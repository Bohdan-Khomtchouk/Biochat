TITLE
Gene expression profiles of T-lymphocytes are sensitive to the influence of heavy smoking

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cigarette smoke components have a proven negative influence on human health. Adverse metabolic effects have been observed in tissues and single cells. As T-lymphocytes get in contact with affected organs (e.g. lung) or cells (e.g.erythrocytes), as well as with smoke components and bioactive molecules, whose production is influenced by them, we compared the gene exression profiles in these cells of the adaptive immune system of three male heavy smokers and three male non-smokers We combined rapid immuno-precipitation and Affymetrix GeneChip® HG U133A2.0 microarray analysis to analyse the data set. 88 genes were found significantly (T-test) differentially expressed by a factor of 1.5-fold or larger between smokers and non-smokers. Using the gene function groups of the gene ontology consortium to categorize the functions of the differentially expressed genes the group termed “response to stimulus” was found most significantly affected by smoking. Our data indicate a prominent role of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in response to smoking. Several genes that are typically found in these cells are found regulated although the ratio of cytotoxic and helper T-lymphocytes remained unchanged in smokers. Keywords: gene expression changes in T-lymphocytes in response to smoking

DESIGN
T-lymphocytes from three non-smokers (control group)and three smokers (case group) were immunoprecipitated from 4ml whole blood. Cells were lysed with Trizol, RNA was worked up using PLG Tubes and the RNeasy Kit. 1µg total RNA was processed according to the Affymetrix manual and hybridised on HG U133A 2.0 arrays. Data analysis was done with the GeneSpring software from Agilent. We performed a T-test to extract significantly altered genes from the data set.
