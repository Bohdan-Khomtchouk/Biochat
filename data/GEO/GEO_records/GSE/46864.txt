TITLE
Gabazine treatment of hippocampal organotypic cultures

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The blockage of GABA-A ionotropic channels by means of gabazine is a widespread model of plasticity where the increased synaptic activity triggered by Gabazine leads to the up-regulation of a plethora of activity-dependent genes. Here, we sought to characterize the overall transcriptional response of GABA-A blocking of rat hippocampal organotypic cultures.

DESIGN
In each of the three biological replica, half of the organotypic hippocampal cultures derived from two rat littermates were treated with gabazine and compared to the untreated ones in order to determine the set of differentially expressed genes.
