TITLE
Regulatory Landscape and Clinical Implication of MBD3 in Human Malignant Glioma [MBD3 knockdown in SF767]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comprehensive study is conducted to inspect the role and function of methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 3 (MBD3) in human malignant glioma, as well as to test its potential as a novel prognostic biomarker. Using whole-genome microarray for transcriptome, the MBD3-mediated epigenetic regulation in glioma was profiled.

DESIGN
siRNAs targeting MBD3 were introduced into SF767 GBM cells and the knockdown efficiency was confirmed by qRT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence staining. Then the genome-wide changes of transcriptome were determined by Agilent one-color microarray (Design ID: 028004).
