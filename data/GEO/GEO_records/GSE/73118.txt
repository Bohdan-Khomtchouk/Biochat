TITLE
Adenovirus Serotype 5 Vectors Trigger IL-27-Dependent Inhibitory CD4+ T Cell Responses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Viral vectors are attractive vaccine platforms that elicit robust innate and adaptive immune responses; however, viral vector vaccine candidates vary greatly in their ability to induce protective immunity. Ad5 vectors elicit robust CD8+ T cell responses but typically characterized by an exhausted phenotype. The mechanisms by which Ad5 vectors induce dysfunctional CD8+ T cells have not been fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that Ad5 vectors, but not Ad26 vectors, elicit exhausted antigen-specific IL-10+PD1+ CD4+ T cells with a dysfunctional transcriptional profile, and these cells effectively suppress CD8+ T cells responses in vivo. Induction of inhibitory CD4+ T cells by Ad5 vectors was associated with increased IL-27 expression, and IL-27 blockade improved CD4+ T cell polyfunctionality. Together our data highlight a novel role for IL-27 in regulating responses to viral vector vaccines.

DESIGN
Splenic CD45.2+ OT-II TCR-Tg CD4 T cells from CD45.1+ B6 mice immunized with Ad5-OVA or Ad26-OVA were purified by FACS on day 10 post-immunization
