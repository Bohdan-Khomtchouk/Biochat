TITLE
Gene expression data in CD4+ and CD8+ cells in sarcoidosis patients following antimycobacterial therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Many chronic cutaneous diseases associated with microbial antigens demonstrate clinical progression due to T cell hyporesponsiveness. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy restores T cell function, leading to clinical resolution.  Due to the association of sarcoidosis with mycobacterial antigens, we compared the efficacy of antimycobacterial therapy with placebo in chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis.

DESIGN
We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind trial on chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis subjects.  Participants received the oral CLEAR regimen:  Levofloxacin 750 mg on day 1, then 500 mg daily, Ethambutol 1200 mg daily, Azithromycin 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily, and Rifampin 300 mg daily, or a comparative placebo regimen, for a total of 8 weeks, with a 180 day follow-up.  Participants were monitored for absolute change in lesion diameter and decrease in granulomas burden upon completion of therapy.
