TITLE
Gene expression analysis & Comparative genomic hybridization from Lung cancer Cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression and Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarrays performed in a set of 8 Lung cancer Cell lines.

DESIGN
The search for oncogenes is becoming increasingly important in cancer genetics because they constitute suitable targets for therapeutic intervention. To identify novel oncogenes, activated by gene amplification, we performed high-resolution CGH (Comparative Genome Hybridization) analysis on cDNA microarrays and compared DNA copy number and mRNA expression levels in lung cancer cell lines. We have performed both microarrays (expression and CGH) in a set of 8 human lung cancer cell lines: Calu3, H23, H441, A427, H522, A549, H1299, H2126.
