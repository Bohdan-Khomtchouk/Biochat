TITLE
Examination of gene expression levels in mutants of phytochrome-related protain

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
To identify novel phototransduction pathways in cyanobacteria, mutants defective for phytochrome-related proteins in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that exhibit increased or decreased gene expression levels. were screened. Keywords: array-based
