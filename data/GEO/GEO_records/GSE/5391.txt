TITLE
Examination of gene expression levels in mutants of phytochrome-related protain

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
To identify novel phototransduction pathways in cyanobacteria, mutants defective for phytochrome-related proteins in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that exhibit increased or decreased gene expression levels. were screened. Keywords: array-based

DESIGN
Gene expression level was compared between phytochrome mutants and the wild type strain grown in continulosly illumiantde consitions (strain name_WT_1 or 2), and between dark and light (strain name_Light_Dark1 or 2). Each experiment was carried out twice. In all twenty five microarray data were included.
