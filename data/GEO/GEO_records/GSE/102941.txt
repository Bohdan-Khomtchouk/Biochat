TITLE
Profiling of miRNAs expression in Rag2 KO and wild type mice spleen by miRNA expression microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: miRNAs are important fators that are involved in the regulation of at least one third of the total human genes and are involved in the regulation of different biological processes. The purpose of the study was to investigate the differential expression pattern of miRNAs in Rag2 KO mice spleen compared to its wild type counterpart. Methods: In this study, we have excised the spleen tissues from three Rag2 KO mice and three wild type mice, and then RNA samples were prepared with the spleen tissues for the analysis of miRNAs profiles using the Affymetrix Genechip miRNA 4.0 arrays. The Affymetrix Genechip miRNA 4.0 array offers an updated content without compromising the high performance as the previous-generation arrays, it also provides a comprehensive coverage that is designed to interrogate all mature miRNA sequences in miRBase Release 20, as well as an easily correlate miRNA results having analysis files contain host gene ID, predicted and validated miRNA target genes, and clustered miRNA information. Result: The miRNAs expression microarray analysis showed that many miRNAs have been expressed differentially between Rag2 KO and wild type  mice spleen. These miRNAs might be involved in the different biological and physiological processes including immune regulations. Conclusion: miRNAs might be an active player during theprocess of immune regulation.

DESIGN
Spleen miRNAs derived from Rag2 KO and wild type mice were profiled by microarray, in triplicates for each sample, by Affymetrix Genechip miRNA 4.0 array platforms.
