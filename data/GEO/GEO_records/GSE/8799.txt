TITLE
Global Control of cell cycle transcription by coupled CDK and network oscillators

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast cell cycle transcription dynamics in two S. cerevisae strains: BF264-15DU (MATa ade1 his2 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3Dns, bar1) [referred to as wild type] and a mutant of the wild type strain, clb1,2,3,4,5,6 GAL1-CLB1, [referred to as cyclin mutant] that does not express S-phase and mitotic cyclins.  Both strains were synchronized by elutriation and released into YEP 2% dextrose/1M sorbitol at 30c. 15 samples were taken at 16 min intervals covering ~2 cycles in wild-type and ~1.5 cycles for the mutants. A significant fraction of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is transcribed periodically during the cell division cycle, suggesting that properly timed gene expression is important for regulating cell cycle events.  Genomic analyses of transcription factor localization and expression dynamics suggest that a network of sequentially expressed transcription factors could control the temporal program of transcription during the cell cycle.  However, directed studies interrogating small numbers of genes indicate that their periodic transcription is governed by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).  To determine the extent to which the global cell cycle transcription program is controlled by cyclin/CDK complexes, we compared genome-wide transcription dynamics in wild type budding yeast to mutants that do not express S-phase and mitotic cyclins. Keywords: cell cycle, strain comparison

DESIGN
Cell cycle synchrony/time series experiments. G1 cells collected by elutriation was examined over time for 2 cell cycles. Strains compared: wild type vs cyclin mutants. 15 samples per time course at 16 min resolution. 2 biological replicates per strain.
