TITLE
Differences in gene expression of Mustard and Kenny mutants relative to control w1118 flies 24 hours after access to food contaminated with Vibrio cholerae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Mustard and Kenny mutants are resistant to oral infection with V.cholerae. We used microarrays to determine whether Key and Mtd have overlapping regulons.

DESIGN
Key1 and Mtd mutant and CTL flies were given access to Vibrio cholerae in LB.  After 24 hours, whole flies were homogenized and RNA was isolated.
