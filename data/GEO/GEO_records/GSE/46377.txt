TITLE
24-epibrassinolide regulates the expression of miRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Brassinosteroids (BRs) are endogenous plant hormones and essential for normal plant growth and development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) of Arabidopsis thaliana are involved in mediating cell proliferation in leaves, stress tolerance, and root development. The specifics of BRs mechanisms involving miRNAs are unknown. To explore the role of miRNAs in BR-mediated pathways, we analyzed differences in miRNA profiles between control (mock solution) and 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) treatments from customized miRNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Seedlings were separately cultured under exogenous 10 nM EBR treatments for 30 (EBR30) or 180 (EBR180) minutes, and total RNAs of all seedlings were extracted after seven days of growth. Two independent experiments were performed at each time (30 or 180 minutes).
