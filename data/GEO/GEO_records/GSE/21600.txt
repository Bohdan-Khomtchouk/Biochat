TITLE
Time course study of experimental cardiac hypertrophy in rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To further investigate the role of hyaluronan and the regulation of its synthesis in cardiac hypertrophy, quantitative measurements of myocardial hyaluronan was correlated to gene transcription in hypertrophic cardiac tissue. Factor analysis was used to study correlation over time.

DESIGN
Abdominal aorta was ligated in Wistar rats. Heart was excised 1 day, 6 days and 42 days after operation. Aorta ligated animals was compared to sham operated animals. N=6 in each time group, except aorta ligated after six days where n=5.
