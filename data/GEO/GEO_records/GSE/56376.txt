TITLE
Follicular B (FoB) cells purified from miR-17-92 tKO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have generated a miR-17~92 fl/fl allele whose expression can be turned off conditionally by Cre recombinase in the miR-106a-363-/-;miR-106b-25-/- background. The mice were crossed to CD19-Cre mice to turn off the expression of miR-17~92 specifically in B cells.

DESIGN
Follicular B(FoB) cells were purified from CD19-Cre;miR-17~92 fl/fl;miR-106a-363;miR-106b~25 mice (tKO1, tKO2, tKO3) and CD19-cre (Control1, Control2, Control3) by MACS depletion of cells positive for CD9, CD43, and CD93 (also known as AA4.1). The purity of follicular B cells was examined by flow cytometry and was greater than 95% for all samples. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN).
