TITLE
Expression data from mouse microvascular transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Little is known about the pan-microvascular transcriptome, particularly considering gene transcripts and their encoded proteins that can be considered as vascular-selective in their expression. Using a combination of publicly available and our own transcript profiles, we identified a core set of gene transcripts, which are specifically and broadly expressed in the microvasculature. Keywords: cell type comparison, developmental regulation
