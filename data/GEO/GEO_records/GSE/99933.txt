TITLE
Multipotent Peripheral Glial Cells Generate Neuroendocrine Cells of the Adrenal Medulla

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cells producing adrenalin are largely derived from nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors via an intermediate progenitor “bridge” cell. We demonstrate that large numbers of chromaffin cells arise from peripheral glial stem cells, termed Schwann cell precursors (SCPs)

DESIGN
SCPs migrate along the visceral motor nerve to the vicinity of the forming adrenal gland where they detach from the nerve and form post-synaptic neuroendocrine chromaffin cells. An intricate molecular logic drives two sequential phases of gene expression, one unique for a distinct transient cellular state and another for cell-type specification. Subsequently, these programs downregulate SCP- and upregulate chromaffin-cell-gene networks. The adrenal medulla forms through limited cell expansion and requires the recruitment of numerous SCPs. Thus, peripheral nerves serve as a stem cell niche for neuroendocrine system development.
