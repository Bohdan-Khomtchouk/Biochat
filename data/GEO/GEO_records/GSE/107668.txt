TITLE
Tumor Necrosis Factor Associated Factor 2 Mediates Cardiac Protection Through Non-canonical NF-κB Signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for cytoprotective effects of tumor necrosis factor receptor activated factor 2 (TRAF2) in the heart, we employed genetic gain and loss of function studies ex vivo and in vivo in mice with cardiac restricted overexpression of TRAF2 (Myh6-TRAF2LC). Crossing Myh6-TRAF2LC mice with mice lacking canonical signaling (Myh6-TRAF2LC/Myh6-IκBαΔN) abrogated the cytoprotective effects of TRAF2 ex vivo. In contrast, inhibiting the JAK/STAT pathway did not abrogate the cytoprotective effects of TRAF2. Transcriptional profiling of wild-type, Myh6-TRAF2LC, Myh6-TRAF2LC/Myh6-IκBαΔN hearts suggested that the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway was upregulated in the Myh6-TRAF2LC hearts. Western blotting and ELISA for the NF-κB family proteins p50, p65, p52 and RelB on nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from naïve 12 week old wild-type, Myh6-TRAF2LC and Myh6-TRAF2LC/Myh6-IκBαΔN mouse hearts showed increased expression levels and increased DNA binding of p52 and RelB, which are NF-κB family members, whereas there was no increase in expression nor DNA binding of the p50 and p65 subunits. Crossing Myh6-TRAF2LCmice with RelB-/+mice (Myh6-TRAF2LC/RelB-/+) attenuated the cytoprotective effects of TRAF2 ex vivo and in vivo. Viewed together, these results suggest that cross-talk between the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways is required for mediating the cytoprotective effects of TRAF2.

DESIGN
Hearts from WT, Myh6-TRAF2LC, Myh6-IκBαΔN and Myh6-TRAF2LC/Myh6-IκBαΔN (n = 4 per group) were used for transcriptional profiling.
