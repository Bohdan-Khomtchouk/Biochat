TITLE
Molecular Effects of Doxycycline Treatment on Pterygium as Revealed by Massive Transcriptome Sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 332 genes were identified which modified their expression in a dose-dependent manner upon exposure to doxycycline. The more represented cellular pathways included all mitochondrial genes, the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, integrins and extracellular matrix components, and growth factors.

DESIGN
Examination of 4 different doses of doxycycline in ten human pterygium samples.
