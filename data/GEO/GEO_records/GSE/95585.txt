TITLE
ChIPSeq data from melanoma cancer cell line CHL-1 after Bromodomain and extra terminal (Bet) domain inhibitor treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) inhibition reduces occupancy of BET-family proteins at promoter and enhancer sites finally leading to genome wide changes in gene transcription. We used ChIPSeq profiling to investigate genome wide changes in promoter and enhancer occupancy induced by BET inhibitors BAY 1238097 and OTX-015, respectively.

DESIGN
CHL-1 cells were treated with BAY 1238097 or OTX-015, potent and selective Bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) inhibitors, before chromatin immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed against BRD4 and acetylated H3K27.

PLATFORM
