TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis in an Animal Model of Cortical Dysplasia-IRRADIATED GROUP

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cortical Dysplasia (CD) is the histopathological substrate in almost half of all drug-resistant epilepsy. Little is known about the gene expression profile of CD. As such information may help target therapeutics more effectively, our aim was to perform a gene expression analysis of an animal model of cortical dysplasia induced by in utero irradiation. THIS SERIES (GSE13697) INCLUDES ALL (AND ONLY) EXPERIMENTAL SAMPLES--I.E. IRRADIATED/CORTICAL DYSPLASIA (9).

DESIGN
Nine offspring from irradiated animals, and nine age-matched controls were sacrificed at post-natal day 60. Cortex and hippocampal regions were separated, and total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted using a commercially available kit (Qiagen®). RNA was then subjected to a gene expression analysis using an oligonucleotide microarray platform (Illumina®). After statistical analysis, genes were considered differentially expressed when a p value less than .001 was observed. Real-time, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to confirm microarray results for three genes via the Livak method.
