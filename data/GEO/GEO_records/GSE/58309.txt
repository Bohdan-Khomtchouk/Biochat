TITLE
The role of  AR-associated factors in androgen signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and AR downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. We identified androgen-regulated genes, CTBP2, FOXP1 and RUNX1. These factors interact with AR ligand dependently. In order to investigate androgen-regulated gene functions in prostate cancer cells, we performed gene expression in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines after siRNA treatment. We also treated cells with vehicle or androgen to analyzed the effects of these genes on AR function.

DESIGN
Observation of androgen dependent gene expression changes after treatment with siRNAs targeting FOXP1, CTBP2 and FOXA1 with microarray.
