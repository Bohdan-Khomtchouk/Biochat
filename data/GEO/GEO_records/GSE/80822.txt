TITLE
Comparative transcriptomes reveal novel evolutionary strategies adopted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae with improved xylose utilization capability

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The xylose fermentation capability of an industrainl Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain was enhanced by adaptive evolution. Eight homozygots were generated by tetrads dissection. The underlying molecular basis of the enhanced xylose fermentation capability was analyzed.

DESIGN
The enriched transcriptional difference between the eight homozygotes generated from the evolved strain and the parental strain  revealed novel responses to xylose that were likely to contribute to the improved xylose utilization.
