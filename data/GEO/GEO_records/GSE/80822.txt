TITLE
Comparative transcriptomes reveal novel evolutionary strategies adopted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae with improved xylose utilization capability

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The xylose fermentation capability of an industrainl Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain was enhanced by adaptive evolution. Eight homozygots were generated by tetrads dissection. The underlying molecular basis of the enhanced xylose fermentation capability was analyzed.
