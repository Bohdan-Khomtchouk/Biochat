TITLE
Ammonia oxidizing archaeal community composition in Gulf of Mexico sediments investigated with an amoA functional gene microarray

ORGANISM
synthetic construct ; uncultured ammonia-oxidizing archaeon

SUMMARY
Ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) amoA diversity and relative abundance in Gulf of Mexico sediments (0-2 cm) were investigated using a functional gene microarray; a two color array with a universal internal standard

DESIGN
Two color array (cy3 and cy5): the universal standard 20 bp oligo (fluoresced with cy5) is printed to the slide with a 70-mer. Environmental DNA sequences (fluoresced with Cy3) within 15% of the 70-mer will bind to it.  Signal is the cy3/cy5. Up to four arrays per sample, with two biological replicates made into two targets, each run on duplicate arrays.
