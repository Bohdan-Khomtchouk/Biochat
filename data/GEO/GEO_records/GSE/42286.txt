TITLE
Ammonia oxidizing archaeal community composition in Gulf of Mexico sediments investigated with an amoA functional gene microarray

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) amoA diversity and relative abundance in Gulf of Mexico sediments (0-2 cm) were investigated using a functional gene microarray; a two color array with a universal internal standard
