TITLE
Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma Model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma/malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like tumors from LSL-KrasG12D, p53Fl/Fl mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma.

DESIGN
Murine soft tissue sarcomas (n = 17) were compared to normal muscle (n = 4).  Tumors were isolated surgically from soft tissue sarcomas generated by conditional Kras and p53 alleles.  Tumors were induced using an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase.  Normal muscle samples were isolated from mice of the same genotype without tumor induction.
