TITLE
Control of RNA stability by NrrF, an iron-regulated small RNA in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

SUMMARY
Regulation of gene expression by small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) plays a critical role in bacterial response to physiological stresses.  NrrF, a trans-acting sRNA in Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, has been shown in the meningococcus to indirectly control, in response to iron (Fe) availability, the transcription of genes encoding subunits of succinate dehydrogenase, a Fe-requiring enzyme.  Given that in other organisms sRNAs target multiple mRNAs to control gene expression, we used a global approach to examine the role of NrrF in controlling gonococcal transcription.  Three strains, including N. gonorrhoeae FA1090, an nrrF deletion mutant and a complemented derivative were examined using a custom CombiMatrix microarray to assess the role of this sRNA in controlling gene expression in response to Fe availability.  In the absence of NrrF, mRNA half-lives increased for 12 genes in Fe-depleted growth conditions, compared to FA1090.  Biological functions for the 12 genes controlled by NrrF included energy metabolism, oxidative stress, antibiotic resistance, amino acid synthesis and a regulatory protein whose functions are not fully understood, in addition to hypothetical proteins.

DESIGN
18 samples. Three separate biological replicates for both growth conditions (Fe deplete and Fe replete) were done for all each isolate (6 samples per isolate); FA1090 wild type strain; NrrF_mutant strain LJ001; NrrF_complemented strain LJ002
