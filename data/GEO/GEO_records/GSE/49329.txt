TITLE
Integrated expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA in polarized primary murine microglia (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine the role that miRNAs have on influencing murine microgial phenotypes under M1(LPS) and M2a (IL-4) stimulating conditions. This Series includes expression data obtained from mRNA gene expression microarrays; miRNA expression profiles obtained from the same RNA samples were deposited as a separate Series.

DESIGN
9 total samples were analyzed, n=3 for the three stimulating conditions (resting state, LPS and IL-4) for murine primary microglia. This allowed us to perform the following pairwise comparisons: PBS vs. LPS, and PBS vs. IL-4. This was performed for both mRNA and miRNA gene expression profiles.
