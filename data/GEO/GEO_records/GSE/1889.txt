SUMMARY
In this study, we asked whether expression profiling could generate a “signature” of a dose of exposure to a toxic in general and to gamma rays in particular. To characterize genes that could potentially “sign” an exposure to irradiation and could allow the estimation of the received dose, we have performed DNA microarray experiments. Responses to gamma rays were analysed by genome-wide expression profiling at different doses in blood leucocytes of c57bl/6 mice. Twenty four mice were divided into five groups and exposed to 0.02Gy, 0.2Gy, 0.5Gy, 2Gy and 5Gy, five mice by dose except for 5Gy where we used only four mice. Keywords: dose response
