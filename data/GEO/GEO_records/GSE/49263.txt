TITLE
SM014 - SARS MA15 wild type, and SARS nsp16 mutant virus infections of C57BL6 mice - A time course

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This purpose of this experiment was to investigate the transcriptional differences between mice infected with SARS MA15 or SARS nsp16 mutant viruses.

DESIGN
Overview of Experiment: Groups of 20 week old C57BL6 mice were infected with wild type SARS MA15 or SARS nsp16 mutant viruses.  Infections were done at 10^5 PFU or time-matched mock infected.  Time points were 1, 2, 4 and 7 d.p.i.  There were 3-4 animals/dose/time point.  Lung samples were collected for virus load, transcriptional and proteomics analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.
