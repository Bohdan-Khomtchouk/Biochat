TITLE
VirF gene from Shigella spp is able to induce chromosomal genes in E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
In order to understand whether the evolutionary acquisition of virF gene may have altered the transcriptional program in Shigella's harmless ancestor (E. coli) promoting the inactivation of genes potetially detrimental to the full expression of the invasivity phenotype, we performed a global transcriptional analysis of E. coli cells expressing or lacking the virF gene. To this end we used the E. coli K12 MG1655 strain, carrying the virF-encoding plasmid pMYSH6504, or its virF depleted derivative pMY6504R.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment: the E. coli K12 MG1655 strain, carrying the virF-encoding plasmid pMYSH6504, and its virF depleted derivative pMY6504R.  Two replicate for each condition
