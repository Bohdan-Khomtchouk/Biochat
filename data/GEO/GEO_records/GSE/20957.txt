TITLE
Staphylococcus aureus small colony variant (JKD6229) vs. parent strain (JKD6210)

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the small colony variant (SCV) S. aureus isolate (JKD6229) compared to the parent isolate with a normal phenotype (JKD6210). Both isolates were from a patient with persistent S. aureus infection, and the SCV strain arose during failed antibiotic therapy.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment JKD6229 vs JKD6210. 4 biological replicates, one replicate per slide.

PLATFORM
GPL10229 JCVI PFGRC Staphylococcus aureus 22K v6 array designed primarily based on strain Mu50 (all spots)
