TITLE
Comparison of the global gene expression of choroid plexus and meninges and associated vasculature under control conditions and after pronounced hyperthermia or amphetamine toxicity

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
These tissue were harvested to complement and extend the studies that generated GSE23093.  They served 3 purposes; 1) identify genes important to choroid plexus function and compare them with those important for meninges and associated vasculature (MAV) function, 2) determine genes in the choroid plexus and sensitivity hyperthermia and amphetamine toxicity, 3) identify the important gene expression changes related to the immune system in MAV, choroid plexus and trunk' blood

DESIGN
Gene mRNA expression patterns in choroid plexus and trunk blood were determined under control conditions as well as after (3 hr and 1day) exposure to either environmentally-induced hyperthermia or neurotoxic doses of amphetamine.  This data was analyzed and compared to data from meninges and associated vasculature previously deposited in GEO.  The data gathered under control conditions was used to further understand how the choroid plexus and meninges and associated vasculature might function to generate and regulate the cerebrospinal fluid.  The expression patterns in the choroid plexus after environmentally-induced hyperthermia or neurotoxic doses of amphetamine was determine its damage and protective responses.  The expression patterns after environmentally-induced hyperthermia or neurotoxic doses of amphetamine were compared among choroid plexus, meninges and associated vasculature and blood were analyzed to determine immune system responses.
