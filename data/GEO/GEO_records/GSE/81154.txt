TITLE
RIP4 inhibits STAT3 Signaling to sustain Lung Adencarcinoma Differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Evaluation of the role of RIP4 in lung adenocarcinoma revealed that RIP4 inhibits STAT3 signaling in vitro and in vivo. Repression of RIP4 enhanced STAT3 signaling activation in KRAS LSL/G12D/wt; p53flox/flox murine tumors. This promoted cancer dedifferentiation through ECM remodeling

DESIGN
Investigation of transcriptional changes in KP tumors expressing shRNA against RIP4 or p53 (control) by microarray (Mouse gene 2.0 ST array from affymetrix)

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
