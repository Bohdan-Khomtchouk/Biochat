TITLE
Identification and Comparative Analysis of Cotton miRNA Target Genes using Degradome Sequencing

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the functions of salt-regulated miRNAs, target genes were identified through degradome sequencing approach. Three cotton RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced under normal consideration, osmotic and ionic stress. A total of 73,988,644 reads represented by 3,254,054 unique reads from the 5’ ends of uncapped and poly-adenylated RNAs were obtained. The PairFinder software was used to identify the sliced targets for the known miRNAs and novel miRNAs. These sequences were further compared with transcriptome sequencing data of G. arboretum and G. raimondii. We obtained the data from (Cotton Genome Project, http://cgp.genomics.org.cn/page/species/index.jsp ).Based on degradome sequencing, 31 target genes were identified for 20 cotton miRNA families. The abundance of transcripts was plotted for each transcript. Conserved miRNAs target conserved homologous genes in diverse plant species.

DESIGN
Three cDNA libraries were constructed using total RNA obtained from control samples (CK), the 4 h and 5 d salt-treated samples. A total of 74,351,180 sequence reads were obtained from three libraries. After removing the 3p and 5p adapter sequences and filtering out low quality ‘‘n’’ sequences, 864,720, 1,217,757 and 1,171,577 clean reads remained in the CK, 4 h and 5 d samples, respectively.
