TITLE
Expression data from multiple myeloma cells overexpressing CS1 versus CS1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying CS1-regulated biological processes including increased cell adhesion and cell proliferation.

DESIGN
Human multiple myeloma cell lines with and without CS1 expression, either by transffecting CS1 overexpressing vector or lentiviral CS1 shRNA, were subject to total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to define the common genes underexpressed in CS1 knockdown myeloma cells whereas overexpressed in CS1 overexpressing myeloma cells to gain insight into CS1-targeting genes in order to define the molecular mechanisms regulated by CS1 in multiple myeloma.
