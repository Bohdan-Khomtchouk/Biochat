TITLE
Effect of the Conceptus on Global Gene Expression in the Mouse Uterus During Decidualization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of differences in gene expression in the mouse uterus during decidualization in the presence and absence of a conceptus. A deciduomal model previously shown to better mimick natural decidualization was used.  The results reveal some, but very few, genes that are differentially expressed, which is unlike previous reports using other deciduomal models shown previously to not mimick natural decidualization.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated uterine segment tissue undergoing decidualization from pregnant or pseudopregnant mice. Three replicates per condition.
