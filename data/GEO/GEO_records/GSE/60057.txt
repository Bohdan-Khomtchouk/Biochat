TITLE
Expression data from PTEN-deficient regulatory T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to assess transcriptional changes in regulatory T cells upon deletion of PTEN.

DESIGN
Foxp3+ CD25+ or Foxp3+ CD25- cells were double-sorted from 3 individual healthy 7 week old mice to over 99% purity.
