TITLE
Tissue-specific nuclei purification from animal models for genome-wide expression and chromatin profiling.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Here we describe a method for purifying nuclei from specific tissues of animal models that allows simultaneous analysis of both expression and chromatin profiles. The method is based on in vivo labeling of the nuclear envelope and subsequent affinity purification. We describe the use of the method to isolate nuclei from muscle.

DESIGN
We determined genes preferentially expressed in muscle cells of adult C. elegans by analyzing RNA from total and affinity-puridied muscle nuclei using microarrays. We also determined the nucleosome occupancy in these nuclei by micrococcal nuclease mapping and paired-end sequencing.
