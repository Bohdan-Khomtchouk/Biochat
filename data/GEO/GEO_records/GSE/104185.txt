TITLE
Differential Expression of MicroRNAs Among Cell Populations in the Regenerating Adult Mouse Olfactory Epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Progenitor cells were purified from methimazole-lesioned olfactory epithelium based on c-Kit expression, and miRNA expression was assayed in c-Kit (+) and c-Kit (-) cell populations.

DESIGN
Progenitor cells were purified from methimazole-lesioned olfactory epithelium based on c-Kit expression, and miRNA expression was assayed in c-Kit (+) and c-Kit (-) cell populations. N=3 mice/samples per group.
