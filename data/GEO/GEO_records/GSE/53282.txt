TITLE
Shp2 transcriptome in melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
1205Lu Metastatic Human melanoma cell lines with knockdown of Shp2 (PTPN11) were grown as xenograft tumors in NSG mice. RNA was extracted from the tumors and analyzed on [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]

DESIGN
Shp2 knockdown compared with non-target controls

PLATFORM
GPL16686 [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
