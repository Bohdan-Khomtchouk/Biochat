TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from chicken embryos

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We applied Illumina sequencing to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) and piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) in the pre- and post-gastrula chicken embryos, and simultaneously obtain a comprehensive expression profile of miRNAs at diverse developmental stages.

DESIGN
Discovery and characterization of small RNA species from pre-gastrula and post-gastrula chicken embryos through deep sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL10223 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Gallus gallus)
