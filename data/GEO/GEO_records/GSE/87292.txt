TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of lung tissue from cigarette smoke induced emphysema murine models and human COPD show shared and distinct pathways

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although cigarette smoke (CS) is the primary risk factor for COPD, the underlying molecular mechanisms for the significant variability in developing COPD in response to CS are incompletely understood. We performed lung gene expression profiling of two different wild-type murine strains (C57BL/6J, NZW/LacJ) and two genetic models with mutations in COPD GWAS genes (HHIP, FAM13A) after 6 months of chronic CS exposure and compared the results to human COPD lung tissues. We identified gene response patterns that correlate with severity of emphysema in mouse and human lungs. Xenobiotic metabolism and Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response were commonly regulated molecular response patterns across C57BL/6J, Hhip +/- and Fam13a -/- murine models upon chronic CS exposure and human COPD subjects.  The CS resistant Fam13a -/- mouse and NZW/LacJ strain revealed an opposite pattern of gene expression response, suggesting distinct molecular pathways for resistance against emphysema. There were few genes commonly modulated between mouse and humans. Our study suggests gene expression responses to CS may be largely species and model dependent, yet shared pathways could provide biologically significant insights underlying individual susceptibility to CS

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from the lung tissue of C57BL/6J wild type, Hhip+/- , Fam13a -/- and NZW/LacJ exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) or filtered air (air) for 6 months and gene expression profiling was performed on murine lungs.
