TITLE
Expression data from p63 siRNA in squamous cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p63, a homologue of the tumor suppressor p53, is critical for the development and maintenance of squamous epithelia.  p63 is specifically expressed in the basal layers of stratified epithelial tissues, and is considered to be a specific marker for cells of this type.  The role of p63 in tumorigenesis remains poorly defined.  Numerous studies have highlighted the oncogenic potential of the predominant p63 isoform, ΔNp63α; however, data suggests that other p63 proteins can act as tumor suppressors or alter the metastatic potential of tumors.  ΔNp63α can act as a transcriptional repressor, but the link between the transcriptional functions of p63 and its biological role is still unclear.  In this study, we used a loss-of-function approach to investigate the transcriptional programs controlled by p63. Keywords: cell line panel

DESIGN
A panel of squamous cell lines, including transformed and non-transformed cells, were transfected with hygromycin selectable vectors encoding p63 siRNA or control, then were selected with Hygromycin B and harvested.
