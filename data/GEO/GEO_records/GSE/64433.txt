TITLE
Detection of potential microRNA biomarker for postmenopausal osteoporosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in the development of postmenopausal osteoporosis, implying potential biomarkers. We performed a microarray-based expression scanning to search for potential circulating miRNA biomarkers for postmenopausal osteoporosis as whole blood obtianed from patients was used.

DESIGN
MiRNA expression in the whole blood of 23 Chinese postmenopausal women with osteopenia and that of 25 Chinese postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. After total RNA was extracted, all of the RNA extraction samples were seperately pooled into six subgroups according to the T-score measurement.
