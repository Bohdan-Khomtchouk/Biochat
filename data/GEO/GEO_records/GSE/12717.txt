TITLE
miRNA profiles of HCC from Southeast China

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated the expression of known human miRNAs in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and normal hepatic tissues from southeast China, and identified the differentially expressed miRNAs in HCC tissues.

DESIGN
We use microRNA array platform from CapitalBio Corp. to access the miRNA expression profiles in HCC and non-tumor liver samples from Southeast China. There were 5 HCC samples and 3 non-tumor liver samples in our study. As the microarray platform we used was based on a older version of miRBase, we mapped the probe sequences to a newer version of miRBase before these data was applied to further analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL7274 CapitalBio human/mouse/rat non-coding RNA microarray
