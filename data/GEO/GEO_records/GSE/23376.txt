TITLE
Gene expression data from stage IV melanoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we tested the hypothesis that pregnancy, a physiologic condition of transient, organ system-based immune evasion, can integrate known and identify new mechanisms of immune modulation pertinent to metastatic melanoma.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples of frozen melanoma tumor biopsies.
