TITLE
A Comparision of Gene Expression between Normal and Diseased Human Meibomian Glands

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study is to identify human meibomian gland genes that may promote the development and/or progression of meibomian gland dysfunction.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from normals (n=6) and patients with meibomian disease (n=6).   The RNA was then used in conjuction with HumanHT-12 v3 Expression BeadChips to assay differential gene expression between normal and diseased meibomian glands.
