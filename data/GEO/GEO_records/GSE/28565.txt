TITLE
RNAs binding to the nucleoid protein HU in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
HU is a conserved prokaryotic nucleoid-associated protein known for its role in DNA binding and maintaining negative supercoils in DNA. HU also binds to a few RNAs but the natural targets are unknown. To understand the biology of HU interactions with RNA in Escherichia coli, potential HU-RNA in vivo complexes were immunoprecipitated and bound RNAs were examined by hybridization to whole-genome tiling arrays. We observed HU associations with rRNA, multiple tRNAs, a few sRNAs and a small, distinct set of mRNAs. More importantly, we also identified associations between HU and ten intragenic non-coding (nonc) RNAs, two of which are homologous to the annotated Bacterial Interspersed Mosaic Elements (BIME) and boxC elements; the other eight RNAs have not been annotated. We confirmed binding of HU to BIME RNA in vitro. Since HU and some unidentified RNAs have been implicated in the nucleoid structure, we explored an idea that HU, along with some or all of the nonc RNA species discovered here bind to BIME and/or boxC repeats to condense chromosomal DNA in a specific fashion. We propose that nonc RNAs may interact with both HU and DNA repeats to form ternary complexes, which are the anchoring points separating different chromosomal domains.
