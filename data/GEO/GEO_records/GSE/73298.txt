TITLE
Global hepatic gene expression data from PPARa liver KO, PPARa liver WT, PPARaKO and WT male mice treated or not with Fenofibrate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fenofibrate is a specific agonist of the nuclear receptor PPARa. To identify the gene expression under the strict dependence of hepatic PPARa activity, we generated a new mouse strain of PPARa-specific deletion in hepatocyte (albumin-Cre+/- Pparaflox/flox or LKO) and we compared them to total Ppara KO (KO), wild-type (WT) and liver WT (albumin-Cre-/- Pparaflox/flox or LWT) mice. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in liver of Ppara LKO, LWT, Ppara KO and WT male mice.

DESIGN
There are 36 liver samples, each from an individual mouse. The samples are from Ppara liver KO (LKO), Ppara KO (KO), wild-type (WT) and liver WT (LWT) male mice of 14 week-old from the same genetic background (C57Bl/6J) treated with Fenofibrate (100 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (aqueous solution of gum Arabic 3%) by daily gavage for 10 days. n= 4 mice for LKO, LWT and WT genotypes treated with vehicle; n=3 for KO mice treated with vehicle; n=5 mice for LWT, LKO and KO genotypes treated with fenofibrate; n=4 WT mice treated with fenofibrate.  All mice were sacrified at ZT14.
