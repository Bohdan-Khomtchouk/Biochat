TITLE
Expression data from NT and PHB siRNA treated hESCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are useful resources for clinical cell therapy as its unlimited self- renewal and pluripotecy properties, so it is critical to understand how ESCs maintain its identity. We reported a gene named PHB is essential for hESC self- renewal. We used microarrays to find out the potential mechanisms regulated by PHB in maintaining hESC identity.

DESIGN
hESCs were reverse transfected with NT and PHB siRNA respectively. Four days after transfection, cells were collected for TRIzol extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
