TITLE
Expression data from murine embryonic stem cell derived cardiac progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mamamlian cardiogenesis occurs through the development of discreate populations of first and second heart field progenitors.  We have used a dual transgenic color reproter system to isolate purified populations of these progenitors. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cardiac development in mouse All four populations of cells are derived from embryonic stem cells differentiating in vitro (day 6 of in vitro differentaition).  The stem cell   line has two transgenic reporters as follows: 1.  The second heart field (SHF) specific reporter of the Mef2C gene (E. Dodou, S. M. Xu, B. L. Black, Mech Dev 120, 1021 (Sep, 2003)) driving the   expression of dsRed 2.  The cardiac specific enhancer ( C. L. Lien et al., Development 126, 75 (Jan, 1999)) driving the expression of eGFP.   Thus, the red cells are SHF specific, the green cells are cardiac specific, and the red/green are SHF and cardiac  specific.  These cells are compared   to the double negative cells which serve as a control.

DESIGN
Embryonic stem cell derived progenitors were isolated into four distinct populations by FACS purifying these progenitors based on a two color reporter system.  Four populations were then compared to each other by transcriptional profiling.
