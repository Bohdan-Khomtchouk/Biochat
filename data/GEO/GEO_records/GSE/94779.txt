TITLE
Gene expression profiling of ligand signaling in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulation of lineage specification and differentiation in embryonic stem (ES) cells can be achieved through the activation of endogenous signaling, an avenue for potential application in regenerative medicine. During vertebrate development, retinoic acid (RA) plays an important role in body axis elongation and mesoderm segmentation in that graded exposure to RA provides cells with positional identity and directs commitment to specific tissue lineages. We have previously established that bexarotene, a clinically approved rexinoid, enhances the specification and differentiation of ES cells into skeletal myocytes more effectively than RA. Profiling the transcriptomes of ES cells differentiated with bexarotene or RA permits the identification of different genetic targets and signaling pathways that may contribute to the difference of bexarotene and RA in efficiency of myogenesis. Interestingly, bexarotene induces the early expression of a myogenic progenitor marker, Meox1, while the expression of many RA targets is also enhanced by bexarotene. Several signaling molecules involved in the progression of myogenic specification and commitment are differentially regulated by bexarotene and RA, suggesting that early targets of rexinoids allow the coordinated regulation of molecular events which leads to efficient myogenic differentiation in ES cells.

DESIGN
Mouse ES cells grown as embryoid bodies were treated with retinoic acid or bexarotene with untreated as control. Total RNA was isolated from undifferentiated ES cells and from untreated, RA-treated and bexarotene-treated day 7 embryoid bodies and subjected to Affymetrix GeneChip analysis. Data was normalized using GC-RMA.
