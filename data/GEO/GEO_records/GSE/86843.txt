TITLE
Expression profiles of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER)-knockout versus intact cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine if there are differences in the gene expression profile of cardiomyocytes with GPER deletion when compared to intact cardiomyocytes in both sexes. None of the gene expression profiles have been previously published. Here we provide the original DNA microarray data with the hope that other investigators will be able to utilize this data in their own research.

DESIGN
Cardiomyocytes were isolated from adult male and female GPER knockout and wild type mice. Total RNA was isolated from cardiomyocytes and gene expression levels were profiled on the Affymetrix GeneAtlas Mouse MG-430 PM Array Strips.
