TITLE
Transcriptomic characterization of the novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus: specific and intermediate host-response between avian (H5N1 and H7N7) and human (H3N2) viruses.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A novel avian-origin H7N9 influenza A virus (IAV) emerged in China in early 2013 causing mild to lethal human respiratory infections. H7N9 originated from multiple reassortment events between avian viruses and carries genetic markers of human adaptation. Determining whether H7N9 induces a host-response closer to human or avian IAV is important to better characterize this emerging virus. Here we compared the human lung epithelial cell response to infection with A/Anhui/01/13 (H7N9) or highly pathogenic avian-origin H5N1, H7N7, or human seasonal H3N2 IAV.

DESIGN
Here, polarized confluent monolayers of Calu-3 cells were infected apically with the avian-origin IAVs A/Anhui/01/2013 (H7N9) [Anhui01], A/Netherland/219/2003 (H7N7) [NL219], A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) [VN1203], or a human seasonal virus A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) [Pan99] at an MOI of 1.  Time-matched mocks were also included using the same cell stock as the rest of the samples.  Culture medium (same as what the virus stock is in) was used for the mock infections.  Quadruplicate wells were infected for each virus/timepoint.  Measured timepoints were 3, 7, 12 and 24 hours post-inoculation and the RNA was used for transcriptional analysis via microarray.
