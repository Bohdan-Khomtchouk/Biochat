TITLE
Epigenome analysis of whole blood samples in Chinese children

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylome-wide DNA methylation profiling of whole blood samples in health children to find age-associated  methylation sites. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs in 48 samples. Samples included 29 boys and 19girls.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 48 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
