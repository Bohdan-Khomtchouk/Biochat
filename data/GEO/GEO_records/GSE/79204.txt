TITLE
The impact of decitabine treatment in MDS-induced Tet2KD/KDEzh2Δ/Δ  LSK HSPCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To evaluate the impact of DNA demethylating agents on our mouse MDS model, we chose 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine, decitabine (DAC), one of the DNA demethylating agents, which is incorporated into DNA but not RNA and has 10-fold more potency in DNA demethylation than 5-azacitidine. We transplanted Tet2KD/KDEzh2Δ/Δ MDS cells into lethally irradiated secondary recipients and treated them with DAC (low dose DAC at 0.25mg/kg, 3 times a week, intraperitoneal injection), then purified LSK HSPCs and evaluated the expression profiles.

DESIGN
We purified Tet2KD/KDEzh2Δ/Δ -MDS Lineage-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) HSPCs from secondary recipients 10 weeks post-transplantation and 7 weeks after DAC or PBS treatment and subjected them to microarray analysis.
