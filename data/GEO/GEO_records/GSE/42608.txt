TITLE
Whole-transcriptome high-throughput RNA sequencing of blood leukocytes from Parkinson's disease human patients pre- and post-deep brain stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The given data set is the first deep sequencing transcriptome-wide data set of human Parkinson's disease (PD) patients RNA. The data set was produced from blood leukocytes of PD patients, from the same patients following deep brain stimulation (DBS), and from matched healthy control volunteers. Post-DBS samples were taken from the patients while being on electrical stimulation (ON-Stim), and following one hour off of electrical stimulation (OFF-Stim state). We have previously shown that gene expression changes, and in particular, alternative splicing changes, are observed in blood leukocytes and may contribute to PD and being subjected to regulation following DBS. Here, SOLiD RNA-Seq was applied to study the transcriptome of PD patients. Exon- and junction-level analyses revealed deep insight into both differential expression and alternative splicing regulation in PD blood leukocytes prior to and following DBS both on and off electrical stimulation. This transcriptome genome-wide data obtained through high-throughput sequencing of RNA produced from human Parkinson's disease (PD) patients blood leukocytes prior to treatment and following deep brain stimulation (DBS) neurosurgical treatment may yield insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of PD and treatment efficacy. It may further enable the development of future diagnostics and therapeutics for PD.

DESIGN
Blood leukocyte RNA was analyzed from 3 healthy control volunteers, and from 3 PD patients pre-DBS, ON-Stim, and OFF-Stim.
