TITLE
Coilin ChIP-seq in cycling HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate location of Cajal bodies (CB) inside the cell nucleus, we created a stable cell line expressing the GFP version of CB-marker protein coilin at endogenous levels and performed ChIP-seq with anti-EGFP antibody. ChIP-seq revealed close association of CBs wih U3 genes, snRNA genes and histone genes in histone cluster 1 and 2.

DESIGN
1 biological replicate of coilin ChIP-seq and input sample

PLATFORM
