TITLE
Marker gene/pathway discovery for polystyrene particle toxicity in zebrafish larvae

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We use the zebrafish embryo model to study the innate immune response against polystyrene particles. Therefore, we injected 700nm polystyrene into the yolk at 2 dpf and took samples at 1 and 3 days post injection.

DESIGN
This deep sequence study was designed to determine the gene expression profile by  polystyrene particle toxicity. RNA was isolated from embryos at 1 and 3 days post injection. Wildtypes zebrafish embryos were micro-injected into the yolk (2dpf) with 1nl of  5mg/ml of 700nm red fluorescent polystyrene particles suspended in PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone) (n=3), mock injected with pvp (n=2), or Non-injected as a control (n=3). After injections embryos were transferred into fresh egg water and incubated at 28Â°C. At 1 and 3 days post injection 10 embryos per group were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent.
