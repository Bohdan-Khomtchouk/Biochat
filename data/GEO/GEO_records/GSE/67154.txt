TITLE
Cardiac differentiation time-courses of human ES cells using distinct initial induction conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A simultaneous stimulation of the Activin / FGF, BMP, and WNT pathways is required for promoting most efficient mesoderm induction in human embryonic stem cells, as well as for subsequent differentiation into cardiomyocytes. To reveal the contributions of three of these signaling pathways to mesoderm formation and cardiac induction, comparative differentiation time-courses were recorded, varying the combinations of signaling factors administered to the cells during the first day of differentiation: FGF (F) + BMP (B) + WNT (W) treatment during the first 24 hours, or FGF + BMP, or BMP + WNT, or FGF + WNT

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from differentiating in-vitro samples at the indicated time-points and of undifferentiated human ES cells before the induction of differentiation
