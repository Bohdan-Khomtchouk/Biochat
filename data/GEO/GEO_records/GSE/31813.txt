TITLE
Adaptation to transposon invasion in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transposons evolve rapidly and can mobilize and trigger genetic instability. piRNAs silence these genome pathogens, but it is unclear how the piRNA pathway adapts to new transposons.  In Drosophila piRNAs, encoded by heterochromatic clusters are maternally deposited in the embryo.  Paternally inherited P-element transposons thus escape silencing and trigger a genetic instability and sterility.  We show that this syndrome, termed P-M hybrid dysgenesis, also disrupts the piRNA biogenesis machinery and activates resident transposons.   As dysgenic hybrids age, however, fertility is restored, P-elements are silenced, and P-element piRNAs are produced de novo. In addition, the piRNA biogenesis machinery is restored and resident elements are silenced.  Significantly, new resident transposons insertions accumulate in piRNA clusters, and these new insertions are transmitted to progeny with high fidelity, produce novel piRNAs, and are associated with reduced transposition.  P-M hybrid dysgenesis thus leads to heritable changes in chromosome structure that appear to enhance transposon silencing.
