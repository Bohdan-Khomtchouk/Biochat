TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of basal gene expression analysis of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia xenograft cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of patient-derived xenograft cells at the basal level. A panel of T- and BCP-ALL pediatric leukaemia xenograft cells were utilised to further understand the biology of pediatric leukaemia.

DESIGN
Total RNA were isolated from patient-derived xenograft cells. Illumina beadchip HT12 were utilised
