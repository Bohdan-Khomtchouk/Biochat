TITLE
The spatial map of the chicken genome

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We present the first genome-wide high-resolution spatial map of chromatin of non-mammalian vertebrate, Gallus gallus (domestic chicken). We show the presence of compartments in chicken embryonic fibroblast genome, distributed in accordance with gene density, transcriptional activity, and CTCF binding sites localization. In contrast to mammals, where all examined cell types display relatively similar compartments profile, in mature chicken erythrocytes we identify unique distribution of spatial compartments, which strongly differs from fibroblasts. Comparing mammalian and chicken genome architectures, we provide evidence highlighting evolutionary role of spatial compartments and their significance in genome activity and regulation.

DESIGN
HiC-Seq examination of chromatin contact profiles in 2 cell types.
