TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of embryonic skeletal muscle stem/progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Muscle stem cells (MuSC) change molecular and functional properties during development. Using a transgenic Tg:Pax7-nGFP mice, we FACS-isolated MuSC from embryonic (E12.5) and foetal (E17.5) stages to understand the differences and similarities amongst the myogenic stem/progenitor populations.

DESIGN
Pax7-nGFP+ cells were isolated by FACS from limb buds of E12.5 and E17.5 Tg:Pax7-nGFP embryos following enzymatic digestion.  Affymetrix microarrays were performed on biological triplicates.
