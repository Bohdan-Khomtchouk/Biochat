TITLE
Heterogeneity of LN resident macrophage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LN resident macrophages lining the lymphatic sinuses play critical roles in antigen capture and presentation as well as degradation. We used microarray to examine global gene expression profiles to compare SCS and med macrophages to determine the underlying molecular basis of their differential handling of antigens.

DESIGN
Primary SCS and med macrophages were isolated and purified from LNs by flourescence-activated cell sorting and RNA extracted, amplified and hybridized for Affymetrix analysis.
