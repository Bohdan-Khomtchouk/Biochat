TITLE
Effects of androgen treatment on genital fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
e tested the responses of normal and AIS genital fibroblasts to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), under culture conditions similar to those that were reported to produce aromatase induction in these cells [8]. Cells were treated with DHT (100-1,000 nM) both at confluency (G0) and during exponential growth, and transcript levels were assessed using DNA microarrays. A compound treatment design type is where the response to administration of a compound or chemical (including biological compounds such as hormones) is assayed. Keywords: compound_treatment_design
