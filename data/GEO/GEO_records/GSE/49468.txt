TITLE
EDL933 cultured in bovine small intestine content (BSIC) vs M9 minimal media

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are transmitted from cattle to human by means of contaminated food products resulting from fecal contamination. Transcriptome analysis was performed to gain further insight into the metabolic pathways required for persistence and growth of EHEC in the bovine intestine. Understanding the physiology of EHEC in the gut of ruminants is critical to identifying the potential nutritional basis to limiting EHEC shedding. A global transcriptome analysis was performed to gain further insight into the metabolic pathways required for persistence and growth of EHEC in the bovine intestine. DNA microarrays were performed using RNA from EHEC O157:H7 EDL933 incubated in bovine small intestine content (BSIC) compared with cells incubated in M9-minimal media.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates collected for bacterial cultures on separate days for each media and labelled following a dye-switch design : For each media two replicates labeled in Cy3 and two replicates in Cy5.
