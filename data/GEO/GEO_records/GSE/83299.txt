TITLE
RNA-Sequencing of HDLEC treated with siRNA targeting PROX1 and TIE2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed genome-wide transcriptional changes induced by siPROX1 and siTIE2, using RNA-seq analysis of HDLECs in order to highlight the importance of Ang-Tie2 system in SC and lymphatic development. Here, we report that coordination between both Ang1- and Ang2-signaling via Tie2 and Prox1 activity are essential for the appropriate formation of SC during development and maintenance of SC integrity.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 differenct siRNAs treated to HDLEC to analyze the effect of PROX1 and TIE2 knockdown.

PLATFORM
