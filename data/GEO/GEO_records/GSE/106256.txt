TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed microRNAs in OLF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ossification of the ligamentum flava (OLF) is a common spinal disorder among the elderly that causes myelopathy and radiculopathy. Although studies have identified several genes that correlated with OLF, the underlying regulation network is far from clear. To identify transcriptional regulators for OLF, we compared the microRNA expression of the ligamentum flava tissues from OLF patients and healthy volunteers through microRNA sequencing.

DESIGN
The miRNA expression profile of four OLFs and 4 normal LF tissues were analyzed by Illumina NextSeq 500 sequcening.
