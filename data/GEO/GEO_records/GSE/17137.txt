TITLE
NP-18 vs. NP-18AR transcriptional profile upon treatment with TK/GCV

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pancreatic cancer-derived cells NP-18 underwent four rounds of treatment with increasing doses of an adenoviral vector encoding TK enzyme and GCV. Surviving cells were termed NP-18AR and displayed decreased sensitivity to treatment. This experiment analyses the transcriptomic effect of TK/GCV treatment on NP-18AR as compared to that of NP-18 cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, where response  to treatment in na√Øve cells (NP-18) was compared to response to treatment in previously treated resistant cells (NP-18AR). Biological replicates: samples from 3 independently generated and independently treated NP-18AR lines (NP-18AR1, NP-18AR2 and NP-18AR3) were hibridized with 3 independently treated samples of NP-18 cells. A total of 9 hybridizations were performed, 2 for NP-18AR1 (including 1 dye-swap), 4 for NP-18AR2 (including 2 dye swaps) and 3 for NP-18AR3 (including 1 dye-swap).
