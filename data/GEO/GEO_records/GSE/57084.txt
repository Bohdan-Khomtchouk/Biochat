TITLE
Expression analysis of an enrofloxacin and a tetracline resistant Escherichia coli strain

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli ; Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Comparison of the whole genome gene expression level of an enrofloxacin and tetracycline resistant E. coli strain with the wildtype it was derived from. The process of drug adaptation of E. coli MG1655 wildtype cells is further descibed in van der Horst, M, J.M. Schuurmans, M. C. Smid, B. B. Koenders, and B. H. ter Kuile (2011) in Microb. Drug Resist. 17:141-147. Resistance to amoxicillin was induced in E. coli by growth in the presence of stepwise increasing antibiotic concentrations. To investigate consequences of the aquisition of amoxicillin resistance the transcriptomic profile of sensitive and resistant cells was compared in the absence and presence of sub-inhibitory (0.25xMIC) amoxicillin concentrations was compared.

DESIGN
Total RNA of 3 biological replicates of E. coli MG1655 wildtype cells and drug resistant cells cultured with (0.25xMIC) or without the drug was hybridized on a 12x135k custom designed microarraychip against one common reference.
