TITLE
PKA-dependent Phosphorylation of A Histone Demethylase Drives Higher Order Chromatin Structures by Association with SWI/SNF Chromatin Remodeler

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The current studies show that JMJD1A is phosphorylated at S265 by protein kinase A (PKA), and this is pivotal to activate expression of the b1-adrenergic receptor gene (Adrb1) and downstream targets including Ucp1. Phosphorylation of JMJD1A increases its interaction with the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex and DNA-bound PPARg. This complex conferred b-adrenergic-induced JMJD1A recruitment to target sites throughout the genome. Phospho-JMJD1A also facilitated long-range chromatin looping to recruit PPARg-bound distal-enhancers, SWI/SNF, and RNA polymerase close to the Adrb1 locus to activate transcription. Mutation of the PKA-phosphorylation site on JMJD1A abolished interactions with SWI/SNF without affecting demethylase activity suggesting the two functions are independent of each other. Our results show that JMJD1A demethylase is also a signal-sensing scaffold that regulates cAMP-responsive transcription via interactions with SWI/SNF and hormone stimulated higher-order chromatin conformational changes.

DESIGN
There are 3 samples analyzed. No duplication from each sample. Isoproterenol stimulation at 0hr is used as the relative to fold change in manuscript.
