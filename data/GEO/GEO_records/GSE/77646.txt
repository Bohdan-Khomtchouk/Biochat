TITLE
Gene expression profiling of AR deletion in prostate luminal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common urological disease that adversely affects quality of life among elderly males, but its etiology remains poorly understood. We show that the expression of the androgen receptor (AR) is decreased in the luminal epithelial cells of human BPH specimens and is inversely correlated with the degree of regional prostatic inflammation.

DESIGN
To identify the extracellular signaling that promotes epithelial proliferation, we performed RNA sequencing of FACS-isolated prostate luminal cells from tamoxifen-treated control and K8-AR mice (with knockout of androgen receptor).
