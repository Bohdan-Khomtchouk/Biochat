TITLE
Effects of bromodomain inhibitors on CD4 T+ cells under Th17-promoting conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human dataset includes the gene expression profile of CD4+ T cells isolated from blood of healthy controls and plated on TCP in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FCS, Penicillin-Streptomycin (50,000 units-50 mg) and L-glutamine (2 mM). Cells were stimulated for 4 days with 20 ng/ml of IL-1beta, 100 IU/ml of IL-2, 20 ng/ml of IL-6, 20 ng/ml IL-23 plus anti-CD2/3/28 beads at a ratio of 1 bead per 10 cells. RNA samples were isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNA digestion. The transcriptional profile was evaluated in three different donors using the HT12v4.1 BeadChip arrays from Illumina.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from CD4+ T cells exposed to Th17-promoting cytokines.
