TITLE
Fas promotes T helper-17 cell differentiation and inhibits development of T helper-1 cells by binding and sequestering the STAT1 transcription factor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The death receptor Fas removes activated lymphocytes through apoptosis. Previous  transcriptional profiling predicted that Fas positively regulates interleukin (IL)-17-producing T helper (Th17) cells. We here demonstrate that Fas promoted the generation and stability of Th17 cells and prevented their differentiation into Th1 cells. Mice with T cell- and Th17 cell-specific deletion of Fas were protected from induced autoimmunity and Th17 cell differentiation and stability was impaired. Fas deficient Th17 cells instead developed a Th1 cell-like transcriptional profile, which we predicted by a new algorithm to depend on STAT1. Experimentally, Fas indeed bound and sequestered STAT1 and Fas deficiency enhanced IL-6 induced STAT1 activation and nuclear translocation, whereas Fas-STAT1 double-deficiency reversed the transcriptional changes induced by Fas deficiency. Thus, our computational and experimental approach identified Fas as a regulator of the Th17-to-Th1 cell balance by controlling the availability of the opposing STAT1 and STAT3 proteins with direct impact on autoimmunity.

DESIGN
comparative RNA-seq study comparing the expression of C57BL/6 wildtype vs. Fas-deficient (lpr) sorted naive CD4+ T cells differentiated without cytokines (Th0 cells) or with TGF-Î²1 with IL-6 (Th17 cells)

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
