TITLE
Expression data of glioblastoma stem-like (GS) cell lines, conventional glioma cell lines and primary tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared a large panel of human glioblastoma stem-like (GS) cell lines,  corresponding primary tumors and conventional glioma cell lines to identify cell lines that preserve the transcriptome of human glioblastomas most closely, thereby allowing identification of shared therapeutic targets. We used Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays to compare human glioblastoma stem-like (GS) cell lines,  corresponding primary tumors and conventional glioma cell lines.

DESIGN
We extracted total RNA from 32 conventional glioma cell lines, 12 GS cell lines (8 in two different passages), 7 clonal sublines derived from two GS lines, 12 original tumors, and 4 monolayer cultures established from the same tumors as GS-lines using standard serum conditions.
