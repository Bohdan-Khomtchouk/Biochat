TITLE
Gene expression profile in mouse esophageal squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Human esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. More than 90% of esophageal cancer is esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the etiological cause of ESCC remains unclear. By using gene expression microarray analysis, we aimed to find whether fungal infection is involved in ESCC development. We identified a wide spectrum of molecular signatures in a fungal infection and ESCC mouse model, including alterations involved in epigenetic regulation, cell cycle control, cell proliferation and survival signaling, and inflammation, which share many similarities with human ESCC.
