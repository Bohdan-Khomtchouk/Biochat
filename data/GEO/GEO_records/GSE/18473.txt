TITLE
Transcriptom analysis of the interaction Medicago truncatula â€“ Ralstonia solanacearum

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
affy_ralstonia_medicago - Ralstonia solanacearum is the causal agent of the devastating bacterial wilt disease. Its infection process was studied with an in vitro inoculation procedure on intact roots of Medicago truncatula. The pathosystem involved susceptible A17 and resistant F83005.5 M truncatula lines infected with the pathogenic strain GMI1000. The mutant A17 line, Sickle, which showed a resistant phenotype was also part of the experiment. To identify host signaling pathway triggered by R. solanacearum infection with a focus on the involvment of ethylene, we used the Medicago Affymetrix array to monitore the expression profiles and the molecular process associated with initial symptoms development (12hpi) and colonization (72hpi). In order to maximize chances to observe differential gene expression, RNA samples were extracted from the root infection zone (root tips) -Three Medicago truncatula lines, A17, F83005.5 and sickle were inoculated with GMI1000 Ralstonai solanacearum strain (107 cfu/ml). RNA were extracted from root extremities (1 cm above the root tip) at time 0, 12h and 72h post inoculation. Three biological repeats were conducted
