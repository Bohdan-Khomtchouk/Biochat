Distinct factors control histone variant H3.3 localization at specific genomic regions

SUMMARY
The incorporation of histone H3 variants has been implicated in the epigenetic memory of cellular state. Using genome editing with zinc finger nucleases to tag endogenous H3.3, we report genome-wide profiles of H3 variants in mammalian embryonic stem (ES) cells and neuronal precursor cells. Genome-wide patterns of H3.3 are dependent on amino acid sequence, and change with cellular differentiation at developmentally regulated loci. The H3.3 chaperone Hira is required for H3.3 enrichment at active and repressed genes. Strikingly, Hira is not essential for localization of H3.3 at telomeres and many transcription factor binding sites. Immunoaffinity purification and mass spectrometry reveal that the proteins Atrx and Daxx associate with H3.3 in a Hira-independent manner. Atrx is required for Hira-independent localization of H3.3 at telomeres, and for the repression of telomeric RNA. Our data demonstrate that multiple and distinct factors are responsible for H3.3 localization at specific genomic locations in mammalian cells.

DESIGN
Crosslinking ChIP-seq:  Examination of 1 histone variant (H3.3), 2 histone modifications, and Serine-5 phosphorylated RNA polymerase in 2 different cell types (H3.3-HA ES samples 1-4, and H3.3-HA NPC samples 7-10).  Examination of 1 histone variant (H3.2), and one histone modification (H3K36me3) in 2 different cell types (H3.2-HA ES samples  5-6, and H3.2-HA NPC samples 11-12). Examination of 1 histone variant (H3.3), input control, and one histone modification (H3K36me3) in one cell type (H3.3-HA hybrid ES, samples 13-15).  Examination of 1 histone variant (H3.1S31), input control, and one histone modification (H3K36me3) in one cell type (H3.1S31-HA hybrid ES, samples 16-18).  Native ChIP-seq: Examination of 1 histone variant (H3.3), input control, and one histone modification (H3K4me3) in one cell type (H3.3-HA ES, samples 19-21). Examination of 1 histone variant (H3.2), input control, and two histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) in one cell type (H3.2-HA ES, samples 22-25).  Examination of 1 histone variant (H3.3), input control, and two histone modifications (H3K4me1 and H3K36me3) in one cell type (H3.3-EYFP ES, samples 26-29).  Examination of 1 histone variant (H3.3), input control, and two histone modifications (H3K4me1 and H3K36me3) in one cell type (Hira -/- H3.3-EYFP ES, samples 30-33).  Examination of 1 histone variant (H3.3) and input control in one cell type (Atrxflox H3.3-EYFP ES, samples 34-37).  Examination of HA antibody background in one cell type (wild-type ES, sample 38).
