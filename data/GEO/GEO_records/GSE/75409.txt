TITLE
OG1RF enterococcal cells: wild-type strain (C1) vs. mafR deletion mutant strain (C2)

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles of strains OG1RF (wild-type) and OG1RFΔmafR (deletion mutant). The goal was to determine the effect of the enterococcal MafR protein on global gene expression

DESIGN
Both bacterial strains were grown to mid-log phase in Brain Heart Infusion medium, at 37ºC and without aeration. Replicates 1 (R1) and 2 (R2)
