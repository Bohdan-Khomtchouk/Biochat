TITLE
Feedback regulation of ABA signaling and biosynthesis by OsbZIP23 that targets diverse drought resistance related genes in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
The OsbZIP23 transcription factor has been characterized for its essential role in drought resistance in rice, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we performed genome-wide identification of OsbZIP23 targets by immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses in the OsbZIP23-overexpression, osbzip23 mutant, and wild-type rice under normal and drought stress conditions. OsbZIP23 directly regulates a large number of reported genes that function in stress response, hormone signaling, and developmental processes. Among these targets, we found that OsbZIP23 could positively regulate OsPP2C49, and overexpression of OsPP2C49 in rice resulted in significantly decreased sensitivity of the ABA response and rapid dehydration. Moreover, OsNCED4 (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 4), a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, was also positively regulated by OsbZIP23. Together, our results suggest that OsbZIP23 acts as a central regulator in ABA signaling and biosynthesis, and drought resistance in rice.
