TITLE
H3K4me3 location in U937 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H3K4me3 enrichment at proximal promoter regions Keywords: ChIP-on-chip data

DESIGN
We describe that RBP2 shows high correlation with the presence of H3K4me3. Biological replicates: chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed independently in parallel

PLATFORM
