TITLE
Expression profiling of microRNA and mRNA on hepatic inflammation in high-fat induced murine model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify and characterize of miRNA in the regulation of inflammatory responses of high-fat induced inflammation mouse model.  In this study, we established a mouse model of high-fat-diet-induced inflammation to gain understanding on the biological functions deregulated by aberrant gene expression based on miRNA and mRNA expression profiling analysis. And then we looked for direct miRNA targets by performing pair-wise correlation coefficient analysis on expression levels of mRNAs and by comparing these results with predicted miRNA targets from TargetScan5.1.

DESIGN
A subset of the mice from the Chow and HFD groups were killed after 3 months and 9 months. All animals were weighed and anesthetized with ether. Serum was then obtained from the retro-orbital cavity, and mice were killed before  liver tissue collection.
