TITLE
Gene expression of samples derived from normal lung and patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differences in gene expression profiles regarding the expression of genes encoding for proteins with G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activity between SCLC and NSCLC and normal lung samples was successfully examined.

DESIGN
In the present study, 8 SCLC, 16 NSCLC and 14 normal lung RNA samples (human) had been purchased from OriGene Technologies. Gene expression analysis was performed using Affymetrix microarrays (Human Exon 1.0 ST Array).
