TITLE
Gene expression of samples derived from normal lung and patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differences in gene expression profiles regarding the expression of genes encoding for proteins with G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activity between SCLC and NSCLC and normal lung samples was successfully examined.

DESIGN
In the present study, 8 SCLC, 16 NSCLC and 14 normal lung RNA samples (human) had been purchased from OriGene Technologies. Gene expression analysis was performed using Affymetrix microarrays (Human Exon 1.0 ST Array).

PLATFORM
GPL15974 Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [CDF: Brainarray Version   9.0.1, HsEx10stv2_Hs_REFSEQ]
