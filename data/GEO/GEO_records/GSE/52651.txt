TITLE
A LncRNA-MAF/MAFB transcription factor network regulates epidermal differentiation [expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using kinetic gene expression analysis of regenerated epidermis over a 7 day time-course, we identify a lncRNA-transription factor network with the MAF/MAFB transcription factors as central players in directing the epidermal differentiation program.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis: To establish a differentiation signature for regenerated epidermis over a 7 day time course and assess the effect of MAF/MAFB depletion in regenerated epidermis; total RNA was isolated in biologic duplicate from regenerated tissue in different conditions and hybridized to Affymetrix HGU133 2.0 arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
