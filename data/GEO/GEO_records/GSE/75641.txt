TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Topoisomerase IV binding and cleavage sites in E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
We report binding of Topoisomerase IV  on the E. coli genome. We report the cleavage sites of Topoisomerase IV on the E. coli genome

DESIGN
7 ChIP-seq samples and 3 NorflIP-seq samples were included.
