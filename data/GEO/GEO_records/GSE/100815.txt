TITLE
bli-1 12 DAG continuous light grown whole seedlings analyzed on a 44k single color Agilent microarray

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are key epigenetic regulators of development. The highly conserved Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) represses thousands of target genes by trimethylating H3K27 (H3K27me3). Plant specific PcG components and functions are largely unknown, however, we previously identified the plant-specific protein BLISTER (BLI) as a PRC2 interactor. BLI regulates PcG target genes and promotes cold stress resistance. To further understand the function of BLI, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of bliâ€‘1 mutants. The goal of this experiment was to examine the transcriptional profile of bli-1 seedlings and compare it to the wild type Col-0.

DESIGN
Each two biological replicates of Col-0 and bli-1 12 day old seedlings grown under continuous light conditions (grown on solid half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 0.5% sucrose and 0.05% MES) were compared here. Transcript levels of the two genotypes were evaluated using a 44k single colour Agilent microarray.
