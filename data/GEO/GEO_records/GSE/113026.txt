TITLE
Transcriptomes of Pleurotus ostreatus in four different development stages (mycelium, primordium, young fruit body, mature fruit body)

ORGANISM
Pleurotus ostreatus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the mechanisms of fruit body development in Pleurotus ostreatus, the transcriptomes of four different development stages including mycelium, primordium, young fruit body, and mature fruit body were obtained by RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Total mRNA of Pleurotus ostreatus in four different development stages (mycelium, primordium, young fruit body, mature fruit body) were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
