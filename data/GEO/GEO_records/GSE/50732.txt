TITLE
TEL-AML1 (ETV6-RUNX1) in B-cells and leukemia (part 3)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified directly and indirectly regulated target genes utilizing an inducible TEL-AML1 system derived from the murine pro B-cell line BA/F3 and a monoclonal antibody directed against TEL-AML1. By integration of promoter binding identified with ChIP-on-chip, gene expression and protein output through microarray technology and stable labelling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), we identified directly and indirectly regulated targets of the TEL-AML1 fusion protein.

DESIGN
Bound promoter regions of immunoprecipitated AML1 associated genes were first compared to input material and enrichment was calculated. The same was performed for empty vector control cell lines, also treated with the induction reagent mifepriston. Enriched promoter regions were then compared of the both sets. 3 independent replicates each (6 arrays) were performed.
