TITLE
Expression data in GADD34 knockout cells treated with arsenite

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Growth arrest and DNA damage induced protein (GADD34) is a regulator of protein phosphatase 1 and promotes eIF2α dephosphorylation under conditions of various stress. eIF2α phosphorylation at Ser 51 is a key nodule controlling the general rate of protein synthesis and activation of integrated stress response pathways. In GADD34 knockout conditions, dysregulated eIF2α phosphorylation is likely to produce abnormalities in the integrated stres response. GADD34 can be induced by many different stresses but oxidative stress by arsenite produced highest GADD34 levels in various cell lines tested. We aim to evaluate early gene expression changes on arsenite treatment and examine if GADD34 influences the profile of genes induced by oxidative stress. Using microarrays, we investigated the impact of GADD34 knockout under conditions of oxidative stress induced by arsenite in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Three replicate experiments were performed. Each experiment included wildtype and knockout GADD34 MEFs untreated or treated with arsenite at 0.1 mM for 2 h. In total there were 12 samples.
