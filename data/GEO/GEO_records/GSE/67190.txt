TITLE
Linking transcriptional responses to organismal tolerance reveals mechanisms of thermal sensitivity in a mesothermal endangered fish

ORGANISM
Hypomesus transpacificus

SUMMARY
We exposed adult delta smelt to varying levels of sublethal thermal stress to quantify the genes involved in their cellular stress response and identify sublethal stress thresholds

DESIGN
Fourty-nine samples were run on fourty-nine arrays, with 3-6 replicates for each treatment or control
