TITLE
Myeloid cell RelA/p65 promotes lung cancer proliferation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Smoking is the most important risk factor for both lung cancer (LC) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of myeloid cell NF-kB in the regulation of tumor cell growth signaling. We subjected mice lacking myeloid RelA/p65 to a metastatic LC model. Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure significantly increased the proliferation of Lewis lung carcinoma cell (LLC) tumors in wild type mice. In CS exposed  mice lacking myeloid RelA/p65, the tumor growth was largely inhibited. Transcriptome and pathway analysis of cancer tissue revealed a fundamental impact of myeloid cells on various growth signaling pathways. Myeloid RelA/p65 is necessary to link smoke-induced inflammation with LC growth. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
Analysis of gene expression in lewis lung carcinoma cells resected from lungs of WT and RelA/p65 deficient mice exposed to smoke or air. Four different samples were analyzed (3 replicates each).

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
