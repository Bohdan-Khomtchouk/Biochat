TITLE
The Assembly of miRNA-mRNA-protein Regulatory Networks Using High-throughput Expression Data (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analyze gene expression levels in primary trophoblasts, derived from term human placenta and cultured under standard or hypoxic conditions

DESIGN
Human placental trophoblasts were dispersed using a trypsin-deoxyribonuclease-dispase/Percoll method, plated in 6-well plates, and maintained in standard culture conditions (O2=20%). After 4 h (defined as time 0), the plates were divided to those in continued standard culture conditions, or to culture in hypoxia (O2=0%). Cells were then harvested at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, and processed for mRNA arrays
