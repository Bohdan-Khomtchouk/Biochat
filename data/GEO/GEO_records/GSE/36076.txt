TITLE
A combined strategy of global gene expression analysis and multiplex PCR established a 13-member gene signature for the diagnosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant gene expression between HCC tumor tissues, histologically normal adjacent liver tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from healthy individuals and patients with pancreatic carcinoma, gastric carcinoma and HCC were identified using Affymetrix gene arrays.  A 13-member HCC-specific gene signature was identified and validated via custom-designed quantitative multiplexed gene expression analysis using the GenomeLab GeXP Genetic Analysis System (GeXP). 

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from healthy individuals, patients with pancreatic carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, and HCC were isolated and total RNA was extracted for Affymetrix gene microarray analysis.
