TITLE
Amplitude modulation of androgen signaling by c-MYC [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgen-stimulated growth of the molecular apocrine breast cancer is mediated by an androgen receptor (AR)-regulated transcriptional program.  Through profiling the genomic licalizations of AR and its co-regulators FOXA1 and TCF7L2 in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, we revealed the molecular details of the AR-centered regulatory network. We further identified that  c-MYC is a key downstream target co-regulated by AR, FOXA1 and TCF7L2, and reinforces the transctiopnal activation of androgen-responsive genes in this subtype of breast cancers.

DESIGN
AR and FOXA1 ChIP-seq were performed in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells with treatment of 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 16 h. TCF7L2 ChIP-seq was performed in MDA-MB-453 cells treated with vehicle or DHT for 16 h, respectively. MYC ChIP-seq was performed in MDA-MB-453 cells following 6 h DHT stimulation.
