TITLE
Transcriptome analysis in Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae)-infected granuloma of BALB/c nu/nu mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our object is to characterize the distinguish gene enrichment group in skin of Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae)-infected footpads compared to that of Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) non-infected footpads.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, Skin of M. leprae non-infected footpads (control) vs. Skin of M. leprae infected footpads (sample). Biological replicates: 3 control and 3 sample, independently grown and harvested from isolator. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
