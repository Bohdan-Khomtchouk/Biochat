TITLE
Expression data from neural crest cells and neural crest cell-derived MSCs from human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed simple, robust, efficient, and serum-free/feeder-free induction protocol for neural crest cells from human pluripotent stem cells. To characterize the hNCCs and hNCC-derived MSCs, we performed gene expression profiling experiments.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expressions among hiPSCs, hESCs, hNCCs and hNC-MSCs
