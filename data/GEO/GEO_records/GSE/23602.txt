TITLE
Analysis of cohesin-dependent gene regulation in fission yeast

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
In addition to its well-know function in chromosome segregation, increasing evidence implicates cohesin in the control of gene expression. It has been previously reported that inactivation of the cohesin loader Mis4 in G1-arrested cells leads to the dissociation of cohesin from chromatin. We exploited this experimental situation to ask whether this loss of cohesin would affect gene expression on a genome-wide scale.
