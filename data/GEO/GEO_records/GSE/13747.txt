TITLE
Ghrelin treatment effects on hepatic gene expression in rats submitted to Bile Duct Ligation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Hepatic fibrosis, the wound-healing response to repeated liver injury, ultimately leads to cirrhosis. There is an urgent need to develop effective antifibrotic therapies. Ghrelin (encoded by Ghrl) is an orexigenic hormone that has pleiotrophic functions including protection against cell death1. Here we investigate whether ghrelin modulates liver fibrosis and protects from acute liver injury. Recombinant ghrelin reduced the fibrogenic response to prolonged bile duct ligation in rats. This effect was associated with decreased liver injury and myofibroblast accumulation as well as attenuation of the altered gene expression profile. Ghrelin also reduced fibrogenic properties in cultured hepatic stellate cells. Moreover, Ghrl-/- mice developed exacerbated hepatic fibrosis and liver damage after chronic injury. Ghrelin also protected rat livers from acute liver injury and reduced the extent of oxidative stress and the inflammatory response. In patients with chronic liver diseases, ghrelin serum levels decreased in those with advanced fibrosis and hepatic expression of the ghrelin gene correlated with expression of fibrogenic genes. Finally, in patients with chronic hepatitis C, single nucleotide polymorphisms of the ghrelin gene (-994CT and â€“604GA) influenced the progression of liver fibrosis. We conclude that ghrelin exerts antifibrotic effects on the liver and may represent a novel antifibrotic therapy.
