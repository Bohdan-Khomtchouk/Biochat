TITLE
Butyrophilin 3A1 binds phosphorylated antigens and stimulates human TCR γδ cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used genetic approaches to identify butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1) as the molecule that binds and presents phosphorylated antigens to Vγ9Vδ2 TCR–expressing cells. BTN3A1 represents a novel antigen–presenting molecule for the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 TCR–expressing cells which play important roles in human tumor immunity and host defense.

DESIGN
3 replicates of 4 cell lines (12 samples total) were analysed.  Data was RMA normalized, and genes that expressed above the negative control in all 4 cell lines from chromosome 6 considered for further analysis

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
