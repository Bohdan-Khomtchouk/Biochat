TITLE
Differentially expressed genes in human hippocampus and Tera-1 cell line versus HepG2, A549, NT2/D1 and NGP127 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We discovered a new tissue specific enhancer originated from the human spesific endogenous retrovirus (hsERV). This enhancer displayed its activity in hippocampus and Tera-1 cell line as opposed to HepG2, A549, NT2/D1 and NGP127 cells. The aim of this study was to find transcription factors responsible for the hsERV enhancer activity. So we attempted to identify a fraction of transcription factor genes that were upregulated in enhancer-positive cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human hippocampus and Tera-1, HepG2, A549, NT2/D1 and NGP127 cell lines.
