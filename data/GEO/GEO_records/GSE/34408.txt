TITLE
Global profiling of gene expression in the ΔdigR and ΔsgmT mutant of Myxococcus xanthus

ORGANISM
Myxococcus xanthus

SUMMARY
In Myxococcus xanthus 55% of the more than 250 two-component signal transduction systems (TCS) genes are orphan. We hypothesized that the histidine kinase SgmT and the response regulator DigR, which comprises a DNA binding domain of the HTH_Xer type, function together to regulate gene expression. We performed genome-wide expression profiling experiments to determine wether the same set of genes are differentially expressed in the  ΔdigR and ΔsgmT mutants.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates each; normalized ratios to vegetative cells of DK1622 (wt) Cy5
