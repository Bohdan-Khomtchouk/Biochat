TITLE
affy_ath_2012_04-Functional characterization of JMJ24, a putative histone demethylase

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
affy_ath_2012_04 - affy_ath_2012_04 - Epigenetic informations include histone post-translational modifications such as acetylation and methylation. The jumoni proteins can remove the methyl group from lysine or arginine residues of histones. The aim of this project is to compare gene expression levels between mutants of two jumonji genes and wild type at seedling stage (12 d old).-- Seeds were sterilized in bleach, washed with ethanol, dried, dispersed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) 0.5X containing 2% sucrose and kept 5 days at 4°C. - After 12 days of growth under a cool white fluorescent light (120 μmol m-2 s-1) and long day conditions (16h of light) in a growth chamber, the plants are harvested and stored at -80°C. -The RNA are extracted with the RNA Plant NucleoSpin (Machery-Nagel), quantified with Nanodrop and visualised on agarose gel. The samples are stored at -80°C.
