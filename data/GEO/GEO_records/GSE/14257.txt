TITLE
Colon cancer HT29 cells: siHX transfected vs. control

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
HT29 cells were transsfected with siRNA (siHX), which is targeting the human endogeous retrovirus HERV-HX. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and knock-down of HERV-HX was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, siHX vs. control cells. 1 transfected, 1 control.
