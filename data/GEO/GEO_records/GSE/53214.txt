TITLE
Distinct Cellular Origins for Serotonin-Expressing and Enterochromaffin-like Cells in the Gastric Corpus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The alimentary tract contains a diffuse endocrine system comprising enteroendocrine cells that secrete peptides or biogenic amines to regulate digestion, insulin secretion, food intake, and energy homeostasis. Lineage analysis in the stomach revealed that a significant fraction of endocrine cells in the gastric corpus did not arise from neurogenin3-expressing cells, unlike enteroendocrine cells elsewhere in the digestive tract. We aimed to isolate enriched serotonin-secreting and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells from the stomach and to clarify their cellular origin. We used Neurod1 and Neurog3 lineage analysis, and examined differentiation of serotonin-producing and ECL cells in stomach tissues of Neurod1-cre;ROSAtdTom, Tph1-CFP, c-Kitwsh/wsh, and Neurog3Cre;ROSAtdTom mice, by immunohistochemistry. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate each cell type for gene expression analysis. We performed RNA-seq analysis of ECL cells. Neither serotonin-secreting nor ECL cells of the corpus arose from cells expressing Neurod1. Serotonin-secreting cells expressed a number of mast cell genes, but not genes associated with endocrine differentiation; they did not develop in c-Kitwsh/wsh mice and were labeled with transplanted bone marrow cells. RNA-seq analysis of ECL cells revealed high expression levels of many genes common to endocrine cells including transcription factors, hormones, ion channels, and solute transporters but not markers of bone marrow cells.

DESIGN
We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate Hdc+ cells from stomach corpus and performed RNA-seq for gene expression analysis to determine the origin of those cells.
