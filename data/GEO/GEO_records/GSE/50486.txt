TITLE
rrp6l1-2 project

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
1, Using mRNA-Seq to get expression profiling of rrp6l1-2 mutant and Col-0 wild-type (WT); 2,Using MethylC-Seq to provide single-base resolution of DNA methylation status in rrp6l1-2 mutant; 3, Using small RNA-Seq(sRNA-Seq) to get small RNA profiling of rrp6l1-2 and WT

DESIGN
mRNA-Seq: 2 samples examined, WT and rrp6l1-2 mutant; MethylC-Seq: 1 sample examined, rrp6l1-2 mutant; small RNA-Seq: 2 samples examined, WT and rrp6l1-2 mutant

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
