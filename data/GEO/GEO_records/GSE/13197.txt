TITLE
Macrophages stimulated with LPS and Poly (I:C)

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
The aim of the current study was to investigate the response of in vitro differentiated trout macrophages, a primary cell culture system widely used in fish immunology research, to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to the analog viral ds(RNA) Poly I:C. To that end we have used a salmonid-specific microarray platform enriched with immune-related genes. The results clearly suggest that the molecular mechanisms involved in the response of macrophages to LPS and Poly (I:C) are specific in some signaling pathways related to cell communication, signal transduction and kinase cascades. Nevertheless, macrophages stimulated with bacterial or viral PAMPs also activate common transcription factors.
