TITLE
Activation of ERBB2 signaling causes resistance to the EGFR-directed therapeutic antibody cetuximab

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HCC827 cells were grown in gradually increasing concentrations of cetuximab beginning at 0.1 ug/ml. Drug concentrations were slowly increased until the resistant cells were able to proliferate in 100 ug/ml of cetuximab. Individual clones of cetuximab resistant (CR; CR1 to CR4) cells were isolated and confirmed to be drug resistant.

DESIGN
Number of samples: 5.  Parental HCC827 as a control. 4 Cetuximab resistant clones
