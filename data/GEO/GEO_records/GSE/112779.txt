TITLE
Streptococcus suis 05ZY: wt vs SSU05_0930 knockout strain

ORGANISM
Streptococcus suis

SUMMARY
Two large-scale outbreaks of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (STSLS) have revealed Streptococcus suis 2 (SS2) to be a severe, evolving pathogen in humans. We investigated the mechanism by which SS2 causes STSLS. The transcriptional regulator TstS up-regulated during experimental infection. Compared with the wild type 05ZY strain, the tstS deletion mutant (âˆ†tstS) elicited reduced cytokine secretion in macrophages. In mice, tstS deletion decreased virulence, bacterial load, and cytokine production. Moreover, TstS expression in P1/7 strain led to induction of STSLS in the infected mice. This is noteworthy because although virulent, P1/7 does not normally induce STSLS. Through microarray-based comparative transcriptomics analysis, we found that TstS regulates multiple metabolism related genes and several virulence-related genes associated with immune evasion.

DESIGN
Streptococcus suis 05ZY (wt) and its SSU05_0930 knockout strain were harvested at the logarithmic phase of growth. Four independent experiments were performed at each time
