TITLE
Tfcp2l1 controls cellular patterning of the collecting duct.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of mouse kidney after conditional inactivation of transcription factor Tfcp2l1

DESIGN
Differrential gene expression analysis from Tfcp2l1(floxed/floxed);EIIAcre knockouts and Tfcp2l1(floxed/floxed) littermate controls (n=3 each). RNA from P1 kidneys was used. Biotynilated cRNA was prepared and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430.2 Array.
