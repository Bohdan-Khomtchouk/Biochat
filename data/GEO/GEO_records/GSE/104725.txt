TITLE
Quantitative Transcriptome Analysis of T cells stimulated with STING ligands

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
STING plays a key role in detecting cytosolic DNA and induces type I interferon responses for host defense against pathogens. Although T cells highly express STING, its physiological role remains unknown. In this study, we show that costimulation of T cells via TCR and STING ligand induce  type I  IFN responses like innate immune cells.

DESIGN
Na√Øve CD4+ T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/28 in the presence or absence of STING ligand and analyzed the transcriptome using Illumina HiSeq1500.

PLATFORM
GPL18480 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Mus musculus)
