TITLE
Identification of genes expressed in C. elegans touch receptor neurons

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
By culturing and isolating wild-type and mec-3 mutant cells from embryos and applying their amplified RNA to DNA microarrays, here we have identified genes that are known to be expressed in touch receptors, a previously uncloned gene (mec-17) that is needed for maintaining touch receptor differentiation, and more than 50 previously unknown mec-3-dependent genes. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
