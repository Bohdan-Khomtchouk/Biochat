TITLE
Expression data from mouse liver tissue from SKH:QS mice treated with commercially available sunscreens containing ZnO or TiO2 nanoparticles, or no nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles can elicit a range of perturbed cell responses in vitro. Exposure to topically applied sunscreens containing ZnO or TiO2 particles may or may not elicit a biological effect in mice. We aimed to compare the biological responses of immune-competent hairless mice receiving topical applications of commercially available sunscreens with or without metal oxide nanoparticles, with the responses of mice receiving no sunscreen.

DESIGN
Commercially available sunscreens containing ZnO nanoparticles, a mixture of TiO2 nanoparticles and organic UVR filters, or only organic UVR filters were applied to the backs of SKH:QS mice weekly over 36 weeks, with or without subsequent exposure to 29 kJ/m2 UVR. After 36 weeks and 30 treatments, mice were sacrificed and liver tissue was harvested for RNA isolation and whole genome transcriptional profiling, comparing the expression profiles of treated mice with untreated mice.
