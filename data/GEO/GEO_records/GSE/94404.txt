TITLE
NGS analysis of WT and snf2âˆ† transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Despite its streamlined genome, there are important examples of regulated RNA splicing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One of the most striking is the regulated splicing of meiotic transcripts, part of the dramatic reprogramming of gene expression upon meiotic onset. Here we show a crucial role for the chromatin remodeler Snf2, part of the Swi/Snf complex in meiotic regulation of splicing. We find that the complex affects meiotic splicing in several ways. First, meiosis-specific expression of the splicing activator Mer1 is Swi/Snf dependent, involves precise timing of acetylation of histone H3K9 at the MER1 locus, and changes in the acetylation state of Snf2. Additionally, Swi/Snf abundance regulates meiosis-specific downregulation of ribosomal protein encoding RNAs, leading to the redistribution of spliceosomes from this abundant class of intron-containing RNAs to meiotic transcripts. This regulation is achieved by rapid downregulation of the Snf2 protein. Taken together these data reveal that the Swi/Snf complex coordinates a cascade of events to direct the regulated splicing of meiotic genes, establishing it as a master regulator of meiotic splicing in S. cerevisiae.
