TITLE
Lung Development Timecourse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Time course study of lung development in normal oxygen and 10% oxygen conditions in order to study the relationship between oxidant stress and gene expression changes in the developing lung around birth.  Comparison to normal liver as control tissue not under oxidant stress. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
3 mice at each of 5 time points: fetal day 21, 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours after birth.  Lung samples taken from pre- and post-natal mice in normal oxygen conditions.  3 mice at each of first 3 time points: fetal day 21, 2, and 6 hours after birth.  Liver samples from mice in normal oxygen conditions.  Lung samples from mice birthed into 10% oxygen.
