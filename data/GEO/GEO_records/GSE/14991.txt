TITLE
Time course of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Exposed to Arsenic under Phosphate Limited Conditions

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Arsenic is known as a human carcinogen that easily be exposed by the living organisms through environment and food consumption. The arsenic is transport into the cells via phosphate transporters due to its structural similarity with phosphate in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We here evaluated and analyzed the toxicogenomic impacts of arsenate and the role of different phosphate concentrations on arsenic toxicity. Our results showed that arsenic uncoupled phosphate levels which eventually affected the growth rate of yeast cells. Analysis of arsenate levels in the medium over 4 to 10 h of its exposure clearly showed that arsenate was easily taken up by the cells in phosphate limited condition.

DESIGN
2 Î¼M Arsenate under 100uM and 1 mM phosphate condition experiments with three time intervals (4, 8, and 10 hour).
