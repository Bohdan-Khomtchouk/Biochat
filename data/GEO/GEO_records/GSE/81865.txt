TITLE
Genome-wide maps of histone variant H3.3 occupancy in zebrafish cardiomyocytes [RNA]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report high-throughput profiling of gene expression from whole zebrafish ventricles. We profile mRNA in uninjured ventricles and those undergoing regeneration 14 days after genetic ablation. This study provides a framework for understanding transcriptional changes during adult models of regeneration.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression in cardiomyocytes under different states of proliferation.
