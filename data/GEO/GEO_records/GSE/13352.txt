TITLE
Comparative expression profiling in Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis in inocula, RHE, and PCF cultures

ORGANISM
Candida albicans ; Candida dubliniensis

SUMMARY
The opportunistic human pathogens, Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis, are closely related species displaying large differences in virulence, but the reasons for these differences are elusive. Microarray-based comparative analysis of global gene expression in the two species incubated on reconstituted human oral epithelium (RHE) was used to identify specific and common changes in gene expression and find novel C. albicans virulence genes

DESIGN
Comparative analysis of global gene expression in Candida albicans SC5314 and Candida dubliniensis CD36 in reconstituted human oral epithelium (RHE), polycarbonate filter (PCF; used as RHE support matrix) 30 and 90 min postinoculation, and in cultures used as inocula (0 min). Gene expression in  C. albicans and C. dubliniensis was assessed by co-hybridizations matched by treatments. Performed in two or three biological replicates with reciprocal dye swaps for each biological replicate. Gene expression of Candida cells on RHE was normalized to gene expression in reference control (PCF); log2 ratios were calculated by dividing spot intensity of experimental (C. albicans) by that of the reference control (C. dubliniensis).
