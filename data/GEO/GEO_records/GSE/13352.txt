TITLE
Comparative expression profiling in Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis in inocula, RHE, and PCF cultures

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The opportunistic human pathogens, Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis, are closely related species displaying large differences in virulence, but the reasons for these differences are elusive. Microarray-based comparative analysis of global gene expression in the two species incubated on reconstituted human oral epithelium (RHE) was used to identify specific and common changes in gene expression and find novel C. albicans virulence genes
