TITLE
Effect of growth in TSA or SCFA on gene expression in E. histolytica

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
In order to dtermine the role of histone actylation in gene expresssion, E. histolytica 200:NIH trophozoites were treated with the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A, or grown in short chain fatty acids, which have been shown to alter histone actylation patterns in Entamoeba species. Keywords: Expression

DESIGN
E. histolytica 200:NIH trophozoites grown in standard media (TYI or TYI-low glucose) were compared to trophozoites grown in TYI-LG + Trichostatin A (150 or 300 nM) for 16 or 72 hours, or in TYI-LG + short chain fatty acids (70 mM sodium acetate, 20 mM sodium propionate and 10 mM sodium butyrate). Differences in gene expression were assayed by hybridization to a full genome Affymetrix array.
