TITLE
Polyol stress: time course

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
It is unclear how the amount of active nuclear MAPK over time quantitatively affects transcription. Here, we seek to address this issue by studying signal transduction and transcriptional response in a system that separates signalling from adaptation and hence signal strength from signal duration. The system is based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae osmoadaptation and allows modulation of the period of HOG-dependent responses without changing the initial stress intensity. The conditional osmotic stress system includes (i) a yeast mutant (gpd1 gpd2) unable to produce its main osmolyte glycerol, subsequently stressed with (ii) a stress inductor (polyols of different sizes) and allowed to adapt by (iii) expression of polyol flux-mediating aquaglyceroporin (rat AQP9). As there is no endogenous glycerol production, the osmoadaptation rate depends only on the size dependent equilibration rate over the plasma membrane of the polyol used as both stress inductor and compatible solute. Hence, we apply initially identical stresses but with differential durations, and determine the global transcriptional response.

DESIGN
Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303-1A (MATa leu2-3/112 ura3-1 trp1-1 his3-11/15 gpd1::TRP1  gpd2::URA3)  osmotically stressed with 1M of glycerol, erythritol, xylitol or sorbitol. Samples are taken in triplicates (except for sorbitol 20 an 90 min and 20 min xylitol were duplicates were taken) in time course series after stress application. Total of 45 samples. RNA from from cultures of gpd1 gpd2 cells expressing rAQP9 prior to polyol exposure was used as reference RNA for all microarrays.
