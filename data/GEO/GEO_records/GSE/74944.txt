TITLE
Changes of gene expression signatures in Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The WT and Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) F2 generation embryos were heated shocked at 38°C for 1 hour at 16 hpf, then raised to 3 dpf. Total RNAs were isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen). The samples were processed and subsequently analyzed in triplicate on Zebrafish Oligo Microarrays (Agilent Technologies Italia, Italy) which contain 43,554 sets of probes. The microarrays were scanned in an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner and the images were processed using Feature Extraction software to identify changes of gene expression signatures in Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish embryos.

DESIGN
RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene was induced into wild type AB line and measured at 72 hours after  1hr heat-shock at 38°C at 16 hpf. Wild type AB line was used as the control.
