TITLE
Reconstructing divergent retinoid-induced cell fate-regulatory programs in stem cells [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have integrated dynamic RXRa binding, chromatin accessibility and promoter epigenetic status with the transcriptional activity inferred from RNA polymerase II mapping and transcription profiling. This demonstrated a temporal organization structure, in which early events are preferentially enriched for common GRNs, while cell fate specification is reflected by the activation of late programs in a cell-type specific manner. Furthermore, significant differences in cell lines' promoter status of genes associated with cell-line specific programs were inferred. Finally, a variety of transcription factors (TFs) playing a direct role in the signal transduction cascade downstream of the RXR/RAR initiated wiring were identified, several of them commonly regulated in both model systems, but in addition cell-type specific TF drivers were also identified.

DESIGN
profiling of time series ChIP-seq datasets in two related embryonic stem cells. 5 different factors assessed in 5 timepoints in 2 different cell lines. In addition two input control samples (one per cell line): Total=52 datasets.

PLATFORM
