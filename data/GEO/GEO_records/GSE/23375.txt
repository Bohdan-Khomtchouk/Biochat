SUMMARY
Gene-expression profiles of liver and hepatocellular carcinoma induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) in KLF6 +/- and wild type KLF6 mice. Inactivation of the KLF6 tumor suppressor is common in HCC due to hepatitis C virus (HCV), consistent with its anti-proliferative activity in HCC-derived cell lines and in hepatocytes of transgenic mice. We have evaluated the impact of KLF6 depletion on human HCC and experimental hepatocarcinogenesis. In patients with surgically resected HCC, those with significantly reduced tumor expression of KLF6 had a significantly decreased survival. We modeled this event in KLF6 +/- mice, which displayed significantly more tumorigenicity than KLF6 +/+ animals in response to the hepatic carcinogen DEN, associated with recapitulation of gene signatures in both surrounding tissue and tumors that are  associated with aggressive human HCCs.  In DNA  microarrays, mdm2 mRNA expression was increased in tumors from KLF6 +/- compared to KLF6 +/+ mice, which was validated by realtime qPCR and Western blot in both human HCC and DEN-induced murine tumors. Moreover, chromosomal immunoprecipitation and co-transfection assays established the P2 intronic promoter of mdm2 as a bona fide transcriptional target repressed by KLF6. Whereas KLF6 over-expression in HCC cell lines led to reduced MDM2 levels and increased p53 protein and transcriptional activity, reduction in KLF6 by siRNA led to increased MDM2 and reduced p53. Our findings indicate that KLF6 deficiency contributes significantly to the carcinogenic milieu in human and murine HCC, and uncover a novel tumor suppressor activity of KLF6 in HCC, by linking its transcriptional repression of MDM2 to stabilization of p53.

DESIGN
KLF6 +/- mice were previously generated by homologous recombination in which exon 2 was targeted using an 11-kb targeting construct, and replaced with neomycin/lacZ cassette. After selection with neomycin, the ES clones were injected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts and implanted into pseudo pregnant females; two lines of KLF6 +/- mice were generated from the resulting chimeric animals (Blood 107;1357, Oncogene 26;4428).  Whereas KLF6 -/- mice are embryonic lethal, KLF6 +/- animals had no demonstrable abnormalities in the absence of any stressor. Male KLF6 +/- mice were bred with wild type C57BL/6 to generate mixed litters of KLF6 +/- and KLF6 +/+ animals. Progeny were genotyped using PCR-amplified tail DNA, using primers as previously described (Oncogene 26;4428). Amplified fragments were separated on a 2.5% agarose gel, revealing bands of ~200 bp (wild type KLF6) and ~100 bp (Neo), as expected.  At 2 weeks of age, KLF6 +/+ and KLF6 +/- mice were injected intraperitoneally with either a single dose of diethyl nitrosamine (DEN), 5 µg/g body weight in 100 µl of saline, or vehicle alone. Vehicle and DEN-treated mice were maintained on standard chow, and then sacrificed 3, 6 or 9 months later.  At the time of sacrifice the animals were weighed, and blood and liver samples were harvested for analysis and tumor quantification.
