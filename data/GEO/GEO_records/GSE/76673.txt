TITLE
Expression data of human tympanic membrane cells and epidermal keratinocytes [miRNA]

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The data set compares the microRNA expression of two types of keratinocytes from the tympanic membrane and epidermis of the body. Healthy human samples were harvested for the analysis. Cells were cultivated to evaluate the effect of keratinocytes only. Few Chip Ids (11) were considered differentially expressed between the cell types.
