TITLE
Placentas delivered by term spontaneous labour compared to those delivered by elective term Cesarean section

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentially expressed mRNA transcripts in the placenta delivered by term spontaneous labour compared to those delivered by elective term cesarean section. We hypothesized that the labour process involves changes in mRNA expression in the placenta. To test this hypothesis, we interrogated the mRNA levels of > 50,000 genes and transcript variants using gene expression microarray (Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array, Affymetrix) on 5 placentas collected from term spontaneous delivery and another 5 placentas collected from elective term cesarean delivery. To minimize the effect of gestational age on gene expression, these two groups of placentas were matched for their gestational ages at delivery. We have identified 134 and 128 genes that were up- or down-regulated, respectively, for more than 3-fold in the term (spontaneous) labour placentas compared to the term (elective) cesarean placentas (Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, p-value < = 0.05 after Benjamini and Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing).

DESIGN
Placentas collected from (i) term spontaeous labour and (ii) elective term cesarean section were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To identify gene expression patterns that are commonly involved in term spontaneous labour, we analyzed 5 placentas from each of these 2 groups and tested for any differentially expressed genes by non-parametric statistical methods.
