TITLE
NcRNA profiling after Influenza A/WSN/33 infection II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
8h and 24h after A/WSN/33 infection (MOI 1) ncRNA profiling was performed A growing body of evidence suggests gene regulatory functions for the majority of non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Besides small RNAs (sRNAs), the diverse class of long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) recently came into focus of research. So far, the relevance of lncRNAs in infection processes remains elusive. Here, we report the differential expression of several classes of lncRNAs during influenza A virus (IAV) infection in human lung epithelial cells.

DESIGN
2 biological replicates of 8h and 24h infection were hybridzed in an independent color-swap
