TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed RNAs of lung cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Twist1 induces cancer metastasis. Identification of Twist1 downstream targets should help to delineate the mechanisms of Twist1-induced cancer metastasis.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of H1299 control cells vs. H1299 with knockdown of Twist1 were compared to identify Twist1 downstream targets.

PLATFORM
