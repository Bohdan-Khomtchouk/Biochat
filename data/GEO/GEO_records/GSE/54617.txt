TITLE
Gene espression Profile by YAP1 and TAZ

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Hippo signaling pathway is evolutionarily well conserved, and all core components have one or more mammalian orthologs, including MST1/2 (Hippo), SAV1 (Salvador), LATS1/2 (Warts), MOB1 (Mats), YAP1/TAZ (Yorkie), and TEAD1/2/3/4 (Scalloped) (Halder and Johnson, 2011; Pan, 2007; Dong et al., 2007; Saucedo and Edgar, 2007). When Hippo signaling is active, YAP1/TAZ is phosphorylated by LATS1/2 and sequestered by 14-3-3 proteins in cytoplasm. When Hippo signaling is absent, unphosphorylated YAP1/TAZ enters the nucleus and increases transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. The indispensability of the Hippo pathway in restricting cell growth and proliferation has prompted speculation that many members of the pathway might be involved in tumorigenesis. To see the effect of YAP1 and TAZ in HCC  cell, we generated gene expression profile.

DESIGN
SK-Hep1 cell was transfected with siRNA targeting YAP1 and TAZ for three days.
