TITLE
Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional profiling over life span: Indy vs. Controls

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Indy long lived flies and controls over the course of their entire lifespan. Mutations in the Indy gene extend life span in Drosophila melanogaster. This study investigates the changes in gene expression over time in Indy206 flies heterozygous over Canton-S (Indy206/CS) and compares them to genetically matched heterozygous controls (2216/CS). Samples from both fly strains were collected at age: 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70 and 80.

DESIGN
mRNA samples were collected from the head and thorax of Indy206 and genetically matched control male adult flies at day 5, and every 10 days from day 10 to day 80 (day 60 excluded) and hybridized to two-color microarrays
