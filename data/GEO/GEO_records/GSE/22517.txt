TITLE
primary floral stem 20cm-Modifications of transcriptome in primary floral stem of Arabidopsis thaliana deregulated for a peroxydase involved in the lignification.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra07-01_prx34 - primary floral stem 20cm - The At3g49120 gene codes for the peroxidase 34 (PRX 34), an enzyme potentially involved in the polymérisation of monolignols, the lignin precursors. This enzyme is expressed in primary floral stem and its absence has an impact on the lignin quantity and biomass (at the young stage). Here, its question to characterize several mutants. - Each mutant compare to wild type, samples only primary floral stem of 20cm Keywords: normal vs transgenic comparaison

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - CATMA arrays
