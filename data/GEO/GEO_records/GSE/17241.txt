TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of SATB1 target genes in human T helper cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a global chromatin organizer and a transcription factor induced by interleukin-4 (IL-4) during the early T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated the role of SATB1 in T helper cell differentiation by performing gene expression profiling of human differentiating Th cells in which expression of SATB1 was downregulated by RNA interference (RNAi). Our results indicate that SATB1 is involved in the regulation of more than three hundred genes in primary human CD4+ T cells, including several IL-12 and/or IL-4 regulated factors, suggesting a role in the development or function of Th subtypes.

DESIGN
Set 1: Total RNA obtained from human CD4+ T cells isolated from peripheral blood transfected with SATB1-shRNA or scramble control plasmids and cultured in Th1 and Th2 conditions for 0, 24 and 48 h (Thp - non antigen exposed precursor). Set 2: Total RNA obtained from human CD4+ T cells isolated from peripheral blood transfected with SATB1-shRNA or scramble control plasmids and cultured in Th1 and Th2 conditions for 0, 24 and 48 h (Thp - non antigen exposed precursor). Set 3: Total RNA obtained from human CD4+ T cells isolated from umbilical cord blood transfected with SATB1-siRNA or scramble control siRNAs and cultured in Th0, Th1 and Th2 conditions for 0, 12, 24 and 48 h (Thp - non antigen exposed precursor). Set 4: Total RNA obtained from human CD4+ T cells isolated from umbilical cord blood transfected with SATB1-siRNA or scramble control siRNAs and cultured in Th0, Th1 and Th2 conditions for 0, 12, 24 and 48 h (Thp - non antigen exposed precursor). Set 5: Total RNA obtained from human CD4+ T cells isolated from umbilical cord blood transfected with SATB1-siRNA or scramble control siRNAs and cultured in Th0, Th1 and Th2 conditions for 24 h.
