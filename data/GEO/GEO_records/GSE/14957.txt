TITLE
Zoarces viviparus evaluation data

ORGANISM
Zoarces viviparus

SUMMARY
A 50-mer oligonucleotide microarray was designed for large-scale gene expression analysis in Z. viviparus. To measure the expression of the probes and the corresponding assembled transcripts, the pool of mRNA used for the sequencing was hybridized.

DESIGN
1 Sample hybridized to microarray used to evaluate the transcript assembly described in Kristiansson et al 2009.
