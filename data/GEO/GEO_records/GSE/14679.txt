TITLE
Breast cancer cells: ER status and fatty acid treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Estrogen receptor dependent genomic expression profiles in breast cancer cells in response to fatty acids. Estrogen receptor positive cells respond better to omega 3 treatments.

DESIGN
two condition experiments: ER positive and negative breast cancer cells exposed to two fatty acids: omega-3 (eicosapentanoic acid) and 6 (arachidonic acid).
