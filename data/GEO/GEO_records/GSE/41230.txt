TITLE
Differential gene expression analysis of U87MG EGFRvA cells vs. U87MG EGFR cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EGFRvA is a novel and widely-expressed EGFR isoform, whose upregulation is positively related to glioma grades. Intriguingly, it is the upregulation of EGFRvA but not EGFR that significantly correlates with a poor prognosis in glioma patients. Cancer cells expressing EGFRvA (relative to EGFR) display a higher invasive capacity and a lower sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). To investigate the significant differently expressed genes between U87MG EGFRvA cells and U87MG EGFR cellsï¼Œmicroarray experiments were conducted.

DESIGN
Gene-expression profiling was performed on the CapitalBio 35k human Genome Array microchips (Beijing, China).

PLATFORM
GPL15684 CapitalBio Human oligo chip 35k array V2.0
