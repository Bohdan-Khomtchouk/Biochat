TITLE
Connected gene communities underlie transcriptional changes in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a complex multisystem developmental disorder caused by mutations in cohesin subunits and regulators. While the precise molecular mechanisms are not well defined, they point toward a global deregulation of the transcriptional gene expression program. Indeed, cohesin is associated with the boundaries of chromosome domains in addition to enhancers and promoters connecting the 3D genome organization with transcriptional control and gene expression. Here we show that connected gene communities, built with noncoding regulatory elements and genes physically interacting in the 3D chromosomal space, provide a molecular explanation for the pathoetiology of CdLS. Indeed, NIPBL and cohesin are important constituents of connected gene communities, both being centrally positioned at active noncoding regulatory elements. Interestingly, mutations in SMC1A and NIPBL lead to coordinated gene expression changes in connected communities. Our findings suggest a model where CdLS is explained by coordinated modulation of connected gene communities.
