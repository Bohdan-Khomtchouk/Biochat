TITLE
Reg4+ Deep Crypt Secretory cells function as epithelial niche for Lgr5+ stem cells in colon

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lgr5+ stem cells reside at crypt bottoms of the small and large intestine. Small intestinal Paneth cells supply Wnt3, EGF and Notch signals to neighboring Lgr5+ stem cells. While the colon lacks Paneth cells, Deep Crypt Secretory (DCS) cells are intermingled with Lgr5+ stem cells at crypt bottoms. Here, we report Reg4 as a marker of DCS cells. To investigate a niche function, we eliminated DCS cells using the diphtheria-toxin receptor gene knocked into the murine Reg4 locus. Ablation of DCS cells results in loss of stem cells from colonic crypts and disrupts gut homeostasis and colon mini-gut formation. In agreement, sorted Reg4+ DCS cells promote organoid formation of single Lgr5+ colon stem cells. Stem cells are forced to generate DCS cells in vitro by combined Notch inhibition and Wnt activation. We conclude that Reg4+ DCS cells serve as Paneth cell equivalents in the colon crypt niche.

DESIGN
To define a global gene expression signature of DCS cells, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of sorted Reg4-dsRed+ and Lgr5-GFP+ cells from colonic epithelium. Sorting and RNA-seq library preparation was performed twice, to obtain a biological replicate.
