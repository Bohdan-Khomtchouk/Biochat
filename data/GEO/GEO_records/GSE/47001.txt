TITLE
SMN MO, Gemin2 MO knockdown vs Control MO injected

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptiome profiling of SMN MO injected, Gemin2 MO injected zebrafish embryos vs Control MO injected

DESIGN
Two condition experiment : MO injected vs control. Biological replicates for SMN MO injected : 6, Biological replicates for Gemin2 MO injected: 7; Control MO injected from 6 independent batches pooled to serve as common control sample in all arrays.
