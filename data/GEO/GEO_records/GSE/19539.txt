TITLE
Identification of Novel Oncogene Loci in Ovarian Cancer through Integrated Copy Number and Expression Analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Use of expression data to analyse ovarian cancer often yields long lists of genes that do not agree across various studies. Copy number however is more stable and can reliable predict important regions of change. Using matched copy number and expressiion data helps accurately identify novel drivers of ovarian cancer.
