TITLE
Massive and reproducible production of liver buds entirely from human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Organoid technology provides a revolutionary paradigm towards therapy, yet to be applied in humans mainly because of the reproducibility and scalability challenges. Here, we overcome these limitations by evolving scalable organ bud production platform entirely from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). By conducting massive ‘reverse’ screen experiments, we identified effective triple progenitor populations for generating liver buds in a highly reproducible manner: hepatic endoderm, endothelial and septum mesenchyme progenitors. Furthermore, we achieved human scalability by developing an omni-well-array culture platform for mass-producing homogenous and miniaturized liver buds on a clinically relevant large scale ( > 108-cell scale). Vascularized and functional liver tissues generated entirely from iPSC significantly improved subsequent hepatic functionalization potentiated by stage-matched developmental progenitor interactions, enabling functional rescue against acute liver failure via transplantation. Overall, our study provides a stringent manufacture platform for multi-cellular organoid supply, thus facilitating clinical and pharmaceutical applications especially for the treatment of liver diseases through multi-industrial collaborations.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling of iPSC derived liver buds (iPSC-LB), progenitor populations for generating liver buds (iPSC-tHE/iPSC-EC/iPSC-MC) and human liver tissue of various developmental stages.
