TITLE
Transcriptomic profiles of S. Typhimurium SL1344 parent strain and ΔdksA and ΔrelAΔspoTΔdksA mutant strains grown to various optical densities during late-log and stationary phase in LB aerobic batch culture

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
S. Typhimurium SL1344 parental strain and isogenic ΔrpoS, ΔdksA and ΔrelAΔspoT, ΔrelAΔspoTΔrpoS and ΔrelAΔspoTΔdksA strains were grown to OD600=1.0, OD600=2.3, OD600=3.0 and OD600=4.2 in Luria-Bertani medium.

DESIGN
30 samples (parent strain, ΔdksA, and  ΔrelAΔspoTΔdksA at late-log, early stationary, mid-stationary and late stationary growth phases and 3 or 5 biological replicates for each sample.

PLATFORM
GPL13609 SALSA 2 IFR Salmonella 8K Arrays
