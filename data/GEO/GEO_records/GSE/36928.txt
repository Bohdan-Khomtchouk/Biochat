TITLE
Expression profile of the  endocrine therapy resistant breast cancer cells LTED depleted of PBX1 or treated with the gamma-secretase inhibitor MRK003

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the response to PBX1 deprivation either using an siRNA approach or using a chemicalcompound indirectly targeting it. Deprivation of PBX1 is hypothesized to be essential for the growth of endocrine therapy resistant breast cancer cells (LTED)

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from cells treated with siPBX1 or a control siRNA. The second set contains RNA from cells treated with MRK003 or a control (DMSO).
