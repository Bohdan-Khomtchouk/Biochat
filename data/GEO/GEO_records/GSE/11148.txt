TITLE
Polytopic protease downregulation effect on the brain (rogae-affy-arabi-492460)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulation of AD-related genes. Presenilins are intramembrane polytopic proteases. These proteases are critical proteins in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The function of other polytopic proteases expressed in brains is unknown.  Proteins that may potentially interact with PS pathway are of interest to elucidate. In this project we will determine gene expression patterns in the brains of  mice with altered expression of polytopic protease. We hypothesize that  family of polytopic proteases expressed in brain may potentially interact with presenilin pathway. We will examine 4 RNA samples isolated from brains of  mice with significant downregulation of polytopic protease and control animals. Total RNA was extracted, purified according to the manufacturer's  protocol and stored at -80C. Keywords: polytopic protease, brain
