TITLE
Analysis of genome-wide methylation of phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human intelligence demonstrates one of the highest heritabilities among human quantitative traits. Phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins provide a way to identify loci reponsible for the phenotypical differences. We performed comprehensive DNA methylation analysis in monozygotic twins manifesting differences in IQ scores. Genes with significantly different methylation status are considered as candidates related to human intelligence.
