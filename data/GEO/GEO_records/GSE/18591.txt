TITLE
Gene profiling of TRA1 and tra1-L3733A

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Tra1 is a component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SAGA and NuA4 complexes and a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase kinase family that contain a C-terminal PI3K domain followed by a 35-residue FATC domain. We analyzed alleles with single residue changes in the FATC domain. Of these tra1-L3733A had the most pronounced effects, resulting in phenotypes similar but not identical to those resulting from mutations in the PI3K domain or SAGA or NuA4 components. To analyze the transcriptional effects of the tra1-L3733A allele, we performed gene profiling of wild-type and tra1-L3733A strains. Expression of 11 genes was elevated ≥ 2-fold, 79 genes were decreased ≥ 2-fold. Of the 11 genes with elevated expression, four (HSP26, PIR3, DDR2 and GRE1) have roles in cellular stress response. The only gene ontology process significantly enriched in the genes with decreased expression greater than 2-fold was lysine biosynthesis (GO: 0009085). Broader analysis of gene ontology processes revealed expression of genes involved in cellular respiration (GO:0045333) and the overlapping process generation of precursor metabolites and energy (GO: 0006091) showed an average upward shift of ~10% relative to the total collection of genes. A similar trend of less magnitude was seen for vitamin metabolic processes (GO:0006766). A slight downward shift was seen for genes involved in translation (GO:0006412) and membrane organization (GO:0016044).
