TITLE
Effect of NR4A3 siRNA treatment on gene expression of islet derived hybrid cell of 1.1B4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene regulation associated with antioxidant defense system in pancreatic beta cells still needs to be elucidated, we found NR4A3 gene expression was up-regulated with 100mM H2O2, therefore, we analyzed the genes expression with Agilent micro-array after NR4A3 siRNA4 treatment by one color method, and found 1044 genes were up-regulated and 859 genes were down regulated in NR4A3 knocked down cell. Changes of some genes expressions were confirmed by real time PCR. The genes of 1044 in NR4A3 siRNA treated cell were up-regulated over 2 folds and 859 genes were down-regulated under 0.67 folds compared with control sample.

DESIGN
We analyzed the comprehensive gene expression changes treated by NR4A3 siRNA in pancreatic beta-cell derived 1.1B4 cells using Agilent microarray.
