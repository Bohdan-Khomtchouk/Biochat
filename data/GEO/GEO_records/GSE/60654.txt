TITLE
Expression data from the bladders of carcinogen-treated mice with genetic Hh pathway manipulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Attenuation of Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activity leads to accelerated tumor progression in a mouse model of N-butyl-N-4-hydroxybutyl nitrosamine (BBN) â€“ induced bladder carcinoma. In order to identify genes regulated by the Hh pathway that might be involved in bladder cancer progression, we performed transcriptional profiling of bladders harvested from mice after BBN-exposure, comparing Gli1CreER/WT; Smoflox/WT mice to Gli1CreER/WT; Smoflox/flox mice, which express CreER under control of the Gli1 promoter and carry one or two floxed alleles of the essential Hh pathway transductory component Smoothened (Smo) respectively. Administration of Tamoxifen to these mice results in attenuation of Hh pathway activty to a greater extent in the Gli1CreER/WT;Smoflox/flox mice as compared to Gli1CreER/WT;Smoflox/WT mice, allowing identification of Hh-pathway regulated genes.

DESIGN
6 total samples were analyzed. 3 bladders from Gli1CreER/WT; Smoflox/WT mice and 3 bladders from Gli1CreER/WT; Smoflox/flox mice were analyzed.
