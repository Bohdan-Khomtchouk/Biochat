TITLE
Analysis of the effect of auxin biosynthesis inhibitor L-AOPP on the gene expression profile (shoot apical meristem)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Recently, 2-aminoxy-3-phenylpropionic acid (L-AOPP) had been demonstrated to possess an inhibitory activity against IAA biosynthesis but the molecular basis of the action was unclear. To investigate the function of L-AOPP, we conducted microarray analysis using the shoot apical meristem (SAM) part of A. thaliana in addition to whole plants after the treatment of L-AOPP.

DESIGN
We performed microarray analysis using the shoot apical meristem (SAM) part of A. thaliana (Columbia-0) to investigate function of 2-aminoxy-3-phenylpropionic acid (L-AOPP) in relation to inhibition of auxin biosynthesis. Total RNA was extracted from SAM part of 7-day-old seedlings grown on 1/2 MS medium containing L-AOPP (50 µM),L-AOPP (50 µM) + Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA 10 nM) or Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO 0.1%).
