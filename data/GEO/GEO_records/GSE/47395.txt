TITLE
RNA Seq analysis of Mefs Isolated from STC1+/+ and STC1-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Evaluation of X-linked gene expression in MEFs isolated from STC1 wild type and knock out mice X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is initiated in cis by the Xist RNA, which coats the inactive X chromosome (Xi) from which it is produced.  We performed a large-scale RNA interference screen to identify trans-acting XCI factors (XCIFs) that comprise regulators of cell signaling and transcription. We find that the XCIFs promote Xist expression and/or localization to the Xi. One of the XCIFs, STC1, is a glycoprotein found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus and whose function is poorly understood. A homozygous mouse knockout of STC1 has a defect in XCI but surprisingly is phenotypically normal. We performed transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq) experiments to determine whether the expression levels of X-encoded genes were elevated in Stc1-/- female MEFs. In these experiments, RNA was prepared from three independent cultures of Stc1+/+ or Stc1-/- female MEFs. RNA samples were processed and amplified followed by deep sequencing. The similarity of X-linked gene expression between Stc1+/+ and Stc1-/- MEFs was statistically significant. The vast majority of autosomal genes were also expressed at comparable levels in Stc1+/+ and Stc1-/- MEFs.

DESIGN
Sequenced mRNA isolated from the STC1+/+ or STC1-/- MEFs.
