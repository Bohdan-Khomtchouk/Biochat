TITLE
Identification of pathogenic microRNAs in Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify dysregulated miRNA(s) upon infection with H. pylori during different pre-malignant and malignant stages of gastric cancer in a mouse model

DESIGN
miRNA expression in pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions in murine stomachs induced by H. pylori and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) after 12 months was profiled by miRNA expression array.
