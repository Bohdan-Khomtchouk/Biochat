TITLE
Estrogens Antagonize RUNX2-Mediated Osteoblast-Driven Osteoclastogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary osteoblast NEMCO cells have been transduced with lentivirus conditionally (doxycycline) expressing RUNX2 and treated with E2 to demonstrate effects of estrogen signaling on RUNX2 response

DESIGN
NEMCO cells kept at charcoal stripped serum have been treated with dox and/or E2 for 48h

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
