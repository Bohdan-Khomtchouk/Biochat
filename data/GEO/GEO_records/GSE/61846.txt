TITLE
Small RNAs from third instar Drosophila melanogaster males

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine if small RNAs from the 1.688 g/cm 3 satellite repeats are present in male larvae.

DESIGN
The small RNA profiles of wild type male larvae and males expressing a snap back construct containing 1.688 sequence were compared.  Abundant 21 nt 1.688 RNAs were found in males expressing the snap back 1.688 g/cm 3 construct, but not in wild type males.
