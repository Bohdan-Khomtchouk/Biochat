TITLE
ChIP-Seq of Klf6 in oligodendrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examine the role of Klf6 in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and determine that Klf6 acts in part through direct regulation of gp130 signaling and nuclear import via  importin-α5 (Impα5), a key controller of nuclear trafficking.

DESIGN
Examination of Klf6 DNA binding in two different stages of differentiation

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
