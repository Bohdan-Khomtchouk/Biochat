TITLE
Gene expression data of human mesenchymal stromal cells, fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The data presented is intended to analyse the changes in the expression profiles of human MSCs (Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells) associated to different tissue specific stimulus.

DESIGN
Human BM-, PL-, and AD- MSCs, and skin fibroblasts from healthy independent donors were isolated and expanded in vitro. Hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells (HSCs) were isolated applying CD34+ immunomagnetic selection.
