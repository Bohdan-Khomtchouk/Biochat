TITLE
Primary human trophoblast from term placenta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compare two groups of transcriptome profiles. They are 1) primary human trophoblasts (PHT) and 2) syncytiotrophoblast from human pluripotent stem cells. This data set represents the former data set and the latter has been deposited separately at GSE72712. Primary human trophoblasts (PHT) were purified cytotrophoblast populations from whole term placentas and then cultured in vitro.  The cytotrophoblasts were cultured for short (9 h) or long (48 h) term that show undifferentiated (PHTu) or differentiated (PHTd) phenotype that led syncytialization, respectively. Transcriptome profiles of PHTu and PHTd were compared with three size fractioned syncytiotrophoblasts and trophoblasts from human pluripotent stem cells that are named ESCd_gt70 (greater than 70 µm), ESCd_40-70 (size between 40 and 70 µm), ESCd_lt40 (smaller than 40 µm) and undifferentiated progenitor (ESCu; see GSE72712).

DESIGN
Primary human trophoblasts (PHT) were derived and cultured from three term human placentas obtained by the Obstetrical Specimen Procurement Unit from women after a healthy pregnancy, labor, and delivery at Magee-Womens Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Isolated PHT lines obtained from three individual (1 female and 2 male) placentas were cultured separately.
