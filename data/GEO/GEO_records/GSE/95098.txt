TITLE
Dynamic and stable enhancer-promoter contacts regulate terminal differentiation [UMI-4C]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and promoter-capture Hi-C (CHi-C) were performed during epidermal differentiation. These data indicate that dynamic and constitutive enhancer-promoter contacts combine to control gene induction during differentiation and that chromosome conformation enables discovery of new TFs with distinct roles in this process.

DESIGN
Hi-C and CHi-C data from epidermal keratinocyte progenitor and differentiated cells.
