TITLE
Gene expression profile of C1013G/CXCR4 mutated WM cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
C1013G/CXCR4 variant has been inserted into BCWM.1 cells, and gene expression profile has been performed on the mutated cells and on the parental cells. Affimetrix Human Genome U133_Plus2.0 array

DESIGN
We used microarrays to dissect the possible changes occurring at mRNA level in mutated cells versus the parental cellular counterpart.
