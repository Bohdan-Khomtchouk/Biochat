TITLE
microRNA expression signatures for colon cancer initiating cell in CRC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In CCICs, G9a expression significantly increases K-RAS protein expression but has no effect on mRNA level. This raises the question of whether microRNA (miRNA) is involved in regulation. A heat map of a miRNA array in G9a versus shG9a transfectants ranked the Let-7 family first, with only Let-7b consistently up-regulated in G9a-knockdown CCICs and down-regulated in G9a-overexpressed non-CCICs

DESIGN
microRNA array  in CRC clinical patientâ€“derived cell line transfected with shRNA against G9a (CCICs/shG9a) or DN-G9a (CCICs/DN-G9a), or in non-CCICs transfected with G9a-expression vector (non-CCICs/G9a).
