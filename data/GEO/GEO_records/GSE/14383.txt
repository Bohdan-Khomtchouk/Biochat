TITLE
Effects of chronic exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells to low doses of cigarette smoke condensate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BEAS-2B cells have been treated with low doses (20Âµg/ml) of CSC for 4 months. As negative control BEAS-2B cells were treated with DMSO (the CSC solvent). Non-treated cells were cultivated in parallel. Keywords: time course, stress response

DESIGN
After each month total RNA was extracted from three replicates of CSC, DMSO and non-treated BEAS-2B cells and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChips.
