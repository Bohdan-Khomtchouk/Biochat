TITLE
Rice gene expression in heat stress and dehydration stress - time series

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Transcriptome measurements of 14 day old rice leaves (2nd leaf) in heat stress and recovery and dehydration stress and recovery - samples collected every 15 minutes for up to 4h - 480 samples (240 conditions, 2 biological replicates)

DESIGN
5 conditions: control (30C, liquid media); Heat (transferred from 30C to 40C; up to 4h); Heat recovery (transferred back to 30C after 2h at 40C; up to 2h); Dehydration (roots exposed to air; up to 2.25h); Dehydration recovery (roots returned to liquid media after 1.5h in air; up to 3.5h) Samples: every 15 minutes, 2 biological replicates.  Dataset includes 475 samples.
