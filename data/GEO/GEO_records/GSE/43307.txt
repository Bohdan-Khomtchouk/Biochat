TITLE
Feed restriction, but not L-carnitine infusion, affects the liver transcriptome with an evident and inhibition of energy production and sterol synthesis and increase of gluconeogenesis  in mid-lactating dairy cows

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Feed restriction and L-carnitine infusion are known to affect the liver metabolism of dairy cows. In the present experiment the effects on liver transcriptome of feed restriction and L-carnitine abomasal infusion and the interaction of the two in mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows was assessed. Data clearly indicated a lack of transcriptomics effect by L-carnitine but a strong effect due to feed restriction. The functional analysis identified a overall reduction of cholesterol synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation and data suggested an increase flux toward gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation.

DESIGN
The liver biopsy was performed after 14 days of treatment in 8 Holstein dairy cows in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangment with 5 days washout between treatments. A dye-swap reference design (reference =  mixture of RNA from several bovine tissues) was used.
