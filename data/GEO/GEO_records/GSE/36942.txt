TITLE
Genomic profiling of oral squamous cell carcinoma by array-based comparative genomic hybridization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated CNAs of 40 tumor samples from 25 patients, including 15 metastatic primary tumor (MPT), paired neck lymph-node metastasis (LNM) and 10 non-metastatic primary tumor (NMPT), by 44k oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH).

DESIGN
15 MPT vs 15 LNM, 10 NMPT vs 15 LNM

PLATFORM
GPL5477 Agilent-014950 Human Genome CGH Microarray 4x44K (Feature Number version)
