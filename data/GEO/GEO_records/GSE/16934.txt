TITLE
A five-gene signature is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed an experimentally derived molecular signature from mouse tumor models that is closely associated with survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.

DESIGN
We isolated single cell-derived progenies (SCPs) from the SW480 CRC cell line and compared their metastatic potential in an orthotopic implantation model of murine CRC. We compared the differences in the gene expression profiles of a high metastatic variant SCP51, a low metastatic variant SCP58 and their parent SW480/EGFP.
