TITLE
Genomic analysis of low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas [IL610Q]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas are typically Ras-pathway mutated, TP53 wild-type, have limited chromosomal aberration, and are frequently associated with borderline tumors. By contrast, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma lack Ras-pathway mutations, are invariably TP53 mutated, show widespread genomic change, and are commonly BRCA-pathway disrupted. We sought to identify differences in genomic copy number changes between co-existing borderline and invasive components of serous carcinoma.

DESIGN
Paired co-existing borderline and invasive tumor components of ovarian serous carcinoma were sampled and profiled from tumors from 7 patients
