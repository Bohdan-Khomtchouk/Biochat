TITLE
Temperature induced alternative splicing is affected in sdg8 and sdg26.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plants developed a plasticity to environmental conditions, such as temperature, that allows their adaptation. A change in ambient temperature leads to changes in the transcriptome in plants, such as the production of different splicing isoforms. Here we study temperature induced alternative splicing events in Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and two epigenetic mutants, sdg8-2 and sdg26-1 using an RNA-seq approach.

DESIGN
We generate 3 biological replicates for each genotype (wild-type, sdg8-2 and sdg26-1) at each condition (16°C and 25°C day 1), for a total of 18 samples.
