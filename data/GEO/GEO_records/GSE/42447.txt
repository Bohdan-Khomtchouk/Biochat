TITLE
Activation of the chromatin-remodeling factor Smarca4/Brg1 cooperates with Olig2 to establish oligodendrocyte identity and control CNS myelination [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We investigate the role of Brg1 and Olig2 during oligodendrocyte differentiation by combining gene conditional knockout and next generation sequencing technology. We generate genome-wide maps of RNA polymerase II (RPolII), Brg1 (Smarca4), Olig2 and histone modifications in primary rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells (iOLs), differentiating oligodendrocytes and mature oligodendrocytes.We found that Brg1 is intensely regulated by RPolII at the initiation of oligodedrocyte differentiation. The genomic distribution of Brg1 in differentiating oligodendrocytes is pre-directed by Olig2 in iOLs. The dynamic interaction of Brg1 and chromatin is correlate with the distinct stages of gene expression during maturation. Finally, we show that Brg1 and Olig2 localization predict critical genes controling CNS myeliantion. Our study represents the first detailed analysis of genomic landscape during the oligodendrocyte development and provides a framework for further understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying oligodendrocyte lineage progression.

DESIGN
Genomic distribution of Brg1, Olig2, RPolII and three different histone modifications in three oligodendrocyte developemtal stages were examined using primary cells by ChIP-sequencing. Spinal cord mRNA profiles of 14-day old control and Brg1c/c;Olig1-Cre mice were generated by RNA-sequencing.
