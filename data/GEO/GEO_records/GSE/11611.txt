TITLE
Combined gene expression and QTL analysis of soybean quantitative resistance to Phytophthora sojae

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
To identify soybean genes and QTLs associated with quantitative resistance to infection by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae, we conducted a very large-scale microarray experiment using 2522 Affymetrix GeneChips. The experiment involved assaying a total of 298 soybean recombinant inbred lines together with internal checks.
