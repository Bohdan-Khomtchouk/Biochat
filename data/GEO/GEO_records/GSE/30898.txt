TITLE
Msn2p occupancy dynamics in yeast BY4741 responding to 0.4mM H2O2 over time (0-60 min)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C

SUMMARY
Numerous factors have been implicated in regulating gene expression changes, including changes to nucleosome occupancy.  Here we followed dynamic changes to nucleosome occupancy, gene expression and DNA binding of the transcription factor Msn2p genome-wide in yeast cells responding to hydrogen peroxide. and reveal new relationships between regulators of stress-dependent gene expression in yeast.

DESIGN
Msn2p occupancy was measured in response to 0.4mM H2O2 in the S288c derivative BY4741 with an integrated myc-tagged Msn2p.  A single replicate of the time course was performed with time points at 0, 4, 12, 20, 40 and 60 minutes after treatment.
