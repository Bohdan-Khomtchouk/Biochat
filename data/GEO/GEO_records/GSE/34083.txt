TITLE
Intracellular transcription by multiple Listeria monocytogenes strains

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
These studies were designed to examine the transcription of Listeria monocytogenes strains 10403S and LO28 during intracellular replication in mammalian macrophages.

DESIGN
Duplicate WT Listeria monocytogenes (strains 10403S and LO28) were used to infect mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs).  Bacterial RNA was harvested at 4 hours post-infection.
