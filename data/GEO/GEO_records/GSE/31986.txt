TITLE
Pemetrexed alters inflammatory profile in EA.hy 926 cells grown under low-folate conditions.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pemetrexed is an antifolate drug used in the treatment of lung cancer. EA.hy 926 cells grown under low (Lo) and normal (Hi) folate conditions were treated with PMX. Microarray analysis was used to examine changes in gene expression due to PMX treatment.

DESIGN
Hi and Lo cells were grown to confluence and maintained in fresh medium for 24 hours prior to treatment with 0.5uM PMX for 48 hours.
