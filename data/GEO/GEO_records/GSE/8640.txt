TITLE
TFAP2C regulates multiple pathways of estrogen signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We were interested in determining what genes might be controlled by TFAP2C and/or TFAP2A, either directly or indirectly through regulation of ER-alpha and potentially other signaling pathways. We performed an microarray analysis in MCF7 cells with elimination of either TFAP2C or TFAP2A. The patterns of gene expression with alteration of TFAP2 activity were compared to changes in expression induced by estrogen exposure. Knock-down of TFAP2C in the presence of estrogen altered the pattern of several known ERalpha-regulated genes and a number of genes outside the estrogen-regulated pathways. Keywords: Various siRNA treatments

DESIGN
6 samples were analyzed. 1. MCF7 cells treated with TFAP2C siRNA, without the presence of estrogen. 2.MCF7 cells treated with TFAP2C siRNA, with the presence of estrogen. 3.MCF7 cells treated with TFAP2A siRNA, without the presence of estrogen. 4.MCF7 cells treated with TFAP2A siRNA, with the presence of estrogen. 5.MCF7 cells with no siRNA treatment, without the presence of estrogen. 6.MCF7 cells with no siRNA treatment, with the presence of estrogen.
