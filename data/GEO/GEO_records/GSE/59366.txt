TITLE
Pharmacologic inhibition of histone demethylation as a therapy for pediatric brainstem glioma [expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of two pediatric human DIPG cell lines, harboring the K27M mutation. DIPG cell lines were treated with GSKJ4 for 24 and 72 h. The untreated cell lines served as baseline, and expression fold changes in each treated cell line were determined relative to the baseline. Goal was to determine the effects of GSKJ4 treatment on global gene expression in DIPG cells harboring the K27M mutation.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: 72 h GSKJ4 treated cells vs. 24 h GSKJ4 treated cells vs. untreated cells. Biological replicates: 1 cell line, with 2 technical replicates per condition.

PLATFORM
