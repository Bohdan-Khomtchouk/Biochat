TITLE
Modeling Fanconi Anemia pathogenesis and therapeutics using   integration-free patient iPSCs [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the epigenetic status of the mutant and disease-free iPSCs at the whole genome level. Whole epigenome profiling based on trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3) showed concordant epigenetic remodeling in the two corrected clones when compared with two mutant iPSC clones.

DESIGN
Examination of the trimethylated H3K4 histone modification in Fanconi anemia patient iPSCs before and after gene correction

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
