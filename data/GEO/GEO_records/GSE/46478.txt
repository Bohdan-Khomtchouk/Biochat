TITLE
Transcriptional profile of WT, PRR and IFN-/- dendritic cells stimulated with poly IC in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the specific transcriptional changes on DCs provided by direct pattern recogition receptor (PRR) or IFNAR signaling that are required for DC maturation after poly IC stimulation. Results provide important information about the intricate differentiation process of DC maturation and the importance of type I IFNs for DC immunogenicity.

DESIGN
WT/IFNA-/- or WT/PRR-/- mixed-chimera mice were injected with 50 ug Poly-IC i.p. in vivo 4 and 14 hr later, wild type and KO CD11chi CD3- DX5- B220- DCs were FACS sorted based on CD45.2 expression. Total RNA was isolated and expression profile was compared between unstimulated and activated WT and KO DCs.
