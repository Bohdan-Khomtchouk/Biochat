TITLE
Identifying SC1-regulated miRNAs in the J1 mESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been demonstrated that SC1 (Pluripotin) promotes self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells.  To better understand miRNAs regulated by SC1 directly or indirectly in mouse embryonic stem cells, we performed next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify small RNAs with expression changes after SC1 treatment.

DESIGN
J1 mESCs maintained in  medium containing 1000 U/mL LIF and supplemented with SC1 or equal volume of DMSO (Control) , after 6 h treatment, total RNA was extracted for small RNA sequencing.
