TITLE
Investigation of Alterations in Gene Expression in the Retina Induced by Intravitreal Injection of titanium dioxide nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated the safety of locally delivered titanium dioxide nanoaprticles at the level of gene expression in the retina. To figure out any definite dose-dependent effect, we injected titanium dioxide nanoparticles into the vitreous cavity of 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice at the concentration of presumptive therapeutic concentration (PTC; 130.47 ng/ml) and 10 times PTC (1.30 Î¼g/ml).

DESIGN
We intravitreally injected PBS or titanium dioxide nanoparticles into the right eyes of 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 12 per group). PBS-treated mice were regarded as negative control. Four retinal tissues were pooled into 1 test tube and prepared for further analyses.
