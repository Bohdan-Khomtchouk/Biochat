TITLE
RNAseq analysis of murine brainstem gliomas with and without H3.3K27M

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using the RCAS/tv-a system, we induced murine brainstem gliomas (PDGF-B; p53 loss using RCAS-Cre with and without H3.3K27M) in Nestin tv-a; p53 floxed mice

DESIGN
Three independent tumors with H3.3K27M (PKC) and three independent tumors without H3.3K27M (PDC) were snap frozen, RNA extracted, and RNAseq analysis was performed (PDGF-B; H3.3K27M; p53 loss vs. PDGF-B; p53 loss)
