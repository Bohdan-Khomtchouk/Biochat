TITLE
alphaT-catenin in restricted brain cell types and its potential connection to autism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis was performed between WT and alphaT-cat KO mouse cerebella aiming to discover gene transcripts altered by the loss of alphaT-cat These altered gene transcripts could be associated with several neurologic disease-relevant pathways

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted of cerebellar tissue (n=3) from the brains of WT ad alphaT-cat KO mice
