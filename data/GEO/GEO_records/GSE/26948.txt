TITLE
Programming of marginal zone B cell fate by basic krüppel-like factor (BKLF/KLF3)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of splenic follicular B cells and marginal zone B cells from B6 and CD19:KLF3 transgenic mice Comparing KLF3-transgenic and non-transgenic follicular B cells by RNA-microarray revealed that KLF3 regulates a subset of genes that was similarly up-/downregulated upon normal MZ B cell differentiation. Indeed, KLF3 expression overcame the lack of MZ B cells caused by different genetic alterations, such as CD19-deficiency or blockade of B-cell activating factor (BAFF)-receptor signaling, indicating that KLF3 may complement alternative NF-κB signaling. Thus, KLF3 is a driving force towards MZ B cell maturation.

DESIGN
RNA of splenic follicular B cells and marginal zone B cells were obtained from 4 different mice per group (B6 and CD19:KLF3 mice). 16 samples = 8 individual mice x 2 B cell subsets.
