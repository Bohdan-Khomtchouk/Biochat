TITLE
Gene expression profiling of early primary breast cancer to identify prognostic markers and associated pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Retrospective series of primary breast cancer patients who received surgery between 1989 and 1992. Patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and/or adjuvant hormone therapy, or no adjuvant treatment. Tamoxifen was used as endocrine therapy for 5 years in ER+ BC patients. Patients who were < 50 years of age, with lymph node positive tumors, or ER– and/or > 3 cm in diameter, received adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) for six cycles, in a thrice weekly intravenous regimen. Patients > 50 years of age with ER–, lymph node–positive tumors also received CMF.

DESIGN
Retrospective clinical study to identify breast cancer prognostic markers and associated pathways. 216 early primary breast cancers were considered who had complete 10-years follow-up, clinical and demographics information. mRNA profiling data.
