TITLE
FolR1 gene ablation-induced changes in gene expression in mouse conotrucus tissue and developing heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Defective function of FolR1 in mice results in inadequate transport, accumulation, or metabolism of folate during cardiovascular morphogenesis. We have observed cardiovascular abnormalities including outflow track defects and aortic arch artery defects in these genetically compromised mice. In order to investigate the mechanisms underlying the failure to complete cardiac development in the transgenic mouse model, we studied gene expression difference between FolR1 knockout embryos and normal embryos during outflow track septation (GD11:12, GSM78976 ... GSM78987), and studied gene expression difference between FolR1 knockout embryos and normal embryos during embryonic heart development(GD9:00 and GD10:00, GSM79024 ... GSM79035). Keywords: gene ablation response
