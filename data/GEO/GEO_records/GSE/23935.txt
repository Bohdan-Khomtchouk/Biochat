TITLE
Gene responses to TGF-beta receptor inhibition in glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGF-beta has an oncogenic response in glioblastoma and it is considered to be a therapeutic target. We evaluated the effect of TGF-beta inhibition in glioblastoma. Differential gene expression analysis of patient-derived primary cultured glioblastoma cells treated with the TGF-beta receptor inhibitor, LY2109761

DESIGN
11 patient-derived cell cultures from 11 patients were treated with 2microM of the TGF-beta receptor inhibitor, LY2109761, for 3 hours or left untreated and RNA was isolated and microarray analysis was performed
