TITLE
GATA factors efficiently direct cardiac fate from ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gata5 efficiently promotes cardiomyocyte fate from murine ESCs.By removing serum from the culture conditions, GATA4 and GATA6 are each also able to efficiently promote cardiogenesis in ESC derivatives, with some distinctions. Thus, GATA factors can   function in ESC derivatives upstream of other cardiac transcription factors to direct specification of progenitors with cardiac potential. We used microarray to compared the global gene expression of Gata5-induced cardiac cells with other growth factor directed ESC-derived cardiac cells

DESIGN
iGata5 ESCs were induced with doxycycline at day 4 and harvested at day16 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
