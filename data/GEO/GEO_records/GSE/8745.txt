TITLE
Low R:FR treatment at 16 and 22 degrees

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to identify genes responding differently to a 24 h low red to far red ratio (R:FR) treatment in plants grown at 16 and 22 degrees Keywords: Light treatment

DESIGN
Microarrays were used as a gene discovery tool to identify genes showing differential regulation by low R:FR at 2 growth temperatures. Plants subject to a 24 h low R:FR light treatment were compared with control plants maintained in high R:FR. This experiment was carried out at two growth temperatures, 16oC and 22oC.
