TITLE
MicroRNA Expression data from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) granulosa cell tumour (GCT) tissue samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Granulosa cell tumours (GCTs) of the ovary are a unique subset of ovarian stromal tumours accounting for approximately five percent of all ovarian malignancies. Based on their pathologic characteristics and clinical features, GCTs can be further divided into two distinct subtypes: adult-GCTs and juvenile-GCTs. In this study, we investigate the use of microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognostication of GCTs.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from five adult-GCT and five juvenile-GCT FFPE tumours and hybridised on Affymetrix miRNA microarrays.
