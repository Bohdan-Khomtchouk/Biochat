TITLE
MicroRNA Expression data from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) granulosa cell tumour (GCT) tissue samples

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Granulosa cell tumours (GCTs) of the ovary are a unique subset of ovarian stromal tumours accounting for approximately five percent of all ovarian malignancies. Based on their pathologic characteristics and clinical features, GCTs can be further divided into two distinct subtypes: adult-GCTs and juvenile-GCTs. In this study, we investigate the use of microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognostication of GCTs.
