TITLE
Sexually dimorphic transcriptomic responses in the largemouth bass to the neuroactive pesticide dieldrin

ORGANISM
Micropterus salmoides

SUMMARY
In this study, both male and female sexually regressed largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) (LMB) were fed a nominal concentration of 3.0 mg dieldrin/kg in feed for 60 days.  A third group of male LMB was fed both 3.0 mg dieldrin/kg dieldrin and 0.7 mg E2/kg  in feed.  E2 was used as a model compound to elicit estrogenic effects via ER signaling.

DESIGN
There were four samples analyzed for 1) control males 2) control females 3) males fed 3 mg/kg dieldrin 4) females fed 3.0 mg/kg dieldrin, and 5) males fed 3.0 mg/kg dieldrin +  0.7 mg/kg E2. There was a total of 20 microarrays and sample processed.

PLATFORM
GPL13229 LMB microarray 15K (Agilent format)
