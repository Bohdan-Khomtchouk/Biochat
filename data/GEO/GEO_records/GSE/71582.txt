TITLE
Intrahepatic transcriptional signature associated with response to interferon-a treatment in the woodchuck model of chronic hepatitis B

ORGANISM
Marmota monax

SUMMARY
To define the intrahepatic cellular and molecular characteristics of the antiviral response to wIFN-alpha in woodchuck, the transcriptional profiles of woodchuck liver were studied by using RNASeq

DESIGN
Woodchucks liver samples with chronic woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection were treated with recombinant woodchuck IFN-alpha or with placebo for 26 weeks

PLATFORM
