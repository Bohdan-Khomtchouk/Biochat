TITLE
Global view of mRNA uridylation in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To obtain a global view of mRNA uridylation in Arabidopsis, we generated TAIL-seq libraries from WT plants, urt1 and xrn4 single mutants, and urt1 xrn4 double mutant. The TAIL-seq protocol was recently developed to deep-sequence the 3' ends of RNAs (Chang et al., 2014).

DESIGN
We generated TAIL-seq libraries from WT plants, urt1 and xrn4 single mutants, and urt1 xrn4 double mutant.
