TITLE
Gene expression data from mouse colon. AOM+DSS induced colitis. Wild type or Cygb -/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cytoglobin is a member of the hemoglobin family and is thought to protect against cellular hypoxia and cellular oxidative stress. This function may be particularly important in inflammation induced cancer observed in e.g. patients with ulcerative colitis. In this study, we investigated the development of inflammation and tumors in the murine model of inflammation induced colorectal cancer using Azoxymethane treatment combined with Dextrane Sodium Sulphate.

DESIGN
29 samples were analyzed. Wild type, untreated (8 biological replicates); Wild type AOM+DSS (8 biological replicates); Cygb -/-, untreated (8 biological replicates); Cygb -/- AOM+DSS (8 biological replicates)
