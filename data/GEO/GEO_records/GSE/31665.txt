TITLE
Role of Cofilin 1 pathway and actin dynamics in nuclear retinoid receptor function

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have investigated the role of actin dynamics and the effect of actin cytoskeleton modifying agents on retinoid receptor-mediated transactivation. Using Nef, an actin modifying HIV-1 protein, the role of LMK1/CFL1-mediated actin dynamics in receptor function was studied. The effect of Nef expression on transcriptome was investigated following transfection of HEK293 cells with Nef-expressing plasmid. The array data identified Nef-induced inhibition of a number of genes that contain retinoid receptor binding sites in their promoters.

DESIGN
The experiment was designed to study the effect of expression of HIV-1 Nef protein on gene expression levels in HEK293 cells. Cells were transfected in three different experiments (each time in duplicate) with Nef expressing plasmid and a plasmid that contained a non-expressing Nef construct (Nef/Stop) as control. The cells were harvested after 36 of transfection and processed for gene array.
