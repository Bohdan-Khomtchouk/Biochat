TITLE
Construction of Reusable Plasmid Libraries for Strain Construction

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli ; Escherichia coli BW25113

SUMMARY
Test whether it is possible to conjugate a whole plasmid library into a recipient strain without loss of fidelity (as judged by aCGH analysis)

DESIGN
Donor and Recipient Libraries are compared with array CGH to detect copy number differences, a simple selection experiment is also performed

PLATFORM
GPL13359 Agilent-020097 E. coli Gene Expression Microarray (Probe Name version)
