TITLE
Toxicogenomic Effect of Burkholderia pseudomallei in a Human Macrophage Cell (THP-1) Model of Acute Melioidosis Using Whole-genome Microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Burkholderia pseudomallei

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of human cell (THP-1) lines exposed to a novel Daboiatoxin (DbTx) isolated from Daboia russelli russelli, and specific cytokines and inflammatory pathways involved in acute infection caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei. Keywords: Melioidosis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Daboiatoxin, Cytokines, Inflammation.

DESIGN
1.	Group I:- Human monocytic macrophage (THP-1) cell lines grown in the culture medium without any bacterial infection served as untreated control group (Three Biological Replicates). 2.	Group II:- THP-1 cells were infected with Burkholderia pseudomallei (A600 nm = OD 0.6, ~5 x 107 cfu/ml) for 24h served as a disease control group (Three Biological Replicates). 3.	Group III:- THP-1 cells were infected with B. pseudomallei and treated with Daboiatoxin (0.5 mM) isolated from Daboia russelli russelli venom served as a treatment group (Three Biological Replicates). 4.	Group IV:- THP-1 cells were infected with B. pseudomallei (A600 nm = OD 0.6, ~5 x 107 cfu/ml) treated with standard antimicrobial drug ceftazidime (10mg/ml) served as a drug control (Three Biological Replicates). 5.	Group V:- THP-1 cells were exposed to Daboiatoxin (0.5 mM) without bacterial infection (Three Biological Replicates).
