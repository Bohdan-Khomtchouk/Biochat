TITLE
Chip-chip from C3H10T1/2 cells with Gli1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Indian Hedgehog signaling (IHH) regulates multiple aspects of endochondral bone formation and ultimately regulates expression of downstream genes by Gli zinc finger domain-containing transcription regulators in the cartilage development. In response to a BDA1 mutant IHH induction, Gli1-mediated downstream regulatory pattern might be quite different from that in response to wild type IHH induction.

DESIGN
Comparison of wild type IhhN protein-induced, E95K mutant IhhN protein-induced and non-protein induced cells
