TITLE
Tobramycin Treatment of Planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
As a comparison to tobramycin-treated P. aeruginosa biofilms, we investigated the response of planktonic P. aeruginosa to tobramycin by microarray. Keywords: Tobramycin Response

DESIGN
We included 2 control (untreated) cultures and 2 tobramycin-treated cultures.  We used mid-exponential phase cultures of P. aeruginosa PA14.  Replicate cultures were incubated in the presence or absence of 5 μg/mL tobramycin for 30 minutes at 37°C.
