TITLE
microRNA expression profiles of distinct mouse mammary epithelial cell types

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA samples were prepared from freshly sorted mammary cell subpopulations (MaSC/basal-enriched, luminal progenitor, mature luminal and stromal) from five sets of adult mice. High throughput RT-PCR was used to measure the global microRNA expression profiles of each cell subpopulation. The expression profiles were compared between cell subpopulations to gain insight into the regulation of lineage-restricted genes.
