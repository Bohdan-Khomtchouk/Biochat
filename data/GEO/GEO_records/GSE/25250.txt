TITLE
Cerebellum from mice exposed to chronic low-level chlorpyrifos oxon

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphorus (OP) insecticide that is still widely used despite statutory restrictions on home use. CPF is converted to chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) by oxidative desulfuration in liver.  Paraoxonase (PON1) polymorphisms affects the catalytic efficiency of the hydrolysis of OPs, including CPO. We used both wt (PON1+/+) and PON1 knockout (PON1-/-) mice and PON1-/- mice carrying transgenes encoding the human alloforms tgHuPON1Q192 and tgHuPON1R192 to gain insight into the mechanisms of neurotoxicity of CPO throughout postnatal development, and to ascertain the importance of the PON1Q192R polymorphism for protecting against developmental toxicity of CPO. Whole-genome microarrays were used to measure gene expression changes associated with chronic CPO exposure of developing (PND 4-21) PON1-/-, tgHuPON1Q192R transgenic and PON1+/+ mice. Expression profiles are derived from cerebella from wild-type C57/Bl6 and PON1-/- on a C57/Bl6 background and two transgenic strains (tgHuPON1Q192, tgHuPON1R192) expressing either human PON1Q192 or human PON1R192 on the PON1-/- C57/Bl6 background. The mice were subjected to chronic postnatal exposure to CPO (CPO).

DESIGN
Transgenic, PON1-KO and WT neonatal mice either treated with control (DMSO), 0.35 mg*kg-1*day-1 CPO or 0.5 mg*kg-1*day-1 CPO daily from PND 4 to PND 21. Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is converted to chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) by oxidative desulfuration in liver. 55 arrays, 12 experimental groups (strain + treatment), due to QC issues the replicates are as follows; PON1-KO-0.35 (5), PON1-KO-.O5 (3), PON1-KO-DMSO (4), PON1-Q129-0.35 (5), PON1-Q129-0.5 (5), PON1-Q129-DMSO (4), PON1-R129-0.35 (5), PON1-R129-0.5 (5), PON1-R129-DMSO (4), WT-0.35 (6), WT-0.5 (3), WT-DMSO (6)
