TITLE
Transcriptomic insights into human decidual and peripheral blood CD4 T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed the analysis of transcriptional and alternative splicing landscapes for paired decidual and peripheral blood CD4 T cells during human pregnancy by high-throughput mRNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Healthy women during early pregnancy were recruited, and FACS was performed to isolate and purify the CD4+ T cells from the decidua and peripheral blood. We sequenced the RNA samples on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.

PLATFORM
