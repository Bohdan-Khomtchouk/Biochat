TITLE
DnaA coordinates replication initiation and cell cycle transcription in Caulobacter crescentus

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
Supporting data for Hottes et al., " DnaA coordinates replication initiation and cell cycle transcription in Caulobacter crescentus " The microarray component of this work monitors mRNA expression during the cell cycle of synchronized populations of Caulobacter crescentus cells.  Transcription during the normal cell cycle is compared with transcription during a cell cycle where expression of dnaA, which encodes a key DNA replication initiation factor, is delayed. Keywords: time course, cell cycle, metabolism
