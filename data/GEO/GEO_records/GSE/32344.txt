SUMMARY
Microarray experiments were performed for VCaP and VCS2 cells with and without androgen stimulation

DESIGN
The RNA samples were extracted from VCaP and VCS2 cells treated with Ethanol or 10nM DHT for 24 hours. RNA was submitted to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Microarray Core Facility for hybridyzation.
