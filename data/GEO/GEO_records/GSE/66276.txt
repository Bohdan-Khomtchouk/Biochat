TITLE
Microarray profiling of rats treated for 21 days with Lithium chloride (0.2% in chow), Lamotrigine (30 mg/kg), or appropriately matched vehicles

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
SD rats were dosed with gold mood stabilizer therapies, lithium or lamotrigine, at doses aimed at achieving therapeutically relevant drug exposures.  Tissues were collected after 21 days of delivery to examine the impact of this treatment on gene expression in frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum.

DESIGN
n=5 per group.  LiCl was delivered in chow (0.2%), and compared with a vehicle chow group.  Lamotrigine was administered via subcutaneous injection once daily and compared with a vehicle injection.  All drugs were administered for 21 days.
