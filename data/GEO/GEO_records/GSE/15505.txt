TITLE
Expression of cyclophilin B is associated with malignant progression and regulation of genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray was conducted on Illumina Human Ref-6 Version 2 Expression Chip (Illumina, San Diego, CA).  Three independent cultures were used for RNA isolation with RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA quality was checked by Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). An Ambion labeling kit was used for labeling cDNA followed by hybridization to Illumina chips. ChIP scan data was extracted by Illumina Beadstudio and subsequently analyzed using Bioconductor lumi package.
