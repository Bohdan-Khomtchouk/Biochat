TITLE
Sequencing of small RNAs in healthy human serum from China

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied Solexa sequencing technology to identify normal human serum microRNA genes. Sequencing result was refered to miRBase 15.0, including 904 human miRNAs.Using this method, we found that there were total number of 513 miRNAs in normal human serum and the total copy number of the serum miRNA was 3780436.

DESIGN
18-30 nt small RNAs from 43 healthy Chinese serum pool was sequenced in one Solexa lane

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
