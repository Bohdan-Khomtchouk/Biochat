TITLE
Single tip transcriptomics of neighboring hyphae of Aspergillus niger

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Mycelia of filamentous fungi explore new substrates by means of hyphae that extend from the periphery of the colony. Previously, it has been shown by immuno-labelling, reporter studies and in situ hybridization that these exploring hyphae are heterogenic with respect to protein secretion and transcription. We performed single hyphal tip RNA profiling using microarrays to assess the differences in RNA accumulation in neighboring exploring hyphae

DESIGN
Single tips from 5 neighboring exploring hyphae from a single colony were selected for RNA extraction, amplification and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
