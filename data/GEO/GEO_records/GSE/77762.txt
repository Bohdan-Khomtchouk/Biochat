TITLE
LNCaP LSD1 knockdown and SP-2509 treatment ChIP-seq data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LSD1 (also known as KDM1A) is a histone demethylase and a key regulator of gene expression in embryonic stem cells and cancer.1,2 LSD1 was initially identified as a transcriptional repressor via its demethylation of active histone H3 marks (di-methyl lysine 4 [2MK4]).1  In prostate cancer, specifically, LSD1 also co-localizes with the AR and demethylates repressive 2MK9 histone marks from androgen-responsive AR target genes, facilitating androgen-mediated induction of AR-regulated gene expression and androgen-induced proliferation in androgen-dependent cancers.   We report here that the LSD1 protein is universally upregulated in human CRPC and promotes survival of CRPC cell lines. This effect is explained in part by LSD1-induced activation of cell cycle and embryonic stem cell gene setsâ€”gene sets enriched in transcriptomal studies of lethal human tumors. Importantly, despite the fact that many of these genes are direct LSD1 targets, we did not observe histone methylation changes at the LSD1-bound regions, demonstrating non-canonical histone demethylation-independent mechanisms of gene regulation.   This ChIP-seq dataset included H3K4me2 and H3K9me2 ChIP-seq data for siRNA target against LSD1 and non-targeting control, as well as SP2509 inhibition of LSD1 and mock treatment

DESIGN
4 conditions: siRNA against LSD1, siRNA against luciferase (non-targeting control); SP2509 inhibition of LSD1, mock treatment. There are 2 replicates per condition.
