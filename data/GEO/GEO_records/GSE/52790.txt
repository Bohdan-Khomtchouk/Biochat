TITLE
lncRNA and mRNA expression data in peripheral blood sampled from MDD patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are pervasively transcribed and have a direct role in the regulation of genes involved in neural plasticity and cognitive function. Moreover, alterations in the expression of several lncRNAs have been observed in some psychiatric disorders. However, changes in the expression of regulatory lncRNAs in MDD have not yet been reported. Using microarrays, we profiled the expression of 51513 lncRNAs and 35123 mRNAs in peripheral blood sampled from MDD patients as well as demographically-matched controls.

DESIGN
This study recruited a total of 10 patients and 12 coupled healthy controls. The patients were recruited from outpatients of the department of psychiatry at the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University and the controls were recruited from the community nearby. All participants were Chinese of Han origin and came from the same geographic areas in northern China.
