TITLE
Expression data from WT, E2f8 KO, Rb KO and Rb;E2f8 DKO spleen Ter19+CD71high sorted cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand molecular mechanisms underlying the synergy of Rb loss and E2F8 loss, we used gene expression profiling to assess molecular changes in Mx1-Cre-mediated knockout (KO) mice using RNA isolated from sorted Ter119+CD71high Erythroblasts. The top four upregulated and enriched pathways in the DKO mice included DNA replication, DNA damage response, DNA repair, and RNA processing. Interestingly, the majority of upregulated genes in the enriched sections of the four shared pathways contain E2f binding site(s) in their promoters, suggesting that Rb and E2F8 largely repress those genes through the E2f binding sites. Collectively, our data suggest that Rb and E2F8 co-regulate E2F-responsive genes.

DESIGN
Spleen Ter119+CD71high cells were sorted from WT, E2f8 KO, Rb KO and E2f8;Rb DKO mice
