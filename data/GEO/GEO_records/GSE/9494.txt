TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of Daptomycin Induced Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Daptomycin is a  lipopeptide antibiotic that has recently been approved for treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections.  The mode of action of daptomycin is not yet entirely clear.  To further understand the mechanism transcriptomic analysis of changes in gene expression in daptomycin-treated Staphylococcus aureus was carried out.  The expression profile indicated that cell wall stress stimulon member genes (B. J. Wilkinson, A. Muthaiyan, and R. K. Jayaswal.  2005.  Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Infective Agents 4: 259-276) were significantly induced by daptomycin, and by the cell wall-active antibiotics vancomycin and oxacillin.  Comparison of  the daptomycin response of a two-component cell wall stress stimulon regulator VraSR mutant, S. aureus  KVR, to its parent N315 showed diminished expression of the cell wall stress stimulon  in the mutant.  Daptomycin has been proposed to cause membrane depolarization, and the transcriptional responses to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and nisin were determined.  Transcriptional profiles of the responses to these antimicrobial agents showed significantly different patterns compared to those of  the cell wall-active antibiotics, including little or no induction of the cell wall stress stimulon.  However, there were a significant number of genes induced by both CCCP and daptomycin that were not induced by oxacillin or vancomycin, such that the daptomycin transcriptome was probably reflecting a membrane depolarizing activity of this antimicrobial also.  The results indicate that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, either directly or indirectly, and membrane depolarization are parts of the mode of action of daptomycin.
