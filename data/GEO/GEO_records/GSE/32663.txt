TITLE
Identification of 67 histone marks and histone lysine crotonylation as a new type of histone modification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the identification of 67 previously undescribed histone modifications, increasing the current number of known histone marks by about 70%. We further investigated one of the marks, lysine crotonylation (Kcr), confirming that it represents an evolutionarily-conserved histone posttranslational modification. The unique structure and genomic localization of histone Kcr suggest that it is mechanistically and functionally different from histone lysine acetylation (Kac). Specifically, in both human somatic and mouse male germ cell genomes, histone Kcr marks either active promoters or potential enhancers. In male germinal cells immediately following meiosis, Kcr is enriched on sex chromosomes and specifically marks testis-specific genes, including a significant proportion of X-linked genes that escape sex chromosome inactivation in haploid cells. These results therefore dramatically extend the repertoire of histone PTM sites and designate Kcr as a specific mark of active sex chromosome-linked genes in postmeiotic male germ cells.

DESIGN
2 histone marks (pan-lysine acetylation and pan-lysine crotonylation) were studied in 1 human cell type and 2 mouse cell types using ChIP-Seq.  Input was sequenced for each cell type as a control. Pan-anti_Kac and pan-anti_Kcr antibodies were custom developed with PTM BioLab, Co., Ltd (Chicago, IL).
