TITLE
A landscape of cellular aggregation of Rhizobium etli CFN42 by a transcriptomic approach

ORGANISM
Rhizobium etli CFN 42

SUMMARY
Dna microarray technology was used to survey changes in gene expression in R. etli CFN42 in biofilm formation In these organisms, two main phases, biofilm and planktonic, have been identified. In this work, using microarray assays, we evaluated global gene expression in biofilm and planktonic growth phases in rich medium, in the bacterium Rhizobium etli CFN42.

DESIGN
Three independent biological materials with one dyeswap were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL10081 CCG-UNAM Rhizobium etli CFN42 6051 v1.0
