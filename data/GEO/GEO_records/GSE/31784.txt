TITLE
Expression changes in Yy1 knock down mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have determined the global gene expression upon loss of function of the Yy1 transcription factor in mouse embryonic stem cells

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from ES cells transiently transfected with yy1-specific or scrampled-control siRNA oligos 48 hr post-transfection.

PLATFORM
