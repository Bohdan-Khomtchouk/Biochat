TITLE
Whole Genome Microarray Analysis of the OmcF-deficient Mutant

ORGANISM
Geobacter sulfurreducens

SUMMARY
OmcF is a monoheme c-type cytochrome in Geobacter sulfurreducens.  An OmcF-deficient mutant is impaired in iron reduction and electricity production.  Heme staining revealed altered expression of several c-type cytochromes in the OmcF-deficient mutant.  Whole genome DNA microarray analysis was performed in order to determine which genes demonstrate altered expression in the OmcF-deficient mutant compared to wildtype. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
RNA samples from three biological replicates were hybridized in duplicate on 12K Combimatrix sense-detecting arrays.  The experiment (omcF mutant) was labeled with Cy5, the control (wildtype) was labeled with Cy3.
