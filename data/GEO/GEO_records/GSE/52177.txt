TITLE
Endogenous small-noncoding RNAs and their roles in cold response and stress acclimation in Cassava

ORGANISM
Manihot esculenta ; Ricinus communis

SUMMARY
Small noncoding RNA (sncRNA), including microRNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous small-interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) are key gene regulators in eukaryotes, playing critical roles in plant development and stress tolerance. Trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs), which are secondary siRNAs triggered by miRNAs, and siRNAs from natural antisense transcripts (nat-siRNAs) are two well-studied classes of endo-siRNAs. In order to understand sncRNAsâ€™ roles in plant cold response and stress acclimation, we studied miRNAs and endo-siRNAs in Cassava (Manihot esculenta), a major source of food for the world populations in tropical regions. Combining Next-Generation sequencing and computational and experimental analyses, we profiled and characterized sncRNA species and mRNA genes from the plants that experienced severe and moderate cold stresses, that underwent further severe cold stress after cold acclimation at moderate stress, and that grew under the normal condition. We also included Castor bean (Ricinus communis) to understand conservation of sncRNAs. In addition to known miRNAs, we identified dozens of novel miRNAs as well as ta-siRNA-yielding and nat-siRNA-yielding loci in Cassava and Castor bean, respectively. Among the expressed sncRNAs, many sncRNAs were differentially expressed under cold stresses. Our study provided the results on gene regulation by sncRNAs in cold acclimation of Euphorbiaceous plants and the role of sncRNA-mediated pathways affected by cold stress and stress acclimation in Cassava.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA populations in Cassava cultivar SC124 under the normal condition (NC), gradual cold acclimation (CA), cold shock (CS) and stress acclimation Cold stress after cold acclimation (CCA).
