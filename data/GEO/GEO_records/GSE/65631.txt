TITLE
Expression data from four stage of hUC-MSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
hUC-MSCs exhibit the biological characteristics and potential for neural differentiation.The different gene involved in the neural differentiation were not clear. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during the process of neural differentiation.

DESIGN
Human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells were induced in vitro, RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays were performed on the cells at successive four stages. We sought to obtain the gene expresssion pattern in the four stage of hUC-MSCs.
