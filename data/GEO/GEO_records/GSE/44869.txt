TITLE
Genome-scale methylation changes induced by photoperiods in Nasonia vitripennis

ORGANISM
Nasonia vitripennis

SUMMARY
Seasonal photoperiodic changes have strong impact on development in Nasonia vitripennis. Here, Using high-throughput Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps of female wasps maintained in long vs short day. We have identified differential methylated loci that encode the photoperiodic change.

DESIGN
