TITLE
Expression data from glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) and astrocyte co-cultured GSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
consequences of astrocytes on GSCs, gene expression profiles generated from glioblastoma stem-like cells grown alone (mono-culture) and compared to those generated 48h after the initiation of co-culture with astrocytes We used microarrays show that astrocytes are capable to modify via a paracrine mechanism  GSC gene expression and thus phenotype.

DESIGN
GSCs were seeded into 6-wellplates  with astrocytes onto the corresponding trans-well inserts.  Co-cultures were initiated by combining the inserts and the 6-well plates; 48h later RNA was collected from GSCs.  RNA was collected from three biological replicates was processed and subjected to microarray analysis on Human Genome U133A 2.0 chips.
