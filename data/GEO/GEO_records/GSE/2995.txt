TITLE
S. fradiae WT and KOS155-3C R5/No Glucose 02/09/03

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
RNA timecourse data for Streptomyces fradiae wildtype (ATCC19609) and overproducing strain KOS155-3C(RUS).  Strains were grown at 30 C in shake flask cultures in R5 medium with no glucose.  RNA samples were harvested over 5 days as tylosin was produced.  12 h RNA samples of each strain were used as the reference sample(green) within their respective timecourses.  The WT gDNA vs. 12 h RNA control displays relative gene expression at the beginning of the timecourse.  The 12 h RNA control compares initial RNA levels between the WT and overproducer. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series. Keywords: time_series_design
