TITLE
Methylome study in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant methylation at the promoter region of tumor suppressors is frequently reported in NPC; however, genome-wide methylation changes have not been comprehensively investigated. Therefore, we systematically analyzed methylome data in 25 primary NPC tumors and non-tumor counterparts using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from 50 samples were hybridized to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Bisulphite pyrosequencing was used as an independent method to validate the BeadChip results.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
