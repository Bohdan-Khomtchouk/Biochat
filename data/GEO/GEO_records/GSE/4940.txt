TITLE
murine T-cells from wildtype and Gfi1 knockout mice activated by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 for 0 to 24h

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the transcriptomes of T-cells from Gfi1-knockout cells with wildtype cells, spleenocytes  from wildtype and Gfi-knockout C57Bl/6 mice were isolated using panT-cell kit  in an AutoMACS device (Miltenyi). Cells were cultured with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies (2 Âµg antibody/ml) for the indicated time period. Total RNAs was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis on Affymetrix MOE430A_2.0 arrays. Keywords: time course, wt and Gfi1 knockout

DESIGN
8 samples, 1 replicate per group

PLATFORM
GPL339 [MOE430A] Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430A Array
