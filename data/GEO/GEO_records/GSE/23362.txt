TITLE
Genes regulated by SDC1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips to compare the transcriptome of MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with SDC1-siRNA against negative control siRNA-transfected cells.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with SDC1-siRNA or negative control siRNA. Subsequently, total RNA was collected and processed for analysis using Affymetrix microarrays. Three independent replicates were prepared for each comparison group.
