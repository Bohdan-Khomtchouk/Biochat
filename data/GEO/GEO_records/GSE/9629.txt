TITLE
Comparison of normal and beta catenin deficient kidney gene expression profiles at E12.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated a murine genetic model of beta-catenin deficiency targeted to the ureteric bud cell lineage to study the role of beta-catenin mediated Wnt signaling during ureteric morphogenesis. Keywords: mutation
