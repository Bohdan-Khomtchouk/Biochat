TITLE
Comparison of normal and beta catenin deficient kidney gene expression profiles at E12.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated a murine genetic model of beta-catenin deficiency targeted to the ureteric bud cell lineage to study the role of beta-catenin mediated Wnt signaling during ureteric morphogenesis. Keywords: mutation

DESIGN
A comparison was made between triplicate samples of E12.5 kidneys from either normal mice or mice with a b-catenin allele containing LoxP sites flanking exons 2 through 6 crossed to Hoxb7-Cre:Gfp mice
