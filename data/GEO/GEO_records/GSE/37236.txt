TITLE
Gene expression analysis of murine SAMHD1 deficient peritoneal macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate responses of myeloid cells to SAMHD1 deficiency in the absence of exogenous viral infection, we performed global gene expression analysis of SAMHD1 deficient macrophages.

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from nine mutants and nine controls were FACS sorted. Cells from three animals were pooled to yield three poolls per group. RNA from these pools was subjected to next generation mRNA sequencing
