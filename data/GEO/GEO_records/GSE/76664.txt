TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in human malignant rhabdoid cells following prolonged treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Panobinostat

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that prolonged treatment of malignant rhabdoid tumor cells with low-dose HDACi will drive cellular differentiation. We assessed changes in gene expression following 21 days treatment with the HDACi, Panobinostat, versus a DMSO vehcile control in three human MRT cell lines.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from three human malignant rhabdoid tumor cell lines (G401, SJSC, STM91-01) cultured for 21 days in the presence of low-dose Panobinostat was compared to 21-day treated DMSO control cells. All treatments and cell lines were performed in triplicate.
