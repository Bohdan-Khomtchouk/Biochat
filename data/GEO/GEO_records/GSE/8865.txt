TITLE
Overlapped gene expression alterations in heavy metals- and carcinogen-exposed human hepatoma (Hep G2) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
From the result of comparative the gene expression analyses of human hepatoma cell line, HepG2 following exposures of three heavy metals; arsenic, cadmium and nickel and three carcinogens; N-dimethylnitrosoamine (DMN), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and tetrachloroethylene (TCE),  31-55% of the genes altered by As, Cd and Ni exposure were overlapped with those by three model carcinogen exposures in our experiments.  In particular, three heavy metals shared certain characteristics with TPA and TCE in remarkable up-regulations of the genes associated with progression of cell cycle, which might play a central role in heavy metal carcinogenesis.  In addition, this characteristic of gene expressions alteration was counteracted by intracellular accumulation of vitamine C in As-exposed cells but not in Cd- and Ni-exposed cells.  These results suggest that the cell proliferative responses are caused by reactive oxygen species mainly in As exposure, while other mechanisms would be involved in these responses in Cd and Ni exposures.

DESIGN
In this study, we examined the gene expression alteration in human hepatoma cell line, HepG2 following exposures of three heavy metals; arsenic, cadmium and nickel and three carcinogens; N-dimethylnitrosoamine (DMN), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and tetrachloroethylene (TCE) using DNA microarray with 8795 human genes. Furthermore, we also performed the DNA microarray analyses for the heavy metal exposed-cells that were loaded with vitamine C beforehand to examine the effects of antioxidant molecule to heavy metal exposures.
