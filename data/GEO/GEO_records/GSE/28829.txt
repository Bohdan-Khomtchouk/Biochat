TITLE
Gene Expression in early and advanced atherosclerotic plaque from human carotid

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study is to identify genes and pathways involved in the progression of atherosclerotic plaques from early to advanced stage in humans.

DESIGN
Samples from atherosclerotic carotid artery segments, from early ((pathological) intimal thickening and intimal xanthoma) and from advanced (thin or thick fibrous cap atheroma) lesions, have been retrieved from the Maastricht Pathology Tissue Collection (MPTC). Tissue was obtained during autopsy (Dept of Pathology, Maastricht University Medical Centre). Collection, storage  in the Maastricht Pathology Tissue Collection (MPTC) and use of tissue and patient data were performed in agreement with the " Code for Proper Secondary Use of Human Tissue "
