TITLE
Type 1 interferon and pattern recognition receptor signaling following particulate matter inhalation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study utilized microarray technology as an exploratory search for mechanisms of systemic effects after welding fume inhalation.  In addition, the applicability of this methodological approach for determining specific exposure-induced responses was examined.

DESIGN
C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to gas metal arc-stainless steel (GMA-SS) welding fume by inhalation for 10 days (3 hours/day) at 40 mg/m3. Microarray analysis was done on lung, blood and aorta from n=4 mice exposed to welding fume or air (control).
