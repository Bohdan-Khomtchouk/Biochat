TITLE
DNA methylation, RNA Pol2 binding and H3-K4me2 of human promoters in WI38 primary fibroblasts and sperm cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insights into the function of DNA methylation at cis-regulatory regions and its impact on gene expression, we measured methylation, RNA polymerase II and histone modifications at 24.000 promoters in primary human soma and germline cells. Keywords: DNA methylation, MeDIP

DESIGN
The chosen array from NIMBLEGEN (HG17_min_promoter array) represents 24134 putative human promoters, each covered by 15 oligonucleotides spanning 1.3 kb upstream and 0.2 kb downstream of the transcription start site. All experiments have been repeated two or three times, including one dye-swop.
