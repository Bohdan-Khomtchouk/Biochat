TITLE
Expression data from mouse E14.5 fetal liver SLAM LSKs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine genes in FL HSCs that are sensitive to Notch signagling, E14.5 FL cells were cultured on DL1( to stimulate Notch signaling). Cells were cultured in the presence of DMSO (vehicle control)  or gamma secretase inhibitor (1uM)  for 4 hrs or 10hrs. Gamma secretase inhibitor was used to inhibit Notch signaling. SLAM-LSKs were sorted and used for RNA preparation.

DESIGN
7 biological replicates (14 totalt samples) were collected for cells cultured for 4hrs. 4 biological replicates (8 total samples) were collected from cells cultured for 10hrs. Each replicate consisted of a DMSO and GSI treated sample
