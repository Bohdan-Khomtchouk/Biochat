TITLE
Akt signalling leads to stem cell activation and promotes tumour development in epidermis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A permantly active form of the oncogene Akt was expressed in the keratinocytes of the basal proliferative layer of the epidermis. Stem cells of the hair follicle expressing the cell surface marker CD34 were isolated. RNA form the CD34(+) and CD34(-) keratinocytes was extracted and and hybridized to Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Affymetrix arrays.

DESIGN
Gene expression was compared between CD34(+) hair follicle stem cells and CD34(-) cells isolates from the back skin of K5-myrAkt transgenic mice.
