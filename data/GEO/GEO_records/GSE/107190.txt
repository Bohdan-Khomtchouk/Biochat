TITLE
The germline-specific factor OEF-1 facilitates coordinated progression through germ cell development in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
How germ cells faithfully pass genetic material to the next generation despite undergoing several developmental transitions during maturation is poorly understood. Here we identify a novel factor in C. elegans, OEF-1, that is highly germline-specific, with early expression in the embryonic germ lineage and differential expression in larvae and adults depending on the gametogenesis program. OEF-1 is nuclear and associates with autosomal germline-expressed genes. Loss of OEF-1 triggers accelerated germ cell progression, leading to defects at multiple points during germline development. Thus OEF-1 may act to coordinate the timely progression of germ cells through proliferation, meiotic entry, and gametogenesis.

DESIGN
This data submission includes a single ChIP-seq sample for one factor called OEF-1 in C. elegans. These samples were done in replicate, with input, yielding three sequence files per sample (two replicates, and one input fasta file). In addition, we are submitting two wig files for the dataset, consisting of one normalized wig file for the combined duplicate IP and one normalized wig file for the input sequence.
