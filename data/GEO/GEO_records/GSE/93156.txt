TITLE
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma cell line with Acquired Resistance to PI3Kδ Inhibitor Idelalisib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNAseq profile of TMD8 cell lines resistant to Idelalisib treatment.  Idelalisib resistant TMD8 cells were generated by continuous passage in the presence of 1 μM idelalisib for 8 weeks until stable resistance to idelalisib was established. Parallel cultures were grown in the presence of 0.1% DMSO as passage-matched, drug-sensitive control lines. Sensitive and resistant TMD8 cells were clonally isolated through two rounds of single cell limiting dilution

DESIGN
8 Idela-resistant TMD8 clones were evaluated and compared to 3 passage-matched idela-sensitive TMD8 clones

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
