TITLE
Bioinformatics approaches for viral metagenomics in plants using short RNAs : model case of study and application to a Cicer arietinum population

ORGANISM
Cicer arietinum

SUMMARY
Size fractionated small RNA from total RNA extracts of Cicer arietinum leaves and from Nicotiana benthamiana infected by Cymbidium ringspot virus were mixed in a ratio of 1000 to 1 in amount, respectively.  The RNA was  ligated to adapters, purified again and reverse transcribed. After PCR amplification the sample was subjected to Illumina high throughput pyrosequencing. The kit used is TrueSeq Small RNA kit Please see www.illumina.com for details of the sequencing technology.

DESIGN
Short RNA fractionation and characterization

PLATFORM
GPL19428 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Cicer arietinum)
