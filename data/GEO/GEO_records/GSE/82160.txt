TITLE
FAS signalling in retroviral neuroinflammation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We comprehensively explored Fas expression (protein and mRNA) and function in lymphocyte activation, apoptosis, proliferation and transcriptome, using flow cytometry, [3H]-thymidine incorporation and microarray analysis in PBMC from HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients.

DESIGN
A systems analysis of HAM/TSP in vitro gene expression showed that triggering Fas receptor with agonist (but not antagonist) antibody, induces a specific gene set with a central role for NFKB pro-survival signaling (n=3). In addition, ex vivo transcripts significantly correlated to FAS mRNA levels are enriched in proliferative but not apoptotic pathways in HAM/TSP patients (n=6).
