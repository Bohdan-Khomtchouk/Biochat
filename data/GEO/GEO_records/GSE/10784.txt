TITLE
Gene profile data from Df(16)A/+ and wild type littermates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This represents an unbiased evaluation of the transcriptional response in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus areas in the Df(16)A/+ mice, a mouse model of human 22q11 microdeletion syndrome. These mice were generated by chromosomal engineering and carry a microdeltion of ~1.3Mb in the mouse locus syntenic to the human 22q11.1 The reasoning behind this expression profiling is that alterations in transcriptional programs reflect either downstream (immediate or remote) effects of the deficiency or reactive (compensatory) changes, and can thus point to affected biological processes and molecular functions. Keywords: disease state analysis, genetic modification

DESIGN
A total of 20 PFC and 20 HPC from 10 Df(16)A/+ mutants and 10 WT control mice was used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. All mice were male littermates 8 weeks of age.
