TITLE
Expression data from adult wild-type male Drosophila melanogaster fed control or high-sugar diets

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chronic high-sugar feeding (1 M or 34% sucrose) leads to hyperglycemia, obesity, and insulin resistance in adult flies, compared with those fed a control diet (0.15 M or 5% sucrose). We compared two days and four weeks of high-sugar feeding to look at short- and long- term effects on gene expression. We used Affymetrix Drosophila GeneChip 2.0 microarrays to quantify differential expression between control and high-sugar-fed flies at two time points.

DESIGN
Young adult (3-5 day old) Canton-S genotype D. melanogaster males were fed control or high-sugar diets for two days or 4 weeks. Animals were sacrificed and homogenized on ice, RNA extracted, then cDNA labeled and hybridized by Washington University's Genome Technology Access Center to produce .cel files. dChip (2006 version) was used to extract probeset intensites and to normalize using the precise match/mismatch algorithm.
