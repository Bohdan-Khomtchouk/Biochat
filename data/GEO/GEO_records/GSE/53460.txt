TITLE
Nucleosome density map during B-cell to Macrophage lineage switching

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using homogenous populations of cells undergoing lineage switching we studied enhancer nucleation related to nucleosme organization.

DESIGN
Examination of nucleosome densities by using Mnase-seq at several time points after induction of lineage switching

PLATFORM
