TITLE
Neutrophils play a key role in schistosome-induced hepatic granuloma formation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The severity of schistosome egg-induced hepatic granulomatous pathology depends markedly on the nature of the mammalian host immune response. The local cellular and molecular mechanisms that co-ordinate hepatic granuloma formation during schistosome infection are still poorly understood. We used a combination of laser microdissection microscopy and microarray analysis to further our understanding of fibrogenesis and granuloma formation in C57BL/6 mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum. We compared hepatic gene expression profiles in histologically distinct zones both within, and directly proximal to, granulomas during the course of their development.

DESIGN
Defined zones of granulomas develop in the murine liver infected by Schistosoma japonicum over a period of 4, 6 and 7 weeks post infection were microdissected, and subjected to total RNA isolation and gene expression analysis. Microarray analysis of this study was performed using samples derived from 2 individual mice per group/time-point.
