TITLE
Evaluation of three different fluorescent dyes for cDNA labeling in microarrays

SUMMARY
The simultaneous measurement of gene expression for thousands of genes in a single analysis by the microarray technology allows researchers to describe transcriptomes in various samples of interest. Problems with variation in data quality derived from microarray experiments are well known and might result from poor RNA quality, background problems, or sub optimal signal strength. To assess variation due to the fluorescent dye chosen, three different dye pairs were tested for labelling of cDNA in gene expression analysis experiments on a porcine immune focused oligonucleotide microarray (POM3). This in-house oligonucleotide microarray allowed a direct comparison of background fluorescence, Median signal intensities, numbers of spots detected, and resistance to photobleaching between different dye pairs. We tested Alexa Flour 546/647, Cy3/Cy5 as well as Oyster 550/650 all from Genisphere Inc., Hatfield, PA, USA. Keywords: Comparison of fluorescent dyes
