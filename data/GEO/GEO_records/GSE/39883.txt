TITLE
Expression data from AML1-ETO (AE)-expressing murine bone marrow (BM) cells treated with retinoids

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
AE-expressing murine BM cells treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in semi-solid methycellulose-based cultures show an increase in self-renewal capacity whilst treatment with a specific RARa agonist NRX195183 reduces their clonogenicity. Gene expression analysis was performed to further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations. Upregulated gene sets were identified in the ATRA-treated AE BM cells.

DESIGN
3 C57Bl/6 AML1-ETO-stop/+/Mx-Cre+ mice (#D203, 218 and 220) were treated with polyI:C to excise the stop codon allowing AML1-ETO expression. 2-4 weeks following completion of polyI:C administration, mice were euthanised and BM cells harvested. BM cells were cultured in semi-solid methylcellulose assays with cytokines for 2 weeks; then cells were harvested, pooled and replated in suspension cultures containing cytokines and the respective treatments - DMSO (control), ATRA and the specific RARa agonist NRX195183. At the 8 hour (8H) and 24 hour (24H) timepoints, cells were harvested for RNA extraction and processing.
