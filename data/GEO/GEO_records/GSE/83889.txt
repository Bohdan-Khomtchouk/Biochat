TITLE
Prognosis of Stage III Colorectal Carcinomas with FOLFOX Adjuvant Chemotherapy can be Predicted by Molecular Subtype

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison the mRNA expression profiles of 101 CRC tissues to those from matched 35 non-neoplastic colon mucosal tissues from patients with stage III CRCs treated with FOLFOX adjuvant chemotherapy in each molecular subtype. Gene expressionâ€“based subtyping is widely accepted as a relevant source of disease stratification. Results provide important information of molecular marker genes for molecular classification.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated 101 colorectal cancer tissues and theose from matched 35 non-neoplastic colon mucosal tissues.

PLATFORM
