TITLE
Gene expression signature and the prediction of recurrence in stage III colorectal cancer by DNA microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were taken from colorectal cancers in surgically resected specimens in 36 colorectal cancer patients. The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Comparison between the sample groups allow to identify a set of discriminating genes that can be used for molecular markers for predicting recurrence. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
Thirty-six colorectal cancer patients who had undergone surgical resection of colorectal cancer were studied. In all patients, curative resection was performed and no patients had any distant metastasis at the time of operation (stage III patients). Among the 36 patients, 23 patients did not develop recurrence. On the other hand, 13 patients developed rucurrence such as liver metastases, lung metastases and distant lymph node metastases. The median follow up period was 4.5 years.
