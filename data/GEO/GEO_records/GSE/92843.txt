TITLE
Genome-wide DNA-methylation profiles of human lung cancer cell lines and normal lung cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA-methylation profiles of human lung cancer cell lines and normal lung cells were generated by Infinium bead chip technology DNA methylation patterns of over 480,000 CpG sites were analyzed in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEC) and three non small cell lung cancer cell lines (NSCLC: A427, A549 and H322) using bisulfite-based Illumina 450K BeadChip arrays

DESIGN
Three lung cancer cell lines (A549, A427 and H322), normal bronchial ephitelial cells (NHBEC)
