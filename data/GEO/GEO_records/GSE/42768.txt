TITLE
Colonic gene expression data of acute and chronic dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) colitis mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The lack of suitable animal models reflecting chronically relapsing inflammation and tissue remodeling have hindered fibrosis research in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This study investigated changes in connective tissue in a chronic murine model using different cycles of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) to mimic the relapsing nature of the disease. We used whole gene expression arrays to study differences in colonic gene expression levels between acute and more chronic DSS colitis,

DESIGN
Acute and chronic relapsing colonic inflammation was induced in C57BL6 female mice using several cycles of exposure to DSS in drinking water, followed by recovery phases. Total RNA, extracted from snap frozen colon from five mice per condition was used to analyze mRNA expression via Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
