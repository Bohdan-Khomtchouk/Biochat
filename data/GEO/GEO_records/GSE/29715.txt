TITLE
mRNA expression data from mice infected with H. pylori treated with estradiol, tamoxifen, or placebo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We are investigating the mRNA expression profiles of gastric tissue within H. pylori-infected mice treated with estradiol, tamoxifen, or placebo We used microarrays to compare the global mRNA expression profiles in H. pylori infected mice in response to estradiol and tamoxifen

DESIGN
Male mice were infected with H. pylori. After 16 weeks of H.pylori infection, mice were treated with 17beta-estradiol, Tamoxifen or placebo pellets implated subcutaneously for 12 weeks.  At that point, longitudinal strips of gastric tissue were snap-frozen.  Tissue was later weighed and RNA extracted using Trizol and purified with RNeasy kit including DNase treatment.  9 samples with 3 groups (n= 3 per group, except Tamoxifen (n=2)).  Placebo samples are controls and were compared to estradiol or Tamoxifen treated samples.
