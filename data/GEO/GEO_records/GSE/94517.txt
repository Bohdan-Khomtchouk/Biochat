TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of reovirus-induced host responses in mesenteric lymph node, lamina propria, peyer's patches, and epithelium.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of reovirus-induced host responses at the level of gene expression. Results provide insights into how reovirus infection breaks tolerance to dietary antigens and promotes the development of celiac disease.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from mouse mesenteric lymph node, lamina propria, peyer's patches, or epithelium subjected to 6 or 48 hours stimulation with Reoviruses T1L or T3D-RV compared to Sham.
