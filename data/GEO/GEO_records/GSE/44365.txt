TITLE
Epididymosomes convey different repertoires of miRNAs throughout the epididymis

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Epididymosomes are small membrane vesicles (50-500nm) secreted by epididymal epithelial cells and involved in post-testicular sperm maturation. While their role in protein transfer to the sperm membrane is well acknowledged, we unveil here their capacity to vehicle microRNAs (miRNAs), which are potent regulators of post-transcriptional gene expression. Using a global microarray approach, we showed that epididymosomes providing from two discrete bovine epididymal regions (caput and cauda) possess distinct miRNA signatures. In addition, we established that miRNA repertoires contained in epididymosomes differ from those of their parent epithelial cells, suggesting that miRNA populations released from the cells may be selectively sorted. Binding of DilC12-labeled epididymosomes to primary cultured epididymal cells was measured by flow cytometry and indicated that epididymosomes from the median caput and their miRNA content may be incorporated into distal caput epithelial cells. Overall, these findings reveal that distinct miRNA repertoires are released into the intraluminal fluid in a region-specific manner and could be involved in a novel mechanism of intercellular communication throughout the epididymis via epididymosomes.

DESIGN
We determined the miRNA profiles of epididymosomes isolated by perfusion from caput and cauda regions of the epididymis and compared it with the miRNA content of epididymal epithelial cells from the same regions.
