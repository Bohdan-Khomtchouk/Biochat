TITLE
Effect of Notch signal inhibition on chicken neural retina in spreading culture

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We investigated the effect of Notch signal inhibition on the embryonic E8 neural retina cells concerning expression of various regulatory genes.

DESIGN
E8 neural retina cultures were treated with DAPT (Notch signal inhibitor) or DMSO (solvent control) from day 2 to day 12 of culturing, and each duplicate samples were analyzed.
