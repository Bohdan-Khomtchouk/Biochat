TITLE
DNA microarrays time course of a MaF pre-iPSC clone (C9) untreated or treated with Vc

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Treatment with vitamin C (Vc) on MaF pre-induced pluripotent stem cells (pre-iPSCs) induced a rapid conversion into full-iPSCs within a few passages. We used microarrays to identify changes induced by Vc in the MaF pre-iPSC clone.

DESIGN
MaF pre-iPSCs were cultured in mESC medium with or without Vc. TRIZOL cell lysates were prepared from D3, D4, D5 and D6 of Vc treated or untreated cells.
