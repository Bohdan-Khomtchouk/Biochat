TITLE
Transcriptional Profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Replicating in Human Type II Alveolar Epithelial A549 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) is initiated when an aerosol droplet carrying a few bacilli is inhaled into an alveolus. Alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) (type II and type I) are among the first cells encountered by the infecting bacteria and greatly outnumber macrophages in the alveolus. M. tb replicates dramatically ( > 20,000 fold) in a “non-migrating” compartment in the lung prior to the development of the cell-mediated immune response in aerosol-infected mice (Wolf AJ, 2008).  M. tb DNA has been found in type II AEC in autopsied lung tissue of latently infected individuals (Hernandez-Pando R et. al, 2000; Barrios-Payan J et. al 2012), and M. tb-infected AEC in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and in sputum samples from TB patients indicates the infection of these cells in active as well as latent human TB (Eum SY et. al, 2010).  M. tb has been shown to infect and replicate in the human type II AEC line, A549, and passaging of M. tb through A549 increases M. tb invasiveness (Bermudez LE et.al, 2002).  In this work, we have used DNA microarray analysis to investigate the transcriptome of M. tb replicating in type II AEC (A549) compared to M. tb grown logarithmically in Middlebrook 7H9 broth media in order to identify M. tb adaptations to this intracellular environment as well as M. tb mechanisms/factors contributing to M. tb replication and increased invasiveness in primary infection.

DESIGN
The global gene expression of M. tb H37Rv replicating in A549 cells at 72 hr was compared to that of M. tb grown to log phase in Middlebrook 7H9 media.
