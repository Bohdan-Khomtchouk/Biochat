TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human monocytes and monocyte-derived-macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we analyzed the gene expression profiles of human monocytes and monocyte-dervied-macrophages. Keywords: Gene expression profiling

DESIGN
Blood samples were obtained from 86 patients with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome who had undergone coronary angiography at the department of cardiology of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris and who had on stenosis > 50 % diagnosed in at least one major coronary artery. 48 monocyte and 48 macrophage samples (38 pools of 2 samples and 10 individual samples for each type of RNA) were hybridized to the RNG/MRC platform.
