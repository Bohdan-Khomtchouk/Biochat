TITLE
Expression data from early Arabidopsis thaliana embryo

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
After zygote division, the resulting daughter cells progressively give rise to two very different tissue types. With the use of microarrays, global nuclear expression profiles were generated.

DESIGN
Tissue-specific marker lines were used to isolate nuclei from early Arabidopsis embryos by flow cytometry. Additionally, cellular RNA from intact whole embryos was extracted. Subsequently, extracted RNA was biotinylated and  hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 chips.
