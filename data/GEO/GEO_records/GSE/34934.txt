TITLE
Expression data from BDC2.5 TCR Tg, preselected Rag-/-.B6 and Rag-/-.NOD.H2b thymocytes upon antigenic stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of NOD genetic vatiation on thymic negative selection transcriptional programs.

DESIGN
Pre-selected BDC2.5 TCR Tg DP thymocytes from non-selecting B6 and NOD.H2b backgrounds were purified (Dynal CD8 FlowComp), mixed in a 1:1 ratio and stimulated with BDC mimotope-loaded TCRa-/-/NOD splenocytes for indicated periods of time and double sorted by FACS as Thy1.2+Dump-CD4+CD8+; Dump includes CD19, Gr1, CD11b, CD11c, CD49b. Following cell sorting into trizol, RNA was purified, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays. experiment type: unstimulated versus stimulated BDC/B6.Rag-/- and BDC/NOD.H2b.Rag-/- DP thymocytes
