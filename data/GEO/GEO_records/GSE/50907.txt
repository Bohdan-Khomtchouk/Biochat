TITLE
fourSig: A Method for Determining Chromosomal Interactions in 4C-Seq Data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ability to correlate chromosome conformation and gene expression gives a great deal of information regarding the strategies used by a cell to properly regulate gene activity. 4C-seq is a relatively new and increasingly popular technology where the set of genomic interactions generated by a single point in the genome can be determined.  4C-seq experiments generate large, complicated datasets and it is imperative that signal is properly distinguished from noise.  Currently there are a limited number of methods for analyzing 4C-seq data.  Here, we present a new method, fourSig, which, in addition to being simple to use and as precise as current methods, also includes a new feature to prioritize significantly enriched interactions and predict their reproducibility among experimental replicates.  Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of fourSig with previously published and novel 4C-seq datasets and show that our significance prioritization correlates with the ability to reproducibly detect interactions amongst replicates.  The datasets provided include those generated from allele-specific 4C-Seq with a viewpoint of the TSS for the gene Ibtk on mouse Chromosome 9.  FASTQ files, text files containing genomic coordiantes and read counts, and bedGraph formats for UCSC Genome Browser tracks are provided.  All sequences were mapped relative to mouse genome build mm9.

DESIGN
Sequencing of circular chromosome conformation capture (4C-Seq) was performed at the transcription start site (TSS) for the gene Ibtk for three replicates in F1 hybrid mouse trophoblast stem (TS) cells.  Experiment was designed to detect allele specific patterns using SNP differences between the inbred lines mated to produce the TS cells (C57Bl/6 and CAST/EiJ)
