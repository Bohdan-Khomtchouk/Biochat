TITLE
compare of microRNA expression between IA and MMA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To exploring the difference of microRNA expression between IA and MMA, we have employed microRNA array expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes between the IA and MMA. Futher functional analyses were performed based on the data.

DESIGN
3 IA and 3 MMA were used for the microarray.
