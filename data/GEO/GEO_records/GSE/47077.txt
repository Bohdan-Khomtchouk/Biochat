TITLE
Multi-region copy-number analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) foster tumour adaptation and hamper the efficiency of personalised medicine approaches. We investigated the extent of ITH within individual clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) by multi-region sampling and copy number analysis. We analyzed 63 tumour regions and 8 normal samples from eight clear cell renal cell carcinomas using Affymetrix SNP6 arrays.

DESIGN
All individual tumours were subjected to multi-region sampling and copy-number analysis using Affymetrix SNP6 arrays.
