TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of AR binding and comparison with transcript expression in primary human fetal prostate fibroblasts and cancer associated fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied ChIPseq to identify genomic AR binding sites for the first timeÂ in primary human fetal prostate fibroblasts and patient derived cancer associated fibroblasts, as well as the WPMY1 cell line overexpressing AR. We identified AR binding sites that were specific to fetal prostate fibroblasts (7534), cancer fibroblasts (629), WPMY1-AR (2561) as well as those common among all (783). Primary fibroblasts had a distinct AR binding profile versus prostate cancer cell lines and tissue, and showed a localisation to gene promoter binding sites 1kb upstream of the transcriptional start site, as well as non-classical AR binding sequence motifs. We used RNAseq to define transcribed genes associated with AR binding sites and derived cistromes for embryonic and cancer fibroblasts as well as a cistrome common to both. These were compared to several in vivo ChIPseq and transcript expression datasets; which identified subsets of AR targets that were expressed in vivo and regulated by androgens in order to define for the first time which cellular subpopulations might be the true source of AR-associated signals.
