TITLE
Gene expression changes in gastric epithelial cells induced by Helicobacter pylori infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This group is focusing on the molecular mechanisms of the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates and carbohydrate ligands important in the process of gastric carcinogenesis and on gastric carcinoma progression and metastasis. The adhesion of H. pylori to epithelial cells induces a variety of modifications, including changes in cell morphology,cytokine production and release, alterations in glycosylation and in the biosynthesis of mucins. This study aims to identify the gene expression changes in the gastric epithelial cells (AGS) induced by Helicobacter pylori infection. This experiment was performed as previously described in the literature by submitting a gastric cell line to co-culture with reference strains of H. pylori.

DESIGN
The following RNA samples (in triplicate) were analyzed by hybridization to the GLYCOv2 array: 1)Gastric cell line co-culture with H. pylori strain A(High Patogenicity) 2)Gastric cell line co-culture with H. pylori strain B(Low Patogenicity) 3)Gastric cell line without H. pylori co-culture (control)
