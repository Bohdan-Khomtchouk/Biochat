TITLE
Mouse Dbh-/- vs. Dbh+/+ E10.5 hearts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genomic microarray analysis of adrenergic-deficient (Dbh-/-) vs. wild-type control (Dbh+/+) mouse heart expression at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5).

DESIGN
Four Dbh-/- and four Dbh+/+ E10.5 hearts were isolated, and RNA was extracted from each for genomic microarray analysis using Affymetrix 430A 2.0 arrays.  The biological samples were collected and prepared in Dr. Ebert's laboratory at the Univ of Central Florida in Orlando, FL.  The RNA samples were sent to GeneLogic (Gaithersburg, MD) for the microarray analysis.
