TITLE
LMO1 Synergizes with MYCN to Promotes Neuroblastoma Initiation and Metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High levels of LMO1 expression synergizes with MYCN to accelerate neuroblastomagenesis, enhance disease penetrance and promote widespread metastasis in zebrafish. Transcriptomic analysis of human neuroblasotma cells with programed expression of LMO1 vs vector control or neuroblastoma cells with differential endogenous LMO1 expression revealed that gene signitures affecting tumor cell-extracellular matrix interaction are significantly associated with high levels of LMO1 expression. Our findings provide compelling evidence for a major pathogenic role of LMO1 in MYCN-driven neuroblastoma.
