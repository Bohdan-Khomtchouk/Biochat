TITLE
Molecular alterations in bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) derived from acute myeloid leukemia patients (AML)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide methylation profiling of BM-MSC derived from AML patients in comparison to healthy donor controls using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip

DESIGN
bisulfit converted genomic DNA extracted from BM-MSC samples (AML n=32) and healthy donor controls  (n=12) were hybridized onto an Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip

PLATFORM
