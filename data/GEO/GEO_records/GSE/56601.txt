TITLE
WGBS data of pediatric B-cell acute leukemias

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated DNA methylomes of 227 pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs) using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and high-definition microarrays, along with RNA expression profiles. The current study identified a link between DNA methylome of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs) and embryonic stem cell (ESC) bivalency, through which tumor cells can mimic the pluripotency of ESCs.

DESIGN
A total of 231 pediatric patients with B-ALL were utilized from the California Childhood Cancer Study. After informed consent, bone marrow specimens packed with leukemic blasts were obtained in each patient. Expression and methylation data of purified Pre-B cells in four developmental stages were retrieved from our previous study (Lee et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2012).
