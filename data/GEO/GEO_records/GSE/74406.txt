TITLE
Single-cell RNA-seq transcriptome profiling of Prdm1+ lineages in E9.5 mouse placenta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our goal was to transcriptionally profile Prdm1+ cell lineages of maternal and embryonic origin in mid-gestation mouse placenta in order to study vascular mimicry and additional processes in the placenta.

DESIGN
Profiling of 61 single cells and 17 clusters of 2 or 3 cells chosen based on expression of Prdm1, a paternally inherited Prdm1-Venus fluorescent reporter, progenitor trophoblast marker Gjb3 and spiral artery trophoblast giant cell marker Prl7b1.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
