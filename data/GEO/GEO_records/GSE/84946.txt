TITLE
Co-assembly of stranded and unstranded RNA-seq data improves coding and noncoding transcriptome maps

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We want to develop transcriptome assembly pipeline that significantly improves the quality of the assemblies constructed using stranded and/or unstranded RNA-seq data.

DESIGN
Transcriptome of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) were assembled using stranded and unstranded library generated by Illumina HiSeq 2000
