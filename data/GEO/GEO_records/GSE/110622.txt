TITLE
PTEN Deficiency Promotes Pathological Vascular Remodeling of Human Coronary Arteries

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of Rat aortic smooth muscle clonal isolates of PTEN knock-down and control wild-type. We used Affymetrix microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression changes between PTEN deficient and wild type smooth muscle cells.  We identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Infection of Rat VSMC's with retroviral shRNA specific to PTEN or non-targeting control in order to compare the gene expression under basal, low serum, conditions.

PLATFORM
GPL6247 [RaGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
