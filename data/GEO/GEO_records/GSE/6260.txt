TITLE
Erythroid progenitors stimulated with EPO

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD34+ progenitors were isolated from the bone marrow of three healthy volunteers. CD34+CD71+CD45RA- were FACS sorted to enrich for erythroid progenitors. The cells were cultured for four hours with or without EPO in combination with LY294002, and harvested for RNA extraction, amplification and expression analysis. A compound treatment design type is where the response to administration of a compound or chemical (including biological compounds such as hormones) is assayed.
