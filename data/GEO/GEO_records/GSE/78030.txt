TITLE
m6A RNA methylation promotes XIST-mediated transcriptional repression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
XIST is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that mediates transcriptional silencing of X chromosome genes. Here we show that XIST is highly methylated with at least 78 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) residues, a reversible base modification whose function in lncRNAs is unknown. We show that m6A formation in XIST, as well as cellular mRNAs, is mediated by RBM15 and its paralog RBM15B, which bind the m6A-methylation complex and recruit it to specific sites in RNA. This results in methylation of adenosines in adjacent m6A consensus motifs. Furthermore, knockdown of RBM15 and RBM15B, or knockdown of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 impairs XIST-mediated gene silencing. A systematic comparison of m6A-binding proteins shows that YTHDC1 preferentially recognizes m6A in XIST and is required for XIST function. Additionally, artificial tethering of YTHDC1 to XIST rescues XIST-mediated silencing upon loss of m6A. These data reveal a pathway of m6A formation and recognition required for XIST-mediated transcriptional repression.

DESIGN
Three to four biological HEK293T replicates were used to perform iCLIP of endogenous YTH proteins, RBM15, and RBM15B. Crosslinking induced truncations were identified using CIMS-CITS pipeline.
