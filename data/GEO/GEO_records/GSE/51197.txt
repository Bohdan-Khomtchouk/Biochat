TITLE
Effect of different Two-component systems system deletion in S. aureus NCTC8325

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus NCTC 8325

SUMMARY
To analyze function of three Two-component systems SAOUHSC_00184-185, SAOUHSC_01313-1314, and SAOUHSC_01980-1981, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes transcription changed in respective mutant strains. Target TCSs were replaced by ermB gene.

DESIGN
Cells were grown to OD600=2.0, and the RNA level of wild type NCTC8325 and three TCSs mutant were compared.

PLATFORM
