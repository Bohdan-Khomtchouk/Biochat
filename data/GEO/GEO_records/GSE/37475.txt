TITLE
CSF-1R inhibition alters macrophage polarization and blocks gliomagenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, can be divided into several molecular subtypes including proneural GBM. Most clinical strategies aimed at directly targeting glioma cells in these tumors have failed. A promising alternative is to target stromal cells in the brain microenvironment, such as tumor-associated microglia and macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages are dependent upon colony stimulating factor (CSF)-1 for differentiation and survival; therefore, we used an inhibitor of its receptor, CSF-1R, to target macrophages in a mouse proneural GBM model. CSF-1R inhibition dramatically increased survival in mice and regressed established GBMs. Tumor cell apoptosis was significantly increased, and proliferation and tumor grade markedly decreased. Surprisingly, TAMs were not depleted in tumors treated with the CSF-1R inhibitor. Instead, analysis of gene expression in TAMs isolated from treated tumors revealed a decrease in alternatively activated/ M2 macrophage markers, consistent with impaired tumor-promoting functions. These gene signatures were also associated with better survival specifically in the proneural subtype of patient gliomas. Collectively, these results establish macrophages as valid therapeutic targets in proneural gliomas, and highlight the clinical potential for CSF-1R inhibitors in GBM.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from sorted tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) from murine gliomas following either 7 days of vehicle or BLZ945 treatment.  Samples were collected from 16 total tumor burdened mice, with 8 replicates for each treatment group. BLZ945: a Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor
