TITLE
Apolipoprotein E promotes invasion in oral squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression array  measurements for  9 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) stratified by worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) Jayakar et al. (2016). Apolipoprotein E promotes invasion in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Li et al. (2013). Validation of the risk model: high-risk classification and tumor pattern of invasion predict outcome for patients with low-stage oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.

DESIGN
Comparison of transcription profiles between OSCC tumors with a more invasive (WPOI 5) versus a less invasive (WPOI 3) pattern of invasion using two independent Illumina platforms.

PLATFORM
GPL8432 Illumina HumanRef-8 WG-DASL v3.0 GPL18461 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip [HumanHT-12_V3_0_R2_11283641_A]
