TITLE
Gene expression analysis of metastatic and non-metastatic osteosarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of two metastatic OS cell lines, KHOS and KRIB, and two non-metastatic OS cell lines, HOS and U2OS. Results show differences in gene expression between cell lines with different ability to metastasise in vivo.

DESIGN
Each of the four cell lines were analyzed in tripicate. Total RNA was extracted from each triplicate cell line culture with Trizol. cRNA was amplified using the Ambion Illumina Total Prep RNA Amplification Kit. Concentration was determined in NanoDrop and qulity checked in the Agilent Bioanalyzer, before hybridizing to Illumina HT-12 BeadChip Array.

PLATFORM
GPL6947 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip
