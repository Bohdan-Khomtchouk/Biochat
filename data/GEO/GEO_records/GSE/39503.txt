TITLE
mRNA expression data from lymph node tumors from IL10R2-/- patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were used to identify coordinately regulated gene sets and pathways actuvated in tumors occuring in IL10R2-/- patients.

DESIGN
Frozen tumor biopsies and paired peripheral blood from 2 children with IBD and 2 age-matched tonsil were obtained. Cases were ascertained at the Necker hospital. Sufficient RNA for hybridization to Affymetrix U133 plus 2 arrays was obtained on all cases.
