TITLE
A single-cell survey of the small intestinal epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the diversity of cellular states within mouse intestinal epithelial tissue, we obtained whole intestines from wild type mice, dissagregated the samples, sorted into single cells and profiled them by single-cell RNA-seq.

DESIGN
To understand normal tissue homeostasis, untreated cells were profiled, while to investiage the impact of enteric pathogens on epithelial cells, mice infected with both Salmonella Enterica and the parasitic worm H. polygyrus were profiled using both 3'-droplet-based and full length plate-based single-cell RNAseq. RANKL-mediated differentiation of organoid cultures were used to sequence the rare intestinal M cell, these were then compared to M cells obtained from the in vivo follicle associated epithelium (FAE).
