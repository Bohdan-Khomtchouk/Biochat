TITLE
Differences in the global transcriptome between high- and low-pathogenic Salmonella Enteritidis strains

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis

SUMMARY
We report the use of RNA-Seq technique to characterize differences in the global transcritome between multiple genetically similar but phenotypically diverse poultry-associated field strains of S. Enteritidis grown in laboratory media at avian body temperature (42Â°C).

DESIGN
Characterization and comparison of transcriptome of six S. Enteritidis strains previously identified as high-pathogenic (HP, n=3) and low-pathogenic (LP, n=3)
