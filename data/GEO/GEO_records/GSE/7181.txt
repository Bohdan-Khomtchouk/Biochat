TITLE
CD133+ and CD133- CSC lines in primary human GBM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We cultured tumor cells from 22 GBM under medium conditions favoring the growth of neural stem cells. 11 out of 15 primary GBM contained a significant CD133+ subpopulation that comprised cells showing all hallmarks of neural stem cells. Cell lines derived from these CD133+ GBM showed a neurosphere-like, non-adherent growth pattern. In contrast, 4 out of 15 cell lines derived from primary GBM grew adherent in vitro and were driven by CD133- tumor cells that fulfilled stem cell criteria. In vivo, these GBM were characterized by a significantly lower proliferation index but similar GFAP staining as compared to CD133+ GBM. Gene arrays from 2x3 representative cells lines are given. Keywords: Cancer stem cell, CD133, glioblastoma
