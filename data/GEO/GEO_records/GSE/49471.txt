TITLE
Gene expression in the mouse embryonic small intestinal epithelium in the presence or absence of GATA4 and GATA6

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression was compared between E18.5 Gata4Gata6 double conditional knockout (cKO) small intestinal epithelium and E18.5 control mouse small intestinal epithleium.

DESIGN
E18.5 mouse small intestine was collected from control and Gata4Gata6 double conditional knockout mice. Epithelial cells were isolated, and RNA was prepared.  Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 gene arrays were used to interrogate gene expression.  Data was analyzed using dChip software.
