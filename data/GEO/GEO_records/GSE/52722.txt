TITLE
Expression analysis of Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 Plac::CCNA_00382 (ccrM) vs Caulobacter crescentus

ORGANISM
Caulobacter crescentus NA1000

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a  Caulonacter crescentus NA1000 Plac::CCNA_00382 (ccrM) mutant, compared to the wild-type strain.  The mutations engineered into this strain cause the CcrM DNA methyltransferase to be overexpressed and the chromosome to be constitutively methylated at the adenine at GANTC motifs.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of Caulonacter crescentus NA1000 and three separate cultures of a triple mutant strain, Caulonacter crescentus NA1000 Plac::CCNA_00382 (ccrM), in which the ccrM gene coding for a DNA methyltransferase methylating the adenine in GANTC motifs is truncated and its product inactive.  Each chip measures the expression level of 3933 genes from Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 with 3 probes per gene and with three-fold technical redundancy.
