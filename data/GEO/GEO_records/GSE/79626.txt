TITLE
Ribosome footprinting of fly heads

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We applied ribosomal footprinting experiment followed by RNA-seq  in order to detect circular RNA associated with ribosomes in fly heads.

DESIGN
Ribosome profiling of Drosophila fly heads. Two samples were treated with low detergent buffer and the other two with high detergent buffer.
