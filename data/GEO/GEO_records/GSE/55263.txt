TITLE
Genome wide occupancy of Msgn1 in differentiating embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Msgn1 is a bHLH transcription factor and is a direct target gene of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway. During mouse embryogenesis, Msgn1 is expressed in the mesodermal compartment of the primitive streak and is required for the differentiation of presomitic mesoderm. Msgn1-/- mutants show defects in somitogenesis leading to a lack of trunk skeletal muscles, vertebra and ribs. The goal of this study is to dissect the molecular and cellular function of Msgn1 in Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) and mouse development. In order to identify direct Msgn1 targets, we performed transcriptional profiling and CHIP-seq of Msgn1 expressing differentiating ES cells. Integration of these data sets, we found that Msgn1 is a master regulator of PSM differentiation regulating gene expression programs of PSM identity, EMT, motility and Notch segmentation clock.

DESIGN
Inducible Flag Msgn1 ES cells were differentiated to form Embryoid bodies (EBs) for 2 days. Flag-Msgn1 was induced on day 2 with doxycycline and samples were collected 36h later. Here Input DNA is used as control.
