TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3K9me3 with tethered heterochromatin machinery

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study is to characterize the domain(s) of H3K9me3 induced by artifical localization of heterochromatin factors in wild-type and mutant backgrounds.

DESIGN
Methods: ChIP-seq was performed on each sample (H3K9me3 ChIP; six samples total). qRT-PCR validation was done with SYBR Green reagent.

PLATFORM
GPL23150 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Neurospora crassa)
