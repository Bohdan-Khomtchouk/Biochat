TITLE
Gene expression patterns define the hepatocyte-like cells derived by different strategies [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the active H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) histone marker in hiPSC-Heps and hiHeps.The genome-wide H3K27ac occupancy analysis exhibited different patterns among these 4 types of cells. In accordance with the RNA-seq clustering results, the H3K27ac modifications of genes in seven clusters matched well with the active gene expressions in different cell types.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27 acetylation(H3K37ac) and input in 3 cell types.
