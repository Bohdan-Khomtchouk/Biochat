TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of Cirh1a heterozygote state on early embryo in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CIRHIN is a transcription co-factor, shows postive effect on Hiv-1 LTR enhancer element(NF-ÎºB site); and Cirh1a null is preimplantation lethal, but highly expressed in the early mice embryo (E6.0-E12.5). We hypothesis that Cirh1a's  effect on gene transcription of early embryo  can be detected with Cirh1a down regulated in Cirh1a+/- state. Result shows that Cirh1a+/- has significant effect on early mice embryo gene transcription, Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) detected are mainly involved in cell proliferation/differenciation, cell cycle progress, embryo development and multi-orgnaogenesis.

DESIGN
Littermate embryos (E8.5) were dissected into RNAlater reagent for total RNA extraction, and yolk sac was used for genotyping PCR. Littermate embryos (E9.5) were dissected into RNAlater reagent for total RNA extraction, and yolk sac was used for genotyping PCR. Liver buds from littermate embryos (E11.5) were dissected into RNAlater reagent for total RNA extraction, and yolk sac was used for genotyping PCR. Liver buds from littermate embryos were dissected into RNAlater reagent for total RNA extraction, and yolk sac was used for genotyping PCR.
