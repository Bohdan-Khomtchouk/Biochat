TITLE
Targets of Ty3 transposition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The goal of these experiments was to define the targets of Ty3 transposition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Ty3 is a retroviruslike element that is found at the transcription initiation site of chromosomal tRNA genes.

DESIGN
A Ty3 that can be induced by growth in galactose-containing medium and which was marked by an insertion of HIS3 downstream of the second open reading frame of the element (POL3) was induced to undergo transposition by plating cells onto galactose containing medium and replica-plating onto medium selective for cells that had undergone transposition.  These cells were collected, DNA was extracted, and inverse PCR was performed using primers inside the Ty3 element in order to generate a library of insertion sites flanked by Illumina sequence-compatible primers.
