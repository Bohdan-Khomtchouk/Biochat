TITLE
Transcriptome data from induced Pluripotent Stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have generated human induced Pluripotent Stem cells (hiPSc) using Sendai virus-mediated delivery of reprogramming factors. hiPSc lines have been screened using SNP array to assess chromosomal stability (alongside the fibroblast lines from which they derived), and validation of the pluripotency of the hiPSc lines is provided by Pluritest assessment of transcriptome datasets, prior to differentiation and downstream assays. Single cell RT-qPCR analysis of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons reveals frequent dual layer identity.

DESIGN
human iPSc lines were derived from human dermal fibroblasts from control donors. SNP and gene expression datasets from control lines. Note that iPS NHDF-1, also used in the current study, has been published previously [Van Wilgenburg B., Browne C., Vowles J. & Cowley S. A.
