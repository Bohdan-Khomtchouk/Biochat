SUMMARY
Philadelphia-like B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is characterized by distinct genetic alterations and inferior prognosis in children and younger adults. The purpose of this study was the genetic and clinical characterization of Ph-like ALL in adults. Among 207 adult B-cell precursor ALL patients, 26 (13%) were classified as Ph-like using Affymetrix microarrays. The incidence of this subtype was 25% among 105 B-cell precursor ALL patients negative for BCR-ABL1 and MLL-translocations (B-other). All patients with IgH-CRLF2 translocation (38% vs 0%; p=0.002) or mutations in JAK2 (44% vs. 0%; p < 0.001) were exclusively found in the Ph-like subgroup. Clinical and outcome analyses were restricted to patients treated within GMALL trials 06/99 and 07/03 (n=107). The complete remission (CR) rate after induction was 100% for Ph-like (n=19) and B-other patients (n=40). After induction, significantly fewer Ph-like patients reached molecular CR (33% vs 79%; p=0.01). At 5 years, the Ph-like ALL subgroup had a lower probability of continuous CR (24% vs 62%; p < 0.001) and overall survival (22% vs 64%; p=0.006) compared to B-other ALL patients. Subsequent analysis led to a clinically applicable algorithm identifying this patient subset with a specificity of 100%. Our study is the first to demonstrate that the profile of genetic events in adult Ph-like ALL resembles pediatric Ph-like ALL and differs from B-other ALL. The Ph-like phenotype associates with inferior outcomes in intensively treated adult ALL patients. Ph-like adult ALL should be recognized as a distinct, high-risk entity and further research on improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches is needed.

DESIGN
Analysis of 207 samples of bone marrow mononuclear cells (98 Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 Plus Chip; 109 Affymetrix HG-U133 A & B Set) from adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
