TITLE
Array CGH of Mexican Patient Isolates and BCS100 Strain

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
Array CGH of human H. pylori isolates from natrually infected Mexican patients and BCS-100 strain used for experimental infection of humans which is labeled as OVX-34 in this sample set(Graham et al., 2004, Gut, 53:1235-1243). Each Mexican isolate has a three digit number indicating the patient, a letter indicating biopsy site location and number indicating single colony clone number. Patient 249,259 and 251 are adults and patient 291,293,612 and 653 are children. Multiple single clonies were isolated from 2-4 gastric biopsy sites (a- antrum, c-corpus, f- fundus, i-incisura angularis). Genomic DNA prepared from each experimental strain (500 ng) was labeled with Cy5 (red channel) and co-hybridized with an equimolar mixture of genomic DNA from the reference strains 26659 and J99 (500 ng). Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
