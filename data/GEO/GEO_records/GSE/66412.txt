TITLE
RNA-Seq whole transcriptome analysis of normal human epidermal keratinocytes and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The incidence of keratinocyte-derived skin cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is increasing worldwide making it the second most common metastatic skin cancer. In this project we used SOLiD next generation sequencing to characterize gene expression profiles in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) and cSCC cell lines.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) (n=4) and cSCC cell lines (n=8) were extracted. The samples were sequenced using SOLiD next generation sequencing.
