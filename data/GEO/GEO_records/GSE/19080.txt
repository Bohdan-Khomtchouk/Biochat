TITLE
Gene expression profiling in patients infected with HTLV-1: Identification of ATL and HAM/TSP-specific genetic profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the gene expression profiles of CD4+ T-cells isolated from 7 ATL, 12 HAM/TSP and 11 AC (asymptomatic carriers) to identify gene signatures that may be characteristic for these particular diseases. Using gene expression arrays, we identified ~ 1039 immune-related genes that were differentially expressed in CD4+ T cells; using stringent exclusion criteria, a 122 gene signature could be divided into 3 groups: I) ATL-specific; II) common; and III) HAM/TSP-specific markers

DESIGN
To better understand the genetic differences between HTLV-1-associated diseases, we examined the gene expression profile of T lymphocytes from patients either suffering from ATL, HAM/TSP or carrying the HTLV-1 virus without any symptoms. Microarray experiments were performed using the human ImmuneArray cDNA array (UHN Microarray Center, University of Toronto). We used the Stratagene Universal Control, labelled Cy5 for all samples in a competitive hybridization.
