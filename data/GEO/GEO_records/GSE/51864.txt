TITLE
Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing of HEK293 cells (HEK293-CT) and HEK293 cells stably over-expressing the BAHD1 gene (HEK-BAHD1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we report the partial methylome (CG-rich regions) of HEK293 cells and HEK293 cells over-expressing the BAHD1 gene (HEK-BAHD1)

DESIGN
We used MEDIP-seq to identify genomic regions differentially methylated upon overexpression of the chromatin repressor BAHD1 in HEK293 cells.
