TITLE
Genome wide RNA Sequencing of whole C. elegans RNA

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We report genes induced under transient hypoxia in an ELT-2 dependent manner

DESIGN
Adult C. elegans were exposed to transient hypoxia and fed ELT-2 RNAi. Normoxia and Empty Vector RNAi were performed as controls
