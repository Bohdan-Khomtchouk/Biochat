TITLE
Steady-state in vitro transcriptomic profiling of P. falciparum across parasite's intraerythrocytic life cycle

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
This dataset pertains to a steady-state in vitro transcriptomic profiling of artemisinin-resistant (6A-R, 11C-R) and artemisinin-sensitive (6A, 11C) P. falciparum parasites across its intraerythrocytic life cycle

DESIGN
Parasitized red blood cells (RBCs) from highly synchronized artemisinin-resistant (6A-R, 11C-R) and artemisinin-sensitive (6A, 11C) P. falciparum parasite lines were harvested at 8-hr intervals (6 timepoints) across their intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC). Prior to harvesting, all parasite lines were tighty synchronized 5 times over 2 generations using treatment with 5% sorbitol. Extraction of total RNA and amplification of total cDNA was carried out as  described in Bozdech, Z., S. Mok & A. P. Gupta, (2013) DNA microarray-based genome-wide analyses of Plasmodium parasites. Methods in molecular biology 923: 189-211.
