ChIP-chip from ex-vivo differentiated erythroblasts derived from human primary CD34+ cells

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms underlying erythroid-specific gene regulation remain incompletely understood.  Closely spaced binding sites for GATA, NF-E2/maf and CACCC interacting transcription factors play functionally important roles in globin and other erythroid-specific gene expression.  We and others recently identified the CACCC-binding transcription factor ZBP-89 as a novel GATA-1 and NF-E2/mafK interacting partner.  Here, we examined the role of ZBP-89 in human globin gene regulation and erythroid maturation using a primary CD34+ cell ex vivo differentiation system.  We show that ZBP-89 protein levels rise dramatically during human erythroid differentiation, and that ZBP-89 occupies key cis-regulatory elements within the globin and other erythroid gene loci.  ZBP-89 binding correlates strongly with RNA Pol II occupancy, active histone marks, and high-level gene expression.  ZBP-89 physically associates with the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) p300 and Gcn5/Trrap, and occupies common sites with Gcn5 within the human globin loci.  Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of ZBP-89 results in reduced Gcn5 occupancy, decreased acetylated histone 3 levels, lower globin and erythroid-specific gene expression, and impaired erythroid maturation.  Addition of the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid partially reverses the reduced globin gene expression.  These findings reveal an activating role for ZBP-89 in human globin gene regulation and erythroid differentiation. Keywords: Antibody ChIP-chip, Human Primary Erythroblasts
