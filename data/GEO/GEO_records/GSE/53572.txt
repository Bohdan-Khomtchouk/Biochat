TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of B lymphocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells, neonatal and adult sources

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the array was to compare iPS-derived CD19+CD10+ B cells with B cells from umbilical cord blood (UCB) and adult peripheral blood (PB)

DESIGN
iPS-CD34+ cells and UCB-CD133+ cells were differentiated to the B cell lineage in vitro. B cells were also isolated directly from UCB and PB. RNA was extracted from CD19+CD10+ FACS isolated cells from all 4 B cell samples as well as from undifferentiated iPS cells.
