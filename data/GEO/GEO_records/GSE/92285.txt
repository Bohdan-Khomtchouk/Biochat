TITLE
Expression data from different stages of erythropoiesis from cord derived CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Erythropoiesis from pluripotent stem cells is very complex, and mirrors that observed in developmental erythropoiesis, with primitive and definitive waves. For a better understanding of their potential for their use in blood transfusion, they were compared to erythropoiesis from cord derived CD34 haematopoietic stem cells. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying different stages of erythropoiesis from each source, pluripotent or haematopoietic stem cells.

DESIGN
We isolated mRNA (as well as conducting phenotypic and  functional studies) at each stage of erythropoiesis from pluripotent and haematopoietic stem cells, that includes pro-erythroblast, erythroblast, and the orthochromatic erythroblast. Also included in tis study is the primitive erythroblast stage from pluripotent sources.
