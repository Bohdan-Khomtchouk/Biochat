TITLE
Comparative gene expression profiles on contrasting mealy phenotypes in peach fruits reveal candidate genes associated with fruit quality

ORGANISM
Prunus persica

SUMMARY
Storage at low temperatures is one of the most used methods to prolong the life of postharvest peaches (Prunus persica (L) Batch.). However, fruit quality is adversely affected by the development of woolliness, a physiological disorder that is apparent when the fruit is ripened after prolonged periods of cold storage and is mainly manifested as loss of juice in the peaches. The aim of this study was to obtain a more detailed cohort of genes that underlie the wolliness in a segregating population with contrasting phenotypes of mealiness after being exposed to cold storage at 4 Â°C. For this, a transcriptomics approach was applied to fruits from a progeny of individuals accounted for 6% more juicy and woolly 6% over a 2 years. Our results suggest that not only genes related to the maintenance of cell wall architecture may contribute to the development of mealy phenotype. Based on its possible physiological process and differential pattern of expression transcriptomic profiles show that genes related to maintenance (modification I) and membrane fluidity account for the differences between fruits that exhibit contrasting phenotypes of mealiness. These genes may contribute to tolerance to cold during storage.

DESIGN
We analyzed a total of 9 woolly fruits (from 3 different trees, 3 fruits from each tree) and 12 juicy fruits (from 4 different trees, 3 fruits from each tree). An RNA pool from 9 woolly fruits was used as reference and was compared to an RNA pool of 3 juicy fruits from each individual tree. Two technical replicates were done for each comparison, thus making in total 8 hybridizations.
