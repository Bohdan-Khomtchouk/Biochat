TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of skeletal muscle gene expression in Lin28A Tg mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify mechanisms involved in growth and glucose metabolism, we performed whole genome mRNA expression analysis in five week old quadraceps muscle from 2 CD-1 background male Lin28A Tg and 2 WT littermates (all male) in which there was 7 fold overexpression of Lin28A, a RNA binding protein that enhances Igf2 translation and suppresses the let-7 microRNA biogenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested and processed using RNeasy mini kits from Qiagen. All RNA samples were DNase treated. The Illumina Ref-8 microarray platform was used to generate data.
