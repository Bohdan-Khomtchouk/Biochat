TITLE
Single-cell RNA sequencing of aspirates from cortical neurons after patch clamp recording

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We obtained full transcriptome data from single cortical neurons after whole-cell patch-clamp recording (termed “Patch-seq”). By applying “Patch-seq” to cortical neurons, we reveal a close link between biophysical membrane properties and genes coding for neurotransmitter receptors and channels, including well-established and hitherto undescribed subtypes.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed on a total of 83 individual cells

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
