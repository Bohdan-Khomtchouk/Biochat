TITLE
Gene alteration in A549 cells by disinfectant PHMG

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polyhexamethyl guanidine is widely used as a disinfectant in various places such as hospitals and restaurants. In order to examine of PHMG cytotoxicity in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells we treated 5 ug/ml PHMG for 24 h.

DESIGN
To investigate cytotoxicity of commonly used bactericidal reagent PHMG, A549 cells were treated 5 ug/ml PHMG for 24 h. After then purified the total RNA from treated and untreated cells using the Rneasy mini kit (Qiagen). The concentration and purity of the total RNA was measured and performed gene array.
