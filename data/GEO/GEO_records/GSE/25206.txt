TITLE
Transcriptomic shifts in rice roots in response to Cr (VI) stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Detailed analysis of genome-wide transcriptome profiling in rice root is reported here, following Cr-plant interaction. Such studies are important for the identification of genes responsible for tolerance, accumulation and defense response in plants with respect to Cr stress. Rice root metabolome analysis was also carried out to relate differential transcriptome data to biological processes affected by Cr (VI) stress in rice.

DESIGN
The rice variety IR-64 was germinated and allowed to grow for 5 d at 37 oC and then transferred to Hewitt solution for growth. After 10 d of growth, seedlings of uniform size and growth were treated with 100 µM of Cr (VI), As (V), Cd, and Pb under standard physiological conditions of 16 h light (115 μmol m−2 s−1) and 8 h dark photoperiod at 25 ± 2°C for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from the treated rice roots and microarray was performed using one-cycle target labeling and control reagents (Affymetrix platform).
