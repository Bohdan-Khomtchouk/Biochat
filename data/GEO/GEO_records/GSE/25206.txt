TITLE
Transcriptomic shifts in rice roots in response to Cr (VI) stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Detailed analysis of genome-wide transcriptome profiling in rice root is reported here, following Cr-plant interaction. Such studies are important for the identification of genes responsible for tolerance, accumulation and defense response in plants with respect to Cr stress. Rice root metabolome analysis was also carried out to relate differential transcriptome data to biological processes affected by Cr (VI) stress in rice.
