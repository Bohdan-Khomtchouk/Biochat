TITLE
Epigenome analysis of control and neurodevelopmental disorder lymphoblastoid cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of control and neurodevelopmental disorder lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in LCLs. Samples included 19 control, 18 Rett syndrome, 17 autism and 6 generalized epilepsy LCL samples. Six technical replicates were also included in the analysis.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 60 samples and 5 technical replicates were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
