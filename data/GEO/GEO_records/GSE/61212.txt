TITLE
Microarray-based gene expression of rabbit basilar artery smooth muscle cells exposed to hemodynamic insult

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
High-flow causes the remodeling of arteries, in which smooth muscle cells play an important role. To know the profile of smooth muscle gene expression under high-flow conditions in vivo, flow of rabbit basilar artery was increased by ligation of both common carotid arteries. Microarrays were performed to profile the gene expression of smooth muscle cells isolated from rabbit basilar artery. Expression profiles indicate 43603 differentially expressed genes in smooth muscle cells exposed to high-flow insult compared with the sham control, of which 1470 genes were upregulated and 780 genes downregulated using 2 fold-changes and P < 0.05 as a cut-off.

DESIGN
Bilateral common carotid arteries of female New Zealand White rabbits were ligated to increase vascular flow.The control group was performed the same procedure to expose the CCAs without ligation. Rabbits were euthanized at day 5 after ligation or exposure of bilateral CCAs in both groups (n=3 for each group). The rabbits used and all procedures in this study were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Smooth muscle cells were isolated. After  euthanization of rabbits, the whole basilar arteries were removed. The arteries were cleaned in PBS buffer,cannulated and perfused at a constant flow with a cocktail which contains PBS and 0.4 mg/ml elastase (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml collagenase (type 1A, Sigma). After an incubation time of 45 min, the tissue left was removed and stored in PBS. SMCs were released from the artery by trituration. Then Total RNA was extracted and gene chip tests were performed.
