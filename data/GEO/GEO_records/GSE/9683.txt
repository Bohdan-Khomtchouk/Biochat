TITLE
Tomato wild type, vector control and transgenic lines expressing InsP 5-ptase: mature fruits, root tips, and leaves

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
To reduce the level of major second messenger inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3), we generated transgenic tomato plants (cv. Micro-Tom) that are expressing InsP 5-ptase gene.  To understand effects of transgene (InsP 5-ptase) on gene expression we carried out microarray analysis from different parts of transgenic and control (wild type, empty vector control) tomato plants Objectives for this study included the identification of genes that were up or down-regulated at the transcriptional level in transgenic tomato plants expressing InsP 5-ptase gene Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Ripe fruits of wild type, vector control and two transgenic tomato lines expressing InsP 5-ptase gene  were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays First two leaves of 10 day old light grown in vitro seedlings of wild type, vector control and two transgenic tomato lines expressing InsP 5-ptase gene  were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays 10 day old etiolated root tips of wild type, vector control and two transgenic tomato lines expressing InsP 5-ptase gene  were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
