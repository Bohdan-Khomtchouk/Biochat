TITLE
Tomato wild type, vector control and transgenic lines expressing InsP 5-ptase: mature fruits, root tips, and leaves

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
To reduce the level of major second messenger inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3), we generated transgenic tomato plants (cv. Micro-Tom) that are expressing InsP 5-ptase gene.  To understand effects of transgene (InsP 5-ptase) on gene expression we carried out microarray analysis from different parts of transgenic and control (wild type, empty vector control) tomato plants Objectives for this study included the identification of genes that were up or down-regulated at the transcriptional level in transgenic tomato plants expressing InsP 5-ptase gene Keywords: genetic modification
