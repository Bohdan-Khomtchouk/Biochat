TITLE
Accumulation of TuMV-derived siRNAs in aerial parts of Arabidopsis thaliana plants at 7 and 10 dpi

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana ; Turnip mosaic virus

SUMMARY
At 7 and 10 dpi with wild type TuMV or  buffer (mock) whole plants (root not included) were collected and total RNA extracted for sRNA sequencing using the Illumina plataform.

DESIGN
Three plant genotypes were analyzed: Col-0, dcl1-7 single mutant and dcl2-1 dcl3-1 dcl4-2 triple mutants. Three replicate libraries were made per treatment. For each library, hits to TuMV and to Arabidopsis are inclued in separate files.

PLATFORM
GPL10065 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Arabidopsis thaliana; Turnip mosaic virus)
