TITLE
Transcriptome comparison of oocytes treated with RNAi against Btg4 or with control siRNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The comparison of trancriptomes was part of the study by Pasternak et al. The goal was to check if BTG4 regulates mRNA polyadenylation during mouse oocyte meiosis. To test this we compared the abundancies of the polyadenylated trancripts in control and Btg4-depleted oocytes.

DESIGN
3 samples of 50 oocytes were collected for both groups

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
