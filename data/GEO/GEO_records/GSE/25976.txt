SUMMARY
Breast cancer is a curable disease if it is diagnosed at an early stage.  However, only little options are left once the tumor is metastasized to distant organs, and more than 90% of breast cancer death is attributed to metastatic disease.  The process of metastasis is highly complex and involves many steps for successful colonization of tumor cells at a target organ.  According to the cancer stem cell (CSC) theory, which still remains a hypothesis, these metastatic cells must have stem cell-like capability for their self-renewal in addition to their invasive ability. Therefore, it has been predicted that a “metastatic stem cell”, which is distinct from a cancer stem cell, must exist in the primary tumor mass. To identify genes that are involved in metastasis of CSCs, we isolated CSC populations from a well-established model cell line of breast cancer, MDA-MB231, and that of highly metastatic variants, 231BoM-1833 and 231BrM-2a, using CD24, CD44 and EpCAM (ESA), which have been identified as surface markers for CSCs in breast cancers. Overall yield of CSCs from these cells ranged from 2% to 4%. We then performed global expression profile analysis for these CSCs using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0ST array.

DESIGN
CSC populations (CD24-/CD44+/ESA+) from MDA-MB231, 231BoM-1833 and 231BrM-2a were isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) using specific antibodies to these surface markers. The total RNA was isolated from the CSC populations using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). The RNA was then converted to cDNA and they were hybridized to the Human Gene 1.0ST chip (Affymetrix). The data was normalized using the RMA algorithm of the Expression Console software (Affymetrix). A comparison of transcriptional profiles was then performed in CSCs of highly metastatic cell lines (231BoM-1833 and 231BrM-2a) compared to the CSCs of MDA-MB-231.
