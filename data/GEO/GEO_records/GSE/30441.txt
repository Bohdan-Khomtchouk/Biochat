TITLE
Expression data from ethanol-tolerant E. coli strain and wild type under ethanol stress

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Cellular tolerance toward ethanol is a complex phenotype involved many genes, and hard to be improved by manipulating individual genes. We previously established exogenous global regulator IrrE mutants that confer Escherichia coli with significantly enhanced tolerance to stresses, including ethanol. In order to elucidate the mechanism for enhancement of ethanol tolerance in the mutants and to identify new genes and pathways that can be possible targets for engineering of ethanol tolerance, we carried out comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses with the representative strains E1 and E0 (harboring the ethanol-tolerant mutant E1 of IrrE and the wild type IrrE, respectively). The data from transcriptome analyses were deposited here.

DESIGN
Cells of ethanol-tolerant mutant E1 and wild-type strain E0 were grown in 1.5% ethanol, and the samples for both of these two strains were prepared in triplicate with biological replicates
