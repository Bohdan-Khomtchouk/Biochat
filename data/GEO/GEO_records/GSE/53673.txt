TITLE
CATseq a comparative Arabidopsis Transcriptome - RNA-Seq part

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A comparative assessment between both technologies, RNASeq and microarrays to detect differential expression in Arabidopsis transcriptome. The sequencing approach use High-throughput sequencing on different Solexa technologies (GAII,HiSeq2000 multiplex or not) Wild type samples were analyzed from 2 tissus (flower buds and leaves) which have a very contrasted transcriptomic profile (i.e very high number of genes differentially expressed).

DESIGN
The RNA was extracted from 2 tissus Flower Buds and Leaves from Arabidopsis. The associated GEO series with array part is GSE45345
