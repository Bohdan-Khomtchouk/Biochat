TITLE
Transcription factor binding in human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cohesin interacts with Mediator to link the enhancers and core promoters of actively transcribed genes bound by RNA polymerase II.  Activin signaling directs human embryonic stem cells to differentiate into endoderm.   ChIP-seq was performed to determine the gene targets of these factors in human embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
Human ES cells were grown without feeders using mTESR1.  ChIP-seq was performed against RNA Pol2, Cohesin subunits (Smc1 and Smc3) and IgG for cells grown in mTESR1.  Cells were differentiated into endoderm after resting for 24 hours in RMPI-B27 (0hr), and then treating with 50 ng/ml Activin A for two hours (2hr) and 48 hours (48hr).  DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing.
