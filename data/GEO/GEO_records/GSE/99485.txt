TITLE
Gene expression data from lineage negative c-kit positive sca-1 positive hematopoietic stem cells (LSK, Lin-Sca-1+c-kit+) isolated from  Jak2VF/+ vector and Jak2VF/+ Hmga2 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The JAK2V617F mutation has been detected in ~50% cases of MF. Elevated expression of high mobility group AT hook 2 (HMGA2) also has been frequently observed in patients with MF. Interestingly, upregulation of HMGA2 expression has been found in association with the JAK2V617F mutation in significant cases of MF.  However, the contribution of HMGA2 in the pathogenesis of MF remains elusive. To determine the effects of concurrent expression of HMGA2 and JAK2V617F mutation in hematopoiesis, we transduced bone marrow cells from Jak2V617F knock-in mice with lentivirus expressing Hmga2 and performed bone marrow transplantation. In order to assess the effects of Hmga2 overexpression on gene expression, we performed RNA sequencing analysis for the LSK from  Jak2VF/+ vector and Jak2VF/+ Hmga2mice.

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells from 5-fluorouracil-primed Mx1Cre; Jak2V617F/+ (referred as Jak2VF/+)  mice were transduced with lentiviruses expressing vector alone or Hmga2 by two rounds of spin infection. Transduced bone marrow cells (1X106) were injected into retro-orbital veins of lethally irradiated (2X 550 cGy) C57BL/6 recipient mice. BM cells were harvested at 32 weeks after BMT. RNA sequencing analysis from  Jak2VF/+ vector and Jak2VF/+ Hmga2 mice were performed for LSK cells sorted from BM cells. There are three biological replicates for each genotype and six samples in total.
