TITLE
PRRX1 over-expression in SK-N-BE(2C)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PRRX1 is expressed in mesenchymal-type neuroblastoma cells. Over-expression of PRRX1 in adrenergic-type cell line was used to study reprogramming towards a mesenchymal lineage.

DESIGN
SK-N-BE(2C) cells were transduced with lentiviral vector pInducer containing a doxycycline-inducible promoter driving PRRX1A. Time-course mRNA was analyzed after PRRX1-induction.
