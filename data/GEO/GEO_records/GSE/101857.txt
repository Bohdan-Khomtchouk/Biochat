TITLE
α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling modulates the inflammatory phenotype of fetal brain microglia: first evidence of interference by iron homeostasis.

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 7 microglia extracted from sheep fetuses exposed to LPS, agonist and antagonist of  α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to determine signaling pathway through modeling of α7 during inflammation.

DESIGN
Examination of genetic expression in microglia after α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor modeling with agonistic and antagonistic drug.
