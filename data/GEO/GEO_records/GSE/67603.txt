TITLE
Untreated and iron-treated ARPE-19 cell gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the potential molecular pathway(s) affected by iron treatment and identify the one(s) responsible for C3 induction, we performed a whole genome microarray on untreated ARPE-19 cells and cells treated with 250 Î¼M FAC for 48h/2d.

DESIGN
Gene expression was compared between untreated and FAC-treated ARPE-19 cells, with three biological replicates in each.
