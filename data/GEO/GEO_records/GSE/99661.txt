TITLE
Transcriptional alterations of virulence-associated genes in extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing uropathogenic Escherichia coli during morphologic transitions induced by ineffective antibiotics

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The present study examines changes in global gene expression patterns and in virulence factor-associated genes in an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing UPEC (ESBL019) during the morphologic transitions induced by an ineffective antibiotic and in the presence of human primary bladder epithelial cells. The morphological shifts induced by ineffective antibiotics are associated with significant transcriptional virulence alterations in ESBL-producing UPEC, which may affect survival and persistence in the urinary tract.

DESIGN
Changes in global gene expression patterns and in virulence factor-associated genes in an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing UPEC (ESBL019) during the morphologic transitions induced by an ineffective antibiotic (ceftibuten) in the presence of human primary bladder epithelial cells was evaluated by microarray after 4 hours. Four different morphologies were studied; Coliform, Transition (from Coli into Filamented), Filamented and Reverted (reverted back from a Filamented shape into a coli shape). Four independent experiments were included in each group.
