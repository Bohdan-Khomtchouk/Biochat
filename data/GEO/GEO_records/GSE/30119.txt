TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of whole blood transcriptional response to community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus infection in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptional profiles in whole blood from patients with Staphylococcus aureus infection. The hypothesis tested is that transcriptional profile heterogeneity will reflect patient clinical heterogeneity.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from whole blood (lysed in Tempus tubes) drawn from pediatric patients with acute community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus infection.
