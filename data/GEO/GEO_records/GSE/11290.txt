TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of feeding-to-fasting transition in chicken liver using a chicken 20K oligo microarray

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Four weeks old male broilers, fed ad libitum or fasted for 16h or 48h were used to describe the evolution of global gene expression profiles in chicken liver during a 48h fasting period using a chicken 20K oligo array. Among the 20460 oligos on the microarray, 13057 were identified as aligning with a unique coding region of the 2.1 Washington University assembly of the chicken sequence genome. So the statistical analyses were performed on this 13057 gene set. A total number of 2062 differentially expressed genes were identified. The number of genes differentially expressed after 48h of fasting compared to the Fed state was 4-fold higher than after 16h of fasting. Analysis was focused on 1162 genes selected among these 2062 genes for which a human ortholog could be identified, thus allowing functional information collect. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validated our results. Keywords: Chicken fasted, transcriptional profiling, differentially expressed genes
