TITLE
Transcript profile comparison of Zbtb20-sufficient and Zbtb20-deficient polyclonal bone marrow plasma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ZBTB20 is an adjuvant-specific factor for long-term antibody responses. This factor is critical for maintaining long-lived plasma cells in alum-adjuvanted antibody responses but is dispensable for TLR ligand-adjuvanted responses. To identify the functions of ZBTB20 in long-lived plasma cells, we performed microarray analysis on Zbtb20-sufficient and Zbtb20-deficient polyclonal bone marrow plasma cells under the assumption that ZBTB20 regulates relevant targets in all long-lived plasma cells, irrespective of their mode of formation.

DESIGN
Chimeras were generated using Zbtb20-sufficient (WT) or Zbtb20-deficient (TRAP) E14.5 fetal livers. 3-4 months after reconstitution, donor bone marrow B220low/-CD138+ cells (4 replicates per genotype) were purified via FACS for microarray. In total, 8 samples, 4 for each genotype, were included in this study.
