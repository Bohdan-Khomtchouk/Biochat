TITLE
Comparative transcriptome profiling of the injured zebrafish and mouse hearts identifies miRNA-dependent repair pathways

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mammalian heart has poor regenerative capacity following injury. In contrast, certain lower vertebrates such as zebrafish retain a robust capacity for regeneration into adult life. Here we use an integrated approach to identify evolutionary conserved regenerative miRNA-dependant regulatory circuits in the heart. We identified novel miRNA-dependant networks involved in critical biological pathways, which are differentially utilized between the infarcted mouse heart and the regenerating zebrafish heart.
