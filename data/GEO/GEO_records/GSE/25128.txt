TITLE
Gene expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis lung infections

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen in the lungs of the cystic fibrosis patients.  As infection develops the organism progressively adapts to its environment and its mode of pathogenesis alters, frequently including the loss of quorum sensing regulated virulence factors. We used microarrays to detail differences between two P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients, one of which (UUPA38) exhibited an active quorum sensing system (QS+) typical of early acute infection while the other (UUPA85) was QS-compromised (QS-) typical of chronic CF-adapted infection.

DESIGN
Bacterial cell biomass was harvested from triplicate biofilm and planktonic cultures of each of 2 strains of P. aeruginosa.  RNA was extracted, converted to cDNA and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. We aimed to identify genes which were differentially transcribed between the 2 isolates during both modes of growth.
