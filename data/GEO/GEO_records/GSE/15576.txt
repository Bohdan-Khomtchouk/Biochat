TITLE
Effect of Genetic Variant in miR-196a-2 in MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The impact of a SNP (rs11614913) in miR-196a-2 was examined by introducing expression vectors containing both the common and variant forms of the miRNA precursor.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were transfected with either an empty vector (negative control) or a vector expressing pre-miR-196a-2 with either the common (C allele) or variant (T allele) sequence.  Gene expression was measured relative to negative control, and biological replicates of each allele were included.
