TITLE
Reproducibility of standard and micro-scaled H3K4me2 ChIP-Seq assay in  mouse derived lymphoblastic cell line (D10.G4.1 cells, ATCC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To estimate the reproducibility of standard and micro-scaled H3K4me2 ChIP-Seq assay we performed the genome-wide correlation analysis of H3K4me2 enrichment patterns from 7 independent standard ChIP-Seq assays (2 million D10 cells), and micro-scaled ChIP-Seq 100,000 cells sample –(N=12), 10,000 cells sample–(N=3), and 1000 cell sample – (N=4)

DESIGN
Examination of H3K4me2 histone modifications in mouse derived lymphoblastic cell line (D10.G4.1 cells, ATCC).
