TITLE
The Transcriptome of the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system is highly strain-dependant

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have used microarrays to comprehensively describe the transcriptomes of the supraoptic nucleus (SON), the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the neurointermediate lobe (NIL) of adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, as well as the paraventricular nucleus of Wistar (WIST) rats. Comparison of these gene lists has enabled us to identify surprisingly large differences in hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system gene expression patterns in these three strains. We have also shown that different transcript populations  are enriched in the PVN and the SON of SD and WKY rats. The transcriptome differences catalogued here may be molecular substrates for the neuro-humoral phenotypic differences exhibited by different strains of rats.
