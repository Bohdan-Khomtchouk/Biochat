TITLE
Patient specific orthotopic glioblastoma xenograft models recapitulate the histopathology and biology of human glioblastomas in situ (CGH)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Frequent discrepancies between preclinical and clinical results of anti-cancer agents demand a reliable translational platform that can precisely recapitulate the biology of human cancers. Another critical unmet need is the ability to predict therapeutic responses for individual patients. Toward this goal, we have established a library of orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) xenograft models using surgical samples of GBM patients. These patient-specific GBM xenograft tumors recapitulate histopathological properties and maintain genomic characteristics of parental GBMs in situ. Furthermore, in vivo irradiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy of these xenograft tumors mimic the treatment response of parental GBMs. We also found that establishment of orthotopic xenograft models portends poor prognosis of GBM patients and identified the gene signatures and pathways signatures associated with the clinical aggressiveness of GBMs. Together, the patient-specific orthotopic GBM xenograft library represent the preclinically and clinically valuable “patient tumor’s phenocopy” that represents molecular and functional heterogeneity of GBMs.

DESIGN
aCGH experiments were performed for a human glioblastoma tissue (sample ID: PC-NS08-559) and the matching xenograft tumor tissue using the Agilent Human Whole Genome CGH 244K microarray according to manufacturer's protocol (2-color).
