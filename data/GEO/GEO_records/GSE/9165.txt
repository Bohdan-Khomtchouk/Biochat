TITLE
The Transcriptome of Photo-Biological Hydrogen Production in the Green Alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
Algal photo-bio hydrogen production, a promising method for producing clean and renewable fuel in the form of hydrogen gas, has been studied extensively over the last few decades.  In this study, microarray analyses were used to obtain a global expression profile of mRNA abundance in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii at five different time points before the onset and during the course of sulphur depleted hydrogen production. The present work confirms previous findings on the impacts of sulphur deprivation but also provides new insights into photosynthesis, sulphur assimilation and carbon metabolism under sulphur starvation towards hydrogen production. For instance, while a general trend towards repression of transcripts encoding photosynthetic genes was observed, the abundance of Lhcbm9 (encoding a major light harvesting polypeptide) and LhcSR1 (encoding a chlorophyll binding protein) was strongly elevated throughout the experiment, suggesting remodeling of the photosystem II light harvesting complex as well as an important function of Lhcbm9 under sulphur starvation. This study presents the first global transcriptional analysis of C. reinhardtii during hydrogen production using five major time points at Peak Oxygen, Mid Oxygen, Zero Oxygen, Mid Hydrogen and Peak Hydrogen. Keywords: Time course, sulfur deprivation, hydrogen production.
