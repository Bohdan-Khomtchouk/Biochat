TITLE
Sustainable syntrophic growth of Dehalococcoides ethenogenes strain 195 with Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough and Methanobacterium congolense: global transcriptomic and proteomic analysis

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough ; Methanobacterium congolense ; Dehalococcoides mccartyi 195

SUMMARY
The syntrophic growth of strain 195 with Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DVH) and/or Methanobacterium congolense (MC) enhanced TCE dechlorination process by faster dechlorination rate and more robust growth.  Transcriptomes of strain 195 grown in isolation, co- and tri-cultures were obtained by microarray experiments to find out the differential expressed genes corresponding to the syntrophic growth.  Thus we can better understand the role of DVH and MC within this syntrophy.

DESIGN
[Transcriptomic analysis]: Cells of pure strain 195 culture, co-culture and tri-culture were collected at the early exponential phase during TCE dechlorination process for RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, fragmentation, labelling, and hybridization on microarray.  We sought to obtain differential transcription of 195 genes in pure, co- and tri- cultures, in order to understand the role of DVH and MC in the syntrophy of strain 195.
