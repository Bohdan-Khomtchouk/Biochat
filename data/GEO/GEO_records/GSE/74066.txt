TITLE
Gene expression changes associated with exposure to BHPF in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the gene expression changes associated with exposure to fluorene-9-bisphenol (BHPF), analysis of global gene expression profiles in the uteri, ovaries, and livers of mice treated with 50 mg/kg/day of BHPF for 3 days compared with those of control mice was performed by means of an Agilent mouse gene expression microarray.

DESIGN
Gene expression changes in in the uteri, ovaries, and livers of immature mice treated with 50 mg/kg/day of BHPF for 3 days was compared with those of control mice.
