TITLE
FOXL2 binding sites in primary cells from mouse ovarian follicles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FOXL2 is a lineage determining transcription factor in the ovary, but its direct targets and modes of action are not fully characterized. Here, we explore the genomic targets of FOXL2. We found in particular that FOXL2 directly modulates Esr2 expression through a newly identified intronic element.

DESIGN
Input DNA and FOXL2 ChIP

PLATFORM
GPL15103 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Mus musculus)
