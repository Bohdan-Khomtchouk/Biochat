TITLE
Expression data from normal urothelial cells with exogenous expression of mutant FGFR3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activating mutations of FGFR3 are found in a high proportion of bladder tumours. The molecular consequences of FGFR3 mutation in urothelial cells and the mechanisms by which mutant FGFR3 may drive bladder tumourigenesis are largely unknown. We used expression arrays to identify downstream targets of mutant FGFR3 signalling in normal urothelial cells.

DESIGN
TERT-immortalized normal urothelial cells stably transduced to express the most common FGFR3 mutation (S249C) were compared with control cells transduced with the empty vector (pFB).
