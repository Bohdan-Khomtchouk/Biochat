TITLE
Expression data of Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes in an extended night

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Usually starch is nearly depleted at the end of the night. To induce a gradual depletion of carbon, we have analysed the global response of transcripts during an extension of the night, where carbon becomes severely limiting from about four hours onwards. Keywords: time course
