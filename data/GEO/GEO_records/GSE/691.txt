TITLE
Expression Profiles of Rats Treated with Clofibric Acid: Comparison of Whole and Laser Capture Microdissected Liver

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This is an evaluation of the impact of the successive steps of LCM procedure on gene expression profiling by comparing profiles from LCM samples to those obtained with non-microdissected liver samples collected after a one month CLO treatment in the rat. We showed that the H & E staining used for identifying PP-foci and the laser microdissection itself do not impact on RNA quality. Keywords = Microdissection Keywords = Clofibric Acid Keywords: other
