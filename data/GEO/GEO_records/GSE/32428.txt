TITLE
Mouse and zebrafish genes in vitro and in vivo

ORGANISM
Danio rerio ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of mouse cells was studied by extracting total RNA from cultured mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and zebrafish injected with mouse MSCs, in addition the host response was studied by hybridizing the zebrafish RNA to zebrafish arrays.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, low passage MSCs vs high passage MSCs and tumorigenic MSCs, in vitro and inside zebrafish embryos.
