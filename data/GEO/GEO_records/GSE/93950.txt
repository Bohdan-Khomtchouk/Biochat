TITLE
Identification of differentially methylated regions between the GDDH13 and GDDH18 apple genotypes at two developmental stages

ORGANISM
Malus domestica

SUMMARY
The main objective of this analysis was to sequence the epigenome of two apple (Malus domestica) doubled haploid 'Golden Delicious' fruits (GDDH13 and GDDH18). Our secondary objective was to identify differentially methylated regions between DNA purified from the GDDH13 genotype and the GDDH18 genotypes at two developmental stages.

DESIGN
Six samples have been analyzed. The six samples were collected from pools of young fruits. After DNA purification,  Bisulfite treatment was applied to determine the cytosine methylation status. Illumina reads of the three libraries were generated using an Illumina Hiseq instrument. Differencialy methylated regions were computed according to Hagmann et al. 2015.
