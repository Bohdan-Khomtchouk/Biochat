TITLE
LIF signaling-dependent gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) plays an essential role in the maintenance of pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). LIF withdrawal induces mESC differentiation. To define noval pluripotent factors downstream of LIF signaling, cDNA microarray was used and seveal well-known pluripotent genes were found to respond to LIF withdrawal, including Klf4, Esrrb, Tbx3, and Prdm14.

DESIGN
mESCs were cultured in presence or absence of LIF for two days and RNAs extracted from these cells were subjected to microarray analysis
