TITLE
Expression data from 18h-fasted WT versus KLF15-null mice: heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarray analysis to identify differences in gene expression levels in heart following an 18h (overnight) fast in WT control and KLF15-null mice

DESIGN
Heart tissue was isolated from 3-4 month old, 18h-fasted WT and KLF15-null male mice for RNA extraction and hydridization on Affymetrix microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL8321 [Mouse430A_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array
