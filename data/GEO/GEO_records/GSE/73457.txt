TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in MLL translocation transformed mouse leukemia cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to investigate the transcriptional programs as it relates to disease latency initiated by different MLL fusion proteins, including: MLL-AF1p, MLL-AF6, MLL-Gas7, MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL. Leukemia cell lines were established by transforming kit+ mouse bone marrow cells with retroviruses coding MLL-AF1p, MLL-AF6, MLL-Gas7, MLL-AF9 or MLL-ENL. At early phase after the cell lines were established, cells growing at exponential phase (cell density at 0.5~1x106/ml) were harvested for RNA extraction and sequencing purpose.

DESIGN
Sequencing is performed on total RNA isolated from mouse leukemia cell lines generated from kit+ mouse bone marrow cells transduced with various MLL fusion proteins and is compared to control total RNA isolated from kit+ mouse bone marrow cells.
