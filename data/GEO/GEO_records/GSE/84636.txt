TITLE
Small molecule proteostasis regulators that reprogram the ER to reduce extracellular protein aggregation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Imbalances in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis are associated with etiologically-diverse degenerative diseases linked to excessive extracellular protein misfolding and aggregation. Reprogramming of the ER proteostasis environment through genetic activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)-associated transcription factor ATF6 attenuates secretion and extracellular aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins. Here, we employed a screening approach that included complementary arm-specific UPR reporters and medium-throughput transcriptional profiling to identify non-toxic small molecules that phenocopy the ATF6-mediated reprogramming of the ER proteostasis environment. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis was employed to validate the capacity of three prioritized compounds to remodel the ER proteostasis environment, and to assess the prefential activation of ATF6 transcriptional targets relative to targets of the IRE1/XBP1s and PERK arms of the UPR.

DESIGN
HEK293T-Rex and HEK293-DAX cells were treated for 6 hr with vehicle (DMSO), 1 µM Tg, 10 mM TMP (in HEK293DAX), or 10 µM 132, 147 or 263 in biological triplicate at 37 ̊C
