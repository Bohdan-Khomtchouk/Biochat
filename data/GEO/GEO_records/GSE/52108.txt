TITLE
Gene expression signature of EGR3 silencing in M12 human prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EGR3 expression is upregulated in human prostate cancer compared to normal prostate tissue and is associated with absence of relapse, while low EGR3 expression in tumors is predicitive of disease relapse (Pio et al., PLOS One 2013; 8(1):e54096). However the function of EGR3 in prostate cancer is unknown. Human prostate cancer cells M12 containing high levels of EGR3 were used for shRNA-mediated silencing of EGR3. Gene expression analysis of EGR3 knockdown cells reveals a role in inflammation and the existence of a crosstalk with the NFkB pathway.

DESIGN
The M12 prostate cancer cell line is a tumorigenic derivative of the P69 SV40-T immortalized epithelial cells obtained through serial passages of P69 tumor xenografts in mice (Bae et al., Prostate 1998; 34:275-82). M12 cells were transfected with shRNA scramble plasmid (shSCR) or shEGR3 plasmid and selected with puromycin (1 Î¼g/ml). Single-cell clones were isolated using standard methods. Stably transfected cells (shSCR-M12 and shEGR3-M12) were then maintained in growth medium supplemented with puromycin. Two separate clones (termed cl 2 and cl 3) were studied. Knockdown of EGR3 (50% efficacy on average) was stable over many cell culture passages. Biological duplicates of control cells (scramble shRNA) and of two separate clones of shEGR3 cells (clone 2 and clone 3) were used for the gene expression arrays (i.e. 6 samples).
