TITLE
Gene expression profile of N171-HD82Q hippocampus and cerebellum.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional dysregulation is an important early feature of polyglutamine diseases. One of its proposed causes is defective neuronal histone acetylation, but important aspects of this hypothesis, such as the precise genomic topography of acetylation deficits and the relationship between transcriptional and acetylation alterations at the whole-genome level, remain unknown. We examined here the genome-wide correlation of histone acetylation and gene expression defects in a mouse model of early-onset Huntingtonâ€™s disease.

DESIGN
Hippocampi and cerebella were dissected from 10- and 20-weeks old transgenic mice alongside with wild-type littermates. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix MoGene 1.0 ST arrays. One array consisted on a pool of 3-4 RNA samples and three arrays were used per condition (genotype-tissue-age).  This is the gene expression component of the study only.
