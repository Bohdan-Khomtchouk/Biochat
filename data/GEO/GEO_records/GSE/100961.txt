TITLE
Sensors, Pathways and Transcription factors regulating IR-induced inflammatory transcriptional output [RNA-seq data set 1]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow-derived macrophages derived from C57Bl/6, Myd88-/- and Trif-/-, Ifnar-/-, Atm-/-, Sting-/-, Scid,  Irf3-/-, Irf1-/-, p53-/-, Nrf2-/-mice were irradiated with 6Gray ioninzing radiation; C57Bl/6 macrophages were Irradiated in the presence of MAPK inhibitors or Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenger (N-Acetyl Cysteine), Two biological replicates were generated for each time point. RNA samples were collected at 0 (unirradiated), 0.5, 1, 2, 6, and 24h post irradiation except where ever mentioned.
