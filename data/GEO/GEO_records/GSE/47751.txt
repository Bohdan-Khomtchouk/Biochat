TITLE
Early tissue responses to etanercept in psoriasis lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Anti-TNF-alpha therapy has made a significant impact on the treatment of psoriasis. Despite being designed to neutralize TNF-alpha activity, the mechanism of action of these agents in the resolution of psoriasis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to better understand the mechanism of action of etanercept by examining very early changes in the lesional skin of psoriasis patients. 20 chronic plaque psoriasis patients were enrolled and received 50mg etanercept twice weekly. Skin biopsies were obtained before treatment and on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 post-treatment. Skin mRNA expression was analysed by microarray.

DESIGN
Twenty individuals with chronic plaque psoriasis were enrolled (age range 18-75 years). Entry criteria included age greater than 18 years and stable plaque-type psoriasis involving at least 10% body surface area. Exclusion criteria included use of systemic psoriasis therapy within 4 weeks, topical therapy within 2 weeks, or severe co-morbid diseases. For 12 weeks, subjects received etanercept (Enbrel) 50mg twice a week subcutaneously. At baseline, 6 mm punch biopsies were obtained under local anaesthesia (lidocaine) from uninvolved skin and a target plaque. Subsequent biopsies were taken on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 of therapy from the same target plaque.
