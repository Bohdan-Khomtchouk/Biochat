TITLE
Gene expression profiles of mouse liver tissues in response to choline deficient diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study is to explore gene expression profiles of liver tissues in response to choline defficient diet by DNA microarray data analysis.

DESIGN
Male CD-1mice (5 weeks) were fed either a choline-deficient diet (F2CDD, Oriental Yeast) or F2CDD plus 0.2% choline bitartrate for 3 weeks. Liver tissue from control versus choline-deficient samples were analyzed for gene expression on an Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
