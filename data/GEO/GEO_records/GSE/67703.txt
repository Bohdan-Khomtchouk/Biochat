TITLE
ChIP-seq of GATA4 in mouse skeletal muscle myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GATA4 occupancy on the mouse genome of satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts. Proliferating myoblasts cultured in growth medium were immunoprecipitated with anti-GATA4 antibody or control IgG. Precipitated genomic DNAs were subjected to next generation sequencing.

DESIGN
Paired-end 150 bp sequence reads of GATA4-ChIP and IgG-ChIP using mouse skeletal muscle myoblasts.
