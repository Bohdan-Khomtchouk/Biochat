TITLE
Role of GDF10 for axonal sprouting and functional recovery after stroke

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GDF10 controls a unique transcriptome, which coordinately regulates several molecular signaling systems that provide insights into how this molecule induces a neuronal growth state and is distinct from other developmental and adult plasticity phenotypes.

DESIGN
4 conditions with three replicates: P4: animal control WT: adult animal control PT: adult animal stroke PT-GDF10: GDF10 siRNA adult animal stroke

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
