SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs in chicken somite embryos

DESIGN
Dissected tissue white leghorn chicken embryos was disaggregated and RNA extracted using the miRVana kit (Ambion). Small RNA fraction between 19 and 24 nt was isolated from 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and 15 micro gram was ligated to Solexa adaptors (Illumina) without de-phosphorylating and re-phosphorylating. The short RNAs were converted to DNA by RT-PCR following the Illumina protocol.
