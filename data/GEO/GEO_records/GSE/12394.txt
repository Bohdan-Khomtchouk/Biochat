TITLE
murine MYC-dependent lymphoma cells: Dox vs. NoDox treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiling of murine MYC-dependent lymphoma cell lines harboring the MYC-transgene in a Tet-off system comparing control untreated lymphoma cells (high MYC expression state) with 18hours Dox treated lymphoma cells (low MYC expression state). Keywords: inducible expression system

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Dox vs. NoDox treatment. Biological replicates: 26 distinct cell lines, 1 technical replicate. Four replicates per array.

PLATFORM
GPL7152 Ambion Human Mouse Rat miRNA microarray (probes_1564V1_Oct05)
