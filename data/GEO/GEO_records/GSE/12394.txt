TITLE
murine MYC-dependent lymphoma cells: Dox vs. NoDox treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiling of murine MYC-dependent lymphoma cell lines harboring the MYC-transgene in a Tet-off system comparing control untreated lymphoma cells (high MYC expression state) with 18hours Dox treated lymphoma cells (low MYC expression state). Keywords: inducible expression system
