TITLE
Expression data from age-dichotomized ER+ breast tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the biological basis between aging and sporadic breast cancer incidence and prognosis, RNA samples from matched ER+ invasive breast cancers diagnosed in either young (≤45) or old (≥70) women were analyzed by expression microarrays Keywords: biomarker identification
