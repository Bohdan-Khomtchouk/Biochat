TITLE
De novo epigenetic programs inhibit PD-1 blockade-mediated T-cell rejuvenation [expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
De novo DNA methylation establishes T cell exhaustion and inhibits PD-1 blockade-mediated T-cell rejuvenation. Expression profiling of chronically stimulated WT and Dnmt3a cKO antigen-specific CD8 T cells.

DESIGN
Mouse naïve (CD44low CD62L+) and antigen-specific CD8 T cells were sorted from spleens of chronic LCMV-infected WT and Dnmt3a cKO mice at ≥ 35 days post-infection for Affymetrix gene expression analysis.

PLATFORM
