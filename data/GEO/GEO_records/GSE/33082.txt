TITLE
mRNA expression analysis in wild-type, gld-1 and cgh-1 mutant animals

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To determine mRNA expression levels in wild-type, gld-1 (q485) mutant and cgh-1(tn691) mutant animals, RNA was purified from dissected gonads of young adult worms, using the PicoPur Kit.

DESIGN
A total of 9 samples was analyzed (triplicates of wild-type, gld-1 mutant and cgh-1 mutant animals respectively)
