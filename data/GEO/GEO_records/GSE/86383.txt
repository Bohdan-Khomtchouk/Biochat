TITLE
Differential expression of miRNAs in 3-Deazaneplanocin-A (DZNep) treated normal pancreatic and pancreatic cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiRNAs differentially expressed in normal pancreatic cell line (Human Pancreatic Ductal Epithelial cell line) vs MIA PaCa-2 (Pancreatic cancer cell line) were first identified by profiling > 1900 miRNAs using an array approach. Subsequently, miRNAs differentially expressed in DZNep treated cells (as compared to untreated) were also identified. We also checked for miRNA changes with gemcitabine treatment as well as combination treatment.

DESIGN
MiRNAs differnetially expressed between Normal (HPDE) vs Cancer Control (MIA PaCa-2), Normal - Control vs Treated (DZNep) or Cancer - control vs either Treated 1 (DZNep; 8 h) or Treated 2 (DZNep; 72 h) or Treated 3 (Gemcitabine; 72 h) or Treated 4 (Gem:DZNep: 1:10) was carried out
