TITLE
Metabolic switching in Streptomyces coelicolor wild type, time series under glutamate depletion condition

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
During the lifetime of a fermenter culture, the soil bacterium S. coelicolor undergoes a major metabolic switch from exponential growth to antibiotic production. We have studied gene expression patterns during this switch, using a specifically designed Affymetrix GeneChip and a high-resolution time-series of fermenter-grown samples. This time series was conducted using medium leading to glutamate depletion and the cultivation conditions as published in Nieselt et al. BMC Genomics 2010, performed with the Streptomyces coelicolor wild type strain M145E.

DESIGN
30 samples, no replicates; one hour resolution from 20-32h and 40-42h; half our resolution from 32-40 h; two hour resolution 44-58h; sample missing for 29 and 34 h

PLATFORM
GPL9417 Streptomyces coelicolor Affymetrix array
