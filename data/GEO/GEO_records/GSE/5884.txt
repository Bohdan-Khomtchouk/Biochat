TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of meiotic DSB induced by Gal4BD-Spo11

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We mapped the binding and DSB sites in a strain expressing the fusion protein Gal4BD-Spo11, as well as the DSB sites in strains expressing endogenous Spo11, pADH1Spo11 and pADH1Gal4BD. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
To distinguish between binding and DSB sites, we mapped the binding sites with crosslinking at t=0h after meiosis induction, and the DSB sites without crosslinking at t=6h after meiosis induction. Each experiment was done in triplicates, from independant cultures (except DSB measurement in the Spo11-Myc pADH1-Gal4BD strain, done from two independent experiments).
