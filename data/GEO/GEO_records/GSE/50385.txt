TITLE
Expression data from human ependymoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared molecular characteristics of primary and recurrent pediatric ependymoma to identify sub-group specific differences. Gene expression profiles were used to identify unique immunobiologic sub-types of posterior fossa pediatric ependymoma.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were generated from surgical tumor (ependymoma) (n=65) using Affymetrix HG-U133plus2 chips (Platform GPL570). Normalization was performed on our entire cohort of ependymoma. Of the 65 samples, a sub-set of 58 were used in the corresponding manuscript. Excluded samples are noted. Gene expression profiles were filtered to obtain gene expression of key immune cell markers. Comparative analyses between tumor samples were used to identifiy unique immunobiology between posterior fossa sub-groups.
