TITLE
Hepatic gene expression changes following antisense oligonucleotide-based inhibition of miR-29a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adult BALB/c female mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose at 20 mg per kg of antisense oligonucleotide either against miR-29a (5’-TAACCGATTTCAGATGGTGCTA-3’) or against a scrambled sequence (5’-TCATTGGCATGTACCATGCAGCT-3’ Antisense oligonucleotides contained 2’-O-methoxyethyl (2’-MOE), 2’-flouro (2’-F) 2'-alpha-flouro units with a phosphorothioate backbone (Regulus Therapeutics). Six days following the injection, liver was isolated, total RNA was prepared as described above, and the RNA was amplified and biotinylated using the MessageAmp Premier kit (Ambion). Samples (n=4 each experimental and control) were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays in the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Nucleic Acids Core Facility and analyzed with the assistance of the Penn Bioinformatics Core. Probe intensities were normalized using the GCRMA method and the significance of the log2-transformed, GCRMA-normalized signal intensities was determined using SAM

DESIGN
Adult mice injected with anti-miR-29a or scrambled control ASO, n=4 per group
