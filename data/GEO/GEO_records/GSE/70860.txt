TITLE
Changes of axonal transcriptomes in response to local Abeta

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report that local application of Abeta(1-42) for 24h triggers changes in the localized transcriptome, while the transcriptome in cell bodies remains largely unchanged.

DESIGN
Axonal and somatic mRNA profiles of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons grown in microfluidic chambers were generated by RNA-Seq in duplicates using an Illumina MiSeq. Axons only were treated for 24 h with soluble oligomeric Abeta(1-42) or vehicle control.
