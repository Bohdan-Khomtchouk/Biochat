TITLE
Deregulated gene profiles of zebrafish larvae exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of synthetic glucocorticoid

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To investigate the effects of glucocorticoids on the gene expression profiles in zebrafish, we performed a microarray-based transcriptomic study using larvae exposed to three representative glucocoriticoids at environmentally relevant high and low concentrations. Transcriptiomic profiel of developing zebrafish larvae exposed to dexamethasone, prednisolone or triamcinolone at 50 pM to 50 nM from 3 hours post-fertilisation to 5 days post-fertilisation were analyzed using G2519F Agilent Zebrafish Whole Genome Oligo Microarray Ver3.0, 4x44K.

DESIGN
Embryos aged 3 h post-fertilisation were exposed to 5 nM or 50 nM of glucocorticoid (dexamethasone, prednisolone or triamcinolone) in 0.05% (v/v) DMSO while the control group was exposed to 0.05% (v/v) DMSO only. At 5 days of exposure, larvae were collected for transcriptomic study. Four biological replicates from control group and five biological replicates from treated groups were analyzed using microarry.
