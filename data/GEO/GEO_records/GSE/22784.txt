TITLE
Profiling of Gene expression in Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae)-infected footpad of BALB/c nu/nu mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our goal is to understand the mechanism of granuloma formation in molecular level using Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae)-infected footpads.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, M. leprae non-infected footpads (control) vs. M. leprae infected footpads (sample). Biological replicates: 6 control, 6 (sample), independently grown and harvested from isolator. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL10650 Operon Array-Ready Oligo Set Mouse Whole 34K version 4.0.1 array
