TITLE
Sex-biased gene expression in 18 day embryonic chicken heart, brain, and gonad

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The contrasting dose of sex chromosomes in males and females potentially introduces a large-scale imbalance in levels of gene expression between sexes. In many organisms dosage compensation has thus evolved to equalize sex-linked gene expression in males and females1,2, in mammals achieved by X chromosome inactivation and in flies and worms by up- or down-regulation of X-linked expression, respectively. Another form of dosage compensation ensures that expression levels on the X chromosome and on autosomes are balanced3,4. While otherwise widespread in systems with heteromorphic sex chromosomes, the case of dosage compensation in birds (males ZZ, females ZW) remains an unsolved enigma5,6. Here we use a microarray approach to show that male day 18 chicken embryos generally express higher levels of Z-linked genes than female birds, both in soma and in gonads. The distribution of male-to-female fold-change values for Z chromosome genes is wide and has a mean of 1.4-1.6, which is consistent with absence of dosage compensation and sex-specific feedback regulation of gene expression at individual loci2. Intriguingly, without global dosage compensation, female chicken has significantly lower expression levels of Z-linked compared to autosomal genes, which is not the case in male birds. The pronounced sex difference in gene expression is likely to contribute to sexual dimorphism among birds, and potentially has implication to avian sex determination.
