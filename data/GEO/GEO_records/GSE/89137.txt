TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of alcohol exposure in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We sequenced microRNA from heads of two D. melanogaster populations: an ethanol treated group (30 minutes after sedation with ethanol saturated vapor), and an age-matched untreated control group; and calculated differential microRNA expression between the two groups.

DESIGN
Examination of microRNA levels in heads of D. melanogaster adult females after ethanol exposure using next generation sequencing (NGS)

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
