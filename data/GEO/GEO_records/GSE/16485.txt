TITLE
Expression data from macaque taste buds and lingual epithelium

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Efforts to unravel the mechanisms underlying taste sensation (gustation) have largely focused on rodents. The first comprehensive database of gene expression in primate (Macaca fascicularis) taste buds is presented. This database provides a foundation for further studies in diverse aspects of taste biology. A taste bud gene expression database was generated using laser capture microdissection (LCM) of tissue freeze medium OTC embedded macaque tongue tissue blocks. We collected fungiform (FG) taste buds at the front of the tongue, circumvallate (CV) taste buds at the back of the tongue, as well as non-gustatory lingual epithelium (LE). Gene expression was also analyzed in the top and bottom portions of CV taste buds collected using LCM. Samples were collected from 10 animals - 7 female, 3 male.
