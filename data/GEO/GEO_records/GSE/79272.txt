TITLE
Stimulation of isolated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with TLR9 agonist CpG C (CpG) and TLR7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to assess the genes upregulated when pDCs were stimulated with TLR7 agonist imiquimod and TLR9 agonist CpG C.

DESIGN
pDCs were isolated from six healthy donors by FACS sorting, and were stimulated with CpG and imiquimod for 18 hours, after which RNA was extracted for next generation sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Unstimulated samples were included as controls.

PLATFORM
