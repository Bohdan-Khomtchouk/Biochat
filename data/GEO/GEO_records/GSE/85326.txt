TITLE
microRNA expression changes after lipopolysaccharide treatment in gills of amphioxus Branchiostoma belcheri

ORGANISM
Branchiostoma belcheri

SUMMARY
Recently, amphioxus has served as a model for studying the origin and evolution of vertebrate immunity. However, little is known about how microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the immune defense in amphioxus. In this article, we identified the amphioxus miRNAs in the acute-phase response to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). First, we determined the time point for the peak of immune response in amphioxus after LPS challenge by evaluating the expression of TLR4 and NF-κb(v-rel) which were commonly used immune response indicators. Then we performed miRNA microarray analysis on gill samples collected at the time point to select the differentially expressed miRNAs. Finally, we used real-time quantitative PCR to detect the expression patterns of amphioxus miRNAs under effective LPS challenge during the time course. The microarray data revealed that the miRNA expression file was significantly changed after LPS stimulation. The changes of the most upregulated and most downregualted miRNAs in gills of the amphioxus following challenge with LPS revealed a temporal induction kinetic. Our current study will provide valuable information to take an insight into molecular mechanism of innate immune and the evolution of the miRNA family.

DESIGN
Fifteen microliters of LPS in PBS suspension (1 mg/ml) were injected into the cavum of amphioxus, and the same dosage of PBS was injected as the negative control. After that, the injected amphioxuses were cultured at 25 °C and were separately collected at different time points after injection (i.e. 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72h). The gills were rapidly removed and frozen by liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. The 12h timepoint is represented in this Series.
