TITLE
Analysis of 22G siRNA triggered siRNA amplification in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To determine if an endogenous 22G siRNA sensor transgene is subject to siRNA amplification, small RNAs were deep sequenced from the sensor and from a control transgene that is identical to the sensor but lacks an siRNA target site.

DESIGN
Small RNAs were isolated from synchronized young adult C. elegans and subjected to deep sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL9269 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Caenorhabditis elegans)
