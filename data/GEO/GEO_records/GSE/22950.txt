TITLE
affy_ams_maize-Cell wall maize mutant during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
affy_ams_maize - aafy_ams_maize - Main objectives of this study: - role of plant cell wall during AM symbiosis - regulation pattern during AM symbiosis - understanding of the original mycorrhizal phenotype of bm4 - search of candidate-genes to study AM symbiosis-After 7 days in phytochambers, plantlets were transplanted in 2L of humidified bedrock with 3000 spores for inoculation conditions or without spore for mock conditions then plants have grown in greenhouse. Maize roots have been sampled 7 weeks post-inoculation and freezed in liquid nitrogen then stocked at -80°C. Total RNA was isolated from frozen root tissue by using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison

DESIGN
8 arrays - maize
