TITLE
Gene expression profiles of KDM5A-/- MEFs with wild-type KDM5A or KDM5A-H483A mutant

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of Immortalized KDM5A-/- MEFs with re-introduction of wild-type KDM5A or KDM5A-H483A mutant.

DESIGN
Duplicate total RNA samples were isolated from subconfluent MEFs using RNeasy mini kit with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen). Gene-expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix mouse M430 2.0 chip.
