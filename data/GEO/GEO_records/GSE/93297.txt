TITLE
Transcriptome reponse of Phaeodactylum tricornutum to grazing effect

ORGANISM
Phaeodactylum tricornutum CCAP 1055/1

SUMMARY
RNA-sequencing was used to evaluate the transcriptomic response to grazing stress for P. tricornutum strain CCAP 1055/1.

DESIGN
The mRNA of 9L cultures of strain CCAP 1055/1 under three pairs of control and graz-ing treatments (three pairs of 1 vs 1 replicate) were extracted and submitted to Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform for paired-end sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL22901 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Phaeodactylum tricornutum CCAP 1055/1)
