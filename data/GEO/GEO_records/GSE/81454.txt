SUMMARY
Immune profiles were performed retrospectively in highly sensitized kidney transplant candidates Our hypothesis was that baseline differences in immune profiles could help identify candidates that respond to desensitization therapy.

DESIGN
Single-cell mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) phenotyping, gene arrays, and phosphoepitope flow cytometry were performed in 20 highly sensitized kidney transplant candidates undergoing desensitization therapy.
