TITLE
Expression data from hMSC-TERT4 cells during osteoblast differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentiation of human skeletal stem cells (hMSC) into osteoblasts is regulated by a few well described transcription factors. Our study used clustering and gene expression data to identify a novel transcription factor. ZNF25, which we showed is involved in osteoblast differentiation. We used microarrays to study gene expression of hMSC-TERT4 cells during osteoblast differentiation.

DESIGN
hMSC-TERT4 cells were induced to differentiated into osteoblasts in vitro with siZNF25. Gene expression was analysed using Affymetrix microarrays at days 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 post osteoblast induction.
