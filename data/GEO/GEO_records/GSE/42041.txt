TITLE
Integrin alpha3beta1-dependent gene expression in immortalized keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene-level analysis of gene expression in immortalized mouse keratinocyte lines that express or lack integrin alpha3beta1 The laminin-332-binding integrin alpha3beta1 is expressed highly in the epidermis, but its roles in regulating gene expression programs that promote normal or pathological skin remodeling have not been underexplored previously.  In order to identify genes that are regulated by alpha3beta1 in keratinocytes, we used microarray approaches to identify alpha3beta1-dependent genes in mouse keratinocytes that were immortalized with SV40 large T antigen (i.e., MK cells).

DESIGN
We used the Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST platform to analyze biological replicates of MK cell lines that were derived from wild type mice or alpha3-null mice, as well as a variant of the latter in which alpha3 was rescued by transfection with a human alpha3 cDNA.  Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool.
