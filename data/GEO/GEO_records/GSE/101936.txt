TITLE
ChIP-seq for GABPα in T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ets family transcription factor GA-binding protein (GABP) regulates gene expression in T cells.

DESIGN
GABPα binding sites in CD4 T cells from wild-type C57BL/6 mice were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments.

PLATFORM
