TITLE
Arabidopsis Col0 5 week-old plants: effect of DCMU on high-light treated plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of fully developed leaves of Arabidopsis Col0 plants treated with 50 ÂµM DCMU in high light stress.The aim of the experiment was to determine the specific effect of uncoupling electron transport from Photosystem II (by treatment of leaves with DCMU) under high light conditions compared with the effect of high light treatment alone.

DESIGN
two-condition, two-color experiment, HL (Control) vs. DCMU+HL (treatment), 4 biological replicates per treatment. The experiment comprised a single 4x44 Agilent V4 microarray slide with a dye-swap.

PLATFORM
GPL9020 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Feature Number version)
