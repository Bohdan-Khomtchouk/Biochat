TITLE
Chromosomal High Affinity Binding Sites for the Drosophila Dosage Compensation Complex.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We identified 131 high affinity sites of the Drosophila DCC combining residual ChIP-chip profiles after differential crosslinking and RNAi-mediated knockdown of spreading factors Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
MSL1 and MSL2 ChIP under various conditions including differential crosslinking and RNAi against MOF, MLE and MSL3. 2-4 replicates per experiment. dye-swaps as indicated in sample description.
