Genome-wide Binding Site Mapping of Estrogen Receptor alpha and c-MYC in Breast Cancer Cells

SUMMARY
Estrogens are steroid hormones that play critical roles in the initiation, development, and metastasis of breast and uterine cancers.  The estrogen (E2) response in breast cancer cells is predominantly mediated by the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha), a ligand-activated transcription factor.  ER alpha regulates transcription of target genes through direct binding to its cognate recognition sites, known as estrogen response elements (EREs), or by modulating the activity of other DNA-bound transcription factors at alternative DNA sequences.  The proto-oncogene c-myc is upregulated by ER¦Á in response to E2 and encodes a transcription factor, c-MYC, which regulates a cascade of gene targets whose products mediate cellular transformation.  This study aims at mapping the binding sites of these two transcription factors (ER alpha and c-MYC) in one ER alpha positive breast cancer cell line (MCF7 cell line). Keywords: ChIP-Chip Analysis
