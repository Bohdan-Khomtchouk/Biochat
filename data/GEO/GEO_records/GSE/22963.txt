TITLE
The Nuclear-retained non-coding RNA MALAT1 regulates alternative splicing by modulating SR splicing factor phosphorylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNA is utilized by higher eukaryotes to achieve increased transcriptome and proteomic complexity. The serine/arginine (SR) splicing factors regulate tissue- or cell type-specific AS in a concentration and phosphorylation dependent manner. However, the mechanisms that modulate the cellular levels of active SR proteins remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we provide evidence for a role for the long nuclear-retained regulatory RNA (nrRNA), MALAT1 in AS regulation. MALAT1 interacts with SR proteins and influences the distribution of these and other splicing factors in nuclear speckle domains. Depletion of MALAT1 changes AS of endogenous pre-mRNAs, similar to what was observed upon overexpression of SR proteins. Furthermore, MALAT1 regulates cellular levels of phosphorylated forms of SR proteins. Taken together, our results suggest that MALAT1 regulates AS by modulating the levels of active SR proteins. Our results further highlight a novel role for a nrRNA in the regulation of gene expression.
