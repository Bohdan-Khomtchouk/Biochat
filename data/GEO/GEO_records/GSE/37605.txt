TITLE
Expression Data of Treg and Tconv Cells from FoxP3-GFP Chimeric and FoxP3-ires-GFP B6 and NOD Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of chimeric Foxp3-GFP protein on the Treg cell transcriptional program.

DESIGN
Duplicate samples of Tconv (CD3+CD4+GFP-) and Treg (CD3+CD4+GFP+) splenocytes were double-sorted to achieve > 99.0% purity, from 6 weeks old male Foxp3-Fusion-GFP and Foxp3-ires-GFP mice of both B6 and NOD backgrounds. Following cell sorting into Trizol, RNA was purified, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays.

PLATFORM
