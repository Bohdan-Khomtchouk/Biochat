TITLE
Microarray analysis on livers, spleens and hearts of mice fed a normal diet and supplemented with either oil palm phenolics (OPP) or distilled water

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OPP (1500 ppm gallic acid equivalent (GAE)) was supplemented to BALB/c mice given a normal diet to observe for possible biological activities. Livers, spleens and hearts were harvested six weeks after the feeding regimen for gene expression studies. Results from the separate microarray data analysis carried out on the different organs show that OPP may have pleiotropic biological properties in vivo.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from livers, spleens and hearts of BALB/c mice given OPP (six weeks after the feeding regimen) were compared to controls given distilled water (liver: three replicates in the treatment group versus four replicates in the control group; spleen and heart: four replicates in the treatment group versus four replicates in the control group for both organs)
