TITLE
The effects of fluoride on the gene expression of enamel forming ameloblasrs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the overall gene expression pattern between secretory ameloblasts and maturation ameloblasts, and found out there were 244 genes differentially exppressed in the maturation ameloblasts as compared to secretory ameloblasts. Upon treatment, the genes coregulated with MMP-20 were  downregulated in maturation ameloblasts, though the difference was not significant.

DESIGN
Stage specific secretory ameloblasts (SAB) and maturation ameloblasts (MAB) were laser microdissected from mandibular incisors of control and 50 ppm F treated mice.
