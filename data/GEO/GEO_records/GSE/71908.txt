TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1)-dependent gene expression in tumor-associated macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study was designed to identify a common set of genes under the control of S1PR1 in CD11b-high macrophages from both oncogene-induced breast tumors (PyMT) or carcinogen-induced fibrosarcomas (MCA). The goal was to identify common regulators of lymphangiogenesis in both models.

DESIGN
Total RNA from FACS-sorted wildtype or S1PR1 knockout CD11b-high macrophages of PyMT and MCA tumors

PLATFORM
GPL17543 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 R2 expression beadchip
