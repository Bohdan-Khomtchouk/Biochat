TITLE
Expression data from cAMP-treated WT or IFN-gR1-deficient T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
cAMP inhibits TCR signaling, T cell proliferation, cytokine production and T cell function. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in TCR-activated WT or IFN-gR1-deficient CD4+ T cells by db-cAMP.

DESIGN
CD4+ T cells were purified from spleens of WT or IFN-gR1-deficient mice by autoMACS, and activated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 for 15 h. db-cAMP or vehicle control (med) was added into cultures for the last 3 h.
