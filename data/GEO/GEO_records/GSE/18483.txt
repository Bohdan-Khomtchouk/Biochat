TITLE
Leukemias of different origins

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated MLL-AF9 mediated murine leukemias that originate either from hematopoietic stem or committed progenitors cells. The luekemia stem cell fraction in these two type of leukemias shared exactly the same immunophenotype but their genetic programs differ.

DESIGN
Total RNA from HSC(KLS), CMP, MEP, and GMP, and from leukemia stem cells (LGMP)  was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix expresison microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL8321 [Mouse430A_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array
