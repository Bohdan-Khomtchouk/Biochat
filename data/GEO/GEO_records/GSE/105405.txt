TITLE
Differences of gene expression profiling of breast cancer cells with stable SREBP1 knockdown and the control cells [MCF-7]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SREBP1 is a master regulator of lipogenic gene expression. However, the underlying mechanisms of SREBP1-mediated metastasis has not been thoroughly elucidated.We involved microarray to analyze the differences of gene expression profiling between breast cancer cells with stable SREBP1 knockdown and the control cells.

DESIGN
We established stable SREBP1 knockdown breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and used microarray to compare differential gene expression profiling between the stable SREBP1 knockdown cell lines and the control cells.

PLATFORM
