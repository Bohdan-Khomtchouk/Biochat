TITLE
Dissection of estrogen receptor alpha signaling pathways in osteoblasts using RNA-sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal is to identify estrogen-dependent gene expression patterns using RNAseq for 3 different ERα forms in human osteoblasts.

DESIGN
We analyzed 3 different forms of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), 1) Wild-type, 2) NERKI (DNA-binding mutant) and 3) NOER (Nuclear Only ERα, not membrane).  Each was infected into hFOB (human osteoblast) cells and treated with either vehicle or E2 (10nM) (n=3 for each group/treatment).  RNAseq was then performed.

PLATFORM
