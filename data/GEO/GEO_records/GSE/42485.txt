TITLE
Genomewide analysis of U1C-dependent alternative splicing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate whether U1C plays a role in splicing regulation in human system, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of U1C in HeLa cells and analyzed alternative splicing patterns by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNAseq)

DESIGN
RNAseq performed with poly(A)+ selected total RNA from U1C-knockdown and control-treated HeLa cells
