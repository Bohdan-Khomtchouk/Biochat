TITLE
Induced expression of the C19MC miRNAs in HTR-8/SVneo cells (microRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analyze miRNA expression levels in HTR-8/SVeo cells stably transfected with a BAC plasmid containing the entire C19MC miRNA cluster

DESIGN
HTR-8/SVeo cells were transfected with a modified BAC plasmid containing the entire C19MC miRNA cluster and carrying a zeocin selection cassette. Several independent clones and a mixed population of transfected cells were analyzed and compared to non-transfected HTR-8/SVeo cells and primary human trophoblasts that express the C19MC miRNAs endogenously
