TITLE
RNA-sequencing of unstressed and pressure-overloaded C57 mouse hearts with single or combined ablation of PKCdelta and PKCepsilon

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Combinatorial ablation of the major cardiac-expressed novel protein kinase C isoforms, PKCdelta and PKCepsilon, in murine cadiac myocytes unmasked functionally redundant growth-limiting effects of these kinases in hemodynamically stressed adult hearts and during normal embryonic cardiac development, mediated in part by shared transcriptional de-repression of ERK and periostin signaling.

DESIGN
14 cardiac polyA+-RNA profiles from unstressed, 12 week-old C57BL/6J-background mice (4 wild-type, 3 postnatal cardiac PKCdelta ablation, 3 germline PKCepsilon knockout, 4 combined knockouts) and 15 profiles generated 4 weeks after TAC induction (4 wild-type, 3 PKCdelta, 4 PKCepsilon, 4 combined knockout) were generated on Illumina HiSeq 2000 instruments.
