TITLE
Expression data from Tbx1 knockout (KO) palatal shlelves

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deletion of Tbx1, a member of the T-box transcription factor gene family, results in abnormal epithelial fusion between the palatal shelves and the mandible, which induces cleft palate by inhibiting elevation of the palatal shelves. We used microarrays to determine the downstream genes of Tbx1 during palatogenesis and identified distinct classes of dysregulated genes.

DESIGN
Wild-type and Tbx1KO head or palatal shelves were collected at Embryonic day (E) 12.5 or 13.5 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0ST Array.
