TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional response of the Arctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. A2 to oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Pseudoalteromonas sp. A2

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic sequencing was performed to obtain the key functional genes involved in the adaptation of oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the Arctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. A2. Exposure to 1 mmol/L H2O2 resulted in large alterations of the transcriptome profile, including significant upregulation of 109 genes and significant downregulation of 174 genes. Functional classification of differentially expressed genes revealed that most of genes affiliated with biological adhesion, negative regulation of biological process, enzyme regulator activity, protein binding transcription factor activity and structural molecular activity were upregulated, and most of genes affiliated with multicellular organismal process and extracellular region were downregulated. It was notably that fifteen genes affiliated with flagella and four genes affiliated with heat shock proteins were significantly upregulated. Meanwhile, nine genes affiliated with cytochrome and cytochrome oxidase, and five genes affiliated with TonB-dependent receptor, were significantly downregulated. However, eighteen genes with antioxidant activity categorized by GO analysis showed differential expressions. This overall survey of transcriptome and oxidative stress-relevant genes can contribute to understand the adaptive mechanism of Arctic bacteria. five significant upregulated genes and five significant downregulated genes were selected using qRT-PCR to cinduct the  oxidative stress.
