TITLE
Comparative transcriptional analysis of Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 and mutants in regulator proteins grown in minimal media

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20

SUMMARY
Expression data for Desulfovibrio alaskensis strain G20 and mutants in regulator proteins grown on lactate sulfate media. Pellets collected at mid-log growth phase. We aimed to confirm or expand the predicted regulons of each of the transposon interrupted regulator mutants.

DESIGN
8 samples were collected: 7 regulator mutants and 1 control sample Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20. 1 replicate for each condition.
