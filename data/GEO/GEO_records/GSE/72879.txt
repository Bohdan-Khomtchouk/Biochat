TITLE
Circular RNAs in monkey muscle: age-dependent changes

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Here, we describe the identification of circRNA in monkey (Rhesus macaque) skeletal muscle.  RNA sequencing analysis was employed to identify and annotate ~12,000 circRNAs, including numerous circular intronic RNAs (ciRNAs), from monkey skeletal muscle tissue of  various ages.

DESIGN
Identification and validation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in skeletal muscle tissues (vastus lateralis) were obtained from young (Y), middle-aged (MA), and old (O) monkeys.
