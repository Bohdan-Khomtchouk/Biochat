TITLE
Transcriptomes of Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 induced by different carbon sources

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
Various saprotrophic microorganisms, especially filamentous fungi, can efficiently degrade lignocellulose that is one of the most abundant natural material on earth. It consists of complex carbohydrates and aromatic polymers found in plant cell wall and thus in plant debris. Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 was isolated from compost heaps and showed highly efficient plant biomass-degradation capability.Genome analysis revealed an impressive array of genes encoding cellulases, hemicellulases, and pectinases involved in lignocellulosic biomass degradation. We sequenced the transcriptomes of Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 induced by sucrose, xylan, cellulose and rice straw, respectively. There were 444, 1711 and 1386 significantly differently (q-value ≤ 0.0001 and |log2 of the ratio of the RPM values| ≥ 2) expressed genes in xylan, cellulose and rice straw,respectively, relative to sucrose control.

DESIGN
After incubation at 45 ℃, 145rpm for 20 hours with sucrose as the carbon source, mycelia were induced for 16 hours using xylan, cellulose and rice straw, respectively. Transcriptome induced by sucrose was used as the control when comparing the differences between other three transcriptomes (induced by xylan, cellulose and rice straw, respectively).
