TITLE
Identification of Adr1 regulated genes

ORGANISM
Ustilago maydis

SUMMARY
Adr1 of Ustilago maydis is a protein kinase that is activated after separation from the regulatory subunit mediated by high cAMP levels. A copy of the gene under the control of the arabinose-inducible crg1 promotor was introduced into the Cbx locus of the wild type strain FB1 creating strain HE140. To monitor the transcriptional changes upon adr1 induction by arabinose, we conducted a time course experiment comparing the wild type transcriptional response before and 75 or 180 min after medium shift to complete medium containing arabinose, as well as the response of the mutant HE140 before and 75 or 180 min after induction of the additional copy of adr1 by arabinose. Keywords: gene induction

DESIGN
Strains FB1 (control) and HE140 (a1b1 ipr[pcrg1:adr1]ips) were grown in CM medium containing glucose and were shifted to CM medium containing arabinose and grown for 75 or 180 min. Samples were taken before and after arabinose induction from two (glucose) or three (arabinose) biological replicates each.
