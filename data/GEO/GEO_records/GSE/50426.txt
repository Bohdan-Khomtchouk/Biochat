TITLE
Expression Data from E16.5 hearts from WT and FOG-2R3K5A siblings

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Heart development is modulated by FOG-2/NuRD interactions. FOG-2R3K5A is unable to recuit the NuRD complex and this results in cardiac defects such as ASD, VSD, and thin ventricular walls We used microarrays to detail the changes in gene expression in FOG-2R3K5A hearts to determine misexpression of genes that may be causing the observed phenotypes.

DESIGN
Whole hearts from E16.5 Wild-type and FOG-2R3K5A siblings were processed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We used three biological replicates of each genotype.
