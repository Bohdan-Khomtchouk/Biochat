TITLE
Gene expression profiling of ovaries collected from rat treated with pregnant mare serum gonadotropins (PMSG) and without PMSG

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
PMSG acts like LH in horses and mares but works like FSH in heterologous animals under certain circumstances.

DESIGN

PLATFORM
GPL15084 Agilent-028279 SurePrint G3 Rat GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
