TITLE
Identification of gene expression patterns in spleen of 564+/- mice of different ages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
564Igi mice homozygous for knockin alleles of 564 IgH and IgK expressed high levels of autoantibodies and exhibited a high incidence of mature B cell lymphomas. This study was designed to evaluate the gene expression profiles of 564Igi mice with different ages.

DESIGN
12 samples were tested from 4 groups of mice - 2 samples from one group and 3 to 4 samples from the other three groups. One sample per array
