TITLE
An Easy Operating Pathogen Microarray (EOPM) Platform for Rapid Screening of Vertebrate Pathogens

ORGANISM
Viruses

SUMMARY
An Easy Operating Pathogen Microarray (EOPM) was designed to detect almost all known pathogens and related species based on their genomic sequences. For effective identification of pathogens from EOPM data, a statistical enrichment algorithm has been proposed and further implemented in a user-friendly interface.
