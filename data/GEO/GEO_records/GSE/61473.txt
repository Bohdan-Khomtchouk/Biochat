TITLE
TRIB1 suppression on human hepatocytes transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The TRIB1 locus has been associated with lipid dysfunction.  The underlying mechanisms were investigated by examining the transcription landscape in response to TRIB1 suppression in human primary hepatocytes.

DESIGN
Primary hepatocytes from 3 distinct donors were exposed for  48 h to an antisense nucleotide targeting TRIB1 or a control nucleotide.  The resulting impacts on the transcription profile were assessed using Human Transcriptome 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix).
