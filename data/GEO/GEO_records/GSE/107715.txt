TITLE
Expression data from mouse adrenals during recovery after dexamethasone treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Long-term pharmacological glucocorticoid therapy causes atrophy and hypofunction of the adrenal cortex. Following glucocorticoids withdrawal, a functional and anatomic regeneration take place, whose  cellular and molecular mechanisms  are poorly understood We used microarrays to detail the  gene expression changes occurring during adrenal regeneration following administration of dexamethasone

DESIGN
Six weeks old wild type C57BL/6J male mice were administered dexamethasone in drinking water for 14 consecutive days. Adrenal glands were collected at the time of dexamethasone withdrawal, and 3 and 7 days after withdrawal to study the regenerative process. Adrenals harvested from mice before dexamethasone treatment were considered as controls.
