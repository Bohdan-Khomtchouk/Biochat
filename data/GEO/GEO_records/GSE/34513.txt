TITLE
Gene expression profiling of side population cells of mouse thyroid before and after partial thyroidectomy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Side population (SP) cells are enriched with genes involved in stem cell activity and/or lineage specifications. Stem cell marker genes are upregulated after partial thyroidectomy.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment: control side population (CSP) vs. control main population (CMP) vs. thyroidectomized side population (TSP) vs. thyroidectomized main population (TMP). Biological replicates: 6 CSP, 3 CMP, 6 TSP, and 3 TMP samples.
