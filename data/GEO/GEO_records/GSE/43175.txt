TITLE
Senescence impairs direct conversion of human somatic cells to neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Direct conversion from fibroblasts to neurons is a potential cell replacement therapy for neurological disorders, and a variety of combinations of transcription factors have been tried. We notice that the efficiency of conversion from aging fibroblasts was much lower than in early stage cells, which is consistent with the notion that cellular senescence impairs conversion of fibroblasts to neurons. Here, we found that the transient knockdown of the p16Ink4a/p19Arf locus was sufficient to convert human fibroblasts to neurons. Futhermore, expression of hTERT alone, another mechanism behind immortalization, also induced neuron conversion. Our results show that the acquisition of immortality is a crucial step for the conversion of human fibroblasts into induced neurons.

DESIGN
Transient knockdown of p16/p19 or p53 expression or exogenous overexpression of hTERT can induce primary fibroblasts to immortality. In the following, treated cells were cultured in neuron-induction medium. We can observe the morphology change and detect the neuronal markers. Also, some of the induced neurons could generate action potentials and neurotransmitter-induced currents in optimal conditions.
