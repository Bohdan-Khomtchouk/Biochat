TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in pluripotent human embryonic stem cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We defined the genome-wideH3K4me3 and H3K27me3 chromatin profile of human ESCs in the primed state (F) and the naive state (TL2i).

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications marks in primed and naive human ESCs.
