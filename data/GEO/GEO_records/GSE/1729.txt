Gene expression profile of acute myeloid leukemia

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of acute myeloid leukemia. Bone marrow (BM) samples from 43 adult patients with newly de novo diagnosed AML.All samples contained more than 80% blast cells. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) and purified with RNeasy Mini Kit (Quiagen, Valencia, CA). The RNA integrity was assessed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). The labeled RNA was then fragmented and hybridazed to HU-133A oligonucleotide array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), which contained 22,283 probe sets, according to Affymetrix protocols. The arrays were scanned using Gene Array Scanner (Affymetrix). Keywords = expression profile Keywords = myeloid leukemia Keywords = microarrays Keywords: other
