TITLE
Root-specific transcriptional profiling of contrasting rice genotypes in response to salinity stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Analysis of root gene expression of salt-tolerant genotypes FL478, Pokkali and IR63731, and salt-sensitive genotype IR29 under control and salinity-stressed conditions during vegetative growth. Results provide insight into the genetic basis of salt tolerance in indica rice. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Seedlings were cultured in sand and irrigated with a nutrient solution for 22 d (salt-treated) and 30 d (control) after germination, respectively. Salinity treatment was applied by adding NaCl and CaCl2 (5:1 molar concentration) in two steps over a period of 3 days (final electrical conductivity: 7.4 dS m-1) to prevent osmotic shock. All plants were harvested on day 30.
