TITLE
Large-scale characterization of DNA binding landscape of eukaryotic C2H2 zinc fingers

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) proteins represent the largest class of putative human transcription factors (TFs).  However, it is unknown whether most C2H2-ZFs even bind DNA, or what sequences they bind.  Using a combination of bacterial one-hybrid (B1H) assays, protein-binding microarrays (PBMs), and ChIP-seq, we have found that most natural C2H2-ZFs bind DNA both in vitro and in vivo. This SuperSeries contains the data for identification of C2H2-ZF binding preferences using these three approaches.
