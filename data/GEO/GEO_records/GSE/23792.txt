Genome-wide analysis of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) binding sites in DFB cells

SUMMARY
The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) plays crucial roles in developmental and cancer biology. Most of its biological effects have been ascribed to its tyrosine kinase activity. We report that IGF-1 promotes the modification of IGF-1R by small ubiquitin-like modifier protein-1 (SUMO-1) and its translocation to the nucleus. Nuclear IGF-1R associated with enhancer-like elements and increased transcription in reporter assays. We used ChIP-seq to examine the interaction of IGF-1R with DNA on a genome-wide scale. Analysis of the data set resulted in 568 candidate peaks, that is, statistically significant IGF-1R-enriched regions. The IGF-1R-enriched regions were divided into five classes on the basis of their location relative to known genes. Most of the IGF-1R-interacting sites (80%) were located distal from any annotated gene (intergenic), 6.3% were located in introns, 6.3% in exons, 3.4% were < 20 kb upstream of an annotated transcript start site (5'UTR + 20 kb upstream), and 3.6% were < 20 kb downstream of an annotated transcript end site (3'UTR + 20 kb downstream).
