TITLE
Gene expression analysis of JVM-2 and Granta-519 after CCDC50 gene modulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based gene expression analysis identified genes differentially expressed in JVM-2 and Granta-519 after CCDC50 gene modulation.

DESIGN
In this study, JVM-2 and Granta-519 cells, silenced for CCDC50 using siCCDC50 was compared to genome wide expression changes when compared to cellular transfections with a siRNA non-template control by Significance Analysis of Microarray data. Further, Ooverexpression of CCDC50 using the vector pCMV_CCDC50 was compared to cellular transfections 9with an empty vector pCMV in the cell lines JVM-2 and Granta-510
