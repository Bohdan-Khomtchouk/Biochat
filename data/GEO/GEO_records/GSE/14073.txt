TITLE
microRNA-like off-target transcript regulation by siRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
siRNAs mediate sequence-specific gene silencing in cultured mammalian cells but also silence unintended transcripts. Many siRNA off-target transcripts match the guide-strand ‘‘seed region,’’ similar to the way microRNAs match their target sites. The extent to which this seed-matched, microRNA-like, off-target silencing affects the specificity of therapeutic siRNAs in vivo is currently unknown. Here, we compare microRNA-like off-target regulations in mouse liver in vivo with those seen in cell culture for a series of therapeutic candidate siRNAs targeting Apolipoprotein B (APOB). Each siRNA triggered regulation of consistent microRNA-like off-target transcripts in mouse livers and in cultured mouse liver tumor cells. In contrast, there was only random overlap between microRNA-like off-target transcripts from cultured human and mouse liver tumor cells. Therefore, siRNA therapeutics may trigger microRNA-like silencing of many unintended targets in vivo, and the potential toxicities caused by these off-target gene regulations cannot be accurately assessed in rodent models.

DESIGN
Hepa1-6 mouse hepatoma cell line and HUH7 and PLC/PRF/5 human hepatoma cell lines were transfected in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and siRNA duplexes at a final concentration of 10 nM. For in vitro analysis, RNA was extracted at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h post-transfection. For in vivo studies, mouse livers were harvested 3 d following a single administration of APOB siRNA (3 mg/kg) formulated in lipid nanoparticles.  For details, please see: J. Burchard, A.L.
