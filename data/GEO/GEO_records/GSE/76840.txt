TITLE
MSI2 is required for maintaining activated myelodysplastic syndrome stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of musashi2 contribution towards maintaing myelodysplastic phenotype in stem cells. We find that musashi2 plays an integral role in maintaining the myelodysplastic phenotype

DESIGN
Control, NUP98-HOXD13; NHD13, NHD13/MSI2 bone marrow was transplated allowed to engraft into lethally irradiated congenic CD45.1 animals. Mice were then fed doxycycline to induce MSI2 overexpression.  Mice were induced for 3 months and then CD45.2 Lineage lo Sca1+ and Kit+ cells were sorted and then assessed for gene expression.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
