TITLE
Transcriptome data used for gene annotation

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To optimize the genome annotation, nine tissue and one pool RNA libraries (i.e. heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, muscle, fat, ovary, pool.) were constructed using the Illumina mRNA-spleeneq Prep Kit

DESIGN
We sequenced nine tissues and one pool using illumina Hiseq 2500 platform

PLATFORM
