TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) from JAK2+ myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we analyzed the behavior of bone marrow MSC (BM-MSC) from MPN patients with the mutation in JAK2V617F. We initially characterized the biological function and gene expression profile changes in BM-MSC from MPN patients when compared to BM-MSC of healthy donors (HD). Then, we established co-cultures between MSC cell lines (HTERT and HS5) and the UKE-1 MPN cell line, and performed RT-PCR to study if the leukemic cells were able to modify the genes related to hematopoietic support.

DESIGN
To obtain a global view of the differences between healthy donors (HD) and MPN cells, we extracted the genetic profiles of BM-MSC from 8 JAK2V617F patients: 4 Polycythemia Vera (PV), and 4 Essential Thrombocythemia (ET). 10 healthy donors (HD) and 6 Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients were also included. After assessment of RNA integrity (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent), samples were hybridized in the platform Gene Chip Gene 1.0 ST array system (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), following manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
