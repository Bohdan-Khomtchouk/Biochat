TITLE
Oligonucleotide array CGH in high-risk neuroblastoma tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed array CGH in high-risk neuroblastoma tumors in order to compare genome aberrations with expression of small non-coding RNAs.

DESIGN
We analyzed 33 NB primary tumors collected at the onset of disease. All patients were classified as stage 4 according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (Brodeur GM, Pritchard J, Berthold F, et al. Revision of the international criteria for neuroblastoma diagnosis, staging and response to treatment. J Clin Oncol. 1993; 11: 1466-1477) and they were older than 1 year of age at time of diagnosis. Regarding clinical course, patients were categorized into two subgroups: “good-outcome” (n = 16, neither relapse nor progression), and “poor-outcome” (n = 17, died due to the disease).
