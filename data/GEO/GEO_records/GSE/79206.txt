TITLE
Acquired resistance to BRAF-inhibitors restores melanoma tumor immune suppression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The acquisition of resistance to BRAF-inhibitors results in MAPK-driven, CCL2-mediated repopulation of intratumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in a mouse model of melanoma, and the depletion of MDSCs allows for effective immunotherapy against drug-resistant tumors.

DESIGN
Gene expression and intrinsic subset assignment were measured in 16 mouse biopsies
