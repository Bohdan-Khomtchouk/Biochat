TITLE
Transcriptome profile of peripheral blood from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of expression profile of peripheral blood from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients RNA expression profile of peripheral blood from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood. 36 patients with unresectable PDAC were recruited. The diagnosis of PDAC was based on clinical evaluation and imaging studies, which were histologically confirmed by surgery or imaging-guided biopsy. 14 gender, age, and habits matched healthy controls were also included.  A total of 1000 ng of total RNA was processed using Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit. Hybridization of human samples was performed on Illumina Human-HT12 Version 4.
