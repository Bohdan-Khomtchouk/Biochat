TITLE
Assessing the importance of target type for oligonucleotide microarray experiments

ORGANISM
Sphingomonas paucimobilis ; Dehalococcoides mccartyi VS ; Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b

SUMMARY
In order to assess the effect on signal variability of the type of target used for oligonucleotide microarray experiments, we hybridized double and single stranded DNA of three genes on a Nimblegen High Density microarray. This slide carries specific probes (two lengths: 30 and 50 nucleotides, for a total of 7456 probes) targeting every region of selected genes.

DESIGN
Probes of 30 nucleotides and 50 nucleotides, covering the full length of three genes (ahdA1C, mmoC and vcrA) by a one nucleotide step, were designed and in situ synthesized in six replicates on a 4*72K Nimblegen Custom Microarray. Double and single stranded DNA of the three genes were hybridized as target.

PLATFORM
GPL10729 Nimblegen Custom 7.5K thermodynamic array V01
