TITLE
Single-cell landscape of transcriptional heterogeneity and cell fate decisions during mouse early gastrulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study explores lineage and regulatory processes involved in early post implantation mouse embryos using single-cell RNA-seq

DESIGN
Single cells from C57Bl/6Babr  mouse embryos at E3.5, E4.5, E5.5 and E6.5 were isolated and subjected to single-cell RNA-seq protocol.
