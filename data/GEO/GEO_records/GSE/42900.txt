TITLE
NFIB: A Governor of Epithelial-Melanocyte Stem Cell Behaviour in a Shared Niche

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify direct NFIB target genes in HFSCs, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis using FACS-isolated HFSCs.

DESIGN
Two independent NFIB ChIP-seq experiments were conducted.
