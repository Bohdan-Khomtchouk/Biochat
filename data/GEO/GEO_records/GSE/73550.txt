TITLE
Expression data of differentially regulated genes in ESR1 depleted human endometrial stromal cells during differentiation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Estrogen and progesterone are important regulators of human endometrial differentiation. These steroid hormones act, at least in part, through their nucelar receptors. Role of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) during human endometrial differentiation is still unclear. We used microarray analysis to detail the gene expression regulated by ESR1 during differentiation of human endometrial stromal cells.

DESIGN
Human endometrial stromal cells were transfected with nontargeting control siRNA or siRNA targeting ESR1 for 48h. Then, cell were  treated with differentiation cocktail composed of estrogen, progesterone and a cAMP analog. At 24 hours, total RNA was isolated and used for microarray analysis.
