TITLE
RNA-Seq analyse the virulence mechanism of rice pathogen Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae strain RS-1 following ß-lactam antibiotics exposure

ORGANISM
Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae

SUMMARY
This study investigated the transcriptomic response of rice pathogen Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae (Aaa) strain RS-1 to ß-lactam antibiotics in particular Ampicillin (Amp) and the result highlights the importance of Amp-induced differentially expressed genes in the virulence of Aaa strain RS-1.

DESIGN
1 sample (Aaa strain under Amp (+) condition) with 2 biogical replicates; our previous RNA-Seq squencing result of Aaa strain under Amp (-) condition [GSM1220690 and GSM1220691 in GSE50522] was used as the control.

PLATFORM
GPL20176 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae)
