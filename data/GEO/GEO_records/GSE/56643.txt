TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of Ovis aries

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
We have completed the high quality reference genome for domestic sheep (Oar v3.1) and performed a detailed survey of gene expression across different tissues. RNA-seq data of 7 tissue types from the reference female Texel and  skin tissue from a Gansu alpine fine wool sheep were sequenced.

DESIGN
Here is the part of the RNA-seq data sequenced in BGI, including 7 tissue types from the reference female Texel and skin type from a Gansu alpine fine wool sheep.
