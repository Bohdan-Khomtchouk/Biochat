TITLE
mRNA profiling of MEST knockdown in human adipocyte precursor cells at early stage (day 3) of adipocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Mesoderm-specific transcript homolog protein MEST is a member of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family that is expressed in adipose tissue, adipocytes as well as their precursor cells. To get an idea about potential functions of MEST in adipocyte development, we knocked down MEST in human Multipotent Adipose-Derived Stem (hMADS) cells, induced adipocyte differentiation by a chemically defined medium and performed gene expression profiling at the early stage of adipocyte differentiation.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, hMADS cells at day 3 after induction of adipocyte differentiation, comparison of cells transfected with an siRNA targeting MEST (siMEST) to cells transfected with a control siRNA (siC). Biological replicates: 3, indepently grown and harvested. On each array, one biological replicate of siMEST-transfected cells was directly compared to one biological replicate os siC-transfected cells (serving as reference sample). All hybridizations were repeated with reversed dye assignment (dye-swap) as technical replicates.
