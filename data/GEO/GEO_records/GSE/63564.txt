TITLE
YBX1-dependent LNA-tRF-mediated modulation of gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify YBX1-dependent targets that are modulated upon changing the levels of endogenous tRFs, we used transient transfection of antisense locked-nucleic acids (LNAs) against tRFAsp, tRFGly, tRFGlu, and tRFTyr followed by microarray profiling.

DESIGN
Synthetic antisense locked-nucleic acids (LNAs) targeting the YBX1 binding site on tRFAsp, tRFGly, tRFGlu, and tRFTyr  were transfected into control and YBX1-knockdown cells to identify YBX1-dependent targets that are modulated due to tRF loss-of-function.
