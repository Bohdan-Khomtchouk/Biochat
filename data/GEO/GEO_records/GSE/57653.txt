TITLE
Transfection of rat Sertoli cells with human androgen receptor leads to alternated gene expression without androgen incubation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We introduced a full-length human AR into the expression vector pcDNA 6.2 C-EmGFP and transfected AR-deficient rat Sertoli cells (93RS2) by electroporation. We compared gene expression levels of AR-deficient Sertoli cell line (93RS2_noAR) and a full-length-human-AR transfected Sertoli cell line (93RS2_AR17) using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
We analyzed 3 arrays for the noAR cell line and 3 arrays for the AR17 cell line.
