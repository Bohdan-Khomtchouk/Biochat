TITLE
PBMC transcriptome profiles identifies potential candidate genes and functional networks controlling the innate and the adaptive immune response to PRRSV vaccine in Pietrain pig

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In vivo microarray study of global gene expression changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of Pietrain pigs during the stage of inatte immune and adaptive immune response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vaccination.

DESIGN
PBMCs samples collected at three time points (0, 1 and 28 d post ) from PRRSV vaccinated Pietrain pigs were subjected for hybridization of 9 arrays. Samples from each of time points were hybridized with three biological replications. To characterize the gene expression changes, we compared the PBMCs transcriptome profiles in two contrast pairs: day 1 post vaccination versus day 0 or  just before vaccination (D1 vs. D0) and day 28 post vaccination versus day 0 or  just before vaccination (D28 vs. D0).
