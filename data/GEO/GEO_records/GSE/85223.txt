TITLE
Hepatic differentiation of liver organoids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression profiles of self-organizing, multi-cellular, 3D liver organoids derived by co-culture of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell and stromal progenitors. We report the RNA-seq results of liver organoid at day0, day2, day4, day6 of co-culture. We also report RNA-seq results of constituent of the liver organoid, which are human iPSC at hepatic specification stage, human Mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow, human umbilical vein endothelial cell. As controls, we also report RNS-seq results of un-differentiated human iPSC, human iPSC at definitive endoderm stage, human liver tissue, and primary cultured human hepatocytes isolated from unused donor livers.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of  liver organoids and their constituents were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
