TITLE
Transcriptome characterization of murine ventricular cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated a comprehensive RNAseq data set of wildtype murine ventricular cardiomyocytes . Moreover, a cardiomyocyte-specific knockout for the ion channel regulators CASK was included, since CASK can translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression.  A knockout mouse model for SAP97 and dystrophin, two ion channels regulators, was also investigated.

DESIGN
Sequencing of cardiomycyte RNA from WT mice as well as CASK KO, SAP97 KO and MDX mice. Three replicated experiments were performed for CASK KO and SAP97 KO conditions, and five replicated experiments for the MDX condition. In adddition 4 WT samples were added to have an overview of the RNA distribution in WT mice.
