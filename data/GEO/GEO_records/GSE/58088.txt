TITLE
RNA-seq of Procr-expressing mouse mammary myoepithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Procr, also known as EPCR, is a protein C receptor known to function in the platelet coagulation cascade. We have used RNA-seq to examine RNA differential expression between Procr+ and Procr- myoepithelium in mouse mammary gland.

DESIGN
Examine RNA differential expression among subsets of freshly sorted mouse mammary gland myoepithelium.
