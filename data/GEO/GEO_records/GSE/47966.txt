TITLE
Global epigenomic reconfiguration during mammalian brain development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole-genome single-base resolution methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine maps reveal profound changes that occur during frontal cortex development in humans and mice.

DESIGN
MethylC-Seq, TAB-Seq, RNA-Seq and hmC-IP (CMS-IP and biotin-glucosyl tagging) from Homo sapiens and Mus musculus frontal cortex tissue and neural sorted cell populations. Additionally, MethylC-Seq was performed on the HUES6 embryonic stem cell line (Homo sapiens).
