TITLE
AML1/ETO binding pattern on human promoters

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Approximately 20% of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) cases carry the t(8;21) translocation, which involves the AML1 and ETO genes, and express the resulting AML1/ETO fusion protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting NCoR/SMRT/HDAC complexes to DNA. We used microarrays to identify human promoters bound by AML1/ETO in U937 cells. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
A U937 cell line that conditionally expresses HA-tagged AML1/ETO under the control of the mouse metallothionine promoter (U937-A1E) (Alcalay et al., J.Clin.Invest, 2003,112, 1751-1761) was used. Cells were treated for 8h with 100uM ZnSO4 to induce transgene expression, and ChIP was performed using an anti-HA antibody. ChIP products were then PCR amplified, labeled with Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent dyes and hybridized to the NimbleGen HG17 Human Promoter 2 Array set, which explores 4 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream the transcription start site (TSS) of 24,434 annotated genes. Two biological replicates were prepared and hybridized to independent array sets. U937-Mt cells, which carry the empty vector, served as control for non-specific binding of the anti-HA antibody.
