TITLE
mRNA-Seq of head tissue from Doa and fne mutants, Drosophila melanogaster.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of head tissue of Drosophila Darkener of apricot (Doa) and found in neurons (fne) mutants was performed by RNA-SEQ in females and males. The transcriptional and post-transcriptional targets of these genes, which are involved in regulation by several processes including splicing and mRNA stability, are examined and compared to wild-type.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA profiles in heads of wild-type male and female adult flies are compared to mutant
