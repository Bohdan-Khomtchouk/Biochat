TITLE
Identification of NRSF/REST genomic binding sites in conditions of basal and increased SF-1 dosage in the H295R adrenocortical tumor cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify genomic binding sites of the NRSF/REST transcription factor under conditions of basal and increased SF-1 dosage in the H295R human adrenocortical tumor cell line.

DESIGN
4 samples: input DNA (2 replicates) - NRSF/REST ChIP basal SF-1 dosage - NRSF/REST ChIP increased SF-1 dosage
