TITLE
Genome-wide map of H3K4me3 before and after methionine restriction in HCT116 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goals of this study were to compare the distribution of H3K4me3 before and after methionine restriction to understand how nutrient availability and alterations in methionine metabolism affect the epigenetic state and regulate gene transcription.  To do this we performed ChIP-seq with an H3K4me3 antibody and RNA-seq using PolyA+ mRNA.

DESIGN
We compared genome-wide H3K4me3 and mRNA profiles generated by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) between +Methionine and -Methionine conditions after 24 hours in HCT116

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
