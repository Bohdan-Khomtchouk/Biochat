TITLE
Genome wide transcriptional oscillation for Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK122

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Genetic and environmental stresses are known factors that influence an organisms phenotype. Time is rarely taken into consideration when studying phenotypic changes in cells. Time-resolved microarray data revealed genome-wide transcriptional changes in yeast strain CEN.PK122 oscillating with~2 periods. We mapped the global patterns of transcriptional oscillationsinto a 3-dimensional map to represent different cellular phenotypes ofoscillation period. This map shows the dynamic nature of transcripts through time and concentration space, and that they are ordered and coupled to each other.
