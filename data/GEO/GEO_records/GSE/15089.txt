TITLE
Time-course of gene expression in BMDCs stimulated with gamma-PGA nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene expression levels in murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells treated with γ-PGA NPs were examined by oligonucleitide microarray at 6, 12 and 24 hours. The gene expression of proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and costimulatory molecules was upregulated considerably in DCs treated with γ-PGA NPs at 6 hours.

DESIGN
The gene expression in murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cell was measured at 6, 12 and 24 hours after exposure to  γ-PGA NPs (300 µg/ml).  Three independent experiments were performed.
