TITLE
Trascriptional profiling of angiogenic inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine angiogenesis inhibitor-regulated pathways, the alteration in gene expression of human microvascular endothelial cells after a 4-hour treatment with seven chemically different inhibitors has been analyzed. Specifically, this series describes the expression profiles following treatment with either: 1. recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha); 2. pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF); 3. all trans-retinoic acid (RA); 4. thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1); 5. TNP-470 (TNP-470); 6. endostatin (ENDO); 7. angiostatin (ANGIO). To ensure that cDNA products were proportional to the initial gene expression pattern, 33P-labelled probes from oligo d(T) primed reverse transcription of 5 microg RNA were generated for each. This, followed by second strand synthesis, was used to hybridize the nylon filters (GF211 ) comprising a total of 4132 genes and ESTâ€™s.
