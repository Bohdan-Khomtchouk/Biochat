TITLE
Maternal transmission of anti-miRs into offspring

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pregnant mice were administered anti-miR specific to miR-29a-3p or scrambled control at embryonic day E17 and expression levels of miRNAs were assessed in offspring.

DESIGN
Impact of anti-miR-29a-3p on miRNA expression was investigated in liver homogenates of mouse pups (postnatal day 7) either directly injected by anti-miR-29a-3p (25mg/kg, via i.p. route) on postnatal day 1, or born to dams previously injected by anti-miR-29a-3p (100mg/kg; via i.v. route) on gestational day 17.

PLATFORM
