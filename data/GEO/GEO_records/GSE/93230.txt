TITLE
Brown adipocytes can display a mammary basal myoepithelial cell phenotype in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comparison of the mRNAs analysis in lactation mammary myoepithelial cells (GFP+/GFP-) and brown adipocytes (GFP+)  from Myf5-Cre-ROSAmTmG and Ucp1-iCre-ROSAmTmG mice. Results provide the gene expression signature in the brown origin (UCP1/Myf5-positive) myoepithelial cells in vivo.

DESIGN
Mammary myoepithelial cells and brown adipocytes were isolated by FACS sorting based on the cell surface markers and total RNA were immediately. GFP+ mammary myoepithelial cells (Lin−:CD24+:CD29hi) from lactation day 10 Myf5-Cre-ROSAmTmG mice (n=2). GFP- mammary myoepithelial cells (Lin−:CD24+:CD29hi) from lactation day 10 Myf5-Cre-ROSAmTmG mice (n=2). GFP+ mammary myoepithelial cells (Lin−:CD24+:CD29hi) from lactation day 10 Ucp1-iCre-ROSAmTmG mice (n=2). GFP- mammary myoepithelial cells (Lin−:CD24+:CD29hi) from lactation day 10 Ucp1-iCre-ROSAmTmG mice (n=2). GFP+ brown adipocytes from 8-week old female  Myf5-Cre-ROSAmTmG mice (n=2). GFP+ brown adipocytes from 8-week old female Ucp1-iCre-ROSAmTmG mice (n=2).
