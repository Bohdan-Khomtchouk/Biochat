TITLE
RNA-seq data for tumor tissues from mice fed with normal diet (ND) or high cholesterol diet (HCD)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To address how serum cholesterol affected tumor progression, C57BL/6J mice were placed on either normal diet or high cholesterol diet for 4 weeks, and then B16F10 cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flanks of mice. We performed transcriptome sequencing analysis (RNA-seq) on tumor tissues from ND and HCD groups.

DESIGN
Three tumor tissues from ND group (ND-1,ND-2,ND-3) and three tumor tissues from HCD group (HCD-1,HCD-2,HCD-3) were analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
