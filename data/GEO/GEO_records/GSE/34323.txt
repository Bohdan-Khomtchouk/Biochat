TITLE
Genome wide analysis of tumours in individuals with p53-germline mutations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix GW6.0 SNP/CNV arrays was performed for 7 tumours (4 adrenocortical carcinomas, 2 rhabdomyosarcoma and 1 extra-renal rhabdoid tumour) derived from individuals with germline p53-mutations.

DESIGN
Affymetrix CNV/SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from fresh frozen tumour samples
