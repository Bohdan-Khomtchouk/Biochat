TITLE
Genome-wide map of Gata6 DNA binding in mouse pancreas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have previously described in mouse models that pancreas-specific deletion of Gata6 results in pancreas alterations by rendering pancreatic acinar cells in a non-fully differentiation state, and furthermore it accelerates tumor initiation and progression in  a pro-tumorigenic context (KrasG12V expression). We aim to determine the sites where Gata6 binds at the genome-wide level in the pancreas to unveil why its loss leads to altered pancreatic function and enhanced tumor formation when coexpressed with KrasG12V.

DESIGN
Gata6 ChIP-Seq in the mouse pancreas

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
