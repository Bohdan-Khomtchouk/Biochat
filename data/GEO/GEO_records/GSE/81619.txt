TITLE
Identification and Profiling of microRNAs from Hypothalamus of Estrous Kazakh Sheep Induced by High Nutrition Treatment in Non-breeding Season

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
The identification of significantly differently expressed miRNAs expanded the repertoire of sheep miRNAs and could contribute to further studies on the molecular mechanism of estrous sheep in the non-breeding season under the different levels of nutrition.

DESIGN
Total RNA from the hypothalamus of Kazakh sheep in the estrous group (HEN) under the high-nutrition treated and those in the anestrous group (HAN) under the low-nutrition treated in the non-breeding season were used to construct small RNA libraries by Illumina HiSeq sequencing technology.
