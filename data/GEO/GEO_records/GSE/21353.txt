TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human immature dendritic cells after 3h, 6h and 12h of co-cultivation with Aspergillus fumigatus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of human immature dendritic cells after 3h, 6h, 9h and 12h of co-cultivation with Aspergillus fumigatus were compared to expression profiles from human immature dendritic cells after 3h, 6h, 9h and 12h of cultivation.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of human immature dendritic cells after 3h, 6h, 9h and 12h of co-cultivation with Aspergillus fumigatus
