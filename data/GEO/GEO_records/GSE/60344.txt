TITLE
Functional cooperativity between Myc and PI3K signaling for indefinite self-renewal property of embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We explored the relationship between Myc activity and PI3K signaling in ESCs. Our data demonstrate that Myc and PI3K signaling function cooperatively for supporting pluripotent property of ESCs. Moreover, our data demonstrate that exposure of ESCs to 2i condition render both Myc and PI3K dispensable for preserving ESC status.

DESIGN
Effect of PI3K inhibitor, LY4294002 on EBRTcH3 ESCs or their derivatives overexpressing c-Myc (wild-type or T58A mutant) was examined. Effect of LY4294002 on EBRTcH3 ESCs under 2i conditions was also examined. Furthermore, effect of Max expression ablation was compared between ESCs and those overexpressing p110 alpha.
