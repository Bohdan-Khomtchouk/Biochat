TITLE
Expression anaysis of mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Mus

SUMMARY
Analysis of differential gene expression of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from Tie2floxed:SM22α Cre- (WT) and Tie2floxed:SM22α Cre+ (KO) mice Looking for candidates, that could potentialy be upregulated or downregulated

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from whole lysates of cultured aortic vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from Tie2floxed:SM22α Cre- (WT) and Tie2floxed:SM22α Cre+ (KO) mice
