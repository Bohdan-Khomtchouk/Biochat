TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Candida albicans hyphae in interaction with PK E6/E7 vaginal epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Identification of genes differentially expressed in Candida albicans upon hyphal growth

DESIGN
To better understand the molecular events during vulvovaginal candidiasis, we established an in vitro system based on immortalized vaginal epithelial cells infected with C. albicans. As control, a low glucose cell culture medium was used, which robustly induced yeast to hyphae transition. RNA-seq approach was used to find major and significant changes in our in vitro system at the transcriptional level.
