TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression profiling on pre-chemotherapy biopsies of osteosarcoma patients who developed metastases within 5yrs (n=34) and patients who did not develop metastases within 5yrs (n=19)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High-grade osteosarcoma is a malignant primary bone tumor with a peak incidence in puberty. Overall survival of patients with metastatic disease is approximately twenty percent. Mechanisms behind the development of metastases in osteosarcoma are unknown. To identify gene signatures that play a role in metastasis, we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling on pre-chemotherapy biopsies of osteosarcoma patients who developed metastases within 5yrs and patients who did not develop metastases within 5yrs.

DESIGN
Pre-chemotherapy biopsies of osteosarcoma patients who developed metastases within 5yrs (n=34) were compared with pre-chemotherapy biopsies of osteosarcoma patients who did not develop metastases within 5yrs (n=19).
