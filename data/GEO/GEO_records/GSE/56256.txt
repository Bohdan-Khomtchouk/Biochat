TITLE
Influence of hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) on lipopolysaccharides-induced inflammation in human microvascular endothelial cells of the lung

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP), a water-soluble primary metabolite of the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane, has recently been shown to have favorable properties, improving overall survival in a chronic model of murine peritonitis. The mechanisms of protection provided by HFIP are currently unknown. We therefore performed a gene expression analysis in an in vitro model of endotoxin-induced endothelial cell injury to gain insight into involved molecular mechanisms. Pathway analysis was subsequently performed using the GeneGo Metacore Framework.

DESIGN
Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) were stimulated with 20mcg/mL lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to induce an inflammatory response. Hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) was added to the cell culture medium containing LPS (phosphate-buffered saline, PBS, in controls) for a time period of 6 hours at a concentration of 8mmol/L. After 6 hous, total RNA from HMVEC was extracted and genome-wide RNA levels were assessed. In total, twelve samples with LPS- or PBS-stimulated HMVEC, from which six samples were treated with HFIP, were hybridized on microarrays . One sample of the LPS+HFIP group was lost due to technical reasons (hybridization procedure).
