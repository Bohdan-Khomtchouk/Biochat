TITLE
Effects of elevated seawater pCO2 on gene expression patterns in the gills of the green crab, Carcinus maenas

ORGANISM
Carcinus maenas

SUMMARY
In order to promote our understanding of the responses of green crab acid-base regulatory epithelia to high pCO2, Baltic Sea green crabs were exposed to a pCO2 of 400 Pa for 3 and 7 days after which posterior gills 7 and 9 were sampled. Gills were then subsequently screened for differentially expressed gene transcripts using a 4,462-feature microarray developed by Towle et al. 2010.

DESIGN
For each experimental block (gill7-day3, gill7-day7, gill9-day3, gill9-day7), 6 replicate samples were obtained for control (= 39 Pa) and  elevated (= 400 Pa) pCO2 exposed animals. Each microarray slide included 4 technical replicates for each transcript and was hybridized with one control pCO2 (labelled with AlexaFluor555) and one elevated pCO2 cDNA (labelled with AlexaFluor647). Lowess-normalized gene expression was calculated as the log2 of the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the CO2-treatment cDNA to the fluorescence intensity of the control cDNA (log2 ratio=F635/F532).
