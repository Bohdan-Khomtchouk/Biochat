TITLE
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 total RNA hybridization of TFBd overexpression versus Reference sample

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
Total RNA hybridizations of Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 total RNA versus a strain overexpressing TFBd were compared to verify the transcriptome landscape changes. Comparison with TFBd binding sites localized using ChIP-chip data and MeDiChI algorithm (Reiss et al, 2008) allowed observation that TF-binding in the middle of coding sequences can also result in transcription initiation or termination internal to a single annotated protein-coding gene.

DESIGN
Total RNA sample of plasmid based expression of Cmyc tagged transcription factor TFBd grown in standard growth media with mevinolin.
