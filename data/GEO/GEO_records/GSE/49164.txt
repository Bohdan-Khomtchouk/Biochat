TITLE
Requirement for Lyl1 in a model of Lmo2-driven early T-cell precursor ALL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the requirement for Lyl1 in Lmo2-driven T-ALL, microarray data was perepared from sorted CD4-CD8 double negative thymocytes of wild-type, Lmo2 transgenic and Lmo2-transgenic, Lyl1 knockout mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from sorted CD4-CD8 double-negative thymocytes
