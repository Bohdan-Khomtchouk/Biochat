TITLE
Olfactory mucosa gene expression treated with systemic dexamethasone in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain a global view of the effect of systematic glucocorticoid treatment on gene expression in the olfactory mucosa (OM), we profiled these changes in a murine model of olfaction in order to identify underlying molecular mechanisms.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, 27 wild-type, 6- to 8-week-old, male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups, and were respectively injected with dexamethasone daily for 2 weeks (WK2) (intraperitoneally, 1mg/kg), with saline only for 2 weeks as control group (Ctrl) and with dexamethasone for one day as short term group (D1) (n=9/group). Three olfactory epithelium samples with optimal expression of olfactory marker protein (OMP) from each treatment group were selected to analyze global gene expression.
