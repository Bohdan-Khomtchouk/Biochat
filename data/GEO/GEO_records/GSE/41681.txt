TITLE
Influence of plasma from normal and preeclamptic women on HUVEC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Plasma from normal and preeclamptic pregnancies was collected and added in the culture medium of HUVEC cells. The aims are double: identifying putative biomarkers that could be modified recurrently in the endothelium under preeclampsia and understand at term the molecular bases of the increased risk of cardiovascular and kidney diseases in woman that have had a preeclampsia.

DESIGN
2 pools of 3 control plasmas and 2 pools of 4 preeclamptic plasma were organized and added at a concentration of 1/10 on HUVEC cells, during 24 hours before transcriptomic analysis
