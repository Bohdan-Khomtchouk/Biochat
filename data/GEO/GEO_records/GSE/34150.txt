TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling analysis of a time course of differentiating adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes on gene expression levels in differentiating adipocytes treated with differentiation medium (IBMX), insulin and dexamethasone (time points 2d-4d) as well as with maturation medium containing insulin (time points 6d - 18d)

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from adipocytes
