TITLE
Small RNA sequencing of human K562 cells transduced with lentiviral vectors overexpressing RUNX1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA-Sequencing of RUNX1 overexpressing K562 cells were compared to K562 cells transduced with an empty vector control to analyse the differential expression of miRNAs in hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
K562 cells were transduced either with an empty lentiviral vector as control or a lentiviral vector overexpressing human RUNX1. The samples were biological triplicates and the results were validated by qRT-PCR using SYBR green.
