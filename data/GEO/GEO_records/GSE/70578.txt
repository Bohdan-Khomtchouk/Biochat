TITLE
BMP signaling in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the naïve and primed pluripotent states [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Carrying out both RNA-seq and Smad1/5 genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of mESCs in the naïve or primed states, we revisit the roles of BMP signaling in mESCs.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis in 2 cell types; mESCs and ES-derived EpiSC (ESD-EpiSCs).

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
