TITLE
Transcriptome of Stabilin-1 siRNA transfected human monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stabilin-1/CLEVER-1 is a multidomain protein present in lymphatic and vascular endothelial cells and in M2 immunosuppressive macrophages. Stabilin-1 functions in scavenging, endocytosis and leukocyte adhesion to and transmigration through the endothelial cells. We have analyzed the putative functions of Stabilin-1 in blood monocytes and found that in healthy individuals 60-80% of both CD14+CD16- and CD14+C16+ monocytes, but not CD14dimCD16+ monocytes, expressed Stabilin-1 on the surface. Microarray and RNAseq analysis was performed to get more insight into the effect of Stabilin-1 expression on human monocytes transcriptome.

DESIGN
The transcriptome of human monocytes transfected with Stabilin-1 siRNA was compared to that of control siRNA transfected monocytes
