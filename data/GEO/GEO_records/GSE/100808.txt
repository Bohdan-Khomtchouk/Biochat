TITLE
Distinct cellular mechanisms underlie anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade [WES]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint blockade is able to achieve durable responses in a subset of patients, however we lack a satisfying comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 induced tumor rejection. To address these issues we utilized mass cytometry to comprehensively profile the effects of checkpoint blockade on tumor immune infiltrates in human melanoma and murine tumor models. These analyses reveal a spectrum of tumor infiltrating T cell populations that are highly similar between tumor models and indicate that checkpoint blockade targets only specific subsets of tumor infiltrating T cell populations. Anti-PD-1 predominantly induces the expansion of specific tumor infiltrating exhausted-like CD8 T cell subsets. In contrast, anti-CTLA-4 induces the expansion of an ICOS+ Th1-like CD4 effector population in addition to engaging specific subsets of exhausted-like CD8 T cells. Thus, our findings indicate that anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade induced immune responses are driven by distinct cellular mechanisms.
