TITLE
Inducible DamID systems for genomic mapping of chromatin proteins in Drosophila [DamID-seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Dam identification (DamID) is a powerful technique to generate genome-wide maps of chromatin protein binding. Due to its high sensitivity it is particularly suited to study the genome interactions of chromatin proteins in small tissue samples in model organisms such as Drosophila. Here we report an intein-based approach to tune the expression level of Dam and Dam-fusion proteins in Drosophila by addition of a ligand to fly food. This helps to suppress toxic effects of Dam. In addition we describe a strategy for genetically controlled expression of Dam in a specific cell type in complex tissues. We demonstrate the utility of the latter by generating a glia-specific map of Polycomb in small samples of brain tissue.

DESIGN
We determined DamID scores for Polycomb, normalized by Dam only control, for Drosophila larval central brain, larval fat bodies and repo+ glial cells of larval central brain. All samples were performed with 2 biological replicates. In case of Dam only control for larval central brain, each biological replicate was performed with 3 technical replicates.
