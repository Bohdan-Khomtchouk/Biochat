TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana vegetative part: Col-0 vs. shr scl23 scr triple mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the vegetative part of Arabidopsis comparing wild type with the shr scl23 scr triple mutant. The latter is produced by crossing the strong null alleles of shr (shr-2), scl23 (scl23-1) and scr (scr-5). The goal was to determine the effects of the GRAS transcription factors SHR, SCL23 and SCR on growth and development of the Arabidopsis shoot system by global transcriptome analysis.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: Col-0 vs. shr scl23 scr triple mutant. Biological replicates: 2 WT vs. triple mutant replicates, 2 WT vs. triple mutant replicates dye-swap replicates.
