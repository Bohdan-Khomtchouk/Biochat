TITLE
Effects of NAFLD/NASH on hepatic gene expression.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize gene expression changes in arachidonic acid metabolism pathway genes in the presense of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mice administered were administered an atherogenic diet for a period of four weeks. Administration of the atherogenic diet resulted in significant enrichment of the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The core enrichment subset of genes was down-regulated in mice administered the atherogenic diet and the majority of the genes that were down-regulated were cytochrome P450s.

DESIGN
A total of 4 wild-type mice were administered a standard diet (STD; control group) and 4 wild-type mice were administered a HFHC diet (HFHC).
