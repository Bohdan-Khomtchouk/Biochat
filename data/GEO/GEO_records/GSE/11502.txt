TITLE
Biological indicators of prognosis in Ewing's sarcoma: An emerging role for LGALS3BP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We create an experimental model of EWS cells that are chemoresistant and unable to give metastasis in mice and identify a molecular signature of potential prognostic value in EWS patients Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
we analyzed 4 EWS cell variants derived from TC-71 cell line with similar phenotype (MDR expression and no ability to form metastasis). Control is the parental cell line TC-71. Cells were profiled with Agilent Human 1 cDNA microarray kit (G4100A)

PLATFORM
GPL876 Agilent Human 1 cDNA Microarray (G4100A) [layout B]
