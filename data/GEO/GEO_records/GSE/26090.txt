TITLE
Expression data from the comparison between CD8 single positive (SP) thymocytes of CIITAtgpIV-/- mouse and B6 WT mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Thymocyte-thymocyte interaction can be very efficiently occur in CIITAtgpIV-/- mouse. We analyzed the gene expression profile between CD8+ T cells generated in CIITAtgpIV-/- mouse, and compared it to that of CD8+ T cells from B6 WT mouse. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from  CD8 single positive thymocytes generated in CIITAtgpIV-/- mouse and B6 WT mouse. These data are used to obtain 279 genes that showed differentially increased expression in CIITAtgpIV-/- mouse.

DESIGN
Total 1 sample from 2-4 CIITAtgpIV-/- mice and B6 WT mice were analyzed. We compared these using Affymetrix Expression console1.1, R affy-package(2.9.2), DAVID. Genes with an FDR≤10% and a fold-change ≥2 were selected.
