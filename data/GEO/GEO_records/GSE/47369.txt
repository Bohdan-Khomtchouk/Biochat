TITLE
Targeting BCL-2 with the BH3 mimetic ABT-199 in ER-positive breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A bank of human breast tumor xenografts was established by serial passage of primary breast tumor fragments in the cleared mammary fat pads of immuno-compromised NOD-SCID-IL2Rgammac-/- mice. The expression profiles from four different tumors (23T, 315T, 50T and 838T) were classified using diagonal discriminant analysis. The training data set consisted of 1992 samples from Curtis et al. (2012, PMID: 22522925); class labels were based on tumor subtype information provided (Basal-like, Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched and Normal breast-like).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from xenograft tumors from different patients have been profiled on the Illumina HT-12 BeadChip platform.
