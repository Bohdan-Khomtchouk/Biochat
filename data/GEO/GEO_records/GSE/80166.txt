TITLE
RNA Sequencing Data in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ES cell lines were established from mouse embryos, which were homozygous for the Trim33-flox allele and carried the UbcCreERT2 transgene. Cells were cultured without feeder cells in the presence of LIF and 2i. Embryoid bodies (EBs) were generated using the ATCC protocol on low attachment dishes under differentiating conditions. EBs were induced with Tamoxifen at day 4 and harvested at day 7.

DESIGN
Investigate differentially expressed genes in control and Trim33-deficient embryoid bodies derived from mouse embryonic stem cells
