TITLE
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA-seq analysis in purified quiescent yeast cells to identify the genomic RNA polymerase II and histone H3 methylation occupancy profiles and the quiescent cell transcriptome.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A defining characteristic of quiescent cells is their low level of gene activity compared to growing cells.  Using a yeast model for cellular quiescence, we compared the genome-wide profiles of multiple histone modifications between growing and quiescent cells, and correlated these profiles with the presence of RNA polymerase II and its transcripts.  Quiescent cells retained several forms of histone methylation normally associated with transcriptionally active chromatin and had many transcripts in common with growing cells. Quiescent cells also contained high levels of RNA polymerase II, but only low levels of the canonical initiating and elongating forms of the polymerase.  The data suggest that the transcript and histone methylation marks in quiescent cells were either inherited from growing cells or established early during the development of quiescence and then retained in this non-growing cell population.  This might ensure that quiescent cells can rapidly adapt to a changing environment to resume growth.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis was performed in yeast Log-phase cells and purified Quiescent yeast cells and the transcriptomes in each were compared. The RNA data was correlated with genomic RNA polymerase II and histone H3 methylation occupancy profiles in the log and quiescent cells.
