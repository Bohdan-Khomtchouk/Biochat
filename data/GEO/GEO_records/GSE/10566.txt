TITLE
Control run hybridization

ORGANISM
Enterovirus C

SUMMARY
Laboratory strain poliovirus was hybridized to the array as a control run and a proof of concept. Degree of cross hybridization between polio nucleic acid and non-polio probes was evaluated. Specificity of the probe design was determined. Keywords: control study: target detection and specificity

DESIGN
1 lab strain virus, poliovirus LS-C-1 was cultured on BGM cells. < 24 hrs post infection, viruses were harvested and their nucleic acid was extracted. Viral RNA was labeled with Cy-3 dye and hybridized unto array.
