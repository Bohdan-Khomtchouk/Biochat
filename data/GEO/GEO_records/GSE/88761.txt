TITLE
ERRa/ERRg KO heart gene expression analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ERRa and ERRg are essential transcriptional regulators of cardiac metabolism and functions.  Here we extend our previous studies by analyzing the transcriptome changes in ERRa/ERRg KO hearts

DESIGN
RNA from 16-day-old mouse hearts were used.  2-3 mice per sample, 2 samples per genotype, 4 genotypes (aHetgWT, aHetgKO, aKOgWT, aKOgKO)
