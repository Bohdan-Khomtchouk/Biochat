TITLE
AURATUS goldfish environmental genomics projects: lumiestrone in the liver

ORGANISM
Carassius auratus

SUMMARY
Sexually inactive male goldfish were injected i.p. with lumiestrone (0.5 µg/g) or control vehicle (in charcoal-stripped peanut oil; 5 µL/g) to investigate the biological activity of lumiestrone.

DESIGN
A common reference design was used: 4 independent groups of sexually inactive male goldfish treated with 0.5 ug/g lumiestrone hybridized against a common vehicle control. Slides 2, 15, 20, 43.
