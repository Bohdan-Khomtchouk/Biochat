TITLE
Gene expression variation induced by loss of the CD146 mRNA in MDA-MB-231

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metastasis is a complex process involving loss of adhesion, migration, invasion and proliferation of cancer cells. Cell adhesion molecules play a pivotal role in this phenomenon by regulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. CD146 (MCAM) is associated with advanced tumor stage in melanoma, prostate and ovarian cancers. For this study, the MDA-MB-231 cell line was used as a prototypic mesenchymal and invasive cell line, spontaneously expressing high levels of CD146. Using whole-genome DNA microarrays, we investigated genes for which expression was modified by CD146 down-regulation, obtained by siRNA or shRNA technology

DESIGN
Expression profiles of two cell lines transfected by two differents ShRNA directed against CD146 were compared with expression profiles of 3 control cell lines (i.e. native cell line, empty plasmid and shRNA directed against GFP)
