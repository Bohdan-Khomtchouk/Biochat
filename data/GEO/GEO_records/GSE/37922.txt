TITLE
Cardiac left ventricular physiological hypertrophy in swine

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanism underlying cardiac remodeling following exercise have been incompletely understood. Until now, most studies have been performed in rodents. We studied cardiac remodeling in the physiologically more relevant animal model, the swine.  Microarray analysis was performed on animals that underwent either and exercise protocol or remained sedentary. RNA was isolated from tissue samples from the endocardial layer of the free wall of the left ventricle.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from 8 exercise-trained and 8 sedentary animals 4-5 weeks after start of the protocol. Each group contained 4 males and 4 females. Animals used for the study were 2-3 months old Yorkshire x Landrace swine. Only neutered males entered the study.
