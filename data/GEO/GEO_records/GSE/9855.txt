TITLE
Gene induction by ethanol stress in B. cereus ATCC 14579

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579

SUMMARY
The stress response of B. cereus ATCC 14579 is monitored true time, showing an enormous response in gene expression. Keywords: Stress response, comparative transcriptome analysis.

DESIGN
The wild-type strain of B. cereus ATCC 14579 was cultured to an OD600 of ~0.6. Here the first RNA sample was taken, 0 min. After sampling 4% of ethanol was added (v/v), and samples were taken after 10, 30 and 60 minutes of exposure. Comparisons performed were 0 min - 10 min, 0 min - 30 min, and 0 min - 60 min.
