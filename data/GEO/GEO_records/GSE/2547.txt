SUMMARY
Male Sprague-Dawley albino rats (Charles River) initially weighting approximately 200 grams were randomly assigned to one of the following:  1) olanzapine (2 mg/kg/day, I.P.) (N=20) or 2) Saline (N=20) and administered olanzapine or saline for 21 days. Frontal cortex (N=4/group) was dissected and homogenized for microarray, QPCR and western blotting following previous methods (Fatemi et al. 2003; Brooks et al. 2003). RNA isolation, cDNA preparation, microarray hybridization and QPCR followed previous methods (Brooks et al. 2003). Keywords = olanzapine Keywords = frontal cortex Keywords: repeat sample
