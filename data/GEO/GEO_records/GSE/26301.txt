TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for ovarian cancer cells OVCAR-3 and FU-OV-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A subset of ovarian cancer are characterized by 19q12 amplification. To perform funtional studies of this amplicon the profile has been determined by SNP analysis.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on genomic DNA extracted from ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-3 and FU-OV-1
