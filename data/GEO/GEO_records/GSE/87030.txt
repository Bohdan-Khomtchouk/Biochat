TITLE
Nipple fibroblast gene expression profile

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The nipple is an example of specialized epidermis.  The unique epidermal stratification and gene expression is induced and maintained by developmental distinct fibroblast populations. To identify specific signaling modules involved in the maintenance of nipple epidermis we used gene expression profiling of purified fibroblast populations from a murine model of nipple skin formation

DESIGN
Gene expression of sorted fibroblasts from the nipple-like skin of the keratin-14 promoter driven parathyroid hormone-related protein mouse with the ventral skin of wild type littermates
