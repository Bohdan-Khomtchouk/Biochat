TITLE
Transcriptional profile of C. elegans following over-expression of elt-2 [L4 stage & Day 13]

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to discover that gene expression changes during aging are attenuated in elt-2 overexpressors relative to controls

DESIGN
Whole-worm mRNA was sequenced from worms over-expressing elt-2 and control worms.  Five biological replicates were collected for each condition.

PLATFORM
