TITLE
Effect of TGF-B treatment on human vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The authors did a microarray analysis to investigate the effect of TGF-B treatment on cultured smooth muscle cells from the human aorta. In particular, the authors were interested to see which cell types were upregulated or downregulated after treatment with TGF-B.

DESIGN
Human Smooth muscle cells from 4 different donors in triplicates were analyzed. The cells were either untreated (n=12) or were treated with TGF-B (1 ng/ml)
