TITLE
Expression data from mDCT cell-line over-expressing hMR

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Target gene of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is comparatively unknown, although distal convoluted tubule (DCT) expresses MR in in vivo. We used microarray and immortalized murine DCT cell-line overexpressing human MR with treatment of aldosterone to elucidate target genes of MR in DCT.

DESIGN
mDCT overexpresses human MR by lipofection and is treated for 3 hours with ethanol (g1), or 10^-9 M aldosterone (g2), or 10^-7 M aldosterone (g3), or 10^-7 M aldosterone with pretreatment of 5 x 10^-6 M spironolactone (g4) for 2 hours.
