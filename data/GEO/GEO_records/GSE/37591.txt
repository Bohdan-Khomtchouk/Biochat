TITLE
Human Splice Junction Arrays of Parkinson's Patients Leukocytes mRNA Pre- and Post-Deep Brain Stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide and the first involving motor symptoms. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) neurosurgery treatment through electrodes implanted to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves dramatically the debilitating motor symptoms of the disease due to yet unknown molecular mechanisms. Affymetrix human junction prototype microarrays (HJAY) of blood leukocytes mRNA from PD patients prior to, and following DBS neurosurgery treatment on electrical stimulation were compared to these of age- and gender-matched healthy control volunteers. About 95% of all human genes undergo alternative splicing, and alternative splicing is involved in human diseases and specifically in neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the goal of this study was to detect alternatively spliced genes in PD patients prior to, and following DBS and to predict the effect of these on the functional level of change at the transcript level (such as exon inclusion, intron retention and nonsense-mediated decay events). Understanding the role of alternative splicing in neurodegenerative diseases will open new avenues to future novel approaches for early detection and neuroprotective treatment enabled by the development of future genetic therapeutics targeted at specific modified splice variants.

DESIGN
A total of 11 blood leukocytes mRNA samples were analyzed: four from Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients pre-DBS treatment, three from PD patients tested again post-DBS (while being on electrical stimulation), three from age- and gender-matching healthy control (HC) volunteers, and one PD sample  pre-DBS sample was re-stained and rescanned .
