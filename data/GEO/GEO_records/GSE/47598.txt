TITLE
Activated T cell gene expression profile associated with Psoriasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Psoriasis is a Tcell-mediated disease characterized by the chronic inflammation of skin. Gene expression analyses on skin biopsies and freshly isolated PBMCs have provided important insights into Psoriasis pathophysiology. In the present study we analyze, for the first time, the gene expression profile of in vitro activated T cells in Psoriasis compared to normal heatlhy controls.

DESIGN
T cells from PBMCs isolated from patients and healthy controls were in vitro activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 72 hours. After T cell activation, cells were harvested and RNA extracted for microarray analysis.
