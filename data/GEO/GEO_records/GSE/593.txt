TITLE
Uterine Fibroid and Normal Myometrial Expression Profiles- U133 Arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our study seeks to identify genes differentially expressed between uterine leiomyomas and normal myometrial tissue. This series consists of samples derived from normal myometrium and uterine leiomyomas obtained from fibroid afflicted patients.Total RNA was extracted from samples, converted to biotin-labeled cRNA, hybridized to oligonucleotide arrays, and followed by model based expression analysis. In order to select differentially expressed genes of interest, dChip model-based expression analysis was employed. Significant genes were identified, utilizing the dChip software, as having an average fold change of > +1.5 or < -1.5 between leiomyoma and normal myometrium and p < 0.05. Under these conditions the 226 genes in the following list were identified. Keywords: other
