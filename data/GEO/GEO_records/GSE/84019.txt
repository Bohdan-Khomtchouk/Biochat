TITLE
Gene expression of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells from an 8-week-old WT and ob/ob mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obesity may promote myeloid cell accumulation in liver.  Intravital liver tissue imaging revealed that the number of myeloid cells attached to sinusoidal wall significantly increased in ob/ob mice. To assess the pathophysiological roll of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) in obese livers, we performed microarray analysis  in LSEC isolated from an 8-week-old wild-type and ob/ob mouse. Pathway analysis in microarray data shows genes related to cell adhesion, chemokine signaling and leukocyte transendothelial migration are upregulated in LSEC from ob/ob.

DESIGN
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells were isolated by collagenage digestion of livers from an 8-week-old male wild-type and ob/ob mouse. Cells were cultured overnight in DMEM containing 10% FBS.
