TITLE
Transcriptome changes in response to accumulation of cyclic di-AMP in Bacillus subtilis.

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Cyclic di-AMP is an essential second messenger in many Gram-positive bacteria, including the model organism Bacillus subtilis. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome of a strain accumulating c-di-AMP in vivo. Our results demonstrate that accumulation of c-di-AMP affects the expression of several hundred genes, among them many mother-cell specific sporulation genes. Additionally, the two major biofilm operons, epsA-O and tapA-sipW-tasA, are affected. High levels of c-di-AMP abolish transcription of genes responsible for biofilm formation which in turn leads to a defect in complex colony formation in B. subtilis.

DESIGN
Cells were grown under vigorous agitation at 37 Â°C in Spizizen minimal medium supplemented with glutamate. Samples were taken at OD600 of 0.5. Microarray hybridizations were performed with RNA from three biological replicates. The individual samples were labeled with Cy5; a reference pool containing equal amounts of RNA from all samples was labeled with Cy3.
