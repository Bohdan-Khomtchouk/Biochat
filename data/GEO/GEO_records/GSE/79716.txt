TITLE
Transcriptome changes in response to accumulation of cyclic di-AMP in Bacillus subtilis.

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Cyclic di-AMP is an essential second messenger in many Gram-positive bacteria, including the model organism Bacillus subtilis. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome of a strain accumulating c-di-AMP in vivo. Our results demonstrate that accumulation of c-di-AMP affects the expression of several hundred genes, among them many mother-cell specific sporulation genes. Additionally, the two major biofilm operons, epsA-O and tapA-sipW-tasA, are affected. High levels of c-di-AMP abolish transcription of genes responsible for biofilm formation which in turn leads to a defect in complex colony formation in B. subtilis.
