TITLE
Mapping PRDM9 binding and its effects in transfected HEK293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq results from HEK293T cells transfected with various versions of the meiotic recombination protein PRDM9, in order to learn about its DNA-binding properties, its effects on gene expression and chromatin organization, and which epigenetic factors influence binding and recombination outcomes.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq data on tagged transfected PRDM9 alleles in HEK293T cells, plus H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from transfected and untransfected HEK293T cells.
