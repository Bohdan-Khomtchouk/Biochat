TITLE
A panel of CpG methylation patterns distinguishes human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal human embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and somatic cells. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in 5 normal hESCs, 15 hiPSCs (vector-containing and vector-free), and 5 somatic cells.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 25 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
