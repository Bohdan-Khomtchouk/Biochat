TITLE
Broad spectrum antibodies to self-antigens and cytokines in RAG deficiency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overall, this work describes the largest cohort of patients with RAG mutations and an associated phenotype consisting of combined immunodeficiency and granulomatous lesions and/or autoimmunity (CID-G/AI). By using multiple methods (microarray, ELISA and multiplex bead technology), we have consistently identified a distinctive signature of anti-cytokine antibodies in patients with RAG-dependent immunodeficiencies, especially in those with CID-G/AI and a history of severe viral infections. These autoantibodies were not detected in a large panel of patients with other forms of primary immunodeficiency, and may therefore represent a novel biomarker panel of this condition.
