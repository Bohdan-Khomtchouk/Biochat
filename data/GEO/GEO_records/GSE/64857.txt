TITLE
Gene expression data from patients with colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analyses for the identification of differences in gene expression patterns have increased our understanding of the molecular genetic events in colorectal cancer. We used gene expression analysis data from recurrent and non-recurrent patients with colorectal cancer to identify differentially expressed probes.

DESIGN
Tumor tissues were taken from 81 patients with colorectal cancer, rapidly frozen in RNAlater, and isolated using Trizol. Gene expression proÔ¨Åles were determined using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips.We aimed to identify a molecular signature that can reliably identify colorectal cancer patients at high risk for recurrence.
