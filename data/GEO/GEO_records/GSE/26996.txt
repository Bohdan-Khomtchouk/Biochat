TITLE
Coordinated regulation of polycomb group complexes through microRNAs in cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the altered mRNA expression signatures upon overexpressing EZH2 regulated microRNAs in cancer. To identify EZH2 regulated microRNAs in cancer.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: Each EZH2 microRNA was overexpressed and compared to a control RNA in BT549 breast cancer cells. In DU145 prostate cancer cell EZH2 was knocked down and comapred to EZH2 scrambled siRNA. Other cell lines were monitored for miRNA expression as they are known to have high endogenous levels of EZH2.
