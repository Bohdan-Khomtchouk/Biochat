TITLE
Human PBMNCs: Control vs. Patients with Kawasaki disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genes that were consistently up-regulated in KD patients compared with healthy controls, and that showed over 2.0 or 3.0-fold differences by the comparison between the two groups in the mean expression levels were selected.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis for PBMNCs of acute-phase KD patients was performed using an AceGene Human Oligo Chip 30K 1 Chip Version (Hitachi Software Engineering) that contains approximately 30,000 genes. In the study presented here, 3 cases of Kawasaki disease at acute phase,and 5 healthy controls,were used. The data with low signal-to-noise ratios (S/N < 3) were not used for further analysis.
