TITLE
Gene expression of three hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with different organ-tropism.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we investigated the gene expression profiling in three HCC cell lines with different organ-tropism.The parent cell line has low metastasis ability in nude mice model. Subclone 1 has higher metastasis ability specific to lung, and subclone 2 has dual metastasis ability to lung and celiac lymph node. We aimed to explore differentially expressed genes involved in process of HCC metastasis and organ-specific metastasis, and identify their biological functions.

DESIGN
Examination of different gene expression among the 3 cell types.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
