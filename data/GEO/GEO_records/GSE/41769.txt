TITLE
Effects of acute exercise on gene expression in exercising and non-exercising human skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Exercising is know to have an effect on exercising skeletal muscle, but unkown is the effect on non-exercising skeletal muscle. Gene expression changes in the non-exercising skeletal muscle would point to a signalling role of skeletal muscle

DESIGN
9 healthy middle-aged men performed 1 hour of one-legged exercise, before and afterwards muscle biopsies were taken from both legs. Skeletal muscle biopsies were analyzed by microarray.
