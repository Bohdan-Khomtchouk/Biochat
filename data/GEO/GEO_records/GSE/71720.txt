TITLE
Defining the Roles and Regulation of the GATA-factor ELT-2 in the C. elegans Endoderm

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We identified genome-wide sites of occupancy for the intestine-specific transcription factor ELT-2 in L3-staged N2 worm by performing ELT-2 ChIP-seq on whole worms; we performed RNA-seq on L3-staged N2 whole worms

DESIGN
To identify DNA regions of direct ELT-2 occupancy, we performed the following ChIP-seq assays 1) ELT-2 ChIP-seq on L3 staged N2 C. elegans worms; 2) H3K4me3 ChIP-seq on matched L3 staged N2 worms; 3) Mock IgG-only ChIP-seq negative control on L3 stage N2 worms. Input DNA was also sequenced for each replicate. In addition, we performed RNA-seq on two replicates of L3 N2 C. elegans worms.
