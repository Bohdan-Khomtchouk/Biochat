TITLE
Escherichia coli MG1655 gene expression in glucose minimum media

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
M9 glucose minimum media were analyzed for RNA expression. We use this expression information to show that mRNA level correlate with codon efficiency (Boel et al., Nature 2015)

DESIGN
Cells were grown in M9 glucose media until an OD600 of 1 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
