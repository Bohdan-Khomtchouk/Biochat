TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals ABA mediated response in Arabidopsis during gold (Aucl4-) treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis was carried out in root tissue of Arabidopsis seedlings treated with gold (Au) as Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4). This study demonstrated remarkable changes in root transcriptome within the 12 h exposure. Most of the genes differentially expressed were related to glutathione binding, methylations, secondary metabolism, sugar metabolism, ABA, ethylene, auxin related signalling, transport and signal-transduction pathways.

DESIGN
We analyzed root tissue from 6 samples (3 treated, 3 control) using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis Gene 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No technical replicates were performed.
