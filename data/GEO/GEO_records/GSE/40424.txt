TITLE
Expression data regulated by hMOF in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A549 and H1299 cell lines were transfected with hMOF specific siRNA or control siRNA, and Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray was conducted to systematically determine downstream targets regulated by hMOF.

DESIGN
Two NSCLC cell lines (four samples) transfected with hMOF specific siRNA or control siRNA
