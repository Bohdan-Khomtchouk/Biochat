TITLE
MuRF1 regulation of Fenofibrateâ€™s induction of spontaneous cardiac hypertrophy in vivo.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MuRF1 -/- w/ Fenofibrate treatment leads to the reduction of proteolytic and fibrolytic enzymes, increasing hypertrophy

DESIGN
Four strain-matched groups of 3-8 week old mice were investigated: 1) MuRF1 -/- Fenofibrate feed;  2) MuRF1 -/- chow feed; 3) MuRF1 +/+ Fenofibrate feed; 4) MuRF1 +/+ chow feed  at two time points: 1) 3 weeks; 2) 8 Weeks  Biological replicates: Two to three per condition.  Hearts harvested.  One replicate per array.
