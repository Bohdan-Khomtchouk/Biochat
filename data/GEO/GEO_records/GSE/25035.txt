TITLE
The role of p53 in the regulation of miRNA expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the role of p53 in regulating stem cell population (CD24-CD44+) and stemness-associated miRNAs, we first compared miRNA expression profiles between human mammary epithelial cells knocked-down p53 and control cells. We then cross-referenced p53-regulated miRNAs with stemness-associated miRNAs analyzed from expression profiling of sorted CD24-CD44+ and non-CD24-CD44+ cell populations. Further biological experiments were performed with the miRNAs that are altered in CD24-CD44+ stem cell populations and also regulated by p53.

DESIGN
Total RNAs, including miRNAs, were extracted from cells infected with retrovirus expressing shp53 (labeled in Hy3) and vector control (labeled in Hy5). miRNAs were hybridized on Exiqon miRCURY LNA arrays according to the manufacturer's protocol.
