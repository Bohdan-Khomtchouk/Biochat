TITLE
Efficient and quantitative high-throughput tRNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite its biological importance, transfer RNA (tRNA) could not be adequately sequenced due to the abundant presence of post-transcriptional modifications and extensive structure that interfere with cDNA synthesis and adapter ligation. We achieve efficient and quantitative tRNA sequencing by removing base methylations using engineered demethylases and using a highly processive thermo-stable reverse transcriptase without the need for adapter ligation (DMTRT-tRNA-seq). Our method should be applicable for biological investigations of tRNA in all organisms.
