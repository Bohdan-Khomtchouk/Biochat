SUMMARY
Influenza virus infection-induced gene expression changes of regional B cells are mediated at least in part through type I Interferon: Our objective is to determine whether the influenza virus-infection induced gene expression changes in regional lymph node B cells are facilitated at least in part through type I interferon.  Our specific aim is to compare the gene expression profile of highly FACS-purified B cells in the regional lymph nodes of wildtype and IFNR-/- mice prior to and 48h following infection with influenza virus infection and to contrast this expression profile with that of FACS-purified wildtype B cells activated in vitro with IFN-beta +/- anti-CD86 for 12h. Keywords: Infection-induced responses
