Influenza virus infection-induced gene expression changes of regional B cells are mediated in part through type I IFN

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Influenza virus infection-induced gene expression changes of regional B cells are mediated at least in part through type I Interferon: Our objective is to determine whether the influenza virus-infection induced gene expression changes in regional lymph node B cells are facilitated at least in part through type I interferon.  Our specific aim is to compare the gene expression profile of highly FACS-purified B cells in the regional lymph nodes of wildtype and IFNR-/- mice prior to and 48h following infection with influenza virus infection and to contrast this expression profile with that of FACS-purified wildtype B cells activated in vitro with IFN-beta +/- anti-CD86 for 12h. Keywords: Infection-induced responses

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression from mouse lymph node B cells purified by flow cytometric sorting using single channel oligonucleotide microarrays. There were 4 groups: 1) wild type uninfected mice (control group), 2) wild type mice infected with influenza (flu) for 2 days, 3) IFNR-/- mice infected with flu for 2 days, 4) cells stimulated with IFN-b in vitro for 17 h. Each group contained 4 biological replicates obtained from independent experiments. There were 16 total samples and each was measured on a separate array.
