TITLE
Repression of genes for stimulators of glycolysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The overall aim of the present work was to identify MTG16 functions in leukemia cells. Alterations in quantity of the MTG16 co-repressor might affect gene regulation and cell metabolism in malignant cells. Differentiated cells secure energy for cellular homeostasis largely by mitochondrial oxidation. Whereas, mature cells, proliferating tumour cells including leukemia cells depend on glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration may be low even in oxygen–rich environments.The same signal transduction pathways that govern cell proliferation give instructions for nutrient uptake and co-regulate metabolic processes. In this manner, the metabolism of tumor cells, and other highly proliferating cells, is adapted to stimulate anabolic glycolysis–driven processes for incorporation of nutrients into nucleotides, amino acids and lipids to synthesize macromolecules required for growth and proliferation. We used a doxycycline–regulated Tet-On gene expression system to achieve controlled expression of MTG16. A noticeable finding was that the expression of genes for key glycolytic regulators involved in aerobic tumor cell glycolysis was diminished by MTG16.

DESIGN
Total cellular RNA was extracted from Raji/MTG16 Tet-On 3G cells after 8 hours of incubation with 1 mg/ml doxycycline. Cells were collected in triplicates as biological replicates. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit. The quality of RNA was examined by Bioanalyzer.RevertAidTM was used for synthesis of first strand cDNA from 1mg RNA using random primers.Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix expression system at SCIBLU Genomics.
