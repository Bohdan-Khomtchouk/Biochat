TITLE
Expression data from RAW-264.7 cells transfected with empty vector and mouse FoxQ1 expression construct

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcription factor FoxQ1 belongs to family of Fox transcription factors containing forkhead box (winged helix) domain. This family of proteins plays an important role in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Expression of FoxQ1 was found in cancer cells and was associated with increased migration and invasion. Recently, elevated FoxQ1 expression was found in IL4 stimulated macrophages. We used microarrays to clarify the role of FoxQ1 in macrophages

DESIGN
Murine macrophage/monocyte cell line RAW-264.7 was transfected with murine FoxQ1 expression construct in pEF6/V5-His TOPO vector. Five stable clones stably expressing FoxQ1 were compared with four clones expressing empty vector
