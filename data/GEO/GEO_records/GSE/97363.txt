TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression from murine right ventricle subjected to pressure and volume loading (PSPI)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Performed a transcriptome analysis of control right ventricle and right ventricle subject to pressure and volume overload and demonstrated significant enrichment of genes involved in fibrosis with downregulation of metabolism in late stages of disease.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from 4-5 control right ventricles vs. 4-5 pressure and volume overload right ventricles.
