TITLE
CRISPR-Cas9 combinatorial KO of epigenetic regulators in human ovarian cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced polyA mRNA from OVCAR8-ADR-Cas9 cells in which one or two of 3 epigenetic regulators (BRD4, KDM4C, KDM6B) had been knocked out to examine how global gene expression was affected and evaluate potential synergistic effects at a molecular level.

DESIGN
Gene expression data (RNA-Seq) in OVCAR8-ADR-Cas9 cells infected with control vector or vectors expressing gRNAs targeting one of 4 epigenetic regulators (BRD4, KDM4C, KDM6B) with biological replicates.
