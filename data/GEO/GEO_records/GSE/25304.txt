TITLE
Isolation of poplar genes involved in xylem vessel differentiation

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides

SUMMARY
Downstream genes of PtVNS genes were explored with inducible expression system using glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Transgenic poplar plants expressing 35S:AtVND7-VP16-GR were treated with dexamethazone (DEX). A number of genes related to the formation of xylem vessels were induced by DEX.

DESIGN
Total RNAs of the transgenic plants carrying 35S:AtVND7-VP16-GR treated with and without DEX were compared.
