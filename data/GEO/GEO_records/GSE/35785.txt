TITLE
mRNA expression data from AG-haESC, E14 and MEF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Haploid cells are amenable for genetic analysis because they contain only one set of chromosomes.Here,we report the derivation of haESCs from androgenetic blastocysts. These cells, which we designated AG-haESCs, express classical ESC markers, are pluripotent, and contribute to various tissues including the germline upon injection into diploid blastocysts. We used microarrays to compare the gene expression levels among androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cell lines(AG-haESC) E14 and male mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and identified that most paternally imprinted genes were down-regulated and  the maternally imprinted genes were  up-regulated.

DESIGN
To avoid the influence of diploidized cells on the expression profile, we collected samples from FACS of cells at G1/G0 stage by staining Hochest 33342. We used E14,which was a male embryonic stem cell lines, and MEFs isloated from male individuals as control. Gene expression profiles of all the cell lines were analysed on an Affymetrix GeneChip 430 2.0 array.
