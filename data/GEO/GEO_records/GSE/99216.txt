TITLE
Microarray screening of differentially expressed lncRNAs between resting and IL-4 stimulated microglia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To find potential lncRNAs participating in the regulation of microglial polarization, we employed microarray screening to find differentially expressed lncRNAs between resting and IL-4 stimulated primary cultured microglia

DESIGN
The microarray assay was performed using the Mouse LncRNA Array V2.0 (Arraystar) between microglia treated with IL-4 for 24 hr and the untreated control, in triplicate.
