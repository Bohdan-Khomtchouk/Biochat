TITLE
Using Shewanella baltica ecotypes as a model for transcriptional variation

ORGANISM
Shewanella baltica OS155 ; Shewanella baltica OS195 ; Shewanella baltica OS185 ; Shewanella baltica OS223

SUMMARY
Assessment of individual whole cell transcriptional variation among closely related bacterial ecotypes

DESIGN
Here we used 4 replicates each containing 3 independent biological replicates as well as dye swaps per each replicate. We hybridized in a two color format but analyzed in a one color format.
