TITLE
Gene array data from LOX p0 Mouse pups

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lysyl oxidase is an extracellular enzyme essential for crosslinking elastin and collagen. Mice that do not express Lox have 60% and 40% reductions in elastin-specific and collagen-specific crosslinks, respectively. Mutations in LOX are associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD). Lysyl oxidase knockout mice dye perinatally with ruptured diaphragm, tortuous arteries, and TAAD This is the first study to analyze the mechanical and genetic changes induced by the absence of lysyl oxidase in the thoracic aorta, and may provide new therapeutic targets relevant for the pathogenesis of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections

DESIGN
For each sample, ascending and descending aortas from wild type and knockout p0 mouse pups were isolated, pooled in groups of eight, homogenized to isolate RNA, and processed for microarray analysis to identify genes with significantly changed expression between genotypes and/or anatomic location
