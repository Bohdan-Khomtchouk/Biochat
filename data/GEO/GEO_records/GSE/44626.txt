TITLE
Expression data from mock- or LMO3-silenced human preadipocytes isolated from SAT or VAT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we aimed to gain further insight on the role of glucocorticoids (GCs) in adipocyte differentiation. For the future drugability of candidate targets, it is of utmost importance to find factors relevant to human biology. Thus, we analyzed the transcriptome of GC-induced primary human adipose stem cells (hASCs) isolated from paired subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) to identify novel factors downstream of GC action. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression following GC treatment and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Human preadipocytes (human adipose stem cells) were obtained from lipoaspirates or visceral fat biopsies by enzymatic digestions, followed by several steps of centrifugations (Mikkelsen et. al Cell. 2010 Oct 1;143(1):156-69.). Following isolation, human adipose stem cells were transfected with either siCtrl or siLMO3 oligonucleotides, followed by treatment with hydrocortisone.
