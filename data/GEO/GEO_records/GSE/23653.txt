TITLE
Comparative global transcriptomic profiling of mild and severe neurotrauma in an in vitro neuronal model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Traumatic brain injury is one of the common cause of adult permanent disability. As its physio-pathological mechanism has yet to be elucidated, by adopting microarray technique we hope to decipher the novel signaling cascades involved, and if different severity of injury would induce any form of neuronal regeneration.

DESIGN
Microarray was performed on 34 arrays on Illumina Rat Ref12V1 expression beadchips. 6 control samples were adopted as universal controls, and n=3 was used for each time-points (0h, 8h, 15h, 24h and 48h) for Mild neurotrauma and (8h, 15h, 24h and 48h) for Severe neurotrauma. Only one replicate is present for 0h Severe neurotrauma.

PLATFORM
