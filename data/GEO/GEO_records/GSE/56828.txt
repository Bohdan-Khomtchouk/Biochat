TITLE
Expression profile of a parent and ∆lstC strain in regular and high salt conditions

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of the expression profiles of a parent and its derived ∆lstC mutant in normal and high salt conditions. The analysis was performed to determine which genes were altered in the mutant when grown in high salt conditions relative to the parent strain.

DESIGN
Cultures were performed in triplicate and collected during mid-log phase growth in normal and high salt conditions. RNA was extracted for Affymetrix microarray analysis and compared to identify genes significantly altered in their expression using R and Bioconductor.
