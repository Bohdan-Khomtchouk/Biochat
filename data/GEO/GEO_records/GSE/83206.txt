TITLE
Role of N-α-acetyltransferase 10 Protein in DNA Methylation and Genomic Imprinting

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genomic imprinting is an allelic gene expression phenomenon primarily controlled by allele-specific DNA methylation at the imprinting control region (ICR). How allele-specific DNA methylation at ICR is regulated is largely unknown. Mammalian N-α-acetyltransferase 10 protein (Naa10p) catalyzes N-α-acetylation of nascent proteins. Mutation of human Naa10p is linked to severe developmental defects and mental retardation, including the Ogden syndrome. Here we report that Naa10-null mice display partial embryonic lethality, growth retardation, brain disorder and maternal-effect lethality, phenotypes commonly observed in defective genomic imprinting. Genome-wide analyses reveal global DNA hypomethylation and enriched dysregulation of imprinted genes in Naa10p-null embryos and ES cells. Naa10p regulates global DNA methylation by stimulating DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) activity, while maintaining imprinted allele methylation by binding to GCXGXG and recruits Dnmt1. Clinical mutation of Naa10p disrupts its H19-ICR binding and Dnmt1 recruitment. Our study thus links Naa10p mutation-associated human diseases to defective DNA methylation and genomic imprinting.
