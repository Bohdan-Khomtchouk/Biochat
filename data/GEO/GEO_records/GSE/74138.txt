TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of 3 month old all Ret-positive (EGFP-labeled) dorsal root ganglia L345 or L6S1 neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this set is to build expression data using FACS isolated Ret-positive cells harvested from a Ret-EGFP reporter mouse (3 month old).  To enrich for bladder projecting neurons L6S1 DRGs were FACS isolated.  L3,4, 5 lumbar levels were also FACS isolated to aid in differential expression of Ret-positive populations from L6S1 and L345 and help enrich bladder Ret-positive neurons. The series further includes these populations from males and females to uncover sex based differences.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 3 month FACS isolated dorsal root ganglia dissected from Ret-EGFP C57BL/6J mice (EGFP knocked-in Ret locus-heterozyotes) and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
