TITLE
Expression profiling of TSC2 overexpressing cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify the genes regulated by TSC2, gene expression profiling of two clones stably overexpressing TSC2 was performed.

DESIGN
The gene expression profiles of two stable transfectant clones overexpressing the full-length TSC2 in KB cells were compared with the gene expression profile of a vector control clone carrying an empty plasmid.
