TITLE
Histone demethylase JMJD3 disrupts spectrin-dependent cytoskeleton via activation of HKDC1 to suppress Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we established three cell lines that expressed wild type\mutant JMJD3 and the blank vector in panc-1 cells. We did the whole the mRNA expression profiling of these cell lines using affymetrix microarray kit

DESIGN
Total RNA were purified from above mentioned cell lines, and the whole human mRNA expression was profiled using affymetrix microarray

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
