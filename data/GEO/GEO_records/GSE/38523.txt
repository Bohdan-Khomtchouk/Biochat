TITLE
Targets of the small regulatory RNA DapZ

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
To determine the targets of the small regulatory RNA DapZ in S. Typhimurium, we looked at the effect of a short pulse of DapZ over-expression on the Salmonella transcriptome, as well as a DapZ variant that lacks the GcvB-like R1 region. To achieve over-expression, the wild-type DapZ and its variant were cloned in the pBAD plasmid and induced with 0.2% L-arabinose for 10 min. We then extracted the total RNA for transcriptional profiling. A strain carrying the pBAD plasmid w/o insert was used as negative control (also induced by L-arabinose). 2 biological replicates were performed. This sRNA target identification strategy has been described in Papenfort et al; Molecular Microbiology (2006) 62(6), 1674-1688.

DESIGN
We used whole-genome S. typhimurium microarrays to determine relative mRNA expression changes, comparing the mRNA profiles. Microarrays used in this study were produced by in-situ synthesis as 8x15k multipack format from Agilent Technologies. Each microarray comprises 13268 60-mer S. typhimurium strain SL1344 specific oligonucleotides supplemented with 319 60-mer S. enterica subsp. serovar Typhimurium 14028S specific oligonucleotides, 360 60-mer S. typhimurium LT2 specific oligonucleotides and 360 60-mer oligonucleotides specific for 149 Salmonella sRNAs. The experimental design involves the use of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium genomic DNA as the co-hybridized control for one channel on all microarrays. Two independent biological eperiments were analyzed.
