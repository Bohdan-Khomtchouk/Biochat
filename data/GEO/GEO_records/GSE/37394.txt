TITLE
Global gene expression profiles in ovarian cancer linked to Lynch syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Heredity is a major cause of ovarian cancer. Lynch syndrome is associated with 10-12% risk of ovarian cancer, diagnosis at young age and a predilection for endometrioid and clear cell tumors. Global gene expression profiling applied to 25 Lynch syndrome-associated and 42 sporadic ovarian cancers revealed 335 differentially expressed genes and involvement of the mTOR and the MAPK/ERK pathways. The clear cell tumors had distinct expression profiles with upregulation of HER2 and apoptosis signaling pathways. The distinct expression profiles provide clues relevant for hereditary tumorigenesis and may be relevant for therapeutic strategies and refined diagnostics in ovarian cancer linked to Lynch syndrome.

DESIGN
Ovarian cancers linked to Lynch syndrome (n=25) were compared to a matched series of sporadic ovarian cancers (n=42), selected from a population-based consecutive series in which hereditary was excluded based on family history, normal MMR protein staining and lack of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2.
