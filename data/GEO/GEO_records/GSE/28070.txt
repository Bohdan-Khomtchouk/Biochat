TITLE
Transcriptomic response to variation in habitual n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of variation in subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression in response to dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, as assessed in a cohot of individuals with metabolic syndrome. Outcomes from this study provide insight on molecular details of dietary effects on gene expression and metabolic health.

DESIGN
Subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were taken from a cohort of seventeen individuals with metabolic syndrome. Habitual intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was assessed with 3-day weighed food journals.
