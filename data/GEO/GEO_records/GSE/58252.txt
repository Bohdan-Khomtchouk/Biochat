TITLE
Expression data from breast cancer cell line MCF-7 with ectopic expression of the transcription factor Snail

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Snail has been proposed to mediate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and confer mesenchymal invasive phenotype to epithelial cancer cells To analyze the molecular effects of ectopic Snail expression on an epithelial breast cancer cell line, gene expression profiles of MCF-7 cells transfected to overexpress Snail-6SA variant (MCF-7-Snail) and MCF-7 cells transfected with control plasmid (MCF-7-control) were compared. Development of the cell lines has been previously reported by Zhou et al. (PMID: 15448698).

DESIGN
Dataset includes 3 replicate cultures of MCF-7-Snail cells and 3 replicate cultures of MCF-7-control cells
