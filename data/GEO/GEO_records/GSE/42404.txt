TITLE
The side population of human pancreatic cancer expresses cancer stem cell-associated genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To explore the side population (SP) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) for its gene expression profile and its association to cancer stem cells (CSC) and to evaluate the value of genes from its gene signature on patient survival. Experimental design: Side and main population (MP) cells were isolated from 11 human PDAC resection specimens using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) after Hoechst incubation. Total RNA was extracted for whole-genome analysis. A gene signature for the purified SP (pSP; depleted from immune/endothelial CD45+/CD31+ cells) was developed and validated with the nCounter system on expression data of 78 primary PDAC using Cox regression analyses for disease-free and overall survival. Results: An SP was identified in all PDAC samples. Whole-genome expression profiling of pSP revealed upregulation of genes related to therapy-resistance and of CSC-associated genes and pathways. A pSP signature of 32 up- or downregulated genes was capable of discriminating SP from MP in an independent set of 10 PDAC samples, and some contributing genes had a prognostic value in a separate series of 78 patients who underwent surgery for PDAC. Conclusion: Pancreatic cancer contains an SP with chemo-resistant and CSC-associated molecular characteristics. Genes from a newly defined pSP gene signature are related to survival of patients who undergo surgical resection for pancreatic cancer, and might therefore represent potential therapeutic targets.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on SP and MP samples from 11 different human PDAC samples.
