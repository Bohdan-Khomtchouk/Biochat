TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Salmonella enterica serovars Kentucky and Enteritidis in response to acidic conditions

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis ; Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Kentucky

SUMMARY
S. enterica sv Kentucky 3795 and S. enterica sv Enteritidis NalR were grown to mid-log phase in TSB, then subjected to three different acidic conditions generated by two different acids: HCl to pH4.5, HCl to pH5.5 and CH3COOH to pH5.5. After 10min, total RNA was harvested und compared to total RNA harvested from identical control cultures grown in TSB without the pH alteration.

DESIGN
At least three biological replicates were performed for each strain and acidic condition. Total RNAs were harvested, and labeled by the conventional protocol of Brown et al, then hybridized onto a Salmonella-specific PCR product array that covered over 97% of the Enteritidis genome.
