TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of sorted cortical projection neuron subtype specific responses in a mouse model of ALS over the course of disease progression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neocortical hyperexcitability is a prominent feature of inherited and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and is inversely correlated with patient survival. Cell-type specific changes in neuronal function have been proposed to underlie these functional abnormalities and contribute to the selective degeneration of corticospinal and spinal motor neurons. We analyzed the physiological properties of distinct classes of neurons in the motor cortex of hSOD1G93A mice and found that they exhibit robust physiological changes that depend on disease stage. Targeted recordings and in vivo calcium imaging revealed that neurons adapt their properties to normalize cortical excitability as disease progresses. Although different neuron classes exhibited similar functional changes, transcriptional profiling and pharmacological manipulations indicate that the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes are cell-type specific. These widespread, stage-dependent alterations in neuronal function in ALS mice highlight the dynamic changes cortical circuits experience during neurodegeneration and expand potential therapeutic strategies for normalizing circuit function.
