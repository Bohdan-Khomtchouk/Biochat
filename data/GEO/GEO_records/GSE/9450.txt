TITLE
Rice plants infected by Rice blast fungus

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To investigate plant-fungus interactions in early stage of infection, we analyzed response of rice against Magnaporthe grisea infection deficient mutants.  In M. grisea, Mgb1 and Mst12 are essential for development of infection structures.  Deletion of MGB1 results in defect in appresorium formation, and MST12, in penetration peg development. Analysis of gene expression profiles in rice by microarray revealed the mutant-specific and R gene dependent gene expression, strongly suggesting that gene-for-gene interaction commences before the penetration into rice cell. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Agilent rice oligo microarray was used to investigate the gene expression profiling in rice plants infected with Guy11, Mgb1 and Mst12. Total RNAs were isolated from fourth leaves at 24 and 48 hpi. Agilent rice DNA chips were used according to the manufactureâ€™s protocol.  After hybridization, arrays were scanned using an Agilent Microarray Scanner, and Feature Extraction version 9.1 was used for image analysis and data extraction.  Signal intensities derived from inoculated leaved were compared with that of mock-inoculated leaves. In each treatment, the experiment was performed independently three times.
