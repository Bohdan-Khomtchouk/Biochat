TITLE
Rice plants infected by Rice blast fungus

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
To investigate plant-fungus interactions in early stage of infection, we analyzed response of rice against Magnaporthe grisea infection deficient mutants.  In M. grisea, Mgb1 and Mst12 are essential for development of infection structures.  Deletion of MGB1 results in defect in appresorium formation, and MST12, in penetration peg development. Analysis of gene expression profiles in rice by microarray revealed the mutant-specific and R gene dependent gene expression, strongly suggesting that gene-for-gene interaction commences before the penetration into rice cell. Keywords: disease state analysis
