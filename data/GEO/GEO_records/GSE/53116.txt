TITLE
GENE TARGETS OF PALMITATE, OLEATE AND THEIR MIXTURE IN CULTURED LHCN-M2 MYOTUBES

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A global transcriptomic study enables investigating human skeletal muscle gene targets of palmitate versus oleate and the capacity of oleate to alter palmitate-effects.

DESIGN
LHCN-M2 myotubes were treated with 0.5 mM palmitate, 0.5 mM oleate or 0.25 mM palmitate plus 0.25 mM oleate (mixture) or not (controls) for 16 h. Changes in gene expression were analyzed by DNA microarray. The experimental design was a loop with 4 biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL13607 Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
