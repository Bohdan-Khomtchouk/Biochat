TITLE
Primary human fibroblast transcriptome (mRNA) response to wild type MERS-CoV (icMERS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA analysis in primary human fibroblasts infected with wild type MERS-CoV (icMERS).

DESIGN
Human primary fibroblasts were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 5 PFU per cell.  Infected samples were collected in quintuplet; time-matched mocks were collected in quintuplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post-infection. MERSCOV003.0P references the write up of the experimental procedure.
