TITLE
Molar and incisor development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
One of the key questions in developmental biology is how from universally shared molecular mechanisms and pathways, is it possible to generate organs displaying similar or complementary functions, with a wide range of different shapes or tissue organization? The dentition represents a valuable system to address the issues of differential molecular signatures generating specific tooth types. We performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of developing murine lower incisors, mandibular molars and maxillary molars at the developmental cap stage (E14.5) prior to recognizable tooth shape and cusp pattern.

DESIGN
We compared gene expression profiles in developing murine lower incisor and molars, as well as between the lower and upper (mandibular and maxillary) first molars
