TITLE
IL-18 nAbs block deleterious inflammatory cytokines induced by acute β-AR stimulation in heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To directly test whether inhibition of IL-18 by IL-18 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (IL-18 nAbs)  is sufficient for blocking the inflammatory responses of heart caused by acute β-adrenergic insult, mice were subjected to intraperitoneal injection with rat IL-18 nAbs or IgG as a negative control 1hr after isoproterenol treatment.

DESIGN
16 samples. There are 4 groups: vehicle group, mice were subcutaneous injected with a single dose of saline (10 ml/kg body weight), ISO group, mice were subcutaneous injected with a single dose of isoproterenol (5 mg/kg body weight). ISO+IL-18 nAbs group, IL-18 nAbs were intraperitoneally injected (50 μg/ mouse) at 1 hr after ISO injection. ISO+IgG group, rat IgG were intraperitoneally injected (50 μg/ mouse) at 1 hr after ISO injection. The hearts from mice were harvested at 24 hrs after saline or ISO treatment.
