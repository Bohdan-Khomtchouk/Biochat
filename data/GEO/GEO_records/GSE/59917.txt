TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation map of Zebrafish liver

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Using a pooled (n=10) zebrafish liver DNA, we generated base-resolution DNA methylation maps to document epigenetic landscape in zebrafish genome.

DESIGN
Here we generated single-nucleotide resoultion DNA methylation map of zebrafish pooled liver sample using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS)
