TITLE
Comparison of transcriptomes of sig-7 (RNAi) vs WT C. elegans early stage embryos by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
RNAi targeting a conserved C. elegans cyclophilin, sig-7, causes defective development and embryonic arrest consistent with a global defect in transcription. The goal of this study was to compare the transcript levels in sig-7(RNAi) embryos to those of L4440/RNAi control embryos to examine the global transcriptional effect caused by of loss of sig-7 function

DESIGN
Examination of RNA levels using RNAseq in 2 replicate samples each of early embryos from sig-7(RNAi) and RNAi controls
