TITLE
HoxC11 ChIP-seq of LY2 Breast Cancer Cell Line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SRC-1 (NCOA1) is a steroid receptor coactivator that has been associated with various aspects of the progression of breast cancer disease such as tamoxifen resistance, metastasis, cell proliferation and invasiveness.  In a tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cell line (LY2), SRC-1 has been found to interact with the developmental transcription factor HoxC11. ChIP-sequencing of HoxC11 in LY2 cells shows where the transcription factor binds throughout the genome.

DESIGN
LY2 cells were treated with either tamoxifen or vehicle and immunoprecipitated with anti-Hoxc11
