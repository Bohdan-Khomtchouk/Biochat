TITLE
Gene expression during hyper and hypoosmotic stress adaptation in Gillichthys mirabilis

ORGANISM
Gillichthys mirabilis

SUMMARY
This study investigates changes in gene expression associated with adaptation to acute hyper- and hypoosmotic stress in Gillichthys mirabilis gill tissue. Gene expression data was captured as a time course (1, 2, 4, 12 hours past exposure) during the first 12 hours following abrupt transfer to osmotic stress media.
