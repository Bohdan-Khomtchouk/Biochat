TITLE
Gene expression during hyper and hypoosmotic stress adaptation in Gillichthys mirabilis

ORGANISM
Gillichthys mirabilis

SUMMARY
This study investigates changes in gene expression associated with adaptation to acute hyper- and hypoosmotic stress in Gillichthys mirabilis gill tissue. Gene expression data was captured as a time course (1, 2, 4, 12 hours past exposure) during the first 12 hours following abrupt transfer to osmotic stress media.

DESIGN
We employed a custom made Gillichthys mirabilis cDNA microarray. A total of 39 arrays were used in this study: 12 hyperosmotic stress samples, 12 hypoosmotic stress samples, 12 control samples, and 3 time=0 samples. Three individuals were hybridized at each of the four time points (1, 2, 4, 12 hours past exposure) for experimental and control fish (giving a total of 12). All samples were hybridized against a common reference sample containing pooled cDNAs from several individuals.
