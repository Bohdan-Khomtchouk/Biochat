TITLE
Genome-wide copy number variant discovery in dogs using the CanineHD genotyping array

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
This study used the CanineHD genotyping array to investigate copy number variants in the dog genome in a total of 351 samples from 30 different breeds.

DESIGN
In total, 359 samples from 30 different breeds were genotyped on the CanineHD array. Signal intensities from the array were used to assess copy number variants and a supplied clusterfile from Illumina was used as reference file (downloadable at http://supportres.illumina.com/documents/downloads/productfiles/caninehd/caninehd_a.egt ). Eight samples did not fulfill the quality criteria for CNV calling and therefore CNV calling was performed on 351 samples.
