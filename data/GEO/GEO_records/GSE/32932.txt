TITLE
Exon arrays from HeLa cells transfected with GFP-ZRANB2 vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human ZRANB2 mRNA is alternatively spliced to give two variants with different 3’ ends. Both isoforms are present in the nucleus of human cells. ZRANB2 binds to mRNA, as well as the essential splicing factors U170K and U2AF35, and the novel splicing component SFRS17A (formerly known as XE7). It has been shown to alter splicing patterns of Tra2β1 minigene primary transcripts in a dose-dependent manner. It is still unclear what role ZRANB2 plays in the regulation of alternative splicing. To determine the endogenous transcripts that are targeted by ZRANB2 at the genome wide level, we decided to perform exon microarray studies and analyzed the suitability of this method to examine splicing differences in human cells overexpressing a splicing factor.

DESIGN
GFP-ZRANB2 construct containing isoform 2 (short form, SF) of ZRANB2 was used. This construct includes exon 1 through to alternative exon 10. Isoform 2 was chosen since it has been shown previously to affect alternative splicing of a Tra2β1 minigene. HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-ZRANB2, control vector GFP or were left untransfected. RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNA extraction kit. Experiments were run in 5 replicates.
