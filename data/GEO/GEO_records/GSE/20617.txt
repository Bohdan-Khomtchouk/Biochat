TITLE
ChIP-chip from mouse male and female adult livers and P12.5 embryos with H3K27me3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The H3K27me3 is a repressive histone mark associated with repressive chromatin and is important for X chromosome inactivation. ChIP-chip of H3K27me3 along the mouse X chromosome in male and female livers and p12.5 embryos demonstrated that H3K27me3 is absent at the genes that escape X inactivation.

DESIGN
Comparison of H3K27me3 enrichment along the X chromosome in male and female adult livers and P12.5 embryos
