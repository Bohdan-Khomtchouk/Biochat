TITLE
Global transcriptional profiling using RNA sequencing and DNA methylation patterns in highly enriched mesenchymal cells from young versus elderly women.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose:  Identification of relevant genetic pathways that are altered with aging knowing that the precursors for bone-forming osteoblasts reside in the mesenchymal cell population of bone marrow. Method: harvested and characterized, without in vitro culture, mesenchymal cells form human bone marrow capable of osteogenic differentiation Results:  Identification of differentially regulated genes with aging in a highly enriched human bone marrow mesenchymal cell population. Conclusions:  we have for the first time identified age-related differential gene expression and DNA methylation patterns in a highly enriched human bone marrow mesenchymal cell populationprofiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression and DNA methylation patterns from a highly enriched bone marrow mesenchymal cell population from young (mean age, 28.7 years) versus old (mean age, 73.3 years) women
