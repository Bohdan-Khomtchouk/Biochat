TITLE
Whole larvae and nociceptive neuron RNA-Seq samples

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify ion channels, specifically transient receptor potential cation channel A (trpA1) channels, that were highly expressed and enriched in nociceptive sensory neurons of Drosophila larvae. In class IV da sensory neurons, we find that TrpA1 is the most highly expressed trpA1 channel of the 14 trpA1 channels in Drosophila, and that its expression is highly enriched when compared to the whole animal transcriptome.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates of 100 Drosophila melanogaster larval class IV dendritic arborization sensory neurons and five biological replicates of whole Drosophila melanogaster larvae were profiled by mRNA-Seq

PLATFORM
