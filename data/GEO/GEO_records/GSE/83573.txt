TITLE
Ethylene induced phosphorylation of CBP20 is involved in root growth [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report that CBP20 phosphorylation can regulate root growth in ethylene. We examined the gene expression in roots and shoots of wild type (Col) and cbp20 mutant (in Col background). Ethylene is one of the most essential hormones for plant developmental processes and stress responses. EIN2 is a key factor in ethylene signaling pathway and its function is regulated by phosphorylation. However, the phosphorylation regulation in the ethylene signaling pathway is largely unknown. Here we report the phosphorylation of CBP20 is regulated by ethylene, and the phosphorylation is involved in root elongation. The constitutive phosphorylation format of CBP20 rescues the cbp20 root ethylene hyposensitive phenotype, while the constitutive de-phosphorylation format of CBP20 is unable to rescue the root phenotype of cbp20 in response to ethylene. Genome wide study on ethylene regulated gene expression and microRNA expression in the roots and shoots of both Col and cbp20, together with the result of genetics validation suggest that ethylene induced phosphorylation of CBP20 is involved in root growth and one pathway is through the regulation of  microRNAs and their target genes in roots.

DESIGN
Root and shoot mRNA profiles of 3-day old wild type (Col) and cbp20 mutant (in Col background) were generated by sequencing, in 2 replications, using Illumina HiSeq 4000
