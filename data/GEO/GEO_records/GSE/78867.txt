TITLE
The anti-tumor core molecular targets of TSA in cholangiocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Firstly our study demonstrated that TSA can inhibits cell proliferation, induces cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in CCA cell lines in vitro. To identify the target transcripts of TSA to suppress CCA tumorigenesis, mRNA expression profiles were determined by microarray analysis. We chose TFK-1 cells treated by TSA in indicated concentration (IC50) 48 hours for the microarray. Then we found out TACC3 was downregulated, and demonstrated that TACC3 was high expression and may played a role as an target of TSA in inhibiting CCA cells proliferation and migration via in vitro and vivo experiments.

DESIGN
We chose TFK-1 cells treated by TSA in indicated concentration (IC50) 48 hours as the experiment sample and without TSA as the control sample to do this microarray  analysis for three times. Then regulated genes would be tested to investigate the potential roles in CCA tumorigenesis,
