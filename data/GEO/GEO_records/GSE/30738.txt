TITLE
Genome-wide binding map of the HIV Tat protein to the human genome (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The HIV-1 Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat) protein binds to multiple host cellular factors and greatly enhances the level of transcription of the HIV genome.  Here, we report the genome-wide binding map of Tat to the human genome in Jurkat T cells (Jurkat-Tat cells) using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with next-generation sequencing.  cDNA microarray was used to monitor gene expression changes between Jurkat and Jurkat-Tat cells.  Additionally, we compared distribution of H3K9ac near gene promoters between Jurkat and Jurkat-Tat cells using ChIP-chip method and hybridized onto Agilent promoter array.  Our data reveal that Tatâs interaction with the host genome is more extensive than previously thought, with potentially important implications for the viral life cycle.

DESIGN
Expression profiles on Jurkat-Tat cells versus Jurkat cells.   ChIP on chip for H3K9ac in Jurkat-Tat versus Jurkat cells.  ChIP-seq for HIV-1 Tat protein in Jurkat-Tat cells.
