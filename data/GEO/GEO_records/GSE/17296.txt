TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the roxSR and anr mutant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa under aerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
To assess the role of two redox-sensitive transcriptional regulators, RoxSR and ANR, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa under aerobic conditions, microarray analysis was performed. Transcriptome profiles of roxSR mutant and anr mutant aerobically grown in LB medium were determined by Affymetrix GeneChip at both the exponential phase and early stationary phase and compared to that of the wild type strain.

DESIGN
Pseudomonas aeruginosa wild type (PAO1ut), roxSR mutant (ROX1), and anr mutant (PAO6261) strains were cultivated aerobically in LB in Erlenmeyer flasks, and total RNAs were extracted at both the exponential phase (OD600 = 0.3) and early stationary phase (OD600 = 1.4). The experiment was performed in duplicate independent cultures.
