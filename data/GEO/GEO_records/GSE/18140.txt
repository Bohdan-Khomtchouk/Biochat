TITLE
COX-2 network as predictive molecular marker for clinical pregnancy in IVF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CONTEXT Nowadays, the molecular mechanisms involved in endometrial receptivity and implantation are still not clear. OBJECTIVE The gene expression of human endometrium of patients undergoing an IVF treatment with GnRH antagonists/rec-FSH was studied. CONCLUSIONS COX-2 has been extensively studied as a crucial fertility element in both knock-out mice and human. It appears that increased expression of COX-2 and/or SCGB1D2 on the day of oocyte retrieval in GnRH antagonist/rec-FSH stimulated cycles coincides with a lower probability of achieving a clinical pregnancy in this cycle. Keywords: gene expression analysis, clinical pregnancy in IVF stimulated cycles

DESIGN
Endometrial biopsies taken from patients on day of oocyte retrieval in stimulated IVF cycles with 1 or 2 embryos replaced in the same cycle. Gene expression of pregnant patients (n=4) was compared with matched non-pregnant patients (n=4)
