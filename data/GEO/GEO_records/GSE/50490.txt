TITLE
Over-expression of YAP1 in NCI-H716 colorectal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
YAP1 plays importance roles in development of colorectal cancer as evidenced by their overexpression in colorectal cancer and their expression promoted cell proliferation and survival of colorectal cancer cells. In order to understand potential roles of YAP1 in colorectal cancer, we over-expressed constitutively active YAP1 mutant in NCI-H716 colorectal cancer cells and identified and analyzed genes whose expression is activated by YAP1 activation in colorectal cancer.
