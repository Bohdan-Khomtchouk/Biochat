TITLE
Comparison between all runs of a serial repitching in brewery B

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces pastorianus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify differently expressed genes between all 6 runs of brewery B. A run describes the industrial fermentation of brewery wort. By the end of fermentation the yeast slurry is cropped. These cells are reused for inoculation of another cylindro-conical vessel (CCVs).

DESIGN
Results from two loops of two different breweries are summarized in this study. The samples were taken from two serial repitchings of a two breweries. Microarrays were hybridized in a loop approach.
