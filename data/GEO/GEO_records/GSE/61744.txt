TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of PARP1 reveals an interplay with gene regulatory regions and DNA methylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To address the global impact of PARP-1 on DNA methylation, we treated cells with PJ34 (PARylation inhibitor) and isolated genomic DNA from vehicle and PJ34 treated cells. This DNA was bisulfite treated and hybridized to the Illumina infinium Methylation 450 Beadchip. We next used these RNA-seq data sets (control, PARP-1 KD and PARylation inhibited) to assess whether PARP plays a role in DNA methylation by assessing differential methylation patterns. PARP1 mediates methylation patterns.

DESIGN
DNA from vehicle and PJ34 (PARylation inhibited) cells. 750ng of geneomic DNA was bisulfite converted and used for the Illumia infinium HD methylation assay.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
