TITLE
RNA-seq of mitotic and meiotic cells from Drosophila testis

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
we observed distinct profiles of transcriptome-wide 3â€™UTR in the accurately dissected mitotic and meiotic cells of wildtype testes, also in the over-amplifying mitotic germ cells of mutant testes

DESIGN
Triplicate sampling for laser-dissected SG (mitotic germ cells) and SC (meiotic germ cells); duplicate sampling for tut, bam, or bgcn mutant testes(mainly mitotic germ cells)

PLATFORM
GPL17275 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
