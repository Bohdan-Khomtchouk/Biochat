TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) under drought stress during fibre development stages.

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis in cotton during fibre development stages. To study the molecular response of drought stress in cotton under field condition global gene expression analysis was carried out at fibre development stages (0, 5, 10 and 20 dpa/Days post anthesis). Gossypium hirsutum cv. Bikaneri Nerma was used for the gene expression analysis. Cotton plants were subjected to drought stress at peak flowering stage. Samples were collected when the soil moisture content was 19.5% which is 50% of the normal control plots. Gene expression profiles in drought induced and their respective control samples were analyzed using Affymertix cotton Genechip Genome arrays to study the global changes in the expression of genome.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 0 dpa, 5 dpa, fibre bearing ovules of 10 dpa, and fibre bearing ovules of 20 dpa. Samples were collected from both drought induced and control plants. Biotin labeled cRNA was hybridized on Affymertix cotton Genechip Genome array following the Affymetrix protocols. Three biological replicates were maintained.
