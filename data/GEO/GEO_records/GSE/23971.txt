TITLE
Effect of overexpressing E2FB in tomato plants

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The cell cycle transcription factor E2FB has been overexpressed in tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom). This overexpression accelerates plant development and increases fruit yield.

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from true leaves and apical meristem of 14 days-old WT or E2FB-OE seedlings.
