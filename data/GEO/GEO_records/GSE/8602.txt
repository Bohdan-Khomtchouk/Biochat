TITLE
Early responsive genes in human amnion epithelial FL cells induced by N-methyl-N’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The alkylating agent N-methyl-N’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) induces cellular DNA damages and other comprehensive alterations that lead to chromosomal aberrations, mutations, tumor initiations, and cell death. However, the molecular mechanism of MNNG-induced cellular stress remains unclear.We have genome-wide analyzed early transcriptional responses of human FL amnion epithelial cells after exposure to three relatively low doses of MNNG (0.2, 1.0, and 10.0µM),and differential gene expression profiles were obtained 4 h after exposure using oligonucleotide microarrays followed by validation with quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The results demonstrate that the MNNG-responsive genes are involved in multiple cellular biological processes including transcription regulation, signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, cytoskeleton organization, protein synthesis, immune response, metabolism, etc. The possible roles of these genes and their related pathways in MNNG-induced cellular responses were discussed. This study helps to draw the whole picture how cells respond to environmental chemical exposure via transcriptional regulation. Keywords: Dose response
