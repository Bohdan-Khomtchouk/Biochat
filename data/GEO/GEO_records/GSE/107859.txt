TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of glioblastoma cells bearing different IRE1a mutants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most lethal form of glioma with an overall survival at 5 years nearly null, which mainly results from acquired resistance to therapies. Large scale sequencing studies on human cancer biopsies defined IRE1alpha as the fifth most oncogenic mutated kinase in human cancer. IRE1alpha is a major component of the Unfolded Protein Response signaling and increasing evidence suggests that it is a central player in GBM development.

DESIGN
U87-MG glioblastoma cells were transfected with different IRE1a mutants or a Dominant Negative form of IRE1a. Cells transfected with  Empty Vector were used as control. Cells were treated both in basal and stress conditions. For stress condition, tunicamycin (purchased from Calbiochem (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany)) was used at 0.5 Âµg/mL for 16 hrs. There are 3 replicates for each condition, except from the Dominant Negative (2 replicates).
