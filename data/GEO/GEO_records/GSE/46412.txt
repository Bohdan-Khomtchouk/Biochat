TITLE
Expression analysis of Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 WT and ∆arcA mutant

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 ∆arcA mutant, compared to the wild-type strain.  The mutations engineered into this strain produce a strain lacking the ArcA protein. The results are further described in the manuscript The response regulator ArcA uses a diverse binding site architechture to globally regulate carbon oxidation in E. coli

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 WT and three separate cultures of the ∆arcA mutant strain. Each chip measures the expression level of 4,661 genes from Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 with eight 60-mer probes per gene, with each probe represented twice on the array.
