TITLE
Gene expression profile of  high amylolytic enzyme producing mutant strain of Aspergillus luchuensis obtained by ion beam mutagenesis

ORGANISM
Aspergillus luchuensis

SUMMARY
Aspergillus luchuensis is a kuro (black) koji mold that have been used as starch degrader for awamori and shochu making industries in Japan. In this study, we investigated the effect of ion beam irradiation on the A. luchuensis RIB2601 and successfully obtained a high starch degrading mutant strain U1. Strain U1 showed reduced growth rate, whereas showed higher α-amylase, glucoamylase, and α-glucosidase activities per mycelial growth than those of wild type strain both in the agar plate and rice koji. In addition, strain U1 showed higher N-acetylglucosamine content in the cell wall and showed higher sensitivity to calcofluor white, indicating deficient cell wall integrity. Interestingly, the analysis of secreted protein showed higher expression of acid labile α-amylase (AmyA) and glucoamylase (GlaA) in strain U1 although the real-time-RT-PCR analysis indicated that the transcriptional levels of the amyA and glaA genes are not changed significantly. These results suggested that the high amylolytic activity of strain U1 is attributed to the high AmyA and GlaA expression level, but it is not through transcriptional regulation of the amyA and glaA genes. Furthermore, the RNA-seq analysis indicated that strain U1 shows transcriptional change of at least 604 genes related to oxidation-reduction, transport, and glucosamine-containing compound metabolic processes, which may be involved in the deficient cell wall integrity of strain U1.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of Aspergillus luchuensis wild type and its mutant strain U1 were investigated by Illumina HiSeq2000.
