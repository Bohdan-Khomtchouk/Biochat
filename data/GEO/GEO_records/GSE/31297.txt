TITLE
Differential expression of genes after over expression of hsa-miR-128 in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T cells)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was deigned to identify the genes which get altered after the over expression of hsa-miR-128 in HEK293T cells. The HEK293T cells plated in 6-well plate were transfected with 4 micrograms of cloned miR-128 (p128) in three biological replicates.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates of 2 samples were used viz. control HEK293T cells (c), HEK293T cells transfected with 4 micrograms of the cloned hsa-miR-128(t).
