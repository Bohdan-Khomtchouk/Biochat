TITLE
Expression data from BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Melanoma cell lines  were assessed for differences in gene expression patterns between the lines sensitive and resistant to BRAF and MEK inhibitor drugs.

DESIGN
22 BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines were assessed for response to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in a 3 day drug treatment dose response assay. Based on the IC50, 18 lines were found to be responsive to BRAF or MEK inhibition and 4 were resistant. Normalised gene expression data generated from experimental replicate affymetrix arrays was assessed to identify differential patterns of inherent gene expression between the cell lines grouped as drug-responsive or drug-resistant. This were used to idenify specific candidate genes and pathways associated with inherent BRAF/MEK inhibitor drug resistance in melanoma cells.
