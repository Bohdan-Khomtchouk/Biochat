TITLE
PRMT1 interacts with leukemia fusion protein AML1-ETO for activation of transcription and transformation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fusion protein AML1-ETO resulted from t(8;21) translocation is highly related to leukemia development. We have previously shown that the expression of AE9a, a spliced form of AML1-ETO, can rapidly cause leukemia in mouse. To understand how AML1-ETO is involved in leukemia development, we used AE9a leukemia model to identify a novel AE9a interacting proteins PRMT1 (protein arginine methyltransferase 1) from primary leukemic cells expressing AE9a. To examine whether PRMT1 is involved in AE9a-mediated transcription regulation, genome wide gene expression analysis is carried out in hematopoietic cell line K562 (wild type or AE9a expressing) treated with (-) control siRNA or siPRMT1.

DESIGN
Wild type or AE9a-expressing K562 cells with control siRNA or siPRMT1 in triplicate
