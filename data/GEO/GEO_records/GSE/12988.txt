TITLE
Screening of the Paramecium tetraurelia megabase chromosome for autogamy-specific genes

ORGANISM
Paramecium tetraurelia

SUMMARY
Total RNA was extracted at different stages (TV, T0, T11 and T20) during autogamy of strain d4-2. Genes specifically induced during autogamy were identified following analysis of microarray hybridization data
