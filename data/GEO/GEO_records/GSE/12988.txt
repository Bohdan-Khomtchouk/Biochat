TITLE
Screening of the Paramecium tetraurelia megabase chromosome for autogamy-specific genes

ORGANISM
Paramecium tetraurelia

SUMMARY
Total RNA was extracted at different stages (TV, T0, T11 and T20) during autogamy of strain d4-2. Genes specifically induced during autogamy were identified following analysis of microarray hybridization data

DESIGN
3 technical replicates of the time course were hybridized Subset one and three were labelled with Cy3 Subset two was labelled with Cy5
