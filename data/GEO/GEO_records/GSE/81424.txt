TITLE
Identification of an NKX3.1-G9a-UTY regulatory network that controls prostate differentiation (Mouse_4M-Prostate_RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptome of prostate tissue from 4-month-old Nkx3.1 +/+ and Nkx3.1 -/- mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from prostate tissues from 4-month-old Nkx3.1 +/+ and Nkx3.1 -/- mice. Prostate tissues were harvested and processed for RNA isolation and transcriptome analysis using the MagMAX RNA isolation kit (Ambion).

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
