TITLE
Heterogeneity of hypothalamic Pro-opiomelanocortin-expressing neurons revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Arcuate proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are critical nodes in the control of body weight. Often characterised simply as direct targets for leptin, recent data suggest a more complex architecture. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we have generated an atlas of gene expression in murine POMC neurons, and compare the gene expression profiles of individual POMC-expressing neurons to assess the degree of heterogenity present in this cell population.

DESIGN
We isolated one hundred and sixty-three POMC-expressing neurons from the arcuate nucleus of POMC-EGFP transgenic mice using fluorescence activated cell sorting. RNA was extracted from individual neurons and subjected to RNA sequencing, after which the gene expression profiles of the individual Pomc-expressing neurons were compared.
