TITLE
RNASequencing of nf-yc, hy5, and nf-yc hy5 mutants during photomorphogenic growth in Arabidopsis thaliana.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Purpose: The purpose of this RNA Sequencing project was to investigate the transcriptional regulatory relationship between NF-YC3/4/9 and HY5 Methods: Total RNA was isolated, and then poly-A purified. 100ng of starting RNA was used to generate RNASeq libraries using the NEXTflex Illumina qRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 machine. Results: NF-YC3/4/9 and HY5 have both shared and independent regulatory targets.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 7-day old Wild Type (WT), nf-yc triple (Q3), hy5, and nf-yc triple hy5 (Q3hy5) seedlings grown in continuous white light were generated from two biological replicates through paired end deep sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL17639 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
