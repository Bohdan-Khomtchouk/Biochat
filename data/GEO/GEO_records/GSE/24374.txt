TITLE
Global Analysis of the Transcriptional Response of Whitefly to Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl China Virus (TYLCCNV)

ORGANISM
Bemisia tabaci

SUMMARY
We investigated the transcriptional response of invasive B. tabaci B biotype to tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) using Illumina sequencing technology. We found that 1,606 genes involved in 157 biochemical pathways were differentially expressed in the viruliferous whiteflies.

DESIGN
Culture of B biotype whitefly was maintained on cotton plants. Three thousands of newly emerged adults of whitefly on cotton were released onto the leaves of healthy and viruliferous tobacco plants. They were allowed to feed for 24 h. After that, non-viruliferous and viruliferous whiteflies were transferred respectively to cotton plants in different cages and allowed to feed for 120 h. Then approximately 1,000 non-viruliferous and viruliferous female adults of whitefly were collected, respectively. The RNA was extracted and sequenced using Illunima Analyzer II.
