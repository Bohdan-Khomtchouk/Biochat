TITLE
Comparison of noncoding RNA profiles in RNA from ovarian cancer patient samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used NCode Human Long Non-coding RNA microarray  to study differential expression of noncoding RNAs in tumor samples from patients with ovarian cancer. Normal ovarian tissue samples were used as controls.

DESIGN
Normal ovarian tissue isolated RNA (n=11) and Ovarian tumor tissue isolated RNA (n=29) was used to profile the expression of longnoncoding RNAs.
