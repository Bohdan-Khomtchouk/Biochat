TITLE
Identification of ZEB1-regulated gene expression changes in HCC827 human lung adenocarcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed next-generation RNA sequencing for HCC827 human lung adenocarcinoma cells that are stably transfected with pcDNA3.1-ZEB1 or an empty pcDNA3.1 vector plasmid, in triplicate for each of the two HCC827 cell transfectants. The goal of this experiment is to identify putative downstream mediators of ZEB1 in human lung cancer cells. By successfully acquiring about 25 million reads for each sample, we identified more than 1,700 transcripts that are significantly regulated by ZEB1 (increased or decreased by ZEB1; p < 0.05). Among these genes, 87 of them are predicted direct targets for microRNA-200c, a well-established transcription target of ZEB1. Our results will be useful for further identification of genes that mediate the biological functions of ZEB1 in human lung cancer cells.
