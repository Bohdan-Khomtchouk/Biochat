TITLE
A probiotics strain attenuating the effects of aspirin in the gut

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of partially degraded and fragmented RNA samples from mus musculus gut Global gene expression profiling has shown the gut transcripts changes through administration of aspirin while probiotics strain administration beforehand attenuates the effect more than teprenone.

DESIGN
We analyzed five groups of mice gut using the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No techinical replicates were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
