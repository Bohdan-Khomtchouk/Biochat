TITLE
Gene Expression and evolution of antifungal drug resistance

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We examined the gene expression changes resulting from the evolution of resistance in experimental populations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae subjected to two antifungal drugs, fluconazole (FLC) and amphotericin B (AmB). Fluconazole resistance may involve increased efflux or changes in sterol metabolism, while AmB resistance generally involves changes in sterol metabolism; for all of these types of resistance, the gene expression changes are extensive. The goal of these experiments was to test whether failure of gene expression changes all downstream of the original mutation for drug resistance would affect the ability of a mutant cell to evolve and/or to support a drug-resistant phenotype.
