TITLE
Expression data from three types of spermatogonial stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Multipotent spermatogonial stem cells (mSSCs) derived from SSCs are a potential new source of individualized pluripotent cells in regenerate medicine such as ESCs. We hypothesized that the culture-induced reprogramming of SSCs was mediated by a mechanism different from that of iPS, and was due to up-regulation of specific pluripotency-related genes during cultivation. Through a comparative analysis of expression profile data, we try to find cell reprogramming candidate factors from mouse spermatogonial stem cells. We used microarrays to analyze the gene expression profiles of culture-induced reprogramming converting unipotent spermatogonial stem cells to pluripotent spermatogonial stem cells.

DESIGN
Three types of spermatogonial stem cells were mechanically collected according to morphological criteria for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
