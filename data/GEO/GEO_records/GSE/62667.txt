TITLE
A genomic classifier improves prediction of metastatic disease within 5 years after surgery in node-negative high-risk prostate cancer patients managed by radical prostatectomy without adjuvant therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine whether adding Decipher to standard risk stratification tools (CAPRA-S and Stephenson nomogram) improves accuracy in prediction of metastatic disease within 5 years after surgery in men with adverse pathologic features after RP.

DESIGN
The study population consisted of 182 patients selected from 2,641 men who underwent RP at the Cleveland Clinic between 1987-2008 who met the following criteria: 1) preoperative PSA > 20 ng/mL, stage pT3 or margin positive, or Gleason score > /8; 2) pathologic node negative; 3) undetectable post-RP PSA; 4) no neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy; and 5) minimum of 5 years follow-up for the controls.
