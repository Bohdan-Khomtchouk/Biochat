TITLE
Molecular characterization of a cryptochrome in Neurospora crassa

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
Cryptochromes were identified in plants and animals where they function as either photoreceptors or circadian clock components. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora, the biological function of cryptochrome has not yet been explored. Here, we demonstrate that Neurospora crassa cryptochrome (Nc cry) is a DASH-type of cryptochrome, capable of  binding FAD and MTHF, whose transcript and protein levels are both strongly induced by blue light in a wc-1 dependent manner. Although the Nc cry transcript is circadian-regulated and antiphasic to frq, knockout strains of Nc cry appears to have a normal clock phenotype. Whole genome microarray and RT-QPCR analysis confirm that Nc cry is not involved in the signal transduction of either early or late light responses and seems to have no transcriptional regulatory activity under our laboratory conditions. Our study concludes that the only cryptochrome in Neurospora crassa is dispensable for the well-characterized blue light sensing cascade and is not part of the circadian clock system. Keywords: light response

DESIGN
Two-color microarray. Alexa Fluor 555 was consistently used to label cDNA synthesized from reference RNA, which is a mixture containing equal amounts of RNA samples harvested from different circadian time points and light treatment durations. The same batch of pooled RNA was used as a reference for each array experiment. Alexa Fluor 647 was used exclusively to label cDNA representing sample RNA.
