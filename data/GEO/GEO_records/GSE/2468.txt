ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients were recruited at the Hospital do Cancer AC Camargo (São Paulo/Brazil),  Instituto de Enfermedades Neoplasicas - INEN (Lima, Peru), Hospital Araujo Jorge (Goiania, Brazil) and Hospital Heliopolis (São Paulo, Brazil).All patients signed a pre-informed consent and the study was approved by the internal ethics committee. Tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen . Before RNA extraction histopathological diagnosis was re-confirmed, all samples were micro-dissected and only tissues with at least 70% of tumor cells and no visible infiltrating inflammatory cells were used as tumor. Morphologically disease-free tissue obtained from surgical margins was considered as normal. A total of 38 samples were analyzed: 8 normal tissues, 10 goiters, 10 adenomas and 10 papillary carcinomas. Keywords: other
