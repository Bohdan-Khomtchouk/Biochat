Breast cancer cell lines treated with eribulin and paclitaxel

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eribulin mesylate is a synthetic macrocyclic ketone analog of the marine sponge natural product halichondrin B. Eribulin is a mechanistically unique inhibitor of microtubule dynamics, leading to inhibition of microtubule growth in the absence of effects on microtubule shortening at microtubule plus ends, and formation of nonproductive tubulin aggregates. In this study, we investigated whether selective signal pathways were associated with eribulin activity compared to paclitaxel, which stabilizes microtubules, based on gene expression profiling of cell line panels of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer in vitro.

DESIGN
27 breast cancer cell lines treated with eribulin and paclitaxel for 24 hours at concentration 10xIC50. Three technical replicates were included. for eribulin , paclitaxel and untreated cell lines.
