TITLE
Gene expression in Su(Hw) null larvae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We examined the effects of loss of su(Hw) on gene expression in both carefully staged 3rd instar larvae (selected at the soft white pre-pupae stage) and wing imaginal discs from these animals.  su(Hw) null animals were generated by crossing su(Hw)v mutants with a deficiency (Df(3R)ED5644), homozygous individuals were recognised be the lack of the dominat Tb marker carried on the TM6B marker. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
RNA from null larvae was compared with a pool of RNA extracted from wild type (Oregon R) larvae at the same stage.  To control for genetic background we also examined su(Hw)v and Df(3R)ED5644 heterozygotes with the pool - thus 3 genotypes were examined.  For each genotype, 4 independent biological replicates were performed - 2 of these dye swapped with respect to the other two.  The same experimental design and gentoypes were used for the analysis in dissected wing imaginal discs.
