TITLE
Gene expression changes in Nicd induced wing disc hyperplasia

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The outcome of Notch proliferation on proliferation depends on the context. In Drosophila wing imaginal discs Notch activation causes hyperplasia despite having localized inhibitory effects on proliferation. To understand te underlying mechanisms we have used genomic strategies to identify the Notch-Su(H) target genes during wing discs hyperplasis. these data are the results from expression profiling the RNAs from hyperplastic wing discs overexpressing Nicd.

DESIGN
Direct comparison of third instar lavae wing imaginal disc Nicd (abxUbxFLPase; Act > y > Gal4, UAS GFP; FRT82B tubGal80 with UAS-Nicd; FRT82B) vs control (abxUbxFLPase; Act > y > Gal4, UAS GFP; FRT82B tubGal80 with FRT82B ). 4 Biological replicates, the 2nd replicate was performed as a dye-swap.

PLATFORM
