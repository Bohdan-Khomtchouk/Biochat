TITLE
Gene expression profiles induced by overexpression of PDEF in MCF10A mammary epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent studies suggest that PDEF is required for secretory cell differentiation in several epithelial tissues. To investigate PDEF in the mammary gland, we examined the effect of this transcription factor on gene expression using microarray based profiling of MCF-10A cells. These cells are non-transformed mammary epithelial cells that express protein and gene expression programs of basal epithelial cells and undetectable levels of endogenous PDEF. Bioinformatics analysis of the genes induced or repressed by PDEF overexpression in MCF10A cells revealed a striking effect on expression of luminal and myoepithelial cell markers.

DESIGN
Six samples were harvested 26 hours after retroviral infection with either vector control or PDEF.  Each condition was performed in triplicate.
