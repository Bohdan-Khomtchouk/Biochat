TITLE
An Interaction between RRP6 and SU(VAR)3-9 Targets RRP6 to Heterochromatin and Contributes to Heterochromatin Maintenance in Drosophila melanogaster [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have investigated the effect of RRP6 depletion on the transcriptome of S2 cells using Affymetrix whole-genome tiling arrays. We have also carried out Illumina ChIP-seq analysis of RRP6 genome occupancy in control S2 cells (GFP-KD) and in cells depleted of SU(VAR)3-9.

DESIGN
8 samples total; 4 RNA-Seq samples (1 RRP6-KD and 1 GFP-KD, 2 biological replicates each); and 4 ChIP-Seq samples (RRP6 IP in GFP-KD and in Su(var)3-9-KD conditions; plus their respective Input samples).

PLATFORM
GPL17275 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
