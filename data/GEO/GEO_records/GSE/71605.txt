TITLE
Global changes in gene expression in Caco-2 cell line by treatment with extract from iodine-biofortified carrot and lettuce

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarray data were analyzedÂ to describe the changes in gene transcription profile in human Caco-2 cancer cells under the influence of the extract from iodine-biofortified and non-fortified carrot and lettuce. These iodine-biofortified vegetables can be used as a functional food.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment: iodine-biofortified carrot, non-fortified carrot, iodine-biofortified lettuce, non-fortified lettuce vs. Caco-2 colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line.    Three biological replicates and three technical replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL17077 Agilent-039494 SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray 039381 (Probe Name version)
