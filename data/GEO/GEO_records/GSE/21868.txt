TITLE
gene expression analysis in different tissues of Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)

ORGANISM
Linum usitatissimum

SUMMARY
We developped a new oligo microarray platform to analyse flax transcriptome. Here, we validated this microarray on several tissues of flax, at different developmental stages.

DESIGN
30 chips study using total RNA from 9 different tissue samples of Flax (Leaf sample at green capsule stage, stem inner tissue at vegetavie stage, stem outter tissue at vegetative stage, stem inner tissue at green capsule stage, stem outter tissue at green capsule stage, roots, embryos of 10, 20 and 40 days after flowering) for an overall survey of microarry accuracy and total RNA from 6 stem tissue at green capsule stage (3 of the cultivar 'Belinka' and 3 of the cultivar 'Drakkar') for an analysis of biological replicates reproducibility.
