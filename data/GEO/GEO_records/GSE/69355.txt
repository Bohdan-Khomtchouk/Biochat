TITLE
Cardiac LXRα protects against pathological cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction by enhancing glucose uptake and utilization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene profiling analysis was performed to investigate the molecular basis for the cardioprotective effect of cardiac-specific LXRα overexpression.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from left ventricular tissue from cardiac LXRα transgenic mice (LXRα-Tg) and wild type littermates subjected to 5 weeks of either transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham surgery; n=3/group.
