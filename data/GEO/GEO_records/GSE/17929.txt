TITLE
Expression data from rat (Sprague Dawley) brain subjected to MCAo.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in rat represent the ischemic stroke in human. Rodents subjected to MCAo and treated with venom phospholipase A2 showed reduction in infarct volume after 24hours of stroke. We studied the global gene expression of the reduction in infarct volume using Affymetrix Gene Chips. We analysed all the genes that were up or down regulated in the study.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from sham, MCAo and MCAo+nPLA rat brains, was pooled to minimize inter-individual variation and hybridized to each array of the RAE-230A or U34A GeneChipTM according to protocols described in the GeneChipTM expression analysis package (Affymetrix, CA).
