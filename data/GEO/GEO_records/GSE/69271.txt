TITLE
mRNA expression profile in DLD-1 and MOLT-4 cancer cell lines cultured under Microgravity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DLD-1 and MOLT-4 cell lines were cultured in a Rotating cell culture system to simulate microgravity and mRNA expression profile was observed in comparison to Static controls Simulated microgravity affected the solid tumor cell line DLD-1 markedly which showed a higher percentage of dysregulated genes compared to the hematological tumor cell line, MOLT-4. Microgravity affects the cell cycle of DLD-1 cells and disturbs expression of cell cycle regulatory gene networks. Multiple microRNA host genes were dysregulated and significantly, mir-22, tumor suppressor microRNA, is highly upregulated in DLD-1.

DESIGN
Cells were grown in 10mL rotating vessels in an RCCS and in 60mm Petri dishes (test, control respectively).Two replicates of test (Microgravity) and control (static), each from DLD-1 and MOLT-4  were analyzed by microarray.
