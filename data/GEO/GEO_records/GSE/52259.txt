TITLE
Expression data from the Schizosaccharomyces pombe opi10- strain.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Opi10 is the S. pombe homolog of human Hikeshi, which imports Hsp70s into the nucei during the heat shock. We compared the gene expression of the S. pombe opi10+ and opi10- strains before, during and after the heat shock.

DESIGN
RNA were extracted from the S. pombe opi10+ and opi10- strains cultured at 30C, heat treated for 1 h at 43C, and then cultred for 1 and 3 h at 30C, and analyzed using Affymerix DNA microarrays.
