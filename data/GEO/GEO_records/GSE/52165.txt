TITLE
Nucleosomal chromatin in the mature sperm of Drosophila melanogaster.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Nucleosomal chromatin persists in the mature sperm of Drosophila melanogaster. Paternal epigenetic marks of repression and active transcription are found within many genes essential for embryogenesis. These marks are delivered at fertilization and are subsequently maintained in the early embryo.

DESIGN
The detection and localization of nucleosomal DNA in D. melanogaster spermatozoal chromatin.
