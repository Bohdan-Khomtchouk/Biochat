TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional targets of KLF15 in human airway smooth muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We previously demonstrated that the transcription factor, KLF15, is a glucocorticoid-regulated gene that represses primary human airway smooth muscle (ASM) proliferation. Here, we show that KLF15 also represses ASM hypertrophy. To uncover the mechanistic basis for these effects, we integrated transcriptome data from KLF15 over-expression with genome-wide analysis of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) occupancy (i.e. ChIP-seq). This led us to identify PLCD1 as both a KLF15-regulated gene and a repressor of ASM hypertrophy.

DESIGN
Genome-wide transcriptional targets of KLF15 in human airway smooth muscle cells were determined by RNA-seq in cells transduced with a KLF15-expressing adenovirus (Ad-KLF15) compared to a control adenovirus (Ad-GFP).
