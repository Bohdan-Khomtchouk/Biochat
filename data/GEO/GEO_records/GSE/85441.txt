TITLE
Comparison of RNA Pol II localization in the genomes of sig-7 (RNAi) vs WT C. elegans early stage embryos

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
RNAi targeting a conserved C. elegans cyclophilin, sig-7, causes defective development and embryonic arrest consistent with a global defect in transcription. The goal of this study was to compare the location of RNA Pol II in sig-7(RNAi) embryos to the localization in L4440/RNAi control embryos to examine the global effect of loss of sig-7 on RNA Pol II regulation and its distribution within gene bodies

DESIGN
anti-AMA-1 ChIP in 2 replicates each of sig-7(RNAi) and RNAi control early stage embryos

PLATFORM
GPL13657 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Caenorhabditis elegans)
