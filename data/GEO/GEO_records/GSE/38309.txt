TITLE
Expression data from A549 cells after treatment with flagellin and transforming growth factor beta 1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have examined the changes in gene expression aftert reatment  of A549 cells, a cultured alveolar epithelial cells, with flagellin and transforming growth factor beta 1. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from A549 cells after treatment with purified flagellin or transforming growth factor beta 1 receptor.  The analysis indicated that flagellin induced a change in gene expression that was similar to the changes induced by transforming growth factor 1.

DESIGN
A549 cells were treated with flagellin or transforming growth factor 1 for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed to cDNA. Synthesized cDNA was fragmented and labeled with biotin.   The biotinylated cDNA was hybridized to to an Affymetrix GeneChip Array, and probe signal intensities were captured.
