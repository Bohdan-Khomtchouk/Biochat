TITLE
Gene expression in the hypothalamus that responds to STZ-induced type 1 diabetes and can be reversed by central leptin action

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Central leptin action is sufficient to restore euglycemia in type 1 diabetes via an insulin-independent manner. To examine the mechanism in the hypothalamus at the transcription level, numerous genes that showed expression changes to STZ-induced type 1 diabetes and were reversed by central leptin action were identified.

DESIGN
Hypothalamus tissues from control mice, mice with STZ-induced type 1 diabetes, and mice with STZ-induced type 1 diabetes corrected by central leptin infusion were used.
