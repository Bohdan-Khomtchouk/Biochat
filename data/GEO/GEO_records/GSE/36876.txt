TITLE
affy_cotton_2011_12 - Comparative transcriptional profiling of cotton fibers in Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense using EST pyrosequencing and microarray hybridization

ORGANISM
Gossypium barbadense ; Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
affy_cotton_2011_12 - affy_cotton_2011_12 - In this study we characterized the fiber transcriptomes of the two species, Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense that were parental genotypes of a RIL mapping population used previously for phenotypic QTL and expression QTL mapping., We used 454 deep pyrosequencing to characterize cDNAs from developing fibers at two key developmental time-points; 10 and 22 days post anthesis. A unigene set was assembled and annotated, and differential digital gene expression was assessed from the different time-point and genotype representations of the reads within assembled contigs. As a complementary approach, we conducted microarray-based hybridization profiling using the cotton Affymetrix gene chip and labeled cDNAs from fibers at 11 dpa and for the same two genotypes and compared differentially expressed genes identified by the two platforms. The 454 unigenes were also mined for the presence of microsatellite repeats and SNPs that will be useful markers for mapping and marker-assisted selection in cotton improvement.-Total RNA was extracted from 11 dpa-old fibers from the two genotypes, Guazuncho 2 (Gossypium hirsutum) and VH8-4602 (G. barbadense), and included two replicates of each. RNA was checked for quality and quantity using an Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA, http://www.home.agilent.com ) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The RNA was sent to the Australian Genome Research Facility Ltd. ( http://www.agrf.org.au, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) for labeling and hybridization to the Affymetrix Genechip® Cotton Genome Array (21,854 genes) (Affymetrix, http://www.affymetrix.com/ ). -
