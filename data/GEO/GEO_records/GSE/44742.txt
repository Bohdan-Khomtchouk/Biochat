TITLE
Genetic differences underlying chromatin discordance between monozygotic twins [FAIR-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Open chromatin is implicated in regulatory processes, and thus variation in chromatin structure may contribute to variation in gene expression and other molecular phenotypes. In this work, we performed a targeted deep sequencing to identify somatic mutations and genetic polymorphisms underlying accessible chromatin in the genomes of 72 monozygotic twins.

DESIGN
Open chromatin sequencing based on FAIRE assay for 36 pairs of monozygotic twins

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
