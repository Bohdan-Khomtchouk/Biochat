TITLE
Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Exploit the Immune Response Mediating Chemokines to Impact the Phenotype of Glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Four human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) clones (MSC-1, MSC-2, MSC-3, MSC-4) and three different glioblastoma multiformae (GBM) cell lines (U87-MG, U251, U373) were used to study their mutual paracrine interactions in the indirect co-cultures compared to their monocultures, which were grown under the same experimental conditions. The effects on cell growth, proliferation and invasion in matrigel were quantified. Further on, bioinformatic tools were used to relate these results to the data obtained from cytokine macroarrays and DNA microarrays that revealed proteins and genes significantly involved in the interaction. We showed that hMSC are responsible for the impairment of GBM cell invasion and growth, possibly via induction of their senescence. On the other hand, U87-MG cells even more strongly inversely affected some of these characteristics in hMSCs. We found several chemokines that may account for changed co-cultured cellsâ€™ phenotype, affecting genes associated with proliferation and senescence. CCL2/MCP-1 was collectively identified as the most significantly regulated chemokine during hMSC and U87-MG paracrine signalling. Its role in U87-MG cell invasion was also functionally confirmed. Microarray data deposited here contain gene expression data from three biological replicates of monocultures and indirect co-cultures of MSC-4 and U87-MG cells, representing 12 microarrays.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of four cell set-ups were performed: MSC-4 monoculture, U87-MG monoculture, MSC-4 co-cultured with U87-MG (in Boyden chambers) and U87-MG co-cultured with MSC-4 (in Boyden chambers).
