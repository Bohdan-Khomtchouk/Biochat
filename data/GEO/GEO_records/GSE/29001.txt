TITLE
Identification of Unique Therapeutic Targets in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We utilized tissue microdissection and expression microarrays to measure ex vivo gene expression profiles in twelve cases of patient-matched normal basal epithelial cells, normal differentiated squamous epithelium, and cancer.

DESIGN
The data set from the precisely-dissected, dividing basal cell layer was used as a ‘biological filter’ to identify genes that were specifically dysregulated in tumors, and not simply increased as a consequence of normal growth.
