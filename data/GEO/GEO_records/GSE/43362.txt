TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of PA1 teratoma cells transfected by RIPK1, RIPK2, RIPK3, or RIPK4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RIPK4 but not the related kinases RIPK1, RIPK2, and RIPK3 caused similar transcriptional changes to Wnt3a.

DESIGN
PA1 cells were transfected by 8ug RIPK1, RIPK2, RIPK3, or RIPK4 for 48h, RNA were extracted and sequenced.
