TITLE
Differentially expressed gene profiles in CA 9-transfected C33-A, human cervix carcinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA 9) is a transmembrane isoform of carbonic anhydrase (CA) that contributes to an acidification of tumor microenvironment. The expression of CA 9 in cervical tumors was shown to be strongly involved in high incidence of metastasis and poor prognosis. To search for the key regulators of metastasis related to ectopic expression of CA 9, we investigated differentially expressed gene profiles in CA 9- transfected cervix carcinoma cell line C33-A (CF) compared with mock-transfected (CP) cell line, using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.

DESIGN
CF and CP stable cell-lines trasfected respectively with full-length human CA 9 cDNA cloned into the vector pcDNA3.0 and empty vector control were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on affymetrix microarrays.
