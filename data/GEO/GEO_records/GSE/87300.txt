TITLE
Human intervention study to assess the effects of supplementation with olive leaf extract on peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Olive oil is correlated to long life and low rates of cancers and cardiovascular disease. The health benefits of the oil is contributed to the polyphenols. The polyphenols in olive leaf are simialr bit in high concentrations. We wanted to uncover whether measurable changes would occur with supplementation in human participants. we used affymetrix arrays to measure the gene expression changes with olive leaf extract compared to placebo control.

DESIGN
Intervention trial- parallel 8 week

PLATFORM
GPL13667 [HG-U219] Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array
