TITLE
Identification of long noncoding RNAs regulated by p53

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analyize the transcriptpme regulated by p53 in 3 pairs of isogenic p53WT and p53KO colorectal cancer cell lines untreated or treated with Doxorubicin. The hypothsis of this study is that p53 can regulate the expression of subset of lncRNAs to mediate its biological functions.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 3 pairs of isogenic colon cancer cell lines; HCT116-p53_WT and p53_KO; RKO-p53_WT and p53_KO: and SW48-p53_WT and p53_KO. Cells were untreated or treated with Doxorubicin (DOXO) at a final concentration of 300 nM for 16 hours.
