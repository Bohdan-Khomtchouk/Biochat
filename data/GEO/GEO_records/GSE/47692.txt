TITLE
Genomic variation and adaptation in fragmented landscapes

ORGANISM
Melitaea cinxia

SUMMARY
We have compared allelic and gene expression variation using individual-based RNA-seq data from four regional populations of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in northern Europe. Two of the populations represent fragmented habitat and two continuous habitat. Based on sequence information, we constructed genealogy for four populations. Based on gene expression, we found 1841 genes to be differentially expressed between two different landscape types. Our results demonstrate genomic adaptations to living in fragmented landscapes, which are likely to be related to phenotypic life-history adaptations that have been documented for many species.

DESIGN
RNA-seq from thorax, 174 individuals from four populations.
