Functional and epigenetic studies reveal multistep differentiation and plasticity of in vitro and in vivo follicular T helper cells

SUMMARY
Follicular T helper cells (Tfh) provide critical help to B cells for germinal center (GC) formation. Mutations affecting SLAM-associated Protein (SAP) prevent GC formation due to defective T-B cell interactions, yet effects on Tfh cell differentiation remain unclear. We describe the in vitro differentiation of functionally-competent “Tfh-like” cells that expressed Interleukin-21, Tfh markers, and Bcl6, and rescued GC formation in SAP-deficient hosts better than other T helper (Th) cells. SAP-deficient Tfh-like cells appeared virtually indistinguishable from wildtype, yet failed to support GCs in vivo. Interestingly, both Tfh-like and in vivo-derived Tfh cells could produce effector cytokines in response to polarizing conditions. Moreover, Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells could be reprogrammed to obtain Tfh characteristics. ChIP-Seq analyses revealed positive epigenetic markings on Tbx21, Gata3 and Rorc in Tfh-like and ex vivo Tfh cells, and Bcl6 in other Th cell populations, supporting the concept of plasticity between Tfh and other Th cells.

DESIGN
Epigenetic modifications were evaluated in ChIP-Seq studies by profiling histone H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation marks between Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh-like, and CXCR5+PD-1+ sorted Tfh-like in vitro generated T helper cell populations and ex vivo derived Tfh cells.
