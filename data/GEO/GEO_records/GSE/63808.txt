TITLE
chronic temporal lobe epilepsy: biopsy hippocampus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of biopsy hippocampal tissue of patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergoing neurosurgical removal of the epileptogenic focus for seizure control. Chronic TLE goes along with focal hyperexcitability. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms that may play a role in seizure propensity

DESIGN
129 human hippocampus samples
