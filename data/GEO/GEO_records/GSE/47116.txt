TITLE
Ablation of Pten and Smad4 leads to metastatic lung carcinoma in a murine model.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in both men and women in the United States.  Recently, Smad4 was discovered to be common somatic alteration in human squamous cell lung cancer. Our goal was to delineate the role of Smad4 in lung cancer. We have shown for the first time that the ablation of Pten and Smad4 in the murine airway epithelium harbors a metastatic proximal adeno-squamous lung cancer.

DESIGN
knockout group (PTENd/d and SMAD4d/d) and control group
