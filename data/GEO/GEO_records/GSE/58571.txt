TITLE
Expression data from sodium butyrate treated A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As a histone deacetylase inhibitor, sodium butyrate involves in cellular events such as proliferation, differentiation,apoptosis and cell cycle control via reprogramming gene expression. However, the target genes associated with the cell cycle control and molecular signaling triggering cell apopotosis and death are not well elucidated.

DESIGN
Here, we treated A549 cells, a cell line belong to the non-small cells lung cancer, with high concentration of sodium butyrate and then used microarray detail the global reprogramme of gene expression and identified differentially-expressed genes during this process.
