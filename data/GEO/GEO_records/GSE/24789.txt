TITLE
Expression data from mouse ovarian surface epithelium cells at different stages of malignancy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ovarian cancer is one of the most deadly cancers accounting for only 3% of diagnosed cancers, but is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among woman; however, the progression of ovarian cancer is poorly understood.  To study and further understand the early events that lead to epithelial derived ovarian cancer, we previously developed a cell model of progressive ovarian cancer. Mouse ovarian surface epithelial (MOSE) cells have undergone spontaneous transformation in cell culture and represent pre-neoplastic, non-tumorigenic to an aggressive malignant phenotype. Microarray analysis was performed with RNA isolated from different stages of MOSE cells to examine changes in gene expression as MOSE cells transition from a pre-neoplastic to a malignant state.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from MOSE early cell representing a pre-neoplastic, non-malignant stage, MOSE Intermediate cells representing a noeplastic, pre-invasive state, and MOSE Late cells representing a malignant, invasive stage.  Three biological replicates were used to take into account variations within the heterogeneous cultures.
