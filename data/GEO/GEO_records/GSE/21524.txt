TITLE
HORMAD1 mutation disrupts synaptonemal complex formation and chromosomal segregation in fertilized eggs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hormad1 encodes a protein that contains a HORMA domain, and unlike Mad2, Hormad1 expression is germ cell specific. We discovered that both male and female are infertile, and HORMAD1 has important function in synaptonemal complex formation, sex chromosome inactivation during spermatogenesis and chromosome segregation in meiosis.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from wild-type and Hormad1-/- 2-week-old testes was used for performing Illumina BeadChip MouseWG-6 2.0 arrays. Three replicates per genotype were performed.
