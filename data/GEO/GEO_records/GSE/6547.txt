TITLE
Developmental transcriptome profiling of the C. elegans pocket protein ortholog, lin-35

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
LIN-35 is the single C. elegans ortholog of the mammalian pocket protein family members, pRb, p107, and p130. To gain insight into the roles of pocket proteins during development, a microarray analysis was performed with lin-35 mutants. Stage-specific regulation patterns were revealed, indicating that LIN-35 plays diverse roles at distinct developmental stages. LIN-35 was found to repress the expression of many genes involved in cell proliferation in larvae, an activity that is carried out in conjunction with E2F. In addition, LIN-35 was found to regulate neuronal genes during embryogenesis and targets of the intestinal-specific GATA transcription factor, ELT-2, at multiple developmental stages. Additional findings suggest that LIN-35 functions in cell cycle regulation in embryos in a manner that is independent of E2F. A comparison of LIN-35-regulated genes with known fly and mammalian pocket-protein targets revealed a high degree of overlap, indicating strong conservation of pocket protein functions in diverse phyla. Based on microarray results and our refinement of the C. elegans E2F consensus sequence, we were able to generate a comprehensive list of putative E2F-regulated genes in C. elegans. These results implicate a large number of genes previously unconnected to cell cycle control as having potential roles in this process. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
We compared transcriptom profiles of lin-35 mutants and control N2 worms at 3 developmental stages (embryonic, L1 and L4). Each comparison was done in triplicate on independently grown and isolated animals.
