TITLE
RAMPAGE dataset for the human K562 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
5'-complete cDNA sequencing on ribosome-depleted total RNA from the human K562 cell line. Provides high-quality, genome-wide single-base resolution profiling of transcription start sites and their expression levels.

DESIGN
This dataset represents a whole-genome, single-base resolution profiling of transcription start site (TSS) expression in the human K562 cell line. These profiles were established using RAMPAGE, a high-throughput, high-accuracy 5'-complete cDNA sequencing method implemented on the Illumina platform. The data was analyzed using custom scripts and algorithms that are all available upon request.
