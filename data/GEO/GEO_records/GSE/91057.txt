TITLE
Long Noncoding RNA Expression profiling of IMP1-expression and IMP1 nonexpression MDA231 Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ZBP1/IMP1 is a RNA binding protein that post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of a handful mRNAs, implicated in maintaining cell polarity and adhesion.  We have previously shown that ZBP1 was able to inhibit proliferation and invasiveness of breast carcinoma cells in vitro.  To determine important LncRNA for breast tumor growth and metastasis in response to IMP1 expression, LncRNA expression data were obtained from, and compared between the breast cancer cell line MDA231-IMP1 and MDA231/GFP.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from IMP1-expression（MDA231-IMP）and IMP1-nonexpression MDA231 cells（MDA231-GFP）and used for hybridization on Agilent microarrays. LncRNA expression data from MDA231-IMP were collected and compared to LncRNA expression data from MDA231-GFP. The microarray experiments and data analysis were performed at the Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation in Shanghai, China.
