TITLE
ChIP-chip analysis of human DREAM complex subunits in G0-arrested and S-phase synchronized cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment is a part of global location analysis of the human DREAM complex including subunits: E2F4, RBL2/p130, LIN9 and LIN54. Specifically, the regions in Human Promoter Array 1.0R (GPL5082) bound by: E2F4 in G0-arrested T98G cells E2F4 in S-phase synchronized T98G cells LIN54 in G0-arrested T98G cells LIN54 in S-phase synchronized T98G cells LIN9 in G0-arrested T98G cells LIN9 in S-phase synchronized T98G cells p130 in G0-arrested T98G cells p130 in S-phase synchronized T98G cells were compared with input chromatin. MAT (Model-based Analysis for Tiling Arrays) .bar and .bed output files provided as supplementary files. Keywords: CHiP-chip genomic DNA
