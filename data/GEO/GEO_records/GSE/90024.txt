TITLE
Transcriptome analysis to investigate the oncogenic TGF-β-Smad-Snail signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our study shows that TGF-β signaling promotes tumorigenesis in the  liver through upregulation of its target gene, Snail. We explored gene expression changes in tumors following TGF-β inhibition, and tumors ectopically expressing Snail with the TGF-β inhibition. RNA samples were harvested from tumors expressing Smad7 (S7HP tumors), firefly luciferase (LHP tumors), and Smad7 plus Snail (S7HP+Snail), respectively. Differentially expressed genes were investigated in LHP and S7HP+Snail tumors, compared with S7HP tumors.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of LHP, S7HP, and S7HP+Snail tumors were generated, in triplicate, by RNA-sequencing
