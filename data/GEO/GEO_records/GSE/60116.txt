TITLE
Genetic lineage analysis in intramucosal gland-forming gastric neoplasms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To predict the progression risk of non-invasive gland-forming gastric neoplasms to invasive carcinoma, we assessed lineage continuity or discontinuity between the non-invasive and invasive neoplasms by applying hierarchical clustering analysis to the gene copy-number profiles of individual tumours.

DESIGN
array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization. Samples are including of 7 tumours of Vienna category 3, 12 tumours of Vienna category 4, 8 intramucosal cancers (Vienna category 5), 16 intramucosal lesions and 16 invasive parts (Vienna category 5); 40 reference for control, 19 control replicates

PLATFORM
GPL10152 Agilent-021924 SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray 8x60K (Feature Number version)
