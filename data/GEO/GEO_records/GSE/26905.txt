ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_2946 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Kevin White. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 To classify the binding patterns of six different Drosophila insulator proteins, we used a bioinformatics approach and defined two non-overlapping categories of insulators. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
1  GFF3 files for six different Drosophila insulator proteins (the files contained sites enriched above the 1 % FDR) were used to compare the genomic coordinates for each factor's predicted binding sites. 2. Any overlapping binding sites were tabulated. 3. This revealed distinct clustering into two classes: Class I and Class II, which are annotated in a GFF3 file.
