TITLE
Comparison of the transcriptional response to ethanol in laboratory and wild yeast strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
An S288c-derived lab strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has lower ethanol resistance than either the vineyard strain M22 or the oak strain YPS163.  We performed a 60 minute time-course experiment in the presence of 5% ethanol and compared the transcriptional response to ethanol between strains.  We additionally analyzed the time-point of maximal response (30 min.) in wild type cells, YPS163 msn2D, and YPS163 hap1D cells.

DESIGN
The genomic expression response to 5% ethanol stress was measured in 3 different strain backgrounds, and 2 different mutant backgrounds.  Basal gene expression was also compared in two non-lab strains to the S288c reference.  A single replicate was performed for the time-course experiment.  All of the single time-point experiments were performed using biological triplicates.
