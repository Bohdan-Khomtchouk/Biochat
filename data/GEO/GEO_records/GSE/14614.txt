SUMMARY
Trancript profiling in arabidopsis gdh mutant.  Identification of the function and regulation of the GDH enzyme in plants. Comparison of transcriptome in leaves, stems and roots in wild type versus triple GDH (1, 2, 3)-defficient mutant and in wild type versus GDH3- defficient mutant. Keywords: wt vs mutant comparison
