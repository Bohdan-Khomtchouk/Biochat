TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of grape (Vitis vinifera L.) leaves exposed to ultraviolet C radiation

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Solar ultraviolet C（UV-C）radiation reaching the Earth’s surface is little due to the filtering effects of the stratospheric ozone layer. At present, artificial UV-C irradiation is utilized for different biological processes. Grape is a major fruit crop around the world. Research has shown that UV-C irradiation induced the biosynthesis of phenols. However, changes at the molecular level in response to UV-C and leading to these effects are poorly understood. To elucidate the effect of UV-C on expression of genes in grape and the response mechanism, transcript abundance of grape (Vitis vinifera L.) leaves was quantified using the Affymetrix Grape Genome oligonucleotide microarray (15,700 transcripts)

DESIGN
Grape leaves were exposed to UV-C irradiation at 6W/m2 for 10 min. LCK-0-1, LCK-0-2 and LCK-0-3 are 0 h after the initiation of treatment and as the controls; LTR-6-1, LTR-6-2 and LTR-6-3 are for 6 h after the initiation of treatment; LTR-12-1, LTR-12-2 and LTR-12-3 are for 12 h after the initiation of treatment. Three replicates for each time point. 9 samples in all.
