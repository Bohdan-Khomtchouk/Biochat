TITLE
The Histone Methyltransferases MLL1 and DOT1L Cooperate with Meningioma-1 to Induce AML [Human ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To characterize the genome-wide distribution of H3K79me2 in human leukemia cell lines treated with the Dot1l inhibitor EPZ004777 or control Methods: We performed Chip-seq for the H3K79me2 on the leukemia cell lines Mutz3, Loucy and Molm14 after 6 days in culture in the presence of 3uM EPZ004777 or DMSO control Results: H3K79me2 is completely erased from key target genes such as the HOXA cluster. Conclusions: Exposure of Mutz3, Loucy and Molm14 to 3uM EPZ004777 erases H3K79 methylation globally as well as on key loci
