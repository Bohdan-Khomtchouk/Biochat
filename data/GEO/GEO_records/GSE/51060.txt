TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of a clinical phase Ib Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination study (sex and age matched African males, 25-35 years, performed in South-Africa)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global transcriptome analyses provide an excellent basis for the identification and definition of biomarkers with high relevance in infection processes, therapeutic intervention and protective immunity. The measurement applies three different state of the art transcriptomic technologies for global expression profiling to vaccine development. Different microarray platforms in conjunct to next generation sequencing (NGS) will build the basis for comparative approaches, such as up-down classification and correlation coefficients. This measurement is based on Agilent microarrays and a clinical trial phase Ib study with M. bovis BCG vaccination. • Surrogate measurement using whole human blood • 4 time points: d0 (naïve, pre-immunization) and d14, d28,d56, d168 post m. bovis BCG immunization • Responses of PPD  positive study groups • Group size of approximately 6 individuals European network of vaccine research and development (TRANSVAC)

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed as single-color hybridizations using Agilent Technologies whole human genome 4x44K microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
