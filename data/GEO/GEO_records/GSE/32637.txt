TITLE
Gene expression in Drosophila Poly mutant and wild-type

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The Poly mutant was identified as a previously uncharacterised, but essential gene in Drosphila. Loss of Poly reults in lethality at the third larval instar stage, but only after a stage of extreme larval longevity. We aimed to assess the consequences of loss of the Poly gene on glocal gene expression by microarray analysis. Metabolism is altered in Poly mutants and here we find altered gene expression in insulin signaling pathways. Four biological replicates each of Poly mutant and wild-type larvae were used to assess gene expression on FL002 microarrays (GPL5135) . These data reveal that Poly is a mediatior of insulin receptor/TOR signaling.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates of poly mutant and wild-type Drosophila. Two arrays had wild-type in Cy5 channel and poly in Cy3 channel, the other two were reversed.
