TITLE
Expression data of multiple sclerosis patients receiving Interferon-beta therapy [miRNA-2_0]

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression dynamics of mRNAs and microRNAs in response to subcutaneous IFN-beta-1b treatment (Betaferon, 250 Âµg every other day) in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) or relapsing-remitting type of the disease (RRMS). By using Affymetrix microarrays, we obtained microRNA expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 3 patients within the first month of IFN-beta treatment.
