TITLE
Gene expression data of fibroblasts transduced with LacZ or p63+KLF4.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine if fibroblasts could be reprogrammed to a keratinocyte phenotype p63+KLF4 or LacZ expressing retroviruses were transduced into primary human neonatal fibroblasts. Global gene expression profiling using U133 plus 2.0 arrays were used to deteremine the extent of reprogramming to a keratinocyte phenoypte upon transduction with p63+KLF4. Fibroblasts transduced with p63+KLF4 were also treated +/- high calcium to determine if treatment with calcium could induce differentiation of these cells. Microarray analysis was also performed on cells treated +/- calcium.

DESIGN
For gene expression profiling, cultured human fibroblasts were infected with LacZ or p63+KLF4 expressing retroviruses. p63+KLF4 cells were also treated +/- calcium.  Microarray analysis using Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 plus arrays was performed on duplicate samples.
