TITLE
The effect of MEK inhibition, Interferon beta, and their combination on transcription in melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the transcriptional effect of interferon beta, MEK inhibition or their combination on 6 melanoma cell lines 3 cell lines have high basal acitvity of the interferon pathway, and 3 have low basal activity

DESIGN
Samples were treated with 50nM of the MEK inhibitor PD901, 1000Units/mL of interferon beta, or their combination and collected 8 hours after treatment
