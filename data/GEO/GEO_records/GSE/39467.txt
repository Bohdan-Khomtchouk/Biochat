TITLE
Profiling the target genes for MTA2 and EZH2 in HCT116

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using ChIP-seq technology, we tried to find out the whole genome targets for MTA2 and EZH2 in human colon cancer cells. More than 1700 genes were defined as the target of both MTA2 and EZH2, implying that MTA2 and EZH2 coordinate to participate in regulating a common set of target genes. Our results demonstrate a coordinated histone regulating model of gene transcriptional repression.

DESIGN
ChIP-seqs using antibodies against MTA2, EZH2 and IgG.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
