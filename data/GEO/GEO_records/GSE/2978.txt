Entamoeba heat shock experiments

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite which causes colitis and liver abscesses.  A pilot microarray consisting of 360 unique parasite genes was constructed using identical methods to the larger array (1,971 unique genes).  The four arrays in this data set were used to ascertain whether the microarrays would be useful in detecting changes in transcript abundance by exposing parasites to heat shock (42 0C for 1 hr).  Approximately, 17% of the genes were regulated by at least two fold including many genes previously shown to be involved in heat shock response.  This data confirmed that the genomic DNA arrays were useful in detecting changes in transcript abundance. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
