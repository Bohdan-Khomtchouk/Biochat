TITLE
Rice Seedling Stress treatment

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The japonica rice variety Nipponbare was grown under hydroponic condition for 10-days (untreated seedling sample). Seedlings were exposed to once stress conditions for 24 hours (stress treated sample). Seedlings were exposed to one of the following for 24 h: cold stress, incubation at 10 Â°C; salt stress by adding 150 mM sodium chloride to the planter box; osmotic stress by adding 260 mM mannitol to the planter box; and drought stress by adding 25% polyethylene glycol 6000 to the planter box. Total RNAs were prepared from each sample using an RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) and the mRNAs were purified with an Oligotex-dT30 Kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan). Purified mRNA was amplified and labeled and we hybridized the 1-mg fluorescent liner amplified Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cRNAs (each cRNA was 500 ng) to the NIAS RICE 22K oligonucleotide array ver1 according to the manufacturer.
