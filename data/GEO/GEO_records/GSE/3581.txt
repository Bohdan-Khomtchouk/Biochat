TITLE
Adult fly versus embryo (0-16h)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from wild-type adult flies (yellow white) and from embryos (cs, 0-16h) with TRIZOL reagent.  12 microgram of each total RNA were labeled with fluorescent dyes, following cDNA synthesis with amino-allyl dUTP in addition to the four natural dNTPs using a 1:1 mixture of oligo(dT) and random nonamer primers. An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. Keywords: all_pairs
