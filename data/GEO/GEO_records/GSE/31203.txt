TITLE
Molecular characterization of the chromosome 7 in SMZL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Splenic marginal zone lymphomas (SMZL) are an uncommon type of B-cell non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma (NHL-B) in which no specific chromosomal translocations have been described. In contrast, the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality is the loss of the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q). Previous reports have located this loss in the 7q32 region. In order to better characterize the genomic imbalances in SMZL, molecular studies were carried out in 73 patients with SMZL. To gain insight into the mapping at 7q a tiling array was also used. Our results confirmed the presence of a new region of loss on chromosome 7 in these NHL.

DESIGN
In order to better characterize the genomic imbalances in SMZL, molecular studies were carried out in 69 patients with SMZL.
