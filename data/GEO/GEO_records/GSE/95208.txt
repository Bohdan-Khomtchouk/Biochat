TITLE
Cold atmospheric plasma reprograms the drug sensitivity of Tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
genome-wide expression profiling of MCF-7, MCF-7/TamR and CAP-treated MCF-7/TamR cell. In result, cold atmospheric plasma re-sensitizes the Tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/TamR) breast cancer cell to the drug.

DESIGN
Total RNA is obtained from MCF-7, MCF-7/TamR, and CAP treated MCF-7/TamR.
