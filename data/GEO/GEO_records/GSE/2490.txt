TITLE
Effects of T3 on liver gene expression of wild type and TRbeta -/- mice

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Hypothyroids wild type and TRbeta -/- mice were treated with T3 and livers were collected and analysed using a microarray with 6500 cDNA probes. Expression ratios were calulated between 1) hypothyroids WT and TRbeta-/- mice 2) hypothyroid WT and hypothyroid TR beta-/- mice treated with T3 and 3) hypothyroid TRbeta-/- and hypothyroid TRbeta-/- treated with T3.
