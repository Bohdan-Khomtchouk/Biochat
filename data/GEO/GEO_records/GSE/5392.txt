TITLE
Expression profiling of human adult postmortem brain tissue from subjects with bipolar disorder and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bipolar affective disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component but unknown pathophysiology. We used microarray technology (Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips) to determine the expression of approximately 22 000 mRNA transcripts in post-mortem brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex) from patients with bipolar disorder and matched healthy controls. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
