TITLE
RNA expression profiles of murine polyploid trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) from day 9.5 implantation sites.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We employed RNA-seq to transcriptionally profile a pure population of hand-dissected polyploid TGCs from embryonic day 9.5. These data provide a set of polyploid-specific TGCs transcripts that will aid in the understanding of TGCs differentiation and endoreplication.

DESIGN
TGCs were micro-dissected from day E9.5 nine implantation sites from C57BL/6J mice. The portion of the TGCs in direct contact with the spongiotrophoblast layer and the labyrinth layer were manually removed to avoid collecting any polyploid cells from the former or multi-nucleated syncytiotrophoblast cells from the latter.
