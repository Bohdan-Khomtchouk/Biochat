TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Cbx3 in pluripotent mESC and pre-iPSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the locations of Cbx3 by chromatin immunoprecipitation in ESCs and pre-iPSCs

DESIGN
Examination of Cbx3 in mESC (mouse embryonic stem cells) and pre-iPSCs (fibroblast derived partially reprogrammed cells)
