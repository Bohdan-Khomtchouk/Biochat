TITLE
WT and dTLec1-1 plants systemic wounding

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Innate immune responses in animals and plants involve receptors that recognize microbe-associated molecules. In animals, activation of the Toll-NFkappaB pathway involves the recruitment of a series of TIR-domain containing adaptors that activate NFkappaB transcription factors. Plants contain many TIR modules as part of a large multi-gene TIR-NBS-LRR R-gene innate immune defense system as well as TIR-motif containing genes that lack LRR and whose functions are unknown. Molecular interactions for any TIR module signaling pathway has yet to be shown. Here we investigated the functional role of a TIR module linked to a lectin-containing motif, TIR-Lec1 (TLec1). We show that TLec1 acts as a positive modulator of the systemic JA-dependent wound response. TLec1 transcripts are rapidly induced in a JA-independent pathway and insertional mutants that TLec1 transcripts fail to show the full systemic wound response

DESIGN
