TITLE
RNA-SEQ analysis of various developing and adult kidney components

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used micro-dissection techniques and/or FACS to isolate cell types from the developing and adult kidney (E11.5 ureteric buds, E12.5, P1 and P4 cap mesenchyme, E15.5 collecting ducts, proximal tubules, ureter, Adult renal proximal tubules, podocytes, endothelial and mesangial cells). RNA-SEQ analysis was performed to determine the transcriptional profile of each cell type, identify component specific transcripts and isoforms and cell-type specific long-noncoding RNAs. In addition the unbiased nature of RNA-SEQ will potentially identify novel transcripts that have not been annotated in the database.

DESIGN
Total RNA is obtained from micro-dissected and/or FACS isolated embryonic and adult kidney components. The long term goal is to generate a transcriptional atlas of developing kidney.
