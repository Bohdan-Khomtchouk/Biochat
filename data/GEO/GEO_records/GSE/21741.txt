TITLE
Transcriptional regulation of ROS controls the transition from proliferation to differentiation in the root

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip analysis was used to identify direct targets of the transcription factor UPBEAT1 (UPB1)

DESIGN
ChIP was performed on ProUPB1:UPB1:GFP plants and on wt plants as a control. The two samples were amplified and hybridized on Agilent arrays. Dye swap was performed for two biological replicates.
