TITLE
Expression data for P. aeruginosa ATCC 33988 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 in Jet-A fuel

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
We investigated fuel specific transcriptomic differences between these strains in order to ascertain the underlying mechanisms utilized by the adapted strain P. aeruginosa ATCC 33988 to jet fuel to Jet-fuel During growth in fuel, the genes related to alkane degradation, heat-shock response, membrane proteins, efflux pumps and several novel genes were upregulated in ATCC 33988

DESIGN
Strain Comparison between strains

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
