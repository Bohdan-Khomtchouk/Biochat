TITLE
Extension of Life-span with Enhanced Energy Expenditure by a Modulator of NAD-metabolism in Aged Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of treatment at gene expression level in aged mice. Results provide important information of the response of drug modifying NAD metabolism which has been implicated in anti-aging effect of calorie restriction in aging process.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from skeletal muscles and brain (cortex) subjected to calorie restriction or Î²-lapachone treatment compared to untreated control.
