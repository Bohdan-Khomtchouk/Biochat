TITLE
Comparison of GNC and GNL Overexpression with ga1 and pif1345

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We have used Agilent whole genome arrays (v4) to compare the gene expression changes between 5 days-old Arabidopsis ga1 mutants, pif1345 mutants (Leivar et al., 2008) and transgenic lines overexpressing the regulators GNC and GNL/CGA1 to the wild type. All mutants or transgenic lines are in the Columbia-0 background. Three independent biological samples were prepared for each genotype.

DESIGN
Three replicate measurements of three biological samples were prepared for each genotype.
