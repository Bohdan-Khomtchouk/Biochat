TITLE
Gene expression in medaka (Oryzias latipes) ovarian follicles at late vitellogenesis, oocyte maturation and pre-ovulation stages

ORGANISM
Oryzias latipes

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression level changes in Oryzias latipes ovarian follicles with comparing seven developmental stages; late vitellogenic (-47 hr, -35 hr and -32 hr) , maturation (-23 hr and -14 hr) and pre-ovulation (-8 hr and -2 hr) stages.

DESIGN
A seven chip study using total RNA extracted from the isolated ovarian follicles which were collected at 47 hr, 35 hr, 32 hr, 23 hr, 14 hr, 8 hr and 2 hr before spawning stages.

PLATFORM
GPL21305 NimbleGen Custom Eukaryotic Gene Expression 385K Array (5224667), Medaka (Oryzias latipes), Design ID: RDKK097
