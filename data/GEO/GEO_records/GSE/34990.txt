TITLE
Control of RelB during dendritic cell activation integrates canonical and non-canonical NFkB pathways

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DC) play central roles in coordinating appropriate immune responses to pathogens.  In the present study, the genes regulated by NFkB activators, RelB and cRel, in PAMP-induced bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) activation was examined.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from WT, relb-/-, crel-/-relb-/- bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were subjected to stimulation with CpG or Pam3CSK4.
