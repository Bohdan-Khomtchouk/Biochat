TITLE
RNA-seq of H9-hESC derived human neural stem cells with combinations of mutant IDH1-R132H overexpression, P53 shRNA knockdown and/or ATRX shRNA knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was performed to assess gene expression alterations by the addition of serial oncogenic hits (mutant-IDH1, P53 knockdown and ATRX knockdown) in human neural stem cells.

DESIGN
All RNA-seq was performed in duplicates, there are four conditions total. Vector NSCs are the control line and have an empty mCherry vector and a scramble shRNA vector. One hit NSCs express mutant-IDH1 and have a scamble shRNA vector. Two-hit NSCs express mutant IDH1 and have p53 knockdown. Three-hit NSCs express mutant-IDH1, P53 knockdown and ATRX knockdown.

PLATFORM
