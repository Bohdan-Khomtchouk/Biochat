TITLE
Identification of genes controlled by Ikaros and IL-7 in the mouse Ikaros-deficient pre-B cell line BH1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment was to compare to single and combined effect of Ikaros activation and IL-7 withdrawal in the Ikaros-null pre-B cell line BH1

DESIGN
The mouse BH1 pre-B cell line was transduced with retroviruses encoding Bcl2 and an Ikaros-estrogen receptor fusion protein. Doubly transduced cells were purified by FACS (BH1-Bcl2-Ik1ER). The transcriptome of these cells was analyzed at time 0, and after 6h and 24h of induction of Ikaros activity with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) and/or withdrawal of IL-7. Samples from 2 independent experiments were analyzed (exp1 and exp2).
