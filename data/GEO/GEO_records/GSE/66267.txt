TITLE
miR-431 promotes differentiation and regeneration of old skeletal muscle by targeting Smad4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we identified novel age-related microRNAs through comparative analysis of miRNA expression profiles in young and old myoblasts using next generation sequencing (NGS)

DESIGN
small RNA profiles of young mouse and old mouse were generated by deep sequencing, in each four samples, using Illumina GAIIx
