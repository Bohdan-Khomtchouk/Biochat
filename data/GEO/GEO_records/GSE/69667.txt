TITLE
A systematic analysis of the time series gene expression in TGF-beta induced EMT by Next-generation sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to characterize time course gene expression profiles during TGF-beta induced EMT. In particular, we aim to identify and characterize master transcription factors regulate the transition into partial-EMT state.

DESIGN
A time series mRNA profile in A549 cells is generated from TGF-beta induced EMT samples during 0h,6h,12h,24h,36h,48h,72h and 96h by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500
