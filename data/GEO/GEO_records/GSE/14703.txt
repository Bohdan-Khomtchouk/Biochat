TITLE
Brucella melitensis-infected HeLa cells gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a time course study, we characterized global gene expression profile of B. melitensis-infected epithelium-like cells at the onset of infection. B. melitensis-infected HeLa cells exhibited a down-regulated expression profile at 4 h (48 up- and 109 down-regulated genes) that transitioned to an activated transcriptional profile at 12 h post-infection (733 up- and 224 down-regulated genes).  The analysis of the results indicates that infected cells undergo an adaptation period during the first 4 h p.i. that is overcome by 12 h p.i., permitting Brucella to replicate intracellularly while minimally affecting host physiological processes. Specific genes and biological processes identified in this study will further help elucidate how both host and Brucella interact during the early infectious process to the eventual benefit of the pathogen and to the detriment of the na√Øve host. Keywords: Time course study of gene expression profile of Brucella melitensis-infected HeLa cells

DESIGN
We generated 4 different samples: A) RNA isolated from Brucella melitensis-infected HeLa cells at 4 h p.i.; B) RNA isolated from non-infected HeLa cells at 4 h p.i. of the A samples; C) RNA isolated from Brucella melitensis-infected HeLa cells at 12 h p.i., and D) RNA isolated from non-infected HeLa cells at 12 h p.i. of the D samples. The B. melitensis-infected HeLa cells gene expression was compared with gene expression from non-infected HeLa cells treated similarly. There are four biological replicates of each sample and time point (n=16). ORFs were single spotted on each microarray. Each replicate was normalized against labeled universal human reference RNA.
