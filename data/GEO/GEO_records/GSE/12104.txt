TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of msg5 mutants and msg5 mutants in the presence/absence of alpha factor

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
GSM306248: S. cerevisiae was grown on YEPD. Wild type and msg5 yeast cells were grown overnight at 24 °C to an optical density 0.8 - 1 (A600). The culture was refreshed to 0.2 O.D and grown at 24 °C for 4hours. After  4 hours of growth cells were collected, frozen at -80 °C and processed for RNA extraction. GSM306249: msg5 yeast cells were grown overnight at 24 °C to an optical density 0.8 - 1 (A600). The culture was refreshed to 0.2 O.D and grown at 24 °C for 4hours. After 4 hours the culture was divided into two parts. One was treated with alpha factor and the other part was allow to grow without any treatment. After 90 minutes of treatment, both cultures of cells were collected, frozen at -80 °C and processed for RNA extraction.

DESIGN
GSM306248: Four microarrays were utilized to analyze each condition (coming from two different biological samples labeled using dye swapping strategy). Data processing involves condensing the results from the four microarrays.
