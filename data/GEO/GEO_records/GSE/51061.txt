TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of  non-human primate Chinese and Indian rhesus macaque spectrotype vaccination with Mycobacterium  bovis BCG

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Global transcriptome analyses provide an excellent basis for the identification and definition of biomarkers with high relevance in infection processes, therapeutic intervention and protective immunity. The measurement applies three different state of the art transcriptomic technologies for global expression profiling to vaccine development. Different microarray platforms in conjunct to next generation sequencing (NGS) will build the basis for comparative approaches, such as up-down classification and correlation coefficients. This measurement is based on Agilent microarrays and a pre-clinical study with M. bovis BCG vaccination, using two different non-human primate Chinese and Indian rhesus macaque spectrotypes. • Surrogate measurement using whole blood RNA • 7 time points: d-14 and d0 (naïve, pre-immunization) and d1, d3, d7, d21, d42 post M. bovis BCG immunization • Responses of two macaque spectrotypes • Group size of 6 animals European network of vaccine research and development (TRANSVAC)

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed as single-color hybridizations using Agilent Technologies 4x44K Rhesus macaque gene expression microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL16026 Agilent-026806 M. mulatta (Rhesus) Oligo Microarray v2 (Feature Number version)
