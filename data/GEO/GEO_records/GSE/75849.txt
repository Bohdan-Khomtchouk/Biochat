TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of immature erythrocyte transcribed chromosomal domains (F1-seq)

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional regulation is impacted by multiple layers of genome organization. Here, we  identified and mapped out all the transcriptionally active chromosomal domains in the chicken  immature erythrocyte genome, including the known β- and α-globin domains, by combining a  powerful chromatin fractionation method with next generation DNA and RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
To characterize transcriptionally active chromatin domains, we used two biological replicates. Each replicate set has one control SE fraction and one transcriptionally active chromatin fraction (F1)

PLATFORM
