TITLE
3alpha-acetonyltabersonine induces glioblastoma apoptosis via the inhibition of DNA damage repair

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we report the antitumor activity of an indole alkaloid, 3alpha-acetonyltabersonine, which was isolated from Melodinus suaveolens. 3alpha-acetonyltabersonine was found to be cytotoxic to glioblastoma cell line and stem cells at low concentrations.

DESIGN
Examination the differental expression of 3alpha-acetonyltabersonine-treated and the control.
