TITLE
Expression profiling of MXD3 stable cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A subset of medulloblastomas, the most common brain tumor in children, is hypothesized to originate from granule neuron precursors (GNPs) in which the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway is over-activated. MXD3, a basic helix-look-helix zipper transcription factor of the MAD family, has been reported to be upregulated during postnatal cerebellar development and to promote GNP proliferation and MYCN expression. Mxd3 is upregulated in mouse models of medulloblastoma as well as in human medulloblastomas. Therefore, we hypothesize that MXD3 plays a role in the cellular events that lead to medulloblastoma biogenesis. The purpose of this study was to identify changes in gene expression in response to MXD3.

DESIGN
RNA from MXD3 stable cell lines compared to vector-only cell lines and to parental (DAOY) cell line.
