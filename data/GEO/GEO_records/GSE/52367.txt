TITLE
mRNA expression in C-33A cells expressing HPV1 E2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profile of RNA expression in a C-33A cell line derived from an HPV negative cervical carcinoma in the presence or absence of HPV1 E2 expression.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of C-33A cells in presence or absence of HPV1 E2 expression were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx. Two samples (no replicates). One control and one experimental.

PLATFORM
