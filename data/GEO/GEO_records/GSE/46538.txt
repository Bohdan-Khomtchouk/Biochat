TITLE
Expression data from PDE1C knockdown glioblastoma short-term cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In our lab we detected focal genomic amplification of PDE1C in 90% of short term GBM cultures. Knocking down of PDE1C was associated with compromised capacity opf these cultures to proliferate, migrate and invade. Therefore we carried out affymetric whole genome expression analysis to identify the down stream gene effectors of this function effects.

DESIGN
IN1472 and IN1760 - 2 GBM short term cultures were transfected with siRNA either for PDE1C (siPD) or non-targeting (siNT) and its down gene effectors were studied.
