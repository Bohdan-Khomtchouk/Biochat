SUMMARY
Diethylstilbestrol (DES) inhibits the differentiation of female reproductive tracts during fetal and neonatal days . We examined global gene expressions in the  oviduct, uterus and vagina in newborn mice with or without DES. These results suggest understanding the mechanism of the differentiation of female reproductive tracts. Keywords: ordered
