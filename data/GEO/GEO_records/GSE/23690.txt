TITLE
Study the role of miRNAs in metastasis progression of RCC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study investigates for the miRNAs that drive or regulates Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) metastatic progression using two different RCC cell lines, the metastatic (LM2 and LM1) and non-metastatic (SN12C).

DESIGN
The experiment is designed with three RCC cell lines one non-metastatic (SN12C) and two metastatic (LM1 and LM2). Each cell line has two biological replicates (exception SN12C has 3 replicates)
