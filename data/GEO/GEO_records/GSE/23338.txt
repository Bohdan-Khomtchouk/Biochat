TITLE
TGFÃŸ1-driven epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human kidney cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGFbeta is the major cytokine driver of fibrosis in the kidney and other tissue. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition has been postulated to contibrute to renal fibrosis in diseases such as diabetic nephropathy. We wished to identify novel genes that were upregulated in human kidney epithelial cells in response to TGFb1.The transcriptional responses for human proximal tubule epithelial cells to 10 ng/ml TGFbeta1 was examined over 24 and 48 hr

DESIGN
There were three treatment groups: vehicle, 24hr TGFb1, 48 hr TGFb1. Each treatment was carried out in triplicate 10 cm plates and the experiment was carried out in triplicate using consecutive passages of cells.
