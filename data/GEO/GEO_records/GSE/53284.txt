TITLE
Transcriptome of HEK293 cells stably knockdown for the BAHD1 gene with a shRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profile of HEK293 cells stably expressing a shRNA control (SilX-CT) or a shRNA against BAHD1 (SilX-BAHD1)

DESIGN
We used microarrays to identify the repertoire of genes differentially expressed upon knockdown of the chromatin repressor BAHD1 in human HEK293 cells.
