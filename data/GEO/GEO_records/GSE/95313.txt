TITLE
3' RNA-seq of ADAR hypomorph flies grown in different temperatures

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In order to test whether ADAR is responsible for mediating part of the transcriptional response to temperature changes in fly we determined the gene expression profile of fly heads from control and ADAR Hypomorph flies at 18 and 29°C by 3’ RNA-seq.

DESIGN
ADAR hypomorph flies and the control flies were grown in 18C (3 replicas each) or in 29C (3 replicas each) and harvested 3-6 days after eclosion .

PLATFORM
