TITLE
Effect of Etanercept on Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Rabbits

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
Treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases with tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonists has been associated with increased risk of tuberculosis (TB). We examined the usefulness of the rabbit model of active pulmonary TB for studying the impact of the human immune modulatory reagent etanercept on the host immune response. Control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, disease pathology and the global transcriptional response in Mtb-infected lungs of rabbits were studied.  Etanercept treatment exacerbated disease pathology and reduced bacillary control in the lungs, compared to infected untreated animals. The microarray experiments involves comparison of changes in gene expression between Mtb-HN878 infected and Etanercept treated and untreated rabbit lungs at 4 and 8 weeks post-treatment, starting at 4 weeks post-infection.

DESIGN
New Zealand White rabbits were infected with Mtb HN878 at about 3.2log10 (on day 0).  One group of rabbits were treated with Etanercept, starting at 4 weeks post-infection, for 4 or 8 weeks.  Total RNA from lung tissues of treated and untreated animals were isolated at 4 and 8 weeks post treatment and used for microarray gene expression analysis.
