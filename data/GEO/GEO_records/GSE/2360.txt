TITLE
Comparison analysis of rice and Arabidopsis photomorphogenesis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana ; Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Long oligonucleotide microarrays were used for the study of expression profile changes during seedling photomorphogenesis in rice and in Arabidopsis. Different light quality treatments were applied to seedlings. To dissect organ-specific light effects, we further profiled shoot and root organs in both species. Keywords = rice Keywords = Arabidopsis Keywords = photomorphogenesis Keywords: ordered
