TITLE
Genome-wide Mapping and Analysis of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Repressor (AHRR) by ChIP-Seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we compared the genome-wide binding profiles of AHR and AHRR in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells treated for 24 h with TCDD using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Overall, this study reveals that AHR and AHRR exhibit similar but also distinct genome-wide binding profiles, supporting the notion that AHRR is a context- and gene-specific repressor of AHR activity.

DESIGN
MCF7 treated with DMSO (vehicle) or TCDD for 24h; ChIP-seq in triplicates using AHR- and AHRR-specific antibodies with Illumina HiSeq 2500
