TITLE
3CB-induced gene expression of Pseudomonas putida KT2440/pSL1 in soil (without RNA amplification)

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida KT2440

SUMMARY
To know whether the microarray technique could be used to detect bacterial gene expression in soil, large quantity of RNA was extracted from soil cultures of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 containing a chloroaromatic degrading plasmid at the presence or absence of the growth substrate, 3-chlorobenzoate (3CB). The quality and quantity of the extracted RNA were proper for a typical microarray analysis. Gene expression patterns of soil cultures were analyzed by DNA microarray using the extracted RNA. Among 5346 genes on the array, 5% and 4.5% of genes showed up- or down-regulation. Analysis done at the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources server suggested that the benzoate degradation via hydroxylation pathway had the most significant changes after treatment with 3CB. Expression of the 3CB degradation genes located in the genome was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. In addition, real time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the fluorescent signals from plasmid genes on the microarray were saturated so that the induction ratio of the genes located in the plasmid was underestimated in microarray analysis. To our best knowledge, this report represents the first trial to use microarray technique to detect genome-wide bacterial gene expression in soil.

DESIGN
A study using total RNA extracted from soil cultures of Pseudomonas putida KT2440/pSL1.  Each chip measures the expression level of 5,341 genes from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 genome and 5 genes from an introduced plasmid pSL1 with fourteen 60-mer probes per gene which have five-fold technical redundancy.
