TITLE
A screening for differentially expressed genes between peripheral NK cells of HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma patients and healthy donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used 3 pairs of HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma patients and healthy donors as samples. We tested the DNA expression profiles with DNA microarray including about 30967 probes. Through these raw data, we analyzed out several hundreds of differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
In this study, we choose 3 pairs of HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma patients and healthy donors. We analyzed about 30967 probes with DNA microarray, leading to the successful profiling of interesting genes.
