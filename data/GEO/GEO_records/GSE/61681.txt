TITLE
Small RNA profiles of mycovirus-free and mycovirus-infected Aspergillus fumigatus isolates, created using ScriptMiner adapters

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
Small RNA libraries of 4 different mycovirus-infected and -free isogenic lines of A. fumigatus were constructed using Scriptminer adapters. sRNAomes were analysed and putative virus-derived small RNAs were identified.

DESIGN
Analysis of small RNA profiles of 4 different mycovirus-infected A. fumigatus isolates

PLATFORM
