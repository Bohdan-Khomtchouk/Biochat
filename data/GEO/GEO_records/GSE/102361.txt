TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of SRm160 18603 mutat larvae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the transcriptional profile (RNA-seq) of wild type Drosophila melanogaster larvae (w1118) and mutants for the SRm160 gene in the same genetic background.

DESIGN
150 larvae of each genotype were collected 24h after egg laying (AEL) and transferred to a plate with standard food. 3 groups of 100 larvae from each genotype were collected 12h after transferring to standard food. Larvae of each group were collected, rinsed in PBS  and transferred to TRIzol.

PLATFORM
GPL19951 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
