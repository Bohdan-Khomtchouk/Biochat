TITLE
Comparison of the DNA methylation of bovine blastocysts and bovine sperm

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
DNA from expanded bovine blastocysts and bovine sperm were extracted then subjected to methylation-sensitive enzymatic digestion and LM-PCR enrichment before being hybridized onto a microarray.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, bovine blastocysts (pools of 10) vs bovine sperm. Four biological replicates of each tissue were hybridized to four two-color arrays in a dye-balanced design.
