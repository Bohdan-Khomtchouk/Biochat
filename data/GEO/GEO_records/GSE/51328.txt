TITLE
Pathogenic response of Glycine max to the stem parasitic plant Cuscuta

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Little is known about plant pathogenic response to parasitic plants, although some parasitic plants affect crop production in certain areas. To study this, we chose Glycine max as the model host plant and investigated changes in expression patterns after parasitization by Cuscuta using microarrays.

DESIGN
Transcriptional change of Glycine max stem with and without Cuscuta at 2 different stages were compared

PLATFORM
GPL13674 [SoyGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Soybean Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
