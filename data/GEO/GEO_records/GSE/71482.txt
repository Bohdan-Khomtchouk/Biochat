TITLE
Expression data from Caenorhabditis elegans fed with a Lactoferrin-based product

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Lactoferrin is a highly multifunctional protein. Indeed, it is involved in many physiological functions, including regulation of iron absorption and immune responses. We use microarrays to study the global genome expression of C. elegans fed with a nutraceutical product based on encapsulated lactoferrin.

DESIGN
Wild type strain N2 of C. elegans was cultured in  Nematode Growth medium (MGM, control fed) or NGM supplemented with Lactoferrin-based product. Young adult worms were age-synchronized. RNA was isolated from each populations (control and treated) using RNAasy Kit (Qiagen) and hybridizated on Affymetrix microarrays.
