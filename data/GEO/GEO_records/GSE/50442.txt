TITLE
Expression data from primary and hereditary pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) and paragangliomas (PGLs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genotype specific differences in expression profiles have been evaluated using human HuGene1.0-ST Gene Chips. In this dataset we include expression data for 7 PHEOs/PGLs patient samples with HIF2A or PHD2 mutation. Viable appearing tissue from the center of the lesions was collected and snap frozen for RNA extraction. Each of the 7 PHEO/PGL samples was examined by pathologist upon resection.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on normal and tumor samples.
