TITLE
Effect of blood product - derived Cell Free Nucleic Acids (CFNA) on peripheral mononuclear cells gene regulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PBMC were exposed to Cell Free Nucleic Acids (CFNA) extracted from blood products eligible for transfusion: Red Blood Cell units (RBC), Fresh Frozen Plasma units (FFP). PBMC alone exposed to the same extract from PBS were used as a control (PBMC+control). PBMC alone were also used as control. The used positive control was PBMC exposed to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)

DESIGN
exposition of PBMC to CFNA, RNA extarction and gene expression array (24h) PFC = FFP = Fresh Frozen Plasma units CE = RBC = Red Blood Cell units CP = PC = Platelet Concentrates

PLATFORM
GPL16043 GeneChip® PrimeView™ Human Gene Expression Array (with External spike-in RNAs)
