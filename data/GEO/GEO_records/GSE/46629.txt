TITLE
Expression analysis of Drosophila S2R+ cells depleted of M1BP by RNAi

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of gene expression profiles in control and M1BP-depleted Drosophila S2R+ cells. The results of this analyses are reported in Li, J. and D.S. Gilmour (2013) The newly identified transcription factor M1BP ad GAGA factor orchestrate distinct mechanisms of transcriptional regulation on paused genes. The EMBO J, in press.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates comparing total RNA isolated from M1BP-RNAi treated and LacZ-RNAi treated cells.
