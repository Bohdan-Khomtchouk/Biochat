TITLE
Expression data from early mouse embryo eye development, specifically optic fissure.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The different stages of the optic fissure can be clearly visualized by making sagittal sections through the mouse eye during early development which represent the optic fissure at open (E10.5), closing (E11.5) and fused (E12.5) states.  Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was employed to dissect tissue from the margins of the optic fissure consisting of the outer (presumptive RPE) and inner (presumptive neurosensory retina) layers of the retina. An approximately square-shaped block of optic fissure (50 x 50 mm) was dissected from each side of the fissure.  Two rounds of linear amplification were performed on RNA isolated from each of the samples prior to microarray hybridization.  Expression data were gathered in biological triplicate at E10.5, E11.5 and duplicate at E12.5, each array representing pooled optic fissure tissue from three embryos from a single litter.  Expression signals were ascertained from 45,101 probe sets and normalized across arrays. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Differential gene expression over the course of three days in laser capture microdissected tissue from wild type mouse embryos.
