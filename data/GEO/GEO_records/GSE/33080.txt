TITLE
Transcriptional responses underlying the hormetic and detrimental effects of gossypol on Helicoverpa armigera

ORGANISM
Helicoverpa armigera

SUMMARY
Gut and rest of body tissue from fifth instar larvae which fed for three days a diet containing different doses of gossypol. Transcriptional profiling comparing gut and rest of body samples for three gossypol concentrations (0%, 0.016%-hormetic dose & 0.16%-detrimental dose). Hormesis is a biphasic biological response characterized by the stimulatory effect at relatively low amounts of chemical compounds otherwise known to be detrimental at higher concentrations. A hormetic response in larval growth rates has been observed in cotton-feeding insects in response to increasing concentrations of gossypol, a toxic metabolite found in the pigment glands of some Malvaceae plants. We investigated the developmental effect of gossypol in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, an important heliothine pest species, by exposing larvae to different doses of this metabolite in their diet. In addition, we sought to determine the underlying transcriptional responses to different gossypol doses. Larval weight gain, pupal weight and larval development time were measured in feeding experiments and a hormetic response was seen for the first two characters. On the basis of net larval weight gain responses to gossypol, three treatments, that is 0%, 0.016%  and 0.16% gossypol , were selected for transcript profiling in the gut and the rest of the body in a two-color double reference design microarray experiment.

DESIGN
Two-color double reference design. Reference sample was the 0% (CT) gossypol condition (either Gut or Rest of Body) or one of two experimental conditions  {0.016(T5) and 0.16%(T7)}. Biological replicates: 4 (10 individuals per replicate). 32 samples  total.
