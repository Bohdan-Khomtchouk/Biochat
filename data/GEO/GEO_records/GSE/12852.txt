TITLE
Gene expression profile in pelvic organ prolapse

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Introduction and Hypothesis: Identify processes contributing to pelvic organ prolapse (POP) by transcriptional profiling of pelvic connective tissue in conjunction with light microscopy. Methods: We performed a frequency matched case-control study of women undergoing hysterectomy. Total RNA, extracted from uterosacral and round ligament samples used to generate labeled cRNA, was hybridized to microarrays and analyzed for the expression of 32,878 genes. Significance Analysis of Microarrays, (Stanford University, CA), identified differentially expressed genes used for ontoanalysis, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed results. Light microscopy confirmed tissue type and assessed inflammatory infiltration. Results:  The analysis of thirty-four arrays revealed 249 differentially expressed genes with fold changes larger than 1.5 fold and false discovery rates â‰¤5.2%. Immunity and Defense was the most significant biological process differentially expressed in POP. Selected qPCR confirmed 4 genes. Light microscopy showed no inflammatory infiltrates. Conclusions: Genes enriched for Immunity and Defense contribute to POP independent of inflammatory infiltrates. Keywords: whole tissue (endopelvic fascia) type comparison
