TITLE
Exosomes mediate protective messages during oxidative stress; role of exosomal shuttle RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exosomes are small extracellular nano-vesicles of endocytic origin that mediate different signals between cells, by surface interactions and by shuttling of functional RNA from one cell to another. In this study, we show that exosomes, produced by mouse mast cells exposed to oxidative stress, change their mRNA content and also that these exosomes can influence the response of other cells to oxidative stress by providing recipient cells with a resistance against oxidative stress. Finally, we also show that UV-light affect the biological functions associated with exosomes released under oxidative stress. These results argue that exosomal shuttle of RNA is involved in cell-to-cell communication, by influencing the response of recipient cells to an external stimulus.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail to examine the gene expression underlying the effect of H2O2 on the exosomal RNA and how exosomes isolated from oxidative stress influence the growth of recipient cells during oxidative stress. The mRNA content of the exosomes from normal conditions (MC9 Exo_norm) were compared to that from exosomes from H2O2 conditions (MC9 Exo_H2O2). The mRNA content of recipient cells MC9 were identified before (MC9 cells_norm) and after (MC9 cells_H2O2) addition of exosomes that were isolated from normal and H2O2 conditions.
