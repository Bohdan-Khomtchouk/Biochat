TITLE
Whole blood microRNA expression profiles in human non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fifth generation Exiqon® locked nucleic acid miRCURY™ LNA microarrays were used to profile the expression of microRNAs in whole blood of patients with non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma and of clinically relevant controls without the disease.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from whole blood of 22 cases and 23 controls. Sample RNA was labeled with the Cy3-like Hy3™ dye, mixed with a human universal reference RNA labeled with the Cy5-like Hy5™ dye, and hybridized to two-color miRCURY™ arrays from Exiqon®. - Disease: Lung adenocarcinoma: samples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 - Disease: No cancer: samples 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49
