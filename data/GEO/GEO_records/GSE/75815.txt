TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of vascular tissues in Angiotensin II-dependent hypertension in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that angiotensin II (AngII) affects transcriptome in the vasculature in a region-specific manner, which may help to identify genes causally related to the development of AngII-induced hypertension. This work was supported by the National Science Centre grant (decision no. DEC-2012/07/D/NZ4/00644).

DESIGN
Transcriptome of thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta and mesenteric arteries was profiled in C57BL/6J wild-type hypertensive mice infused with AngII (490 ng/kg/min) for 2 weeks and control mice using Illumina WG-6 v2.0 chip.
