TITLE
Profiling epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) from obese db/db and lean control db/+ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This program addresses the gene signature associated with the development of type 2 diabetes in the db/db mice. Specifically, which genes are differentially expressed in adipose tissue of the db/db mice compared to the control db/+ mice?

DESIGN
The db/db mice eWAT profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in the eWAT of db/db mice compared to the corresponding db/+ controls.
