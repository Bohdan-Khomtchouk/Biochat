TITLE
Hypothalamic transcriptional profiling during the development of adiposity

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Hypothalami from Fat (FL) and Lean lines (LL) of juvenile broiler chickens were obtained by divergent selection for high or low levels of abdominal fat at SRA-INRA, France. Gene expression patterns were measured during the development of adiposity at 1 to 7 weeks of age. Differentially expressed genes associated with line, age, or line-by-age were identified. Various phenotypic and metabolic alterations are present between the lines (i.e., abdominal fat, T3 levels and glycemia), however there are no alterations in ad libitum food intake between the lines. A balanced block hybrdization design and the Del-Mar 14K chicken integrated systems microarrays were used to measure gene expression during development. 561 genes were differentially expressed between line, and 442 genes were significant for line-by-age interactions. The greatest number of genes were differentially expressed at week 1 of age, prior to any divergence in adiposity between the two lines. Keywords: Chickens divergently selected for fatness or leanness, transcriptional profiling, differentially expressed genes
