TITLE
Direct targets of CodY in Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
More than 200 direct CodY target genes in Staphylococcus aureus were identified by genome-wide analysis of in vitro DNA binding. This analysis, which was confirmed for some genes by DNase I footprinting assays, revealed that CodY is a direct regulator of numerous transcription units associated with amino acid biosynthesis, transport of macromolecules and virulence. The virulence genes regulated by CodY fell into three groups. One group was dependent on the Agr system for its expression; these genes were indirectly regulated by CodY through its repression of the agr locus. A second group was regulated directly by CodY. The third group, which includes genes for alpha-toxin and capsule synthesis, was regulated by CodY in two ways, i.e., by direct repression and by repression of the agr locus. Since S. aureus CodY was activated in vitro by the branched chain amino acids and GTP, CodY appears to link changes in intracellular metabolite pools with the induction of numerous adaptive responses, including virulence.

DESIGN
Affymetrix GeneChips were used to compare the transcript titers of S. aureus strains UAMS-1 (wild type) and corresponding agr- (strain CM18), codY- (strain MS1), and agr- codY- (strain CM19) isogenic mutant strains during exponential and stationary phase growth.  At least two biological replicates were assessed for each strain and each growth phase.
