TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of Nr5a2 in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nr5a2 (also known as liver receptor homolog-1, Lrh-1) has been shown to bind both the proximal enhancer and proximal promoter regions of Pou5f1 and regulate Pou5f1 in the epiblast stage of mouse embryonic development (Gu et al., 2005). Nr5a2-null embryos display a loss of Oct4 expression in the epiblasts (Gu et al., 2005) and die between E6.5 and E7.5 (Gu et al., 2005; Pare et al., 2004). To identify the targets of Nr5a2, we generated a stable ES cell-line that expresses HA-tagged Nr5a2. Anti-HA antibody was used to immunoprecipitate HA-Nr5a2 for ChIP-seq analysis. Keywords: Transcription factor binding sites

DESIGN
To identify the binding sites of Nr5a2, we generated a stable ES cell-line that expresses HA-tagged Nr5a2. Anti-HA antibody was used to immunoprecipitate HA-Nr5a2.
