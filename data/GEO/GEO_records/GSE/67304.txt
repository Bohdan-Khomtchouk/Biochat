TITLE
Expression analysis of big neurospheres generated in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of neurospheres generated in vitro treated by potassium chloride (KCl) and norepinephrine

DESIGN
Neurospheres generated in vitro were treated with norepinephrine or potassium chloride. Gene expression analysis was then carried out to identify genes that are up or down regulated due to chemical treatment.
