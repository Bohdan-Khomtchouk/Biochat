TITLE
Transcriptional regulation of Sox17 in HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified Sox17 as a novel angiogenic transcription factor in the context of tumor. Our data revealed that Sox17 promotes tumor angiogenesis and tumor vessel abnormality. We found that Sox17 is specifically expressed in tumor endothelial cells within tumors. Our study elucidates a novel transcriptional regulation for tumor angiogenesis

DESIGN
Control HUVECs vs. Sox17 knockdown HUVECs. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 transfected replicates.
