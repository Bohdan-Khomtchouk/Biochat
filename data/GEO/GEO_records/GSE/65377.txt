TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of rice leaves, nodes and stems

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular mechanism of callus formation in nodes, we performed an RNA-seq experiment, using a mixture of nodes I and II compared to stems and mature leaves. We identified 1,741 candidate genes that were preferentially expressed in the node.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from the mature leaf, node and stem tissues from rice.

PLATFORM
GPL13160 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Oryza sativa)
