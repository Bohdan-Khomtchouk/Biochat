TITLE
Assessment of hematopoietic failure due to RPL11 deficiency in a zebrafish model of Diamond–Blackfan anemia by deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To comprehensively reflect the impact of RPL11 deficiency on the transcriptome of zebrafish embryos, we collected 40–50 RPL11-deficient and MO control zebrafish embryos at 48 hpf from separate experiments and constructed two mRNA-seq sequencing libraries in parallel. High-throughput sequencing was performed on the Hi-Seq2000 sequencing platform in parallel. The number of sequenced gene transcript reads was 35–40 million. We found that hemoglobin biosynthetic and hematological defects in RPL11-deficient zebrafish were related to dysregulation of iron metabolism-related genes, including tfa, tfr1b, alas2 and slc25a37, which are involved in heme and hemoglobin biosynthesis. In addition, we found reduced expression of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) marker c-myb and HSC transcription factor tal1 and hoxb4a in RPL11-deficient zebrafish embryos, indicating that the hematopoietic defects may be related to impaired HSC differentiation and proliferation. However, RPL11 deficiency did not affect the development of other blood cell lineages such as granulocytes and myelocytes.
