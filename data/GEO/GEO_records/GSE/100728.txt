TITLE
Pitx1 directly controls the core limb development program to implement hindlimb identity [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pitx1, critical regulator of a limited hindlimb-specific gene network, targets the limb development program common to both fore- and hindlimbs in order to implement hindlimb-specific limb morphology.

DESIGN
The gene regulatory networks governing forelimb vs. hindlimb development in mouse were investigated using expressing profiling of morphologically stage-matched e10.5 forelimbs and e11.0 hindlimbs, ChIPseq of chromatin marks, and ChIPseq of limb-specific transcription factors Pitx1 and Tbx5. The makeup of the Pitx1-directed components of the hindlimb gene network were investigated using expression profiling of Pitx1 null hindlimbs at two stages (e11.0 and e11.5).
