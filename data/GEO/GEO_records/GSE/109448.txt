TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of freshly isolated synovial fibroblast subsets from patients with rheumatoid arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomics of distinct subpopulations of synovial fibroblasts from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis arthroplasty tissues.

DESIGN
We gated 7 subsets of synovial fibroblasts by protein surface markers and used RNA-seq to profile gene expression of cells taken from each gate. This data includes 25 samples from 4 rheumatoid arthritis patients. *** Raw data are not available for this Series due to patient privacy concerns. The raw data will not be available through controlled-access resources such as dbGaP. The patients did not consent to genomic data sharing. ***
