TITLE
Whole genome microarray of  T lymphoma invasion and metastasis (Tiam1) silenced retinoblastoma Y79 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that Tiam1 is involved in invassiveness of retinoblastoma. The fuctional role of Tiam1 in cell progression and metastasis was tested by siRNA mediated knockdown of Tiam1 in retinoblastoma Y79 cells. The genes de-regulated in response to Tiam1 knockdown was analysed by cDNA microarray in which most of the actin cytoskeleton regulation proteins and apoptotic proteins were de-regulated. our results prove that Tiam1 modulates actin cytoskeleton and cell invasion in retinoblastoma.

DESIGN
Retinoblastoma Y79 cells were treated with Tiam1 siRNA for 48hrs and cDNA microarray was performed to analyze the genes regulated by Tiam1 silencing compared to untreated Y79 cells. Experiments were performed in triplicates.
