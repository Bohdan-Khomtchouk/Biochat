TITLE
Gene expression profile in the pectoralis muscle of penguin before and after acclimatisation to marine life

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we were interested in gene expression changes in the pectoralis muscle of juvenile king penguins during the transition from terrestrial to marine life. Strictly terrestrial during their first year after hatching, king penguin chicks must then depart to sea to reach nutritional emancipation and pectoralis muscle is largely involved in penguin adaptation to the marine environment. To compare these transcriptomic profiles, we realized heterologous hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChip Chicken Genome Arrays, as the chicken is the closest model species for which microarrays are available. The development of a new algorithm, MaxRS, allow us to determine differentially expressed genes implicated in energetic metabolism or involved in cellular defense against reactive oxygen species and associated injuries.
