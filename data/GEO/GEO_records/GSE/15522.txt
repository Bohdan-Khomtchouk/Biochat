TITLE
Expression data of Vibrio fischeri in response to nitric oxide (NO)

ORGANISM
Aliivibrio fischeri

SUMMARY
The bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri initiates a specific, persistent symbiosis in the light organ of the squid Euprymna scolopes. During the early stages of colonization, V. fischeri is exposed to host-derived nitric oxide (NO). While NO can be both an antimicrobial component of innate immunity and a common signaling molecule of eukaryotes, its roles in beneficial host-microbe associations remain undescribed.             V. fischeri encodes HnoX, a member of a family of bacterial NO-binding proteins of unknown function. We hypothesized that HnoX acts as a NO sensor that is involved in regulating symbiosis-related genes during initiation of symbiosis. With an aim to discover the genes whose regulations respond to NO signal, and in an HnoX-mediated fashion in particular, we carried out a whole-genome expression study on the wild-type and an insertional mutant of hnoX.
