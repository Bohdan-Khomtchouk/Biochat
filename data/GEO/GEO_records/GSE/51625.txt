TITLE
Expression data from human abdominal, subcutaneous adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FCHL is a common, complex genetic lipid disorder with a largely unknown aetiology. Altered adipose tissue metabolism has been implicated as contributing to FCHL. We used microarrays to investigate the mRNA profiles of FCHL patients with CHD and non-FCHL patients with CHD in comparison with non-FCHL, non-CHD patients to define a core set of genes that were differentially expressed in FCHL and to provide a reasonable launch-pad for examining the direct contribution of one of this gene set to the development of adipose tissue.

DESIGN
Adipose tissue was obtained from the same anatomical site - the subcutaneous, upper abdominal region - of white British males, either at coronary artery bypass surgery (designated as: FCHL-CHD (13 individuals, subdivided on TG response to statins into Group 1 (n=4), Group 2 (n=7) and unclassified (n=2)) and non-FCHL-CHD patients (6 individuals)), or at heart valve replacement: non-FCHL, non-CHD subjects (5 individuals; controls).
