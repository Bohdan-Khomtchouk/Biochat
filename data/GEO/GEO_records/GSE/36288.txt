TITLE
Expression data from LSK cells from mice with knock-out of Ezh1 versus LSK control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ezh1 is a protein member of PRC2. Ezh1 has been described as a functional repressor gene, such as its homologous Ezh2. We are investigating the role of Ezh1 in hematopoietic stem cells, aging, self-renewal and differentiation. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in LSK cells from mice with knocked-down expression of Ezh1.

DESIGN
LSK cells from EZH1 knockout and control mice were marked and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. 2 replicates each.
