TITLE
Changes in Gene expression during the development and progression of mammary tumors in MMTV-Wnt-1 and MMTV-Neu TG mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of samples from normal virgin mammary glands, hyperplastic mammary glands, mamary tumors, and lung metastases from MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic (TG) mice, and mammary tumors and lung metastases from MMTV-Neu trangenic (TG) mice Keywords: Array analysis, multi-step tumorigenesis, metastasis, MMTV-Wnt-1 trangenic mice, MMTV-Neu transgenic mice

DESIGN
1.  We compared expression prifiles among 5 normal virgin mammary glands, 7 hyperplastic mammary glands and 23 mammary tumors from MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic  mice, and 12 mammary tumors from MMTV-Neu transgenic mice. 2.  We compared expression profiles between 23 mammary tumors and 10 lung metastases from MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic mice and 12 mammary tumors and 5 lung metastases from MMTV-Neu transgenic mice. The experiments for the above comparisons were performed in the same time frame using a single array print and the same batch of reference RNA.
