TITLE
Transcriptional Adaptation to Clcn5 Knockout in Proximal Tubules of the Mouse Kidney

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dent disease has multiple defects attributed to proximal tubule malfunction including low molecular weight proteinuria, aminoaciduria, phosphaturia and glycosuria. In order to understand the changes in kidney function of the Clc5 transporter gene knockout mouse model of Dent disease, we examined gene expression profiles from proximal tubules of mouse kidneys. Overall 720 genes are expressed differentially in the proximal tubules of the Dent Clcn5 knockout mouse model compared to those of control wild type mice. The fingerprint of these gene changes may help us to understand the phenotype of Dent disease. Keywords: gene knockout, mouse, Clcn5, Dent's disease
