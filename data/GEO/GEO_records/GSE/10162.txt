TITLE
Transcriptional Adaptation to Clcn5 Knockout in Proximal Tubules of the Mouse Kidney

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dent disease has multiple defects attributed to proximal tubule malfunction including low molecular weight proteinuria, aminoaciduria, phosphaturia and glycosuria. In order to understand the changes in kidney function of the Clc5 transporter gene knockout mouse model of Dent disease, we examined gene expression profiles from proximal tubules of mouse kidneys. Overall 720 genes are expressed differentially in the proximal tubules of the Dent Clcn5 knockout mouse model compared to those of control wild type mice. The fingerprint of these gene changes may help us to understand the phenotype of Dent disease. Keywords: gene knockout, mouse, Clcn5, Dent's disease

DESIGN
Renal proximal tubules were dissected from wild type and Clcn5 knockout mice. Mice were anesthetized with halothane, the abdominal aorta of each animal was accessed and the left kidney was perfused with an ice-cold salt.  Proximal tubule dissection was performed in an ice-cold salt solution. After dissection of approximately 80-100 segments of 2 mm in length per kidney, the RNA for 3-4 mice was combined to have enough RNA per chip. 3 microarrays each of wild type and knockout mouse proximal tubule were processed
