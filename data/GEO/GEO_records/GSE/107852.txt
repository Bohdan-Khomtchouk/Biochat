TITLE
Phenotypes and niche adaptation of bloom forming Microcystis aerruginosa in a heterogeneous environment revealed by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Microcystis aeruginosa KW

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was applied to compare the changes in transcriptional patterns for these morphotypes of M. aeruginosa KW strain in spatially heterogeneous environment. The main objective was to identify the differentially expressed transcripts and get meaningful information about the molecular mechanism that could be the regulators of this differing morphological and physiological states of these morphs.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of S-morphotype and W-morphotype of Microcystis aeruginosa strain KW using Illumina HiSeq 2500, without replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL24358 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Microcystis aeruginosa KW)
