TITLE
Gene expression profiling of C57BL/6 mouse lung tissue with various treatments using the MA07 array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Flaxseed (FS), a nutritional supplement consisting mainly of omega-3 fatty acids and lignan phenolics, has potent anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and antioxidant properties. We have shown that dietary FS supplementation ameliorates oxidative stress and inflammation in experimental models of acute and chronic lung injury in mice resulting from diverse toxicants. The development of lung tissue damage in response to direct or indirect oxidant stress is a complex process, associated with changes in expression levels of a number of genes. We therefore postulated that flaxseed may modulate gene expression of vital signaling pathways, thus interfering with the development of tissue injury. We evaluated gene expression in lungs of flaxseed-fed (10% FS) mice under unchallenged, control conditions and 48hrs post-radiation treatment (13.5 Gy). Gene expression levels in lung tissues were analyzed using three arrays for each sample, whereby a total of 28,800 genes were evaluated.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 black mice were fed a 10% flaxseed diet for 21 days and/or given 13.5Gy thoracic radiation and sacrificed 48hrs post radiation.
