TITLE
Whole genome transcriptome profiling of Pusa 1266 and Pusa Basmati 1 in panicle primordia stage

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify candidate genes responsible for grain number per panicle between a pair of rice varieties (Pusa 1266 and Pusa Basmati 1) by combining QTL analysis with expression analysis.   Microarray analysis of RNA extracted from the panicle primordia showed 2741 differentially expressed genes.  The differentially expressed genes were shortened to 18 on the basis of their occurance in the QTL region (responsible for grain number regulation) detected in RIL population derived from Pusa 1266 and Pusa Basmati 1.

DESIGN
RNA from the stage '0' panicle primordia of Pusa 1266 and Pusa Basmati 1 were analysed in two different biological replications  (A and B) making total four samples
