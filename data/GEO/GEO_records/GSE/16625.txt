TITLE
5-azacytidine and entinostat treatment of patients with MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), and high risk AML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Early epigenetic changes and DNA damage do not predict clinical response in an overlapping schedule of 5-azacytidine and entinostat in patients with myeloid malignancies. The patients with MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), and high risk AML were treated with sequential administration of methylation inhibitor drugs (5AC and entinostat). To study gene expresion regulation in treated patients, microarray analysis was done on RNA samples extracted from CD34+ cells from 18 patients before and 15 days after treatment using Affymetrix U133Plus2.0.

DESIGN
18 enrolled patients were treated with sequential administration of 5AC and entinostat and microarray analysis were done on RNA samples from CD34+ cells before and 15 days after treatment using Affymetrix U133Plus2.0. One chip was used for one sample and there was no technical replicates. Twelve pairs of day 0 and day 15 specimens passed quality control for hybridization and RNA integrity. A list of differentially regulated genes was created after GC-RMA normalization by t-test paired using a 1.5 fold cut-off with p < 0.005.
