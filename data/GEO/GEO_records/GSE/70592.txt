TITLE
Checking the origin utilisation of Haloferax mediterranei H13 through high-throughput DNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Haloferax mediterranei

SUMMARY
A potential origin that appears to stay dormant in its native host Haloferax volcanii lacking the main active origins becomes activated and competent for replication of the entire chromosome when integrated into the chromosome of the origin-deleted H. mediterranei.

DESIGN
Measurement of replication dynamics (marker frequency analysis; MFA) for Haloferax mediterranei H13
