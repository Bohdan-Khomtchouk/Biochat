TITLE
Characterization of FOXL2 and 17beta-estradiol transcriptional function in mouse granulosa cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FOXL2 is a lineage determining transcription factor in the ovary, but its direct targets and modes of action are not fully characterized. Interaction of FOXL2 with several members of the nuclear receptor familly of transcription factors has been described, and many nuclear receptors play a key role in ovarian biology. Here, we explore the effect of FOXL2 on estrogen signaling in murine primary follicular cells.

DESIGN
siRNA targeting FOXL2 or control siRNA were used in conjunction with 17beta-estradiol or vehicle (2x2=4 conditions). Each condition was analysed in completely independent biological duplicates (i.e. cell from different animals grown independently)
