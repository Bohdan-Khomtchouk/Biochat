TITLE
Response prediction to neoadjuvant chemotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated whether we could identify gene expression profiles in initial core biopsies of breast cancer samples that would permit to a) predict a clinically meaningful response to Epi/Doc in terms of tumor size reduction, b) predict a profound reduction in intratumoral Ki67 protein expression, and c) predict an in vitro response to Epi/Doc in the ATP-TCA.

DESIGN
22 Samples from breast cancer patients with corresponding treatment response indicators

PLATFORM
GPL96 [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array
