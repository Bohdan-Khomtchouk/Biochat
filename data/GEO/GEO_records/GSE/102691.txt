TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis root cells

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Effect of added 0.5 mM ATP on gene expression, 60 min after treatment We used microarrays to detail ATP-induced up- and down- regulated genes

DESIGN
Roots of 4 d-old seedlings were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Gene expression before and after ATP treatment was detected. The relative expression level was calculated.
