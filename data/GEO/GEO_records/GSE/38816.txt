TITLE
Intratumoral diversity in Follicular lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Follicular lymphoma (FL) shows heterogenous expression of the cell surface B-cell marker, CD20. In order to investigate whether this heterogeneity also marks underlying transcriptional heterogeneity, we sorted tumor B-cells from 8 FL specimens based upon their intermediate or high expression of CD20 and transcriptionally profiled them.

DESIGN
CD20 intermediate and CD20 high tumor B-cells were sorted by FACS, RNA extracted, and profiled using Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 microarrays.
