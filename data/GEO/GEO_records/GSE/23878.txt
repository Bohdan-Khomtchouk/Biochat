TITLE
Genome Wide Expression Analysis of Middle Eastern Colorectal Cancer Reveals FOXM1 as a Novel Target for Cancer Therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify potential genes that may play an important role in progression of colorectal carcinoma, we screened and validated the global gene expression using cDNA expression array on 36 CRC tissues and compared with 24 non-cancerous colorectal tissue. We investigated the differential expression levels using cDNA microarray technique in a series of 35 CRC and 24 normal samples. FoxM1 was identified as one of the dysregulated genes and was  significantly overexpressed in the tumor samples in comparison to the normal samples.

DESIGN
35 colorectal cancer samples versus 24 normal samples.
