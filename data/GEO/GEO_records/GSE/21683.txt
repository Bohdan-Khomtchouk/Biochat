TITLE
Impact of CDK4-deficiency on Eµ-myc driven B-lymphoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Impact of  CDK4-deficiency on Eµ-myc driven B-lymphoma By crossing mating CDK4 Knockout mice with Eµ-myc mice,We found CDK4-deficiency enhances the Eµ-myc induced  B-lymphoma.We further to discover the molecular mechanism

DESIGN
B-lymphoma cells form the cdk4+/+ Eµ-myc and cdk4-/-Eµ-myc mice and then culturing for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
