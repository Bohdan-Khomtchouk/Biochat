TITLE
Activation of Parathyroid Hormone 2 Receptor Induces Decorin Expression and Promotes Wound Repair

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TIP39 is an specific agonist of PTH2R. In this paper, we investigated the TIP39-PTH2R response on extracellular matrix which is produced by fibroblasts and adipocytes.

DESIGN
Each sample's RNA was isolated form a single biological source of P3 human preadipocytes. In total there are 4 samples (non-replicates); Control + differentiation media (shRNA), PTH2R knockdown + differentiation media (shRNA against PTH2R), Control + non-differentiation media (shRNA), PTH2R knockdown +non- differentiation media (shRNA against PTH2R)
