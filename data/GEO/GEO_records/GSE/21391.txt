TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between a human epididymal cell line derived from the caput epididymidis of a fertile patient and another one derived from the caput epididymidis of an obstructive azoospermic patient

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human epididymal cell lines FHCE1 and IHCE1 respectively derived from the caput epididymidis of a fertile and an obstructive azoospermic patient. These two cell lines are comprised of homogenous populations of principal cells immortalized with the SV40 Large T antigen. Goal was to determine if cell junctions are impaired in this type of male infertility.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, FHCE1 vs. IHCE1 cells. Replicates: 3 replicates from each cell line.
