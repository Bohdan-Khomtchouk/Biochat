TITLE
Large conserved domains of low DNA methylation maintained by 5-hydroxymethycytosine and Dnmt3a [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the global transcriptome expression in Wild Type mouse hematopoietic stem cells, we performed high-throughput sequencing of Poly A+ RNA (RNA-Seq) from purified HSCs (SP-KSL-CD150+). With biological duplicates, more than 200 million reads in total were obtained.

DESIGN
Mouse hematopoietic stem cell mRNA profiles of wild type mice were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2000.
