TITLE
Gene expression profile in MCF7 breast cancer cells after 78 functionallly important molecules were knocked down using siRNA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix microarray data was generated from MCF7 breast cancer cells treated in vitro with siRNAs against 78 transcription factors and signalling molecules.

DESIGN
Gene expresion of 78 functionally important molecules were knocked down in MCF7 breast cancer cells using siRNA. Then the gene expression profiles of these MCF7 cells, along with untreated cells and non-targetting control (SICONTROL) treated cells were analysed using microarrays.
