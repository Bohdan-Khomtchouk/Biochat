TITLE
Comparison between conventionally-isolated and laser capture microdissected glomeruli

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We compared the gene expression  analysis of 2 different glomerular isolation techniques  (laser capture microdissection with 2 rounds of RNA amplification and unamplified glomerular RNA after iron perfusion with glomerular sieving) and  obtained different results depending on the glomerular isolation technique that was used Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Paired kidneys from Lewis-Hsd rat kidneys were collected. The glomeruli of one kidney was obtained by LCM with 2 rounds of RNA amplification while the unamplified glomerular RNA of the contralateral kidney was obtained after perfusion with iron oxide and isolated by magnetic purification and a glomerular sieving technique. The RNA was analyzed using the Affymetrix  Rat 230A microarrays.
