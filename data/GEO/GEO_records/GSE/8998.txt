TITLE
Comparison between conventionally-isolated and laser capture microdissected glomeruli

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We compared the gene expression  analysis of 2 different glomerular isolation techniques  (laser capture microdissection with 2 rounds of RNA amplification and unamplified glomerular RNA after iron perfusion with glomerular sieving) and  obtained different results depending on the glomerular isolation technique that was used Keywords: time course
