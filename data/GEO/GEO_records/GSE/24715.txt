TITLE
Amplification in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic and clinical analyses of major amplification events in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP 50K XbaI chips were used to anaylyze 57 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma samples and selected cases were further analyzed using Affymetrix SNP 250K StyI chips
