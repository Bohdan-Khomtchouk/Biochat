TITLE
Genomic and Proteomic Characterization of Sessile and Planktonic Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
In order to understand the cellular mechanisms that facilitate a surface-associated lifestyle, expression profiles were determined at the levels of transcription and translation for sessile and planktonic Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 (obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 700819)). These investigations indicate that the immobilized bacteria undergo a shift in cellular priorities away from metabolic, motility and protein synthesis capabilities towards emphasis on iron uptake, oxidative stress defense and membrane transport. Keywords: transcript profiling

DESIGN
Growth in broth was achieved by transferring stock culture to MH broth in tissue culture flasks and incubated microaerobically. Growth on agar was achieved by transferring stock culture onto MH agar plates, spreading the culture to produce a lawn, and incubation microaerobically. Cell densities in both growth conditions increased steadily up to 12 hrs and maximum cell densities were achieved at 18 hrs following which cell death starts to occur. Thus based on the growth curve C. jejuni cells at 16 hrs of incubation were used in all studies.
