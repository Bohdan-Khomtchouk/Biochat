TITLE
Light exposure of wild-type and kdmA deletion mutant

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of wild-type and kdmA deletion mutant in response to white light exposure, against a wild-type dark-incubated reference

DESIGN
Two strains, two conditions. Two biological replicates were hybridised (as dye swaps) for each sample, with the exception of a single sample for the kdmA mutant in the dark (incidental to the main results of the study).

PLATFORM
GPL5138 TIGR PFGRC Aspergillus nidulans v1 array based on strain FGSC A4 (condensed - does not contain replicate spots)
