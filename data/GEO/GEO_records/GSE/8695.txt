TITLE
Interplay between genetic background and genome evolution

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used genome-wide microarray comparative genomic hybridization to investigate the response of cells of related genetic backgrounds to challenge with methotrexate to gain a better understanding of the underlying defects which foster specific aberrations. Keywords: array CGH

DESIGN
Array CGH experiments of cell line genomic DNA as test samples and normal human genomic DNA as reference sample.
