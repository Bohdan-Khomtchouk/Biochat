TITLE
RNA-Seq of Escherichia coli after anaerobic-aerobic transition

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
E. coli K12 strain W3110 was used in this study. Cells were grown anaerobically in defined medium at pH7 and 37Â°C in a stirred 3-liter bioreactor until the culture reached an OD (600nm) of 3. At that point the first sample was drawn and aeration was started subsequently at 1l/min. 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min after the onset of aeration additional samples were drawn.

DESIGN
3 replicates of anaerobic culture and 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min after aeration

PLATFORM
GPL18133 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Escherichia coli)
