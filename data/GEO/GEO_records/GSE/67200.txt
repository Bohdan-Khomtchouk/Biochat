TITLE
A Randomized Clinical Trial to Study the Effects of Single Doses of Corticosteroid on Response to Nasal Allergen Challenge in Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled genome-wide gene expression in nasal scrapes following grass pollen challenge and Prednisone treatment. It was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period, cross-over trial to evaluate the effects of single oral doses of 10 mg and 25 mg of prednisone on inflammatory mediators measured in nasal exudates after nasal allergen challenge in susceptible individuals with allergic rhinitis. It examined the ability to quantify responses to allergen challenge and resolve dose responsive treatment effects of prednisone.

DESIGN
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three treatment period crossover study in 19 healthy patients with allergic rhinitis and allergy to grass pollen. Allergen was rapidly delivered using a nasal mist delivery system. Period 0 was a baseline in the absence of allergen challenge.
