SUMMARY
Androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that plays a key role in the onset and progression of prostate cancer. Surprisingly little is known of AR binding sites and collaborating transcription factors in the human genome. Here we have identified the DNA sequence motifs that are significantly enriched within the authentic 90 AR target regions found on chromosomes 21 and 22 in human prostate cancer cells by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation for AR with chromosome-scale tiled oligonucleotide microarrays. By integrating the DNA sequence motif data with the gene expression profiles from human prostate cancers we identified the transcription factors that recognize each of these motifs. These factors form complexes with AR, bind to specific AR target regions and govern androgen-dependent transcription. Together with AR these collaborating transcription factors form a regulatory network that directs prostate cancer growth and survival and identify potential new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.
