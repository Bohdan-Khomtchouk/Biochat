TITLE
Cell host-response to infection with novel human coronavirus EMC predict potential antivirals and important differences with SARS-coronavirus.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential expression was determined in Calu-3 cells between mock infected and infection with either Human coronavirus EMC and SARS coronavirus at different times post infection.

DESIGN
Calu-3 2B4 cells were infected with Human Coronavirus EMC 2012 (HCoV-EMC) or mock infected.  Samples were collected 0, 3, 7, 12, 18 and 24 hpi. There are 3 mock and 3 infected replicates for each time point, except for 12 hpi for which there are only 2 infected replicates (one replicate did not pass RNA quality check).  There were no mock sampes at 18 hpi, and therefore infected samples at 18 hpi were compared with mocks at 24 hpi. For direct comparison with SARS-CoV infected cells, raw data from HCoV-EMC experiments were quantile normalized together with the SARS-CoV dataset (GEO Series accession number GSE33267).
