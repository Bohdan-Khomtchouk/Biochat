TITLE
Isolation and in vitro expansion of human colonic stem cells [CGH]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tissue for normal colonic stem cell isolation was obtained via colectomy from a colorectal cancer patient. It was shown that the resected tissue and the in vitro-cultured organoids grown from tissue-derived adult stem cells do not harbor chromosomal alterations. For that purpose, genomic DNA from resected mucosa or genomic DNA from adult stem cell-derived organoids grown in a 3-dimensional culture system was compared to white blood cell genomic DNA obtained from the same individual. Furthermore, in vitro organoids which were cultured and serially passaged for several weeks did not acquire chromosomal alterations.

DESIGN
Analysis of chromosomal stability of colonic tissue or in vitro-cultured organoids via comparison with blood cells derived from the same individual.
