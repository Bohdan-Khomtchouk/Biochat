TITLE
Expression data from a mouse small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line, KP1, transfected with Notch-ICD

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transient transfection of activated Notch1 (Notch1-ICD) decreases cellular proliferation and reduces the expression of a subset of neuroendocrine genes. We used microarrays to identify the gene expression changes 48 hours after overexpression of Notch1-ICD.

DESIGN
mSCLC cells transfected with Notch1-ICD-ires-GFP were FACS sorted for GFP+ cells 48 hours after transfection. RNA was then extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse Gene 2.0 ST array.

PLATFORM
