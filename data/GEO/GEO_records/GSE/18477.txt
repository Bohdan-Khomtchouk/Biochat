TITLE
Normal expression of facial prominences in stage 18 chicken embros

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The face is one of the three regions most frequently affected by congenital defects in humans. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved it is necessary to have a more complete picture of gene expression in the embryo. Here we use microarrays to profile expression in chicken facial prominences, post neural crest migration and prior to differentiation of mesenchymal cells. Chip-wide analysis revealed that maxillary and mandibular prominences had similar expression profiles while the frontonasal mass chips were distinct. Of the 3094 genes that were differentially expressed in one or more regions of the face, a group of 56 genes was subsequently validated with quantitative PCR and a subset examined with in situ hybridization. Microarrays trends were consistent with the QPCR data for the majority of genes (81%). On the basis of QPCR and microarray data, groups of genes that characterize each of the facial prominences can be determined. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying facial morphogensis keyword: craniofacial

DESIGN
Chicken embryos were selected at a stage after neural crest cells have ceased migration, when facial prominences have formed and prior to ctyodifferentiation of cartilage, bone, muscle. Microdissection was used to isolate facial prominences. Embryos were dissected on ice in Hanks Buffered Salt Solution and batches of 26-32 pieces were snap frozen in liquid Nitrogen. These pooled facial prominences comprised one biological replicate. A total of three biological replicates were generated for the frontonasal mass, maxillary and mandibular prominences.
