TITLE
Transcriptome analysis reveal the mechanism of Fungicidal of Thymol against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. niveum

ORGANISM
Fusarium oxysporum

SUMMARY
Thymol (5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl) phenol, PubChem CID: 6989) has been extensively reported to have antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, the growth of F. oxysporum was significantly inhibited by thymol in vitro. The dry weight of F. oxysporum was decreased significantly. Thymol-induced cell membrane damage was observed at 24 hpi (hours post incubation). Therefore, the changes in the gene expression level of F. oxysporum after treatment with 80 μg/mL (average EC50 value) of thymol were analyzed using RNA-seq to reveal the underlying fungicidal mechanisms of thymol.

DESIGN
F. oxysporum was cultured in PDB as a control, the F. oxysporum cultured in PDB with 80 μg/mL of thymol was the experiment group. Three biological replicates were performed.

PLATFORM
