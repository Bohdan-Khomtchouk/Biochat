TITLE
Differentially expressed genes after miRNA or siRNA transfection in human cancer cell lines (II)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes by anti cancer treatments (microRNAs or siRNAs) in human cancer, several cell lines (bladder cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human cancer cell lines (SAS, HSC3, BOY, T24, PC3, PC3M, DU145, C4-2, 786-O, A-498 and EBC-1) were treated with miRNAs (miR-205, miR-29a, miR-144-3p, miR-144-5p, miR-451, miR-210, miR-145-5p, miR-145-3p, miR-23b cluster, miR-221, miR-222 and miR-223), siRNAs (si-GOLM1, si-HMGB3, si-CENPF, si-LOXL2, si-TMEM184B and si-CORO1C).
