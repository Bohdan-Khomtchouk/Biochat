TITLE
Prediction of survival in diffuse large B cell lymphoma treated with chemotherapy plus Rituximab

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of DLBCL patient samples was performed to investigate, whether molecular gene expression signatures retain their prognostic significance in patients treated with chemotherapy plus Rituximab. The lymphnode, germinal center signature and a new angiogenesis signature were combined to a final multivariate model which defined quartile groups among Rituximab-CHOP-treated patients with distinct 3-year overall survival rates. Keywords: clinical history design

DESIGN
The retrospective study included 181 clinical samples from CHOP-treated patients and 233 clinical samples from Rituximab-CHOP-treated patients.
