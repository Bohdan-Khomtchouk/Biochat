TITLE
Alterations in soybean gene expression profile after foliar application of lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) from Bradyrhizobium japonicum under sub-optimal temperature

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) produced by N2-fixing rhizobacteria initiate host nodule formation.  Foliar application of LCOs has been shown to induce stress-related genes under optimal growth conditions.  To study the effects of LCO foliar spray under stressed conditions, soybean seedlings grown at optimal temperature were exposed to sub-optimal temperature.  After a 5-day acclimation period, the first trifoliolate leaves were sprayed with 10-7 M LCO (NodBj-V (C18:1, MeFuc)) produced by Bradyrhizobium japonicum, and harvested at 0 and 48 h following treatment.  Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip® Soybean Genome Arrays.  A total of 147 genes were differentially expressed 48 h after LCO treatment, including a number of stress-related genes and transcription factors.  In addition, during the 48 h following treatment, hundreds of genes were differentially expressed in LCO-treated plants, indicating that the dynamic soybean foliar transcriptome was highly responsive to LCO treatment.  The microarray data was supported by quantitative real-time PCR data.

DESIGN
Soybean seedlings grown at optimal temperature (25 °C) were exposed to sub-optimal temperature (15 °C).  After a 5-day acclimation period, the first trifoliolate leaves were sprayed with 10-7 M LCO (NodBj-V (C18:1, MeFuc)) produced by Bradyrhizobium japonicum, and harvested at 0 and 48 h following treatment.  Total RNA was extracted and microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip® Soybean Genome Arrays.
