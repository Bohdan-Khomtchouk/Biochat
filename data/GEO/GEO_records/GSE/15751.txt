TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of time couse of leafy spurge infection with Xam

ORGANISM
Euphorbia esula

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify signaling processes associated with infection and recovery of leafy spurge inoculated with Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam).

DESIGN
Two dye-swap technical replicates for each of 3 biological replicates for each treatment were analyzed. A time course analysis of Xam infected and mock inoculated leafy spurge was performed. Time points were 1, 7 and 21 days after inoculation (or mock inoculation). Thus, 36 labeled samples were hybridized in a 2 dye rolling circle hybridization scheme to 18 arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL4655 High density Euphorbia esula and Manihot esculenta array
