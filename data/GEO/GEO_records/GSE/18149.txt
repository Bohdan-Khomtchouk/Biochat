TITLE
Transcriptome and proteome analyses of the CtrA regulon and growth-phase regulation in Rhodobacter capsulatus

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter capsulatus

SUMMARY
The samples in this series were used to analyze the transcriptome of the CtrA regulon using wild type (SB1003) and ctrA mutant (SBRM1) strains of Rhodobacter capsulatus. As well, the transcriptome of growth phase regulation in R. capsulatus SB1003 between log and stationary phases was determined.

DESIGN
This study included wild type and mutant samples from both log and stationary growth phases. Three biological replicates of each sample were used, yielding a total sample size (including replicates) of 12. Results compared wild type and mutant cultures in both log and stationary phase, as well as comparison between log and stationary phase of wild type.
