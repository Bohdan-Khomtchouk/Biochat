affy_tour_2010_21-Assessing drought stress transcriptomics in Helianthus annus in field cultures

ORGANISM
Helianthus annuus

SUMMARY
affy_tour_2010_21 - affy_tour_2010_21 - The aim of this project is to assess the possibility of implementing transcriptomic studies on sunflower plants grown in field assays. Data obtained from plants under drought in the glasshouse have already obtained. We intend to use these results as a template and see if the field offers the possibility of carrying these studies. In order to do so, treatment-effect as well as intra and inter-plot variability will be assessed.-Plants were grown in the field. The assay was arranged in plots with one genotype per plot. The assay was divided in two identically seized parts, containing the same number of plots. Starting from the capitule, flower # -3 was harvested in every plant. In some cases, several plants from the same plot were harvested. In other, plants from different plots were harvested. We expect that this sampling will allow us to assess intra- as well as inter-plot variability in the analysis of drought-driven gene expression modulation.

DESIGN
24 arrays - SUNFLOWER; treated vs untreated comparison
