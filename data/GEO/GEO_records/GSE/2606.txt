TITLE
Gene expressing profiling of PC12 cells expressing the FGFR3 mutation responsible for thanatophoric dysplasia type II

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To investigate signaling pathways activated by FGFR3 mutations through an analysis of altered expression of downstream transcriptional targets, we performed gene expression profiling of stably transfected inducible PC12 cells expressing a chimeric receptor (PFR3) consisting of the extracellular domain of human platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of human FGFR3 under the control of the zinc inducible metalliothionein promoter.  Cells expressing the wildtype receptor (i.e. zinc induced) were compared to cells expressing the mutant receptor PFR3K650E, which contains the thanatophoric dysplasia type II mutation, K650E.  See PubMed ID for further description of samples. Keywords = thanatophoric dysplasia Keywords = FGFR3 Keywords = PC12 Keywords = ERK1/2 Keywords: repeat sample
