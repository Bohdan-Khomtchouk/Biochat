TITLE
Expression data from superior cervical ganglion cultured cells and whole tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A transcriptomic expression comparison was done among superior cervical ganglion (SCG) cells cultured on 2D substrates, 3D porous polystyrene scaffolds, and in freshly dissected tissue (in vivo surrogate), with the goal of assessing the feasibility of establishing the meaning of 3D and associated physiological relevance at the molecular level

DESIGN
SCG cells were cultured on 2D surfaces and in 3D scaffolds. Chemical cues are controlled by coating. Only spacial properties of the culture systems were compared. Cells from freshly dissected tissue were used as in vivo surrogates for positive control of 3D cells.
