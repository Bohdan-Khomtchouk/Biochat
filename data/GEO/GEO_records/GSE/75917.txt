TITLE
Identification of regulator of DYRK2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to  identified new factor that regulates key factors in siRNA  DYRK2 cells.

DESIGN
We  silenced DYRK2 in MCF-7 cells (siDYRK2 cells) using siRNA. For control, non-silencing siRNA was used. We obtained expression profiles from siDYRK2 cells and sControl cells.
