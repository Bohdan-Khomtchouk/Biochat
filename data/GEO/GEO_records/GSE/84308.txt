TITLE
H3.3 depletion has a mild effect on the global transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of H3.3 KO/Kd mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)

DESIGN
We isolated total RNA from control shRNA treated or shH3.3A treated H3.3B KO MEFs and carried out Ribozero RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq analysis was carried out on pooled datasets from biological duplicate experiments.
