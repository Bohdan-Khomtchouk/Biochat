TITLE
Low SLC22A7 expression in noncancerous liver promotes hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence - a prospective study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background & Aims: The recurrence determines the postoperative prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is unknown whether de novo HCCs derive from the liver with disability of an organic anion transport. This study was designed to elucidate the link between such transporters and the multicentric occurrence (MO) after radical hepatectomy. Results: SLC22A7 expression was the best predictor of metastasis-free survival (MFS) as judged by the GA (Fold, 0.726; P=0.001). High SLC22A7 gene expression in noncancerous tissue prevent HCC occurrence after hepatectomy (Odds Ratio (OR), 0.2; 95%CI, 0.1-0.6; P=0.004). Multivariate analyses of MFS revealed the independent risk factor to be SLC22A7 expression (OR, 0.3; 95%CI, 0.1-1.0, P=0.043). Low SLC22A7 expression caused MO of HCC significantly (log-rank, P=0.001). In the validation study, multivariate analyses of MFS revealed the independent risk factor to be SLC22A7 expression (OR, 0.5; 95%CI, 0.3-0.8; P=0.012). As judged by Gene set-enrichment analysis, SLC22A7 down-regulation associated with mitochondrion (P=0.008; false discovery rate (FDR)=0.199; normalized enrichment score (NES) =1.804), oxidoreductase activity (P=0.006; FDR=0.157; NES=1.854) and fatty acid metabolic process (P=0.021; FDR=0.177; NES=1.723). Sirtuin3 also determined MFS (P= 0.018). Conclusions: These pathways involving SLC22A7 dysfunction may promote the occurrence of HCC.

DESIGN
The 49 noncancerous liver tissues of HCC patients within Milan criteria, treated at our institution between January 2004 and August 2008, were examined as a training set by genome-wide gene expression analysis (GA). Cox proportional hazards regression analyses for MO-free survival (MFS) were performed to estimate the risk factors. Using the independent two institutional cohorts of 134 patients between September 2008 and December 2009, a validation study was employed using tissue microarrays.
