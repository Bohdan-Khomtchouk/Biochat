TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Analysis of Wild Type and SRSF2-/- D11 mice liver Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated the liver specific SRSF2 -/- mice, and collected their liver at 11 day after birth and controls. Then, we extracted RNAs and performed next generation sequencing. By comparing sequencing data from WT and SRSF2 -/- samples, we profiled the alternative splicing events and gene expression regulated by SRSF2 during mouse liver development process.

DESIGN
D11 liver mRNA profiles of wild type (WT) and  liver specific SRSF2-/- mice were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
