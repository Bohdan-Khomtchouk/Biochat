TITLE
Oligoarray analysis of mRNA species from DCs treated with C. parvum for 24 h.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate whether C. parvum treatment of DCs regulates other inflammatory genes, mouse BMDCs (CD11c and CD11b positive) were treated with C. parvum for 24 hr. Control groups included untreated BMDCs and DCs treated with E. cuniculi.  We noticed that a significant upregulation of the expression of interferon-related genes, which may correlation the critical role of interferon in host defense against C. parvum infection.

DESIGN
DCs were treated with C. parvum for 24 hr. Control groups included untreated BMDCs and DCs treated with E. cuniculi. Group comparison was performed using the data of 3 replicate arrays from each time point.
