TITLE
The Global Transcriptional Response of Fission Yeast to Hydrogen Sulfide

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as an important gasotransmitter has fundamental roles in human diseases. The cellular effect of H2S has received lots of attention recently. H2S can affect ion channels, transcription factors and kinase in mammals. The mechanism of cellular effect of H2S is not completely understood. We used fission yeast as a model organism to study the global transcriptional profile in response to H2S by microarray.

DESIGN
The wild type S. pombe cells were grown in liquid medium to OD600=0.5. Then the cells were treated with or without 50μM of NaHS (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at 30℃.Total RNA was extracted from cells using a hot phenol method.The microarray experiments including RNA purification, cDNA probe preparation, hybridization, washing, scanning, image analysis, normalization and data processing were performed by Shanghai Biochip Co., Ltd. as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip_Expression Analysis Technical Manual. Three biological repeats were performed for the microarray experiments.
