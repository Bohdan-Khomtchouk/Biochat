TITLE
Expression data from hBMSCs cultured on PLLA nanofibers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nanotopographic cues from biomaterials exert powerful effects on the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells because of their niche-mimicking features. However, the biological mechanisms underlying cell lineage determination by surface nanotopography have not been clearly elucidated. Here, we explored the osteogenic behavior of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) on PLLA nanofibers with different orientations, and monitored the dynamic changes in global gene expression triggered by topographical cues.

DESIGN
The global gene expression of hBMSCs cultured on random and aligned nanofibers and induced with osteogenic supplement (OS) were analysed using microarray company with control at 4, 7, 14 and 21 days.
