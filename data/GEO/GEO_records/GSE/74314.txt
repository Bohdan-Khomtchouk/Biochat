TITLE
Comparative gene expression in adult SVZ-neurospheres neuronally differentiated under standard conditions and upon PARP1 inhibition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The relevance of DNA-dependent poly-ADP ribose production for neuronal differentiation of adult stem- and progenitor cells from the SVZ was studied. To identify genes whose up- or downregulation during neuronal differentiation requires the activity of poly-ADP-Ribosylase (PARP) 1 or 2, SVZ-derived adult neurosphere cultures were differentiated in the presence or absence of Olaparib.

DESIGN
Freshly isolated stem- and progenitor cells from the SVZ of adult mice were neuronally differentiated by transduction of Pax6. Two treatment regimes were compared: i) standard conditions ii) pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 and PARP2 by 100nM Olaparib in 0.01% DMSO.
