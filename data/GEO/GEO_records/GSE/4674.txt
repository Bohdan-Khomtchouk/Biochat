TITLE
Transcript profiling in A. pleuropneumoniae under iron restriction

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

SUMMARY
To better understand effects of iron starvation on A. pleuropneumoniae and to identify new potential vaccine targets, we conducted transcript profiling using a DNA microarray containing all 2025 ORFs of the genome of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5b strain L20.  Upon comparing growth of this pathogen in iron-sufficient versus iron-depleted medium, 210 genes were identified as being differentially expressed.  Some genes (92) were identified as being up-regulated; many have confirmed or putative roles in iron acquisition, such as the genes coding for two TonB energy-transducing proteins and the hemoglobin receptor HgbA.  Transcript profiling also led to identification of some new iron acquisition systems of A. pleuropneumoniae. Keywords: stress respsonse
