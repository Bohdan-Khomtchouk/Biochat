TITLE
Biodiversity and functional genomics of endogenous small RNAs induced upon biotic and abiotic stresses in plants (gemsupv2ts-7)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au10-09_gemsupv2ts-7 - gemsupv2ts-7 - Determine the level of expression in transgenic plants expressing geminiviral gene silencing suppressors. - One transgenic line of Arabidopsis overexpressing the geminiviral silencing suppressor V2TS was grown in adition to a control and their total RNA was extracted in order to study its genetic expression profile.

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - gene knock in (transgenic)

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
