TITLE
Identification of ATF2 target genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify transcriptional targets of ATF2, we used a recombinant adenovirus to express constitutively active ATF2 in murine hepatoblasts. Expression of GFP was the control condition. Total RNA was harvested from cells 8 hours post infection. Reverse transcription was performed using Ovation Pico WTA kit (NuGen, 3300-12). Labelling, Encore Biotin Module (NuGen, 4200-12)

DESIGN
three replicates GFP control and C2ATF2

PLATFORM
GPL10740 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
