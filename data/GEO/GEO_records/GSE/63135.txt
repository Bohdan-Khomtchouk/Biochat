TITLE
Altered levels of circulating miRNAs are associated with Schistosoma japonicum infection in mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling of  S. japonicum infected mouse plasma comparing control untreated mouse plasma. Schistosomiasis, caused by dioecious flatworms in the genus Schistosoma, is torturing people predominantly in the developing countries. Knowledge on schistosome-host interaction and its parasitism may result in the development of novel strategies for schistosomiasis control. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in a wide range of biological processes including development, cell proliferation, metabolism ,signal transduction, et al. Circulating miRNAs are not only important biomarker associated the process of pathogenesis in many diseases and also are able to regulate target gene expression in recipient cells, just like hormones. In the present study, we investigated circulating miRNA profile associated with S. japonicum infection in mice using miRNA microarray.
