TITLE
mRNAs and miRNAs expression data from AOM/DSS, AOM, DSS and control mouse colon epithelial tissue at day100 when tumor formed in AOM/DSS bearing mice --- miRNA microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To find out which miRNAs are significantly differential expression and potentially  involved in the process of inflammation promoting carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We established a colitis-associated CRC (AOM/DSS, Azoxymethane/Dextran sulfate sodium salt) model, colitis (DSS) model and high dose carcinogen (AOM, about 5 times AOM amount given than AOM/DSS model) model. At day 100 when tumor formed in AOM/DSS bearing mice (colitis-associated CRC mice) but no tumor was found in AOM (high dose carcinogen) and DSS model, we employed miRNA microarray as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to involve in the progression of CRC promoted by inflammation.

DESIGN
5-7 weeks female BALB/c mice, (1) AOM/DSS group: AOM 12.5mg/kg i.p. at day 1, DSS drinking 5d/21dx3circles from day 5; (2) AOM group: AOM 10mg/kg i.p. 1/weekx6 from day 1; (3) DSS group: DSS drinking 5d/21dx3circles from day 5. The distal colon epithelial tissues were collected at day100 when tumor formed in AOM/DSS bearing mice. The miRNA microarray experiments were performed together.
