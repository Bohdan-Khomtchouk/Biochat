TITLE
Resolving phenylalanine metabolism sheds light on natural synthesis of benzylpenicillin in Penicillium chrysogenum

ORGANISM
Penicillium chrysogenum

SUMMARY
Industrial production of penicillin G by Penicillium chrysogenum requires medium supplementation with the side chain precursor phenylacetate. However, P.chrysogenum grown in presence of phenylalanine as sole nitrogen source formed detectable extracellular amounts of phenylacetate and penicillin G. To get more insights in the metabolism implicated, chemostat-cultivation in presence of 13C9-phenylalanine were carried out.  Quantification and modeling of the labeled metabolite pools indicated that phenylalanine was i) incorporated in nascent protein, ii) transaminated to phenylpyruvate and further converted by oxidation or by decarboxylation and iii) oxidized into tyrosine and subsequently assimilated in the homogentisate pathway. Comparative transcriptome analysis of phenylalanine and (NH4)2SO4 grown P.chrysogenum cultures enabled to identify two putative 2-oxo acid decarboxylases Pc13g9300 and Pc18g01490. Both cDNAs were cloned and expressed in the decarboxylase-free Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK711-7C (pdc1delta, 5delta, 6delta, aro10delta, thi3delta) strain that has lost the ability to grow on glucose as sole carbon source or on phenylalanine as sole nitrogen source. Only Pc13g09300 was able to restore growth on glucose and on phenylalanine, demonstrating that this gene encodes a dual substrate pyruvate, phenylpyruvate decarboxylase. This newly identified thiamine-dependent 2-oxo acid decarboxylase provides clues to explain the formation of phenylacetate via an Ehrlich-like pathway in P.chrysogenum.

DESIGN
Penicillium chrysogenum DS17690 was grown in aerobic glucose limited chemostat at 25oC, pH 6.5 and a dilution rate of 0.03h-1 with either amonia or phenylalanine
