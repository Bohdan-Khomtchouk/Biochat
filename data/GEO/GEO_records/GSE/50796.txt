TITLE
Gene Expression Changes Between Patent and Fused Cranial Sutures in a Nonsyndromic Craniosynostosis Population

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Assaying gene expression in sutural bone fragments from patients diagnosed with non-syndromic craniosynostosis.  Sutural fragments were collected from both the fused and patent cranial suture of infants during cranial vault reconstruction.  Gene expression was compared between the patent and fused sutures using the paired t-test.  The aim was to identify thoses genes significantly differentially expressed in fused suture relative to patent.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from patent and fused human cranial sutures was assayed. Expression in synostosed suture was compared to patent suture.
