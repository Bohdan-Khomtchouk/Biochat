TITLE
Gene expression in a conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The specialized glomerular epithelial cell (podocyte) of the kidney is a complex cell that is often damaged in glomerular diseases. Study of this cell type is facilitated by an in vitro system of propagation of conditionally immortalized podocytes. Here, genes that are differentially expressed in this in vitro model of podocyte differentiation are evaluated.

DESIGN
Conditionally immortalized undifferentiated mouse podocytes were cultured under permissive conditions at 33*C. Podocytes that were differentiated at the non-permissive conditions at 37*C were used for comparison.
