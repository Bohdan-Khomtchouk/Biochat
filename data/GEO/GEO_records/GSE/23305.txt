TITLE
WT vs c-Maf KO fetal liver macrophage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Homozygous disruption of c-Maf led to embryonic lethality and impaired erythroblastic island formation. c-Maf is expressed in the fetal liver macrophages. It suggests that macrophages are responsible for the lethality of c-Maf knock-out embryos. To search downstream genes of c-Maf, we surveyed genes associated with macrophage function by microarray analysis. keywords: c-Maf, macrophage, erythroblastic islands,

DESIGN
WT (c-Maf WT) and c-Maf KO (c-Maf KO) fetal liver macrophages were sorted by a FACSAria cell sorter. Total RNAs from those macrophages were prepared using RNeasy Kit. Genes down-regulated in c-Maf KO macrophages were searched by GeneSpring software.
