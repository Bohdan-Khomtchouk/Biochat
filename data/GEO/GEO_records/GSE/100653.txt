TITLE
Genome-wide single base resolution profiling of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in human breast tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through parallel processing of genomic DNA with oxidative bisulfite treatments on Illumina 450K arrays we resolved both 5mC in human breast tissues.

DESIGN
Non-diseased breast tissue (n=18) DNA was subjected to tandem oxidative bisulfite conversion with an input of 4ug per sample using the TrueMethylÂ® kit v.1.1 (Cambridge Epigenetix) protocol optimized for Illumina HumanMethylation450 arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
