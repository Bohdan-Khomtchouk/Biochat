TITLE
Human Lung Fibroblasts treated with TGFbeta, IL1, EGF and small molecule inhibitors of TGFBR1 and p38

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experiment conducted to reverse engineer the transriptional response network of cytokines, growth factors and small molecular inhibitors in HLF cells. Global gene expression was analysed by microarrays

DESIGN
HLF cells were incubated with each agent for 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 2 hours or 8 hours  in standard conditions before total RNA was prepared and hybridised to Affymetrix microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL571 [HG-U133A_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array
