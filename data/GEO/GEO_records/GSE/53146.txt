TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression within vitiligo lesional skin with active inflammation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Vitiligo skin samples with an active inflammatory infiltrate were selected for gene expression profiling in order to identify inflammatory pathways that drive depigmentation in vitiligo.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 10 deidentified human samples from formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded skin, 5 from vitiligo patients and 5 from controls. Control skin was age- and site-matched excision tips without pathology.
