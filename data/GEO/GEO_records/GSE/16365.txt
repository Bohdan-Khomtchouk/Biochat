TITLE
Hybrid Poplar H11-11 Systemic Herbivory Response Dataset 1

ORGANISM
Populus

SUMMARY
We investigated the transcriptional response of hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa x deltoides) source and sink leaves to simulated herbivory (mechanical wounding plus the application of Malacosoma disstria oral secretions) over a 24 hour time course. Experiments were conducted using clonal trees under greenhouse conditions at the University of British Columbia. We used the 15.5K poplar cDNA microarray platform previously described by Ralph et al. (Molecular Ecology 2006, 15:1275-1297). Differentially expressed genes were determined using three criteria: fold-change between treated and untreated control leaves > 1.5-fold, P value < 0.05 and Q value < 0.05. This study identified > 3,000 differentially expressed genes in response to simulated insect feeding damage, which possess distinct source/sink and treated/systemic patterns.
