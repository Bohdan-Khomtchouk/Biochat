TITLE
Investigation of radiosensitivity gene signatures in cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Commercially available cell lines derived from Head and Neck Squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were cultured and baseline gene expression values were assayed. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying differences in radiosensitivity as measured by surviving fraction at 2Gy (SF2)

DESIGN
HNSCC Cell lines (n=11) were cultured in standard conditions. RNA was extracted at subconfluence.
