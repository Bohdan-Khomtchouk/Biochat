TITLE
Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of Escherichia coli isolates carrying virulence factors of both enteropathogenic and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli E2348/69

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli HS ; Escherichia coli O127:H6 str. E2348/69

SUMMARY
Global transcriptional analysis of EPEC/ETEC hybrid isolates.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed on seven E. coli during growth in laboratory media and conditions that have been previously demonstrated to induce expression of virulence genes.
