TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of left ventricle and peripheral blood cells in rats with post-myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Myocardial infarction (MI) often results in left ventricular (LV) remodeling followed by heart failure (HF). It is of great clinical importance to understand the molecular mechanisms that trigger transition from compensated LV injury to HF and to identify relevant diagnostic biomarkers. In this study, we performed transcriptional profiling of LVs in rats with a wide range of experimentally induced infarct sizes and of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in animals that developed HF. We used microarrays to investigate gene expression in the left ventricle (LV) accompanying myocardial infarction and concomitant heart failure (HF) in a well validated model of post-infarcted heart failure and to evaluate their reflection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)

DESIGN
Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in male Wistar rats by ligation of the proximal left coronary artery. The sham-operated group (control group) was subjected to the same protocol, except that the suture was not tied around the proximal left coronary artery. Sham-operated rats (n=6) and rats with small (n=6), moderate (n=6), and large (n=5) MI size were included into the experiment two months after the operation. Then, left ventricules and blood samples were obtained for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Microarrays were used to compare the LV and PBMCs transcriptomes of control and experimental animals. The development of heart failure was estimated by echocardiography and catheterization.
