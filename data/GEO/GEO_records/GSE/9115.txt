TITLE
Determination of  a cell proliferation and chromosomal instability signature in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comparison of profiles of normal thryoid tissue (NT), papillary thyroid carcinoma tissue (PTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma tissue (ATC) was carried out to identify expression patterns specifically associated with analplastic thyroid carcinoma Keywords: Expression profile survey of normal tissue and tumor subtypes

DESIGN
RNA from each of the 4 normal thyroids, 10 papillary thryoid carcinomas and 5 analplastic thryoid carcinomas was labeled (Cy5) and co-hybridized with RNA from a pool of throid cancer cell lines to an array of immobilized PCR products representing the inserts of human cDNA clones

PLATFORM
