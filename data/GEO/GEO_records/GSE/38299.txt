TITLE
Gene expression of mouse embryonic gonad [Cyp26b1_Stra8]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze the function of retinoic acid and Stra8 in the male germ cell differentiation, we performed expression microarray analysis of the Cyp26b1-/-/Stra8-/- male gonads at E14.5.

DESIGN
Biological duplicates were examined at each genotype for each experiment.
