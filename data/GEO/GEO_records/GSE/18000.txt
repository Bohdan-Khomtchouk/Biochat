TITLE
Gene expression comparison of drug-resistant Panc1/mock cells and Panc1 cells expressing wildtype syk

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently identified the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase syk as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.  Reintroduction of syk into Panc1 cells promoted a more differentiated phenotype and retarded invasion and tumorigenic growth. Gene array analysis identified over 2,000 transcripts differentially expressed at FDR < 0.01.  Among these were members of the MMP2 axis, which were subsequently shown to regulate Panc1 invasion. Keywords: Genetic manipulation (stable transgene expression)

DESIGN
Affymetrix global gene arrays were used to analyse differences in gene expression patterns in Panc1 cells stably reexpressing syk, or vector-only mock controls.  RNA was harvested from cells grown under identical conditions in standard culture.
