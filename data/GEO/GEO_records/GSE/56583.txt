TITLE
Effects of vitamin D supplementation on alveolar macrophage gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of the overall study was to determine the effects of  oral vitamin D supplementation on alveolar macrophages from human subjects. In this substudy, subjects treated with vitamin D (intervention group) in paired analysis had small, but significant effects on immune-related differential gene expression pre versus post supplementation. In this study, we obtained alveolar macrophages by bronchoalveolar lavage of subjects before and after a 3 month vitamin D trial.  RNA for the array was obtained shortly after bronchoscopy.

DESIGN
Randomized Controlled Trial: This is a substudy of paired samples of subjects treated with vitamin D.   Each sample was studied once.  22 individuals were studied.
