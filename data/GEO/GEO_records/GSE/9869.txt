SUMMARY
Kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3, also known as prostate-specific antigen, PSA) is a chymotrypsin-like kallikrein that has been shown to have anti-angiogenic properties. KLK3 expression in prostate cancer is associated with low microvessel density. We have previously shown in a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) model that the anti-angiogenic effect of KLK3 is related to its enzymatic activity. However, the mechanism of this effect remains to be clarified. To this end we have used a DNA microarray to study the KLK3-induced changes in gene expression associated with reduction of HUVEC tube formation. Among the 41000 genes studied, 311 were differentially expressed in control and KLK3-treated cells. These changes were enriched in several pathways, including the pathways associated with proteasome, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, focal adhesion and regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the changes were opposite to those described previously to occur during tubulogenesis. In conclusion, our results show that KLK3 induces gene expression changes in HUVECs. While these changes might be relevant for the mechanism by which KLK3 exerts its anti-angiogenic activity, it cannot be judged by the present results whether the changes are secondary to morphogenic differentiation of the cells or the primary mechanism mediating the effect of KLK3.
