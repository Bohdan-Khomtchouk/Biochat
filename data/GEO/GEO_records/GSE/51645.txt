TITLE
Differential gene expression in Malaysian and Wine/European yeast isolates

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Comparative-genomic studies have reported widespread variation in levels of gene expression within and between species. In the vast majority of cases, the phenotypic and evolutionary relevance of regulatory change is unknown. We haveu sed a wild Malaysian population of S. cerevisiae as a testbed in the search to identify organismal correlates of regulatory variation. Malaysian yeast, when cultured in standard medium, activated regulatory programs that protect cells from the toxic effects of high iron.

DESIGN
Analysis of differential gene expression between three Malaysian and two Wine/European isolates and allele-specific expression within three Malaysian x Wine/European hybrids.
