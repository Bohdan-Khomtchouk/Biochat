TITLE
Gene expression affected by TNFa and SB203580

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression affected by TNFa was investigated, then, p38 inhibitor SB203580 was used to investigate p38 signal pathway. Keywords: p38 signal response

DESIGN
Fibroblast-like synoviocyte culture was treated with TNFa in the presence and absence of SB203580 and compared to the gene expression not treated with TNFa.
