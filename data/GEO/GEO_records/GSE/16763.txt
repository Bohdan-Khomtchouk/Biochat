TITLE
Gene expression profiles of LEC, MLC-L, and MSC-BM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of limbal explant culture-derived epithelial (LEC) and mesenchymal-like cells (MLC-L) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-BM). To confirm the stem cell signatures of cultured LEC and to establish the source, possible role of the stroma-derived MLC-L .

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, LEC vs. MLC-L cells, LEC vs. MSC-BM, MLC-L vs. MSC-BM. Biological replicates: 2 LEC replicates, 2 MLC-L replicates, 2 MSC_BM replicates.
