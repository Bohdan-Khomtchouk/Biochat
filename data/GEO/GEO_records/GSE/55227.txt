TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Cbfb-deficient LSK and GMP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Runx/Cbfb heterodimers play important roles in the development of hematopoietic cells in mouse embryos and adults. In order to identify genes that are regulated by Runx/Cbfb, we purified Lin– c-kit+ Sca1+ (LSK) cells and Lin– c-kit+ Sca1– CD16/32+ (GMP) cells from Vav1-iCre x Cbfb(F/F) and Vav1-iCre x Cbfb(F/+) mice and profiled gene expression using microarray.

DESIGN
200,000 LSK and GMP cells were purified separately from two 7 week old Vav1-iCre x Cbfb(F/F) mice and two Vav1-iCre x Cbfb(F/+) mice by cell sorting. The purity was higher than 98%. Total RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA XS kit (Macherey-Nagel), amplified using a PicoSL RNA amplification kit (Nugen) and biotinylated with Encore biotin module (Nugen). Labeled RNA was hybridized to Mouse Gene 1.0ST microarrays (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
