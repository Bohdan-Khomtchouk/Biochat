TITLE
Gene expression in rat striatum following carbon monoxide poisoning and hypoxic hypoxia

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have proposed the existence of a threshold for brain damage, in terms of hydroxyl radical production in rat striatum, between poisoning of carbon monoxide (CO) at 1000 ppm and 3000 ppm, where blood CO-hemoglobin levels reach approximately 50% and over 70%, respectively. To search for factors involved in brain damage, we examined the effects of air, 1000 ppm CO, 3000 ppm CO and 5% O2 (hypoxic conditions comparable with those by 3000 ppm CO) on gene expression in rat striatum, using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in rat striatum which had been obtained at 0, 2, 6, or 12 hours after the 40-minute exposure to air, 1000 ppm CO, 3000 ppm CO or 5% O2 (a rat for each time of each exposure). The control is 0 hour after air.
