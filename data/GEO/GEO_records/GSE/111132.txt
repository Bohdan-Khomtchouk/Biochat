TITLE
A novel linc1405/Eomes interdependent complex regulates cardiac mesoderm specification and coordinates cardiogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) play widespread roles in epigenetic regulation during multiple differentiation processes, but little is known about their mode of action in cardiac differentiation. Here, we identified the key roles of a lincRNA, termed linc1405, in modulating the core network of cardiac differentiation by functionally interacting with Eomes. Mechanistic studies showed that linc1405 physically mediated the complex consisted of Eomes, Trithorax group (TrxG) subunit WDR5, and histone acetyltransferase GCN5 binding at the enhancer region of Mesp1 gene, which activated Mesp1 expression and promoted cardiac mesoderm specification. Importantly, linc1405 was co-located with Eomes, WDR5, and GCN5 at the primitive streak in vivo and depletion of linc1405 resulted in the impaired heart development and function. In summary, we propose that linc1405 mediates a novel Eomes/WDR5/GCN5 complex that contributes to cardiogenesis, highlighting the critical roles of lincRNA-based complexes in the accurate epigenetic regulation of cardiogenesis.
