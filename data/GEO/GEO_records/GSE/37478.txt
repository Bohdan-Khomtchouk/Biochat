TITLE
Genome-wide Mapping of the Ozone-responsive Transcriptomes of Rice Panicle and Seed Tissues Reveals Novel Insight into their Regulatory Events

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The ‘O3-responsive transcriptome’ behavior in the panicles and grains of rice plant was studied individually through high-throughput oligo-DNA microarray technique. Obtained results showed that O3 differentially regulated 620 and 130 genes in the panicles and grains separately, by at least two-fold changes. However, only five genes were found to be common in both the tissues, suggesting towards the tissue specific O3-sensitivity in rice plants. Among the O3-responsive genes, 176 and 444 genes were up- and down-regulated in rice panicle; whereas, 24 and 106 genes in rice grain, respectively. Further mapping onto various regulatory events revealed that, the majority of differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in signaling, hormonal, cell wall, transcription, proteolysis, and defense events. Many previously unknown O3-responsive novel genes were identified, including the brassinosteroid insensitive-1 receptor kinase, wall-associated kinase like receptor, calcium-dependent protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol kinases, G-protein components, ethylene insensitive-3, cellulose synthases, pectatelyase, etc. Inventory of 745 O3-responsive genes and their mapping will surely expand our knowledge on novel regulatory processes in both panicles and grains of rice; and, serve as a resource towards the designing of rice crops for future high-O3 world.

DESIGN
Comparison between healthy rice plant panicles and ozone treated plant panicles (for 8 h)  and seed (grain) of healthy rice plants and of rice plants grown under ozone for their lifeftime was performed. Three biological replicates (panicle or seed; pooled) were used, and dye-swaped.
