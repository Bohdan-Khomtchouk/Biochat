TITLE
Microarray expression analysis of Drosophila DrosDel deficiency lines

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Microarray data of DrosDel deficiency (Df/+) and parental strain diploid flies along with spike-in controls was performed on the Nimblegen 12-plex array platform. Samples are named in this dataset according to the following sample naming scheme: tissue_genotype shorthand_sex_biological replicate #.

DESIGN
PolyA+ mRNA was isolated in triplicate to quadruplicate from 5 day old adult female or male whole flies.  Female and male mRNA were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 dyes separately and hybridized to Drosophila 12-plex Nimblegen arrays.
