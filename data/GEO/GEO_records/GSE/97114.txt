TITLE
EBF2-regulated epigenome in brown adipose tissue [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
EBF2 activates the expression of brown fat-selective genes in adipocytes, but whether EBF2 regulates these genes via direct binding was unknown. To address this question, we analyzed the genome-wide binding profile of EBF2 in BAT using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). To determine if EBF2 is required for the activity of lineage-specific enhancers, we examined the levels of PPARÎ³, RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), and H3K27ac at brown fat-specific genes in wildtype (WT) and Ebf2 KO BAT.

DESIGN
Brown adipose tissues were collected from Ebf2 knockout and wildtype mice and ChIP-seq was performed for EBF2, PolII, PPARy, and H3K27ac.
