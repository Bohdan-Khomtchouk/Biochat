TITLE
Genes expressed in age-induced mitochondrial DNA deletion mutation containing / Electron Transport abnormal cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Muscle tissue was longitudinally characterized histologically for electron transport function by staining 1mm of quadriceps muscle at 70 micron intervals for the activities of two complexes in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, Cytochrome C Oxidase and Succinate Dehydrogenase. Unstained serial cryosections were prepared for Laser Capture Microdissection. Target cells from the serial sections were isolated and pooled for RNA extraction, amplification and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We selected homogeneous populations of muscle fibers for expression profiling based upon  the presence/absence of electron transport dysfunction caused by the somatic accumulation of mitochondrial DNA deletion mutations.

DESIGN
The design of this experiment is limited by the source tissue which is individually identified cells harboring intracellular clonal expansions of mitochondrial DNA deletion mutations. These unique and rare cells were identified in rat Vastus lateralis tissue in an aged 36-month old F344xBN F1 hybrid rat by exhaustive serial sectioning and subsequent histological characterization. Unstained serial sections where isolated by LCM and the purified RNA was amplified by 2 rounds of RNA based transcription prior to fragmentation and hybridization on rat genome affymetrix chips. Two populations of cells were analyzed,  Electron transport deficient and  normal control cells from the same animal.
