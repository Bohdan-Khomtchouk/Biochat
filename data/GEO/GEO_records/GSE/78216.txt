TITLE
Expression data of Mesenchymal Stroma Cells (MSC)-adherent and non-adherent, human cord blood-derived, hematopoietic CD34 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MSC-adherent hematopoietic stem and progenotir cells (HSPC) express adhesion-associated genes at higher levels than non-adherent cells while cell-cycle and differentiation-associated genes are not significantly changed between the two cell populations. We used microarray to confirm identity of MSC-adherent and non-adherent cord blood-derived HSPCs and to exclude that cell cycle and differentiation affect adhesive capacity.

DESIGN
CD34 positive cells were isolated from human cord blood (not older than 24h), expanded for 3 days and assayed for the adhesion to MSC. The adherent and non-adherent live CD34+ cells were sorted and total RNA was extracted.
