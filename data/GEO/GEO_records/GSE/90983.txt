TITLE
Transcriptome Data of Peritoneal Macrophages Isolated from ApoE-/-/Ch25h-/- Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) has been previously demonstrated to be required for anti-inflammatory effect and anti-viral activity, while also promoting foam cell formation.  In order to delineate the role of Ch25h in atherosclerosis, we isolated peritoneal macrophages (PMs) from mice lacking ApoE and Ch25h (i.e., ApoE-/-/Ch25h-/-) compared to their wildtype littermates (i.e., ApoE-/-/Ch25h+/+) for transcriptome analysis, in biological duplicates (n=12 pooled mice per group).  Deep-sequencing analysis revealed that PMs ablated with Ch25h were prone to the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype as well as increased cholesterol biosynthesis.  Overall, we found that Ch25h is integral to atheroprotection through the preservation of M2 polarization and suppression of intracelllular cholesterol content.

DESIGN
Transcriptome data of PMs isolated from ApoE-/-/Ch25h-/- mice (n=12 per group) followed by deep sequencing, in biological duplicate, using Illumina NextSeq 500.
