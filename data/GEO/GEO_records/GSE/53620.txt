TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) in wide-type, brm, clf, and brm clf mutant seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
By using ChIP-seq, we found that loss of BRM activity in developing seedlings leads to ectopic and increased H3K27me3 deposition at several hundred genes, indicating the critical role of BRM in preventing the inappropriate deposition of this histone mark. Removal of CLF in brm mutant could partcially suppress the increased H3K27me3.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27me3 in 14-day-old wt, brm, clf, and brm clf seedlings. Two biological replicates for each one.

PLATFORM
