TITLE
Characterization of human CDK12 and CDK13 in the regulation of RNA processing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the total RNA-seq results after CDK9, CDK12 and CDK13 depletion in human HCT116 cells for three days. RNA-seq was performed in cells using two non-targeting replicates and two different shRNAs for each CDK knockdown.  For each CDK knockdown, most of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated with a very small subset of genes upregulated. Different CDK proteins control distinct subsets of genes in vivo, with CDK12 and CDK13 sharing more overlap in function compared to CDK9. Besides, CDK12 and CDK13 loss preferentially affects DNA damage response and snRNA gene expression, respectively.

DESIGN
Examine the changes of mRNA expression levels after CDK9, CDK12 and CDK13 depletion.
