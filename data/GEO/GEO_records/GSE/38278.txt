TITLE
microRNAs and their target proteins are associated with characteristics of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (miRNA data)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent analyses have identified heterogeneity in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. There are so-called luminal A and luminal B subtypes, and the characteristics, such as response to endocrine therapy and chemotherapy and prognosis, are different in these two subtypes of breast cancer. In this study, expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs in ER-positive breast cancer tissues were compared between highly and incompletely endocrine responsive tumors by miRNA and mRNA microarrays. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses revealed distinct expression patterns of miRNAs and mRNAs in these two groups. We identified one miRNA that was downregulated in highly endocrine responsive tumors and 8 miRNAs that were downregulated in incompletely endocrine responsive tumors, and target genes of these miRNAs were predicted using TargetScan and MiRanda. Protein expression patterns of the predicted target genes and the genes that were identified by mRNA expression profiling were analyzed in ER-positive breast cancer samples by immunohistochemistry. We identified a novel protein that might be associated with characteristics of ER-positive breast cancer.

DESIGN
