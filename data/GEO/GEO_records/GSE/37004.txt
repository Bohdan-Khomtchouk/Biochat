TITLE
m6A mapping in mouse RNA (mouse liver and human brain)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We developed a novel approach, m6A-seq, for high-resolution mapping of the transcriptome-wide m6A landscape, based on antibody-mediated capture followed by massively parallel sequencing

DESIGN
Identification of m6A modified sequences in mouse liver and human brain

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens) GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
