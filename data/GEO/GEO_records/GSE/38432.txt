TITLE
Expression data from Andromonoecious poplar flower

ORGANISM
Populus tomentosa

SUMMARY
Exceptionally andromonoecious individuals that flowers appeared to form that structure resembling a carpel attached to the reverse side of stamen cup were detected in strictly dioecious poplar. Andromonoecious poplarswere used to analyze transcript levels accurately.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression during flower development and identified distinct classes of different-regulated genes between sexes during this process.
