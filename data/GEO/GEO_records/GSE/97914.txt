TITLE
β-catenin deficiency in hepatocytes promotes liver tumorigenesis driven by oncogenic β-Catenin and c-Met in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand differential gene expression globally with/without hepatocyte β-catenin knockout on liver cancer mouse model, RNA-seq analysis were examined using hydrodynamic β-catenin and c-Met induced β-catenin∆H (β-cateninF/F:Alb-cre) and WT mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracts from liver on 2-month-old mice, 3 days and 7 weeks after β-catenin and c-Met injection of β-catenin KO and WT mice, Group 1: 2-month-old mice (n=3); Group 2: 2-month-old β-catenin KO mice (n=3); Group 3: 3 days after β-catenin and c-Met injection of  WT mice (n=3); Group 4: 3 days after β-catenin and c-Met injection of β-catenin KO mice (n=3); Group 5: 7 weeks after β-catenin and c-Met injection of  WT mice (n=3); Group 6: 7 weeks after β-catenin and c-Met injection of β-catenin KO mice (n=3).

PLATFORM
