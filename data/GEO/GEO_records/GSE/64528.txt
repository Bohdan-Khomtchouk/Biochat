ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study is to identify AR target gens in LNCaP cells

DESIGN
5 samples corresponding to LSD1 K114me2 or CHD1 genome-binding in DHT-treated and control LNCaP cells. 6 samples corresponding to LSD1 K114me2 or CHD1 genome-binding in LNCaP cells knocked-down for LSD1 or CHD1 and treated with DHT.

PLATFORM
