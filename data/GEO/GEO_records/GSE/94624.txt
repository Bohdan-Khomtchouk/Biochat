TITLE
Colon epithelial cells gene expression data of Sphingomyelin synthase 2 knockout colitis mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) 2 is the synthetic enzyme of sphingomyelin (SM), which regulates the fluidity and microdomain structure of the plasma membrane. We investigated the effect of SMS2 deficiency on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced murine colitis, and found suppression of DSS-induced inflammation in SMS2 deficient (SMS2-/-) mice. Results provide insight into the role of SMS2 in inflammation.

DESIGN
Colon epithelial cells were isolated from wild-type (WT) and SMS2 knockout mice at day 2 after initiation of DSS treatment or untreated controls. Two independent biologic replicates were performed.
