TITLE
Ribosome profiling on SUM159PT cells grown in vitro or in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SUM159PT cells were grown either in vitro (in culture) or in vivo (mouse), after which RPL10a tagged with GFP was used to perform extraction by immoprecipitation and subsequent ribosome profiling

DESIGN
Two batches of in vitro grown cells, each having 2 replicates. Two batches of in vivo grown cells from tumors grown in two individual mice, each having tumors on left (first batch) and right side (second batch). Extraction and ribosome profiling was done independently for the two batches of samples.
