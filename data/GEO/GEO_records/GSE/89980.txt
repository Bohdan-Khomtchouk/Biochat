TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of primary monocytes from XLA patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this project we report the transcriptome profiles of X-linked Agammaglobulinema (XLA), an inherited form of Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PIDs),  using high-depth RNA-Seq technology .

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from CD14-Positive Monocytes cells of 3 XLA patients. Transcriptome profiling by high throughput RNA sequencing
