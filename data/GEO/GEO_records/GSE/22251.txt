TITLE
Necdin, a Negative Growth Regulator, is a Novel STAT3 Target Gene Down-Regulated in Human Cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We took a broad approach to identify novel STAT3 regulated genes by examining changes in the genome-wide gene expression profile by microarray, using cells expressing constitutively-activated STAT3.  Using computational analysis, we were able to define the gene expression profiles of cells containing activated STAT3 and identify candidate target genes with a wide range of biological functions. We demonstrated that STAT3 has an important role in regulating, both positively and negatively, a diverse array of cellular processes, including cell adhesion, cytoskeletal remodeling, nucleotide, lipid and protein metabolism, as well as signal transduction.  This suggest that STAT3 coordinates expression of genes involved in multiple metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, integrating signals that lead to global transcriptional changes and oncogenesis.

DESIGN
Balb/c-3T3 mouse fibroblasts, v-Src 3T3 cells and STAT3-C 3T3 cells were grown in DMEM/10% bovine calf serum supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin.  At each of 3 passages, cells from the five dishes were pooled and total RNA was extracted.
