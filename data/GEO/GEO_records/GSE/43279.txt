SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional levels. There is increasing evidence to suggest that miRNAs could be useful in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. The aim of our study was to  identify miRNAs predictors of poor prognosis in adrenocortical cancer. miRNA microarray expression profiling was performed on a cohort of 6 adenomas, 6 non-recurrent carcinomas (Carc_B) and 6 recurrent carcinomas (Carc_A). We identified several miRNAs that were differentially expressed between adenomas and carcinomas as well as between Carc_A and Carc_B. We found that the best discriminatory miRNAs between carcinomas and adenomas were miR-195 and miR-335 which were down-regulated in carcinomas. MiR-139-5p was the most powerful discriminatory miRNA between Carc_A and Carc_B subtypes with consistent up-regulation in the recurrent carcinoma subgroup (Carc_A). Target prediction analysis showed that predicted targets of these miRNAs could be involved in biological processes and pathways that enhance tumor progression. Our data suggest that adrenocortical cancer cells progressively switch from a high miR-195 and miR-335 status to a low miR-195 and miR-335 phenotype. MiR-139-5P is a potential prognostic biomarker of recurrent adrenocortical carcinomas.
