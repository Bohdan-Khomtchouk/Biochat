TITLE
miRNA expression data from lean PCOS adipose vs BMI matched control women

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Why ~70% of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have intrinsic insulin resistance (IR), above and beyond that associated with body mass, including dysfunctional glucose metabolism in adipose tissue (AT), remains a fundamental question. In these experiments, we sought to explore the role of miRNAs in the AT of PCOS and matched controls. Analysis determined that PCOS AT has a differentially expressed miRNA profile, including upregulated miR-93. We observed a significant association between HOMA-IR, and GLUT4 and miR-93 expression in human AT. Our results point to a novel mechanism for regulating insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via miR-93, and demonstrate upregulated miR-93 expression in PCOS, possibly accounting for the IR of the syndrome, and also in non-PCOS women with IR. We performed miRNA microarrays to determine PCOS-related miRNA expression in adipose derived from lean PCOS patients and matched control women.

DESIGN
We analyized miRNA from total RNA extracted from subcutaneous (sc) adipose tissue from three lean PCOS patients and three matched control women.
