TITLE
Expression data from Ezh2 epithelial knock-out mouse lungs at E14.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ezh2 epigenetically suppresses developmentally-regulated genes. Ezh2 is highly expressed during development, including in the lung. We knocked out Ezh2 in the developing lung epithelium using a Shh-cre driver which is active in foregut endoderm prior to lung morphogenesis. Many developmentally regulated genes became derepressed in the mutant lungs, leading to defects in lung development. Microarray analysis of genes upregulated in Ezh2 epithelial knock-out mouse lungs compared to Shh-cre controls.

DESIGN
We generated Ezh2 epithelial mutant lungs by crossing the Ezh2-floxed line (Su et al., 2003) with the Shh-cre line (Harfe et al., 2004). We isolated RNA from whole mouse lungs at embryonic day 14.5 from 4 Shh-cre:Ezh2-flox/flox embryos (M1-M4) and 4 Shh-cre embryos (C1-C4). Littermates are as follows: C1+C2; C3+C4; M1+M2; M3+M4.
