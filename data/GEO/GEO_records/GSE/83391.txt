TITLE
Expression data from cultured fetal lung epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Branching morphogenesis in lung development is regulate by growth factor signaling. Wnt signaling is one of the important singnaling pathway that is required for progenitor maintainance. In the presence of CHIR99021, an agonist for the beta-catenin pathway of Wnt signaling, specific group of genes are upregulated in cultured lung epithelium.

DESIGN
RNAs were extracted from cultured epithelium and cDNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
