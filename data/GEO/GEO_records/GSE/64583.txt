TITLE
Gene expression data from human fibroblasts and induced Pluripotent Stem cells from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have generated human induced Pluripotent Stem cells (hiPSc) from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, motor neuron disease) patients, using Sendai virus-mediated delivery of reprogramming factors. hiPSc lines have been screened using SNP array to assess chromosomal stability (alongside the fibroblast lines from which they derived), and validation of the pluripotency of the hiPSc lines is provided by Pluritest assessment of transcriptome datasets, prior to differentiation to motor neuron cultures and downstream functional assays.

DESIGN
human iPSc lines were derived from human dermal fibroblasts from 3 ALS patients with C9orf72 mutations (2 lines per patient) and control donors. SNP datasets for control fibroblasts HDF OX1 and NHDF, and SNP and gene expression datasets from control lines iPS OX1-19 and iPS NHDF-1, have been published previously: Van Wilgenburg B., Browne C., Vowles J. & Cowley S.
