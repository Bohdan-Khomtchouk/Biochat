TITLE
Plasmodium falciparum Heterochromatin Protein 1 Marks Genomic Loci Linked to Phenotypic Variation of Exported Virulence Factors

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Epigenetic processes are the main conductors of phenotypic variation in eukaryotes. The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum employs antigenic variation of the major surface antigen PfEMP1, encoded by 60 var genes, to evade acquired immune responses. PfEMP1 also mediates sequestration of infected erythrocytes in the microvasculature, which is directly linked to severe malaria outcomes. Antigenic variation of PfEMP1 occurs through in situ switches in mono-allelic var gene transcription, which is PfSIR2-dependent and associated with the presence of repressive H3K9me3 marks at silenced loci. Here, we show that the P. falciparum ortholog of heterochromatin protein 1 (PfHP1) binds to H3K9me3 and constitutes a major component of heterochromatin in perinuclear chromosome end clusters. High-resolution genome-wide chromatin immuno-precipitation demonstrates the striking association of PfHP1 with non-syntenic virulence gene arrays in subtelomeric and chromosome-internal islands. These include not only var genes but the majority of P. falciparum lineage-specific gene families coding for exported proteins involved in host-parasite interactions. Over-expression of PfHP1 resulted in decreased  expression of a small number of (virulance) genes and indicated the presence of well-defined heterochromatic boundaries.. In summary, we uncover an unprecedented function of HP1 as a  mayor regulator of virulence gene silencing and phenotypic variation, which will be instrumental for our understanding of this widely used survival strategy of unicellular pathogens.
