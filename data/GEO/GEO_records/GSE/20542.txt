TITLE
Comparison of two clones of Myzus Persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae)

ORGANISM
Myzus persicae

SUMMARY
The aim of this experiment was to compare the transciptome of the peach-potato aphid (Myzus persicae) clone 4106a (a laboratory insecticide-susceptible standard collected from potato in Scotland in 2000) with clone 5191A (an insecticide resistant aphid clone collected from tobacco in Greece in 2007) to identify which genes are over or underexpressed in the resistant phenotype.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 4106a vs. 5191a Myzus persicae clones. Biological replicates: 4 pools of RNA extracted from ten 15 day old aphids of each clone. Technical Replicates: Two technical reps incorporating a dye swap. Total replication: eight replicates for each clone.
