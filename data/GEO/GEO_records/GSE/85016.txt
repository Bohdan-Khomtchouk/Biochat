TITLE
Expression data from Aged HSCs cultured with or without MTM-Pot1a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Appropriate regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal is critical for the maintenance of life long hematopoiesis. However, long-term repeated cell divisions induce the accumulation of DNA damage, especially at telomere, significantly compromises HSC function. Therefore, shelterin elements Pot1a is required to prevent DNA damage response at telomeres in order to maintain their function. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression underlying MTM-Pot1a function in aged HSCs during culture and identified distinct molecular signature during this process.

DESIGN
10wks-old and 60wks-old LT-HSCs were sorted after 3days culture with control-MTM (control), MTM-Pot1a (M-Pot1a) or MTM-dOB-Pot1a (dOB-Pot1a) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
