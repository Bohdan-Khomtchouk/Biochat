TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of differentiation in murine embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Examination of transcriptional responses to Embryonic stem cell differentiation in  the Brca1 (+/+) cell line AB2.2  compared to Brca1 (+/-) cell line PL2F8

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from murine Stem cell lines AB2.2 and PL2F8 at 0,2,4,6,8 days following induction of differentiation via the removal of the Leukemia Inhibitory factor (LIF).

PLATFORM
GPL10951 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip (Gene version)
