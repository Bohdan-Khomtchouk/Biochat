TITLE
Identification of Senescence-Associated Circular RNAs (SAC-RNAs) reveals senescence suppressor CircPVT1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
With advancing age, senescent cells accumulate in tissues and critically influence aging-associated diseases.  We report the first catalog of a novel class of regulatory RNAs, circular RNAs, differentially expressed in senescent (non-dividing) compared with dividing human fibroblasts.  Among them, we focused on the circular RNA CircPVT1, as it promoted proliferation by binding and neutralizing let-7, a microRNA capable of triggering senescence.  Interestingly, by suppressing let-7, CircPVT1 selectively elevated the expression of several proliferative proteins which were otherwise repressed by let-7.  In summary, we have uncovered a novel mechanism whereby circular RNAs control gene expression programs in senescent cells.
