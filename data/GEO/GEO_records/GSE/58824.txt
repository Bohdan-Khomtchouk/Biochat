TITLE
Hepatic transcriptomic profiling reveals early toxicological mechanisms of uranium in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
To study the short term (48 h) hepatic transcriptional changes and identify potential modes of action, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were exposed to 0.25 mg/L, 0.5 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L depleted uranium. A combination of high density (60 k) custom oligonucleotide salmonid miacroarray and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed to perform gene expression analyses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey posthoc tests. Functional enrichment analysis based on Gene Ontology (GO) was performed to link DEGs to their biological functions. The Salmo salar DEGs were further mapped to mammlian orthologs. By using ortholog DEGs, gene networks were built based on well-curated mammlian protein-protein interactions and pathways analyses were performed to link DEGs to specific toxicological/biological functions. The results obtained from microarray analysis were further verified using qPCR.

DESIGN
Juvenile Atlantic salmon were exposed to waterborne depleted uranium for 48 h. Liver were samples and used for gene expression analysis.
