TITLE
Effect of Clofibrate on Rat Primary Hepatocytes.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study provides an evaluation of changes in gene expression associated with clofibrate treatment of rat hepatocytes in vitro. Primary rat hepatocytes were treated for 24 and 48 hours with two doses (60 uM and 1 mM) of clobibrate and 1% DMSO vehicle control.  Five replicates of each treatment were performed.  Cells were then extracted and RNA processed for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
This series is part of a SuperSeries in which primary rat hepatocytes were treated with two doses of ten chemical compounds (and corresponding vehicle controls) for 24 and 48 hours.  Each compound/vehicle treatment group was an individual study performed at different times. Each study was analyzed separately and themes common between studies were reported.
