TITLE
Cellular Senescence RT2 Profiler PCR Array of replicative senescent and hyperglycemia treated HUVECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Young endothelial cells (CPD > 25 and < 30; SA-Beta Gal positivity < 10%) were exposed to one week of hyperglycemia (25 mmol/L) or sub-cultured until complete growth arrest (CPD > 50).  Using real-time PCR, we analyzed the expression of a focused panel of genes involved in cellular senescence.The array includes genes involved in the primary senescence program and known stresses that cause premature senescence.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  Equal amount total RNA from three conditions (NG= normal glucose, HG= high glucose, RS= replicative senescence) was used to gene expression analysis. Three differential batches of HUVECs were used. One of single donor and two pooled.
