TITLE
Gene expression from armored CAR T cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compare the gene expression profile among armored IL-18 secreting CAR T cells and second-generation CAR T cells

DESIGN
CAR T cells were cocultured with NALM6 tumor cells, sorted on day 1 and day 8, RNA extracted and gene expression was analyzed with Nanostring

PLATFORM
GPL23249 Nanostring nCounter Gene Expression Assay (Pan Cancer Immune Panel)
