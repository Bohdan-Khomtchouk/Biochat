TITLE
Expression data from GFP-labeled c-Kit+ mouse APL cells and normal Lin-Sca-1-c-Kit+ mouse bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize the differentially expressed genes between leukemic and normal myeloid progenitors

DESIGN
Using FACS, we isolated GFP-labeled c-Kit+ mouse APL cells and normal Lin-Sca-1-c-Kit+ mouse bone marrow cells. Each sample had 3 biological replicates.
