TITLE
Differential RNA-sequencing of Campylobacter jejuni fur perR mutant

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
We report the use of differential RNA-sequencing for the determination of the primary transcriptome of the fur perR mutant of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168. This allows for the genome-wide determination of transcription start sites.

DESIGN
Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 fur perR mutant was grown to late log phase, RNA was purified and used for differential RNA-sequencing by 454 sequencing with barcoded libraries, and used for determination of genome-wide transcription start sites

PLATFORM
GPL17545 454 GS FLX (Campylobacter jejuni)
