TITLE
The effect of c-Abl inhibitor AMN on the induce expression profile of IFN response genes from MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MEFs were stimulated for 6 h with IFNa or IFNg after pretreatment with AMN107 or DMSO for at least 18 h. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression of IFN-regulated genes

DESIGN
MEFs were treated with or without AMN107, then were stimulated for 6 h with IFNa or IFNg. RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
