TITLE
Spatiotemporal brassinosteroid signaling and antagonism with auxin control Arabidopsis root growth.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of brassinosteroid (BR) and auxin effects on gene expression in Arabidopsis roots. Our genomic results indicate that BR and auxin induce largely opposite gene expression responses in primary roots.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq for 7-day-old Arabidopsis Col-0, dwf4, bri1-116, and bri1-116;bzr1-1D roots grown on regular medium and treated with brassinolide, auxin or mock solution for 4 hr.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
