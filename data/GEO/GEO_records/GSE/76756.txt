TITLE
Isolation and characterization of a novel gammaherpesvirus from a microbat cell line

ORGANISM
Myotis velifer ; Bat gammaherpesvirus 8

SUMMARY
While employing deep sequencing and de novo assembly to characterize the mRNA transcript profile of a cell line derived from the microbat Myotis velifer incautus, we serendipitously identified mRNAs encoding proteins with a high level of identity to herpesviruses.  Next generation sequencing and de novo assembly of the viral genome from supernatants from Vero cells yielded a single contig of approximately 130 kilobases with at least 80 ORFs, predicted microRNAs and a gammaherpesvirus genomic organization.  Phylogenetic analysis of the envelope glycoprotein (gB) and DNA polymerase (POLD1) revealed similarity to multiple gammaherpesvirus, including those from as yet uncultured viruses of the Rhadinovirus genus that were obtained by deep sequencing of bat tissues.  Cumulatively, this study provides the first isolation and characterization of a replication competent bat gammaherpesvirus.

DESIGN
This is a single RNA sample from a microbat cell line (ATCC CRL-6012).  Total RNA was harvested by Trizol extraction.  One microgram of material was purified by oligo dT to enrich for messenger RNA.  Standard Illumina library construction was performed and the sample was sequenced on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II (76bp single read data).  Following genome assembly and annotation, the dataset was imported into CLC Genomics Workbench (Version 8), where reads were mapped onto the novel Bat Gammaherpesvirus 8 (BGHV8) annotated genome to calculate the RPKM for each annotated CDS.  Mapped reads to this reference genome are provided.
