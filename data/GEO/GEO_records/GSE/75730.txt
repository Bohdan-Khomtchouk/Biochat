TITLE
Gene expression of hepatocyte-specific Mcl-1 ko mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression from livers of knock-out, hemizygous and wild-type mice at the age of , 8 and 12 months. Including tumor and non-tumor tissue of the same animals. AlbCre negative littermates were used as wild type controls.

DESIGN
The hepatic gene expression of mice carrying a hepatocyte specific deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 was analyzed at various age. Expression was compared between knock-out, hemizygous and wild-type littermates as well as between tumor and corresponding non-tumor tissue.
