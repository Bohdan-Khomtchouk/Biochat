TITLE
Gene expression analysis of CMV infected human fibroblasts in two cultures with differing sensitivity to the virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression patterns in cytomegalovirus infected human fibroblasts for two cultures with differing sensitivity to the virus

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 2 human fibroblast lines with differing sensitivity to CMV infection. For each line 3 types of samples are compared: pre-experimantal norm, 3 hours after infection, 3 hours without infection.
