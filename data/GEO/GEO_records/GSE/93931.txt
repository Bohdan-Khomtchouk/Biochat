TITLE
Oxidative stress elicits a rapid and global RNA polymerase II transcriptional response in human cells [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using ChIP-Seq, we show that hydrogen peroxide causes rapid accumulation of Pol II at promoters and enhancers. Over time, a fraction of accumulated Pol II loses NELF and creeps downstream. In GSE100740, we also compared nuclear walk-on results with PRO-Seq, both of which were performed using nuclei from DMSO- and flavopiridol-treated cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq in HeLa cells

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
