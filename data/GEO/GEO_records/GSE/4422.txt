TITLE
PERK role in the exocrine pancreas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Molecular characterization of PERK's role in the mouse exocrine pancreas.  Postnatal days 16, 19 and 32 were examined.  Postnatal day 16 represents a stage immediately prior to severe cytological changes in the exPKO mice.  Postnatal day 19 represents the initial stage of severe phenotypes in the exPKO mice.  Postnatal day 32 represents the middle stage of severe phenotypes (about 2 wks from the initiation) in the exPKO mice. Keywords: transgenic mouse
