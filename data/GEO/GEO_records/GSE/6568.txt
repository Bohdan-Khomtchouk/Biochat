TITLE
SHREC, an Effector Complex for Heterochromatic Transcriptional Silencing

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip analyses of Clr1, Clr2, Clr3, Ccq1, and Mit1 across the S. pombe genome. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA recovered with antibody against epitope-tagged protein from wild-type asynchronous growing fission yeast cells and whole cell extracts DNA were amplified by random priming and respectively labeled with Cy5 and Cy3. Labeled DNA samples were mixed and hybridized onto a 44k pombe Agilent oligo array. Data were processed using Agilent scanner and Feature Extraction software.

PLATFORM
