TITLE
Expression data from AML1-ETO9a mouse primary leukemia blast

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray gene profilling indentified snoRNAs are downstream target of Amino Enhancer of Split (AES) and are essential for AML1-ETO9a induced leukemia. Amino Enhancer of Split (Aes) is strongly induced by leukemia oncogenes AML1-ETO, PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα. With a conditional AES knockout mouse model we showed that AES is essential for AML1-ETO9a indeced leukemia. We performed gene expression microarray using mouse primary AML1-ETO9a transformed AES wildtype and knockout and showed that snoRNAs were downregulated in AES knockout cells. We found that SnoRNA induction is a common mechanism shared by distinct oncogenes including AML1-ETO, MYC and MLL-AF9. Suppression of C/D box snoRNA complexes or deletion of several single C/D box snoRNAs inhibit clonogenic growth of leukemia cells. These findings suggest that enhancement of snoRNA levels is a critical mechanism of leukemic transformation.
