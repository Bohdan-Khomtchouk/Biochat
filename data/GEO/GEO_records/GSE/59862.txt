TITLE
microRNA expression data from AG 1522 human fibroblasts post X-ray radiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Radioadaptive response (RAR) in mammalian cells refers to the phenomenon where a low-dose ionizing irradiation alters the gene expression profiles, and protects the cells from the detrimental effects of a subsequent high dose exposure. We focused on microRNA microarray studies, and aimed to characterize the transcriptome for RAR in AG 1522 human skin fibroblasts and to examine the functional regulatory networks at the genetic level. AG 1522 cells were exposed at a specific time point to a challenging dose of 2 Gy in the RAR group, or a priming dose of 5 cGy in the low-dose group.

DESIGN
We aimed to have a comprehensive investigation on the RAR induced in the AG 1522 human fibroblasts first exposed to 5 cGy (priming dose) and then followed by 2 Gy (challenge dose) of X-ray through comparisons to those cells which had only received a single 2 Gy dose.
