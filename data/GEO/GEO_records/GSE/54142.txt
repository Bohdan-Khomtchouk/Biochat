TITLE
Male and female mouse primary astrocytes stably transfected with Cdca7l

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cdca7l acts as a male-specific oncogene in astrocytoma and glioblastoma, and can transform primary astrocyte growth in soft agar. We stably overexpressed Cdca7l in mouse primary astrocytes and compared gene expression to primary astrocytes expressing empty vector control in male and female cell to identify gene expression differences between male and female cells and between Cdca7l-overexpressing and normal primary astrocytes.

DESIGN
Independent primary astrocyte isolates were stably transfected with either Cdca7l or an empty vector control. 4-5 biological replicates were used for each of 4 groups: C57BL/6J (B6) male astrocytes, C57BL/6J (B6) female astrocytes, 129S4/SvJae (129) male astrocytes, and 129S4/SvJae (129) female astrocytes
