TITLE
Comparison of the response to bile of Lactobacillus casei BL23 and its derivative strain TC01

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus casei

SUMMARY
The response to  bile of Lactobacillus casei BL23 and its derivative strain TC01 was investigated. TC01 strain carries a complete deletion of gene LCABL_02080 which encodes a two component signal transduction response regulator.

DESIGN
Lactobacillus casei BL23 and TC01 strains were grown in MRS medium at 37C without shaking until O.D. 595 nm. reached 0.5. The cultures were then two fold diluted with prewarmed MRS medium (control) or MRS supplemented with 0.2% bovine bile (treatment) and incubation continued for 45 min. Cells were then harvested and total RNA purified.
