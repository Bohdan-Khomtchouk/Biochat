TITLE
Deep Sequencing analysis of the total RNA state and the polyadenylation state of mRNAs in Scrambled or CNOT7 knockdown neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential thermal elution over poly(U) agarose was used to identify mRNAs that underwent a change in their poly(A) tail following CNOT7 knockdown in cultured hippocampal neurons. Total RNA levels were also measured from both sets to identify changes in stability or expressions of mRNAs in the different cell types

DESIGN
mRNA and poly(A) state profiles of 17-19 day old hippocampal neurons were generated by deep sequencing in duplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
