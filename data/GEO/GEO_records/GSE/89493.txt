TITLE
Differential gene expressions in the hypertensive heart using pressure-overload model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expressions were constructed through expression profiling of a total of 26,423 genes in the hypertrophic heart followed by pressure-overload model, then 537 significant differential genes were filtered based on the criteria (p < 0.05 and fold change > 1.5).

DESIGN
In the study presented here, the mice were performed the transverse aortic constriction (n=3) or sham operation (n=2) for 28 days. The hearts were collected and performed transcriptome analysis by microarray. The 537 significant differential genes were identified through expression profiling of a total of 26,423 genes.
