TITLE
Analysis of transcripts in PNA-A(15) oligo treated  human HEK-293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mononucleotide A and T repeats are abundant in human genome. Many of A repeats are bound by Argonaute proteins (AGOs). To evaluate the role of AGOs and A repeats in gene regulation, HEK293 cells were treated with 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid added peptide nucleic acid (PNA) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA oligo (OO-A(15)).

DESIGN
Matched two sets of two individual HEK293 cells were transfected with OO-A(15) and scramble OO-PNA oligo, and were analyzed as biological duplicates. Cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco-BRL) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. OO-A(15) and scramble oligo were dilute with dH2O to reach 10μM. Cells were transfected in 6-well plates, seed 6 x 105 cells per well with 50 nM OO-A(15) and scramble oligo using  TransIT-siQUEST transfection reagent (Mirus). The transfected cell lines were cultured for 48 h post-transfection and harvested total RNA by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). All RNA integrity assays were performed and hybridized on beadchip according to the protocol.
