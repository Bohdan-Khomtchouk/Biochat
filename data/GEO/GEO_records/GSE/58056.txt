TITLE
Transcriptional programs of lymphoid tissue capillary and high endothelium reveal control mechanisms for lymphocyte homing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This file contains gene microarray data from FACS purified mouse high endothelial cells and capillary endothelial cells from peripheral lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, and Peyerâ€™s patches. The data will allow for better understanding of the specialization of high endothelial venules (HEV) and their role in lymphocyte recruitment from the blood; the tissue-specific differentiation of lymphoid tissue vasculature; and the specialized features of capillary vs. post-capillary endothelium, including differences in signaling pathways, adhesive properties and mechanisms of hemostasis.

DESIGN
We analyzed transcript expression data from vascular endothelial subsets from BALB/c mouse lymphoid tissue.
