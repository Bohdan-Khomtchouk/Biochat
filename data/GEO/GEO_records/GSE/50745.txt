TITLE
Genotype-by-diet interaction effects on transcriptome profiles in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This study was performed by testing 21 wildtype genetic lines on four different diets to look at the transcriptomic, metabolomic, and gross phenotype variation.  The diets used were Normal Cornmeal-molasses symbolized N, high sugar symbolized 4, high fat F, and control C a low sugar diet.  Larvae were raised from hatching to 3rd instar on the respecitve diets at a density of 50 larvae per food vial.  Larvae were then collected for metabolomics, transcriptomic, and gross phenotype measurements (e.g. trehalose concentration, triglyceride concentration).  Samples for transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.

DESIGN
236 total samples were analyzed.  In most cases the are unique technical replicates except in the cases where the line, diet, and biological replicate characterists are identical.
