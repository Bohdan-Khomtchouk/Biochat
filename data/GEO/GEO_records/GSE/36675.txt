TITLE
Expression data from st 12-13 embryos from 2xbcd and 6xbcd mothers

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Embryo from 6xbcd mother shows expansion of prospective head region.  In this embryo, excessive cell death can be observed. This array expreriment is for identifying differentially expressed genes in the 2xbcd and 6xbcd conditions at stage 12-13

DESIGN
We crossed TT16 males with TT16 females for the 2xbcd condition and bcd+t8 females for 6xbcd.  In both crosses, eggs were collected in 90 minutes and incubated for 8 hours at 25Â°.  After excluding unfertilized eggs under stereomicroscope, we extracted RNA from more than 100 eggs and hybridized by GeneChip Drosophila Genome 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) for hybridization.  We carried out paired (2xbcd vs. 6xbcd) microarray experiments in three replicates using independent RNA samples.
