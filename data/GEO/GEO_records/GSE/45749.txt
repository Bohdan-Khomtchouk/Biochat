TITLE
mRNA expression profiles in androgenetic, parthenogenetic and fertilized embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, mRNA expression profiles were examined by Illumina microarray in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from androgenetic (aESC), parthenogenetic (pESC) and fertilized (fESC) blastocysts. Results showed that 2394, 87 and 1788 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the aESCs vs. fESCs, pESCs vs. fESCs and aESCs vs. pESCs, respectively.

DESIGN
Androgenetic, parthenogenetic and fertilized embryonic stem cell lines were established from androgenetic, parthenogenetically activated and fertilized blasotocyst. mRNA microarrays were repeated three times using passages 6, 7 and 8.
