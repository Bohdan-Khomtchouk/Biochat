SUMMARY
A stably transfected inducible system for KLF4 was established in RKO cells as previously described (Chen et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2003).  This cell line, called EcR-RKO/KLF4, contains stably transfected receptors for the insect hormone, ecdysone (EcR), and a full-length mouse KLF4 cDNA driven by a promoter that responds to ecdysone and its analogue, ponasterone A.  Cells were treated with 5 ÂµM ponasterone A (PA), for various time durations.  To control for the experiment, the vehicle, ethanol, was added for the same periods of time. Keywords: Time course
