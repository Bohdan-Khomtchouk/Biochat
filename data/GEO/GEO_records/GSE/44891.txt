TITLE
H3K9me3 (new lot).D.mel 3rd Instar Larvae Nuclei Sexed Female Jil mutant

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_5609 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Gary Karpen. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: We aim to determine the locations of the major histone modifications across the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The modifications under study are involved in basic chromosomal functions such as DNA replication, gene expression, gene silencing, and inheritance. We will perform Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) using genomic tiling arrays. We will initially assay localizations using chromatin from three cell lines and two embryonic stages, and will then extend the analysis of a subset of proteins to four additional animal tissues/stages. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf
