TITLE
Analysis of Gene Expression in Tissues of Two Turmeric Varieties at Different Developmental Stages

ORGANISM
Curcuma longa

SUMMARY
Two varieties of turmeric, FMO (Fat Mild Orange) and TYA (Thin Yellow Aromatic) were compared. Rhizomes were harvested 3, 5, and 7 months after planting, roots were harvested at 7 months, and leaves were harvested at 7 months. Plants were grown under controlled conditions in the greenhouse.

DESIGN
We used an interwoven loop design for hybridizations. There are two interwoven loops included in this experiment, one for rhizome samples from the different developmental stages, and a second for leaf and root 7 month old samples compared to 7 month old rhizome samples. The two loops were connected at the 7 month old rhizome samples.
