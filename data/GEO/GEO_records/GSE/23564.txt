TITLE
Genome wide transcriptional profiling of c-Cbl deficient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression of genes that are differentially expressed between c-Cbl control and c-Cbl mutant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were identified through this approach. Interestingly, several leukemia associated genes, particularly transcription factors, were differentially expressed between c-Cbl WT and c-Cbl mutant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells of c-Cbl control  and c-Cbl mutant mice were sorted based on their defined immunophenotype. Gene expression studies were performed using Illumina microarray chips.
