TITLE
Cholangiocarcinoma tissues VS. corresponding normal bile duct tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify miRNAs differentially expressed in cholangiocarcinoma,3 human cholangiocarcinoma and their corresponding normal bile duct tissues were obtained from 3 patients after operation with postoperative pathological diagnosed perihilar or distal biliary cholangiocarcinoma

DESIGN
miRNAs expression in human cholangiocarcinoma/normal bile duct samples was measured after operation.Three independent experiments were performed using different patients for each experiment.
