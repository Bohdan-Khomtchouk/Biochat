TITLE
Pinus massoniana Transcriptome Responses Involved in Phosphorus Deficiency

ORGANISM
Pinus massoniana

SUMMARY
Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) has evolved some adaptations for growth in low P soils. To elucidate these mechanisms, we investigated global gene expression profiles of the masson pine responding to long-term phosphorus starvation and different Pi levels (P1, 0.01 mM P; P2, 0.06 mM P).

DESIGN
Analysis used phosphorus-sufficient treatment RNA as control samples for comparison to the experimental samples (P1 and P2) taken at 12, 24, 48 and 60 day. Indirect comparisons were made across multiple arrays with raw data pulled from different channels for data analysis and comparison to the control data.
