TITLE
Identification of ParB binding sites in vivo in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
To identify ParB binding sites in vivo, we performed ChIP experiments followed by high throughput sequencing using a 3xflag tagged version of ParB, in different genetic backgrounds. This allowed us to show that ParB binds in vivo mostly to 4 parS sites, located within 15 kb of oriC. We also identify 9 secondary ParB binding sites.

DESIGN
A functional ParB-3xflag was used for ChIP-seq experiments.
