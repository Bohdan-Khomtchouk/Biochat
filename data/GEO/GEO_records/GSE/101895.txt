TITLE
Metabolic Stress Induces Modifications in the Epigenetic Program of Preimplantation Bovine Embryos

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
we induced an energetic stress on in vitro embryos to observe the epigenetic response associated with metabolic stress. Embryos were created with slaughterhouse cows oocytes and then exposed to an elevated glucose concentration (5mM vs 0.2mM for the control embryos) for the first 3 days post fecundation and then cultivated in normal media until blastocyst stage. Blastocysts were collected from 4 different weeks of culture. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed by micro array using EDMA platform.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, control at 0.2 uM glucose and treatment at 5 uM glucose.  4 pools of 5 blastocysts

PLATFORM
GPL18384 EmbryoGENE DNA Methylation Array Bovine 2x400K v2.0
