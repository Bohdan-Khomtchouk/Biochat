TITLE
Expression data from UPD18 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression levels between matUPD18 and patUPD18 8.5 dpc whole embryo samples (maternal versus paternal uniparental disomy of Chr 18). Identification of highly differentially expressed transcripts. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Pairwise array comparative analyses were performed using MAS5/GCOS where sample age and tissue were matched, while the sample genotype varied between the compared arrays: matUPD18 vs patUPD18.
