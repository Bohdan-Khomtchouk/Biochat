TITLE
Transcriptome Profiling of Roots and leaves Under High Osmotic Stress in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The functions of miRNAs and their target mRNAs in Arabidopsis development have been widely documented, however, roles of stress responsive miRNAs and their targets are not as well understood. Using small RNA deep sequencing and ATH1 microarrays to profile mRNAs, we identified IAR3 (IAA-Ala Resistant 3) as a novel target of miR167a.

DESIGN
2 organs X 3 treatments X 3 replicates This submission represnts ATH1 microarrays component of study.
