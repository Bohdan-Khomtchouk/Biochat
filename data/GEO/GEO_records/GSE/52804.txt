TITLE
Genes related to allergen avoidance in allergic rhinitis mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Allergen exposure was thought to play a critical role in the etiology of AR. And allergen avoidance, the practice of avoiding exposure to allergens, has been generally advised as the management of AR. However, the effect is uncertain and the underlying mechanism is far from known. We used gene expression microarrays to identify genes differentially regulated by allergen avoidance in allergic rhinitis mouse model.

DESIGN
Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays were used to identify the expression profiling of nasal mucosa in three groups of mice: (1) mice sensitized and challenged with saline (control group); (2) mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) and sacrificed 2 hours after the last challenge (OVA group); (3) mice sensitized and challenged with OVA and sacrificed 4 weeks after the last challenge (4w-after group).
