TITLE
ncRNA expression-based, individualized outcome prediction for CRC patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Individualized outcome prediction classifiers were successfully constructed through expression profiling of ncRNAs in 165 CRC cases.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a well-defined cohort of 165 CRC cases from MD Anderson Cancer Center, followed up more than ten years, was used to acquire expression profiles of ncRNAs.
