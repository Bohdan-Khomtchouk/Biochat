TITLE
Effects of Phenylethyl Isothiocyanate on N-Nitrosomethylbenzylamine-induced Cytotoxicity in Rat Esophagus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To date, there is little information on early molecular events in the development of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA) induced esophageal tumorigenesis and of the effects of chemopreventive agents on these events. In this study, we identified genes in rat esophagus that were differentially expressed in response to shortâ€“term NMBA-treatment and modulated by co-treatment with phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC). Rats were fed AIN-76A diet or AIN-76A diet containing PEITC for three weeks. During the third week of dietary treatment, they were administered three s.c. doses of NMBA (0.5 mg/kg b.w.). Rats were sacrificed 24 h after the last treatment, esophagi excised and processed for histological grading, microarray and real-time PCR analysis. Our histopathological data showed that treatment of rats with PEITC had protective effect on NMBA-induced preneoplastic lesions in the rat esophagus. We identified 2261 genes that were differentially expressed in the NMBA-treated vs. control esophagi and 1936 genes in the NMBA+PEITC- vs. NMBA-treated esophagi. The intersection of these two sets resulted in the identification of 1323 genes in NMBA-treated esophagus that were modulated by PEITC to near-normal levels of expression. The measured changes in the expression levels of 10 selected genes were validated using real-time PCR. Principle components analysis (PCA) was applied to all twelve microarrays in the study, which suggested that in terms of global gene expression, PEITC treatment had a genome-wide modulating effect on NMBA-induced gene expression. Samples obtained from animals treated with PEITC alone or co-treated with NMBA were more similar to controls than they were to NMBA treatment alone. Keywords: Toxicogenomics,reference design
