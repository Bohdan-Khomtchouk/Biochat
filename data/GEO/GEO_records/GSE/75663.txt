TITLE
Inactivation of KLF4 in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia promotes the expansion of leukemia cells by activating the Map2k7/Jnk pathway. [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of bone marrow cells from control and Klf4 deficient T-ALL mice Deletion of Klf4 accelerates NOTCH1-induced leukemia. Analysis provides insight into function of KLF4 in leukemia.

DESIGN
GFP+CD4+CD8+bone marrow cells were sorted from control and Klf4 deficient T-ALL mice induced by NOTCH1 at 4 weeks after transplantation. Sorted cells were subjected to gene expression analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
