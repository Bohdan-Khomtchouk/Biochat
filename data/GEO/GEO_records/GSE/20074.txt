TITLE
Transcription profiling of Drosophila melanogaster SSDP target genes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of third instar male larvae of two different heteroallelic combinations of ssdp hypomorphic alleles, ssdp[neo48]/ssdp]BG1663] and ssdp[31]/ssdp[BG1663] were compared to each of the corresponding single heterozygotes

DESIGN
22 hybridizations were conducted, these include biological repeats and dye swaps as technical controls.
