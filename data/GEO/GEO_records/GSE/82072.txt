TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells (MEPs) with or without mutations in JAK2 and Ezh2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of mRNA expression profiles of MEPs with or without mutations in JAK2 and Ezh2 by RNA sequencing. MEPs mRNA was extracted from six different transgenic mice (SclCre, SclCre;Ezh2+/-, SclCre;Ezh2-/-, SclCre; JAK2V617F, SclCre; JAK2V617F;Ezh2+/-, SclCre; JAK2V617F;Ezh2-/-) 10 weeks after tamoxifen injection. Our study represents the first detailed analysis of mRNA expression profile of MEP with or without mutations in JAK2 and Ezh2 , with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. Our results revealed that mRNA expression profile of MEP with different genotype showed specific gene expression patterns, which allows to do biological comprehensive and quantitative analysis for hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
MEPs mRNA profiles six different transgenic mice (SclCre, SclCre;Ezh2+/-, SclCre;Ezh2-/-, SclCre; JAK2V617F, SclCre; JAK2V617F;Ezh2+/-, SclCre; JAK2V617F;Ezh2-/-) were generated by deep sequencing.
