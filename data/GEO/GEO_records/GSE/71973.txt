TITLE
Pif1-family helicases cooperate to suppress widespread replication fork arrest at tRNA genes

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes two distinct Pif1-family helicases – Pif1 and Rrm3 – which have been reported to play distinct roles in numerous nuclear processes. Here, we systematically characterize the roles of Pif1 helicases in replisome progression and lagging- strand synthesis in S. cerevisiae. We demonstrate that either Pif1 or Rrm3 redundantly stimulate strand-displacement by DNA polymerase δ during lagging-strand synthesis. By analyzing replisome mobility in pif1 and rrm3 mutants, we show that Rrm3, with a partially redundant contribution from Pif1, suppresses widespread terminal arrest of the replisome at tRNA genes. Although both head-on and codirectional collisions induce replication fork arrest at tRNA genes, head-on collisions arrest a higher proportion of replisomes; consistent with this observation, we find that head-on collisions between tRNA transcription and replisome progression are under-represented in the S. cerevisiae genome. Further, we demonstrate that tRNA-mediated arrest is R-loop independent, and propose that replisome arrest and DNA damage are mechanistically separable.

DESIGN
We enriched Okazaki fragments by depletion of DNA ligase I, and sequenced the resulting enriched single-stranded/nicked DNA
