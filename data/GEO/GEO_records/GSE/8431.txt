TITLE
Microarray screening of RARgamma responsive genes in F9 teratocarcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the differentially expressed genes between the F9 Wt cells and F9 RAR gamma knock out cells before and after RA treatment. 3 replicates for each conditions. We also identified the RA responsive genes in the F9 Wt cells. Keywords: mutant type

DESIGN
F9 wt cells and F9 RAR gamma knock out cells are treated with RA (1 uM) or ethanol for 24 hours. 3 replicates for each condition.
