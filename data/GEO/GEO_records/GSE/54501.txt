TITLE
Gene expression profiles in the colon of APC and Olfm4 double mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
APC mutant mice develop polys in the intestine, but not carcinoma. We found that additional deletion of Olfm4 gene induced carcinoma formation in the distal colon. To explore the molecular mechanism, we performed cDNA microarray to understand the gene expression files in the tumor tissues compared with WT, APC mutant and Olfm4 mutant mice.

DESIGN
RNA were extracted from three mice of each genotyp category, WT, APC mutant, Olfm4 mutant, APC/Olfm4 mutant adjacent tissues and APC/Olfm4 tumor tissues. Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array GeneChips were used to invesstigate gene expression patterns. The expression files in different groups were compared.
