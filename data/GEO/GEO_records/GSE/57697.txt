TITLE
Brassica napus control vs. heat stress

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
High temperature stress results in yield loss and alterations to seed composition during seed filling in oilseed rape (Brassica napus). However, the mechanism underlying this heat response is poorly understood. In this study, we employed a microarray analysis with silique walls and seeds from the developing siliques (20 days after flowering) of Brassica napus that had undergone heat stress.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs heat stress, 2 time points

PLATFORM
GPL8513 Agilent-018073 Custom Brassica 60-mer two-color microarray
