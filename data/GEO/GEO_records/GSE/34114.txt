TITLE
Temporal response of mouse peritoneal cells to a non-pathogenic E. coli infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of early and late changes in the mouse peritoneal cells in response to E. coli induced sepis. Result provide an insight into the molecular function and pathways expressed at these different time points.

DESIGN
The mice were divided in two groups; the first group of mice were not treated with E. coli and was referred to as the naive group. Each mouse of the second group was injected with 2 X108 cells of a non- pathogenic isolate of E. coli suspended in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. After 1h, 2h and 18h of E. coli administration, peritoneal lavage fluid was obtained from two mice each for E. coli treated group at 1 and 2h and three mice of both groups (control and E. coli treated) at 18h. A common naive group of 2 mice harvested at 2h served as a control for both 1h and 2h.
