TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Ets1-/- CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed microarray analysis of gene expression in WT and Ets1-/- CD4+ CD8+ DP thymocytes. Overall, we find that Ets1-/- thymocytes display gene expression signatures closer to previous stages of thymocyte development (e.g. DN3-4) than WT DP cells, suggesting that while these cells do become DP thymocytes in the absence of Ets1, that the latter is required for the upregulation of later T-cell genes and that its presence is required for the downregulation of genes corresponding to earlier and alternative stages of development.
