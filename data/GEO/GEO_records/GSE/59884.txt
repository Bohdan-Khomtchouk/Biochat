PTBP1 excludes UPF1 to protect long 3'UTRs from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis of human 293 Tet-off cells depleted of PTBP1 and UPF1 alone and in tandem with specific siRNAs.

DESIGN
siRNA-based depletion of PTBP1, UPF1, and PTBP1/UPF1 together, with a validated non-silencing siRNA as a control.

PLATFORM
