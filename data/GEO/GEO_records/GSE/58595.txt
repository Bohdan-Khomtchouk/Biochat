TITLE
Global Transcriptome Analysis and Enhancer Landscape of Human Primary T Follicular Helper and T Effector Lymphocytes (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a subset of CD4+ T helper (Th) cells that migrate into germinal centers and promote B cell maturation into memory B and plasma cells. Tfh cells are necessary for promotion of protective humoral immunity following pathogen challenge, but when aberrantly regulated, drive pathogenic antibody formation in autoimmunity and undergo neoplastic transformation in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and other primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Limited information is available on the expression and regulation of genes in human Tfh cells. Using a fluorescence activated cell sorting-based strategy, we obtained primary Tfh and non-Tfh T effector (Teff) cells from tonsils and prepared genome-wide maps of active, intermediate, and poised enhancers determined by ChIP-seq, with parallel transcriptome analyses determined by RNA-seq. Tfh cell enhancers were enriched near genes highly expressed in lymphoid cells or involved in lymphoid cell function, with many mapping to sites previously associated with autoimmune disease in genome-wide association studies. A group of active enhancers unique to Tfh cells associated with differentially expressed genes was identified. Fragments from these regions directed expression in reporter gene assays. These data provide a significant resource for studies of T lymphocyte development and differentiation and normal and perturbed Tfh cell function.
