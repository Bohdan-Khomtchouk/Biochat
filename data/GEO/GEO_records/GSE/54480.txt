TITLE
Genomic Fingerprints of DC Subsets in the Human Vaginal Mucosa, Skin, and Blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DC) localize throughout the body, where they sense and capture invading pathogens to induce protective immune responses. Hence, harnessing the biology of tissue-resident DC is crucial for the rational design of vaccines against pathogens. Herein, we characterized the transcriptomes of four antigen presenting cell (APC) subsets from the human vagina (vLC, vCD14- DC, vCD14+ DC, vMÎ¦) and compared them to those of three skin DC (sDC) subsets and blood myeloid DC. We find that APC genomic fingerprints are significantly influenced by the tissue of origin as well as by individual APC subsets. Nonetheless, CD14+ APC from both vagina and skin are geared towards innate immunity and pro-inflammatory responses, whereas CD14- DC, particularly sLC, vLC, and vCD14- DC, display both Th2-inducing and regulatory phenotypes. We also identified vAPC subset-specific cellular and functional biomarkers that will guide the design of mucosal vaccines against sexually transmitted pathogens.    Vaginal and skin tissues were obtained from female patients who underwent pelvic or cosmetic surgeries under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Baylor Research Institute (BRI). Patients were not infected with HIV, HCV or TB and did not display inflammation in the tissues. No other diagnosis information was available. Blood from healthy female volunteers was obtained under a protocol approved by the IRB of BRI.
