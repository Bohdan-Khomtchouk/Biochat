TITLE
Expression profiling of host genes modulated by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Rta in HEK293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EBV Rta is a transcriptional activator that functions to disrupt EBV latency in cells of epithelial origin. This series of experiment is to identify host genes that are moduated by the expression of doxycycline-inducible EBV Rta in HEK293 cells. Designations for the pooled EBV Rta inducible cell lines is 293TetER; pooled luciferase inducible lines is 293TetLuc (control).

DESIGN
Both 293TetER and 293TetLuc cells were grown to log-phase before doxycycline induction. Same number of cells from the two cell lines were treated with doxycycline for 48 h. Experiments were performed in duplicates. Total RNAs from the four samples were extracted and subjected to microarray analysis (Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array , n=33,297). Compared to doxycycline treated 293TetLuc, we sought to identify genes up- or down-regulated in by EBV Rta in doxycycline treated 293TetER cells..
