TITLE
Differential gene expression in mouse kidney following 72 hours of colistin exposure by Illumina WG-6_V2 array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Colistin sulfate (polymixin E) is an antibiotic prescribed with resurging frequency for multidrug resistant gram negative bacterial infections. It is associated with nephrotoxicity in humans in up to 33% of cases.  Little is known regarding genes involved in colistin nephrotoxicity. A murine model of colistin-mediated kidney injury was developed.  C57/BL6 mice were administered saline or colistin at a dose of 16mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses. An Illumina gene expression array was performed on kidney RNA harvested 72 hours after first colistin dose to identify differentially expressed genes early in drug treatment. Array platform was MouseWG-6, 48,000 probes. Drug given intraperitoneal.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from mouse kidneys which were harvested upon sacrifice. 12 total 10 week old C57 bl6 mice were analyzed. Six mice were administered 0.1% saline twice daily, six mice were given colistin at 16 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses. The 2 groups were randomized to 2 different MouseWG-6_V2_0_R2_11278593 and groups were compared.
