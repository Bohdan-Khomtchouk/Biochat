TITLE
RNA-seq of YB5 and MCF7 treated with different doses of decitabine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was performed after YB5 cells were treated with 1uM decitabine, and MCF7 cells were treated with 100nM decitabine

DESIGN
Biological triplicates were performed for a total of 6 samples. Fold change of each gene was calculated by comparing change in expression after inhibitor treatment to expression in the control samples from GSE73966 for YB5, and GSE74036 for MCF7. These control samples have been re-accessioned here for convenient access to the entire study.
