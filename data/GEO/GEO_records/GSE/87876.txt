TITLE
piRNA expression data from mouse testis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pregnant females were distributed into two experimental groups: control group and MC-LR group which were exposed to 0 and 10 μg/L of MC-LR through drinking water separately during fetal and lactational periods. In 30 days old, the animals were euthanized. Testes were determined to investigate the different expressions of piRNAs using a piRNA microarray.

DESIGN
Pregnant mice were randomly divided into 2 groups: control group and MC-LR group, with each mouse kept separately. From gestation day 12 to postnatal day 21, 2 groups of pregnant mice were exposed to 0 and 10 μg/L of MC-LR through drinking water. The male offspring were breastfed after natural birth. 30 days after birth, the organs were promptly frozen in liquid nitrogen until further analysis.empty-2T, empty-4T, empty-5T were the three samples from 3 offsprings of different pregnant mice in control group. 10-3T, 10-4T, 10-7T were the three samples from 3 offsprings of different pregnant mice in MC-LR group.
