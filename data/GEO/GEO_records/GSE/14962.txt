TITLE
Temporal Profiling of Rat Transcriptomes in Retinol-Replenished Vitamin A-Deficient Testis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to examine the temporal transcriptome changes of vitamin a deficient rats testes replenished with retinol

DESIGN
20-day old rats were put on a vitamin A deficient diet, after nine weeks the animals were treated with retinol for 0-(VAD), 4-, 8-, 24-hr to determine the global transcriptome changes induced by retinol replenishment of the vitmain A deficient testis
