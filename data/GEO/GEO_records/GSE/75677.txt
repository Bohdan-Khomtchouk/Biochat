TITLE
Comparison of Liver Tumor Models to Regenerating Liver Tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To identify genes and pathways sepcific to tumorigenesis, we harvested tissues from two different liver tumor models as well as regenerating tissues. Genes significantly different in the two tumor models, but not in regenerating tissues, were used for further investigation

DESIGN
Analysis consists of three primary groups. 1) DEN tumors: C57BL6 mice were injected with a 50mg/kg dose of  diethylnitrosamine (DEN) at 14 days of age and a 2mg/kg dose of TCPOBOP 30 days later. Liver tissues with tumors (at 8 months) were harvested compared with liver tissues prior to tumor development (5 months). 2) Morris hepatoma tumors: 10 week-old ACI rats were anesthetized and 1 million MH3924a cells were injected directly into the liver. Tumors were harvested two weeks later and compared to age-match control ACI rat liver tissue. 3) Regenerating: 10-12 week-old rats were anesthetized, two-thirds of the liver was removed, and tissues were harvested 24 hours later. All animals were male.
