TITLE
Chip-chip of condensin subunits Brn1 and Smc4 and Scc2/4 and cohesin and Tfc3 (TFIIIC) on budding yeast chromosomes

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Eukaryotic chromosomes reach their stable rod-shaped appearance in mitosis in a reaction dependent on the evolutionarily conserved condensin complex. Little is known about how and where condensin associates with chromosomes. Here, we analyse condensin binding to budding yeast chromosomes using high resolution oligonucleotide tiling arrays. Condensin binding sites coincide with those of the loading factor Scc2/4 of the related cohesin complex. The sites map to tRNA genes, ribosomal protein genes, and other places characterised by the RNA polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIC. An ectopic B-Box element, recognised by TFIIIC, constitutes a minimal condensin binding site, and TFIIIC and the Scc2/4 complex promote productive condensin association with chromosomes. A similar pattern of condensin binding is conserved along fission yeast chromosomes. This reveals that TFIIIC binding sites, including tRNA genes, constitute a hitherto unknown chromosomal feature with important implications for chromosome architecture during both interphase and mitosis. Keywords: Chip-chip, cell type comparison

DESIGN
Pattern of binding of condensin Brn1, cohesin Scc1, Scc2 and Tfc3 on budding yeast chromosomes as well as condensin Cnd2 binding on fission yeast chromosomes.
