TITLE
Estren Behaves as a Weak Estrogen Rather than a Non-genomic Selective Activator in the Mouse Uterus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A proposed membrane-mediated mechanism of rapid non genomic response to estrogen has been the intense focus of recent research.  Estren (Es), a synthetic steroid, is reported to act selectively through a rapid membrane-mediated pathway, rather than through the classical nuclear estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated pathway, to maintain bone density in ovaierectomized mice without uterotropic effects. To further evaluate the mechanism and physiological effects of Es we studied responses in adult ovariectomized mice. Keywords: estrogen receptor, nongenomic steriod action, uterus
