TITLE
Molecular characteristics and metastasis predictor genes of triple-negative breast cancer (II)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This microarray dataset contains 51 triple-negative breast cancers, 25 normal breast tissues, and 106 luminal breast cancers (reanalyzed data from Series GSE24124, GSE9309, and GSE17040). Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
Specimens of breast cancer tissue were collected and snap-frozen from breast cancer patients who had surgery between 1995 and 2008 at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH, Taipei, Taiwan). Clinicopathological information was obtained for all breast cancer patients along with informed consent. The AJCC/UICC TNM system was used for breast cancer staging classification.
