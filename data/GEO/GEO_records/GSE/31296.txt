TITLE
Differential analysis of transcriptomes regulated upon ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning versus ischemia-reperfusion protocols in the mouse heart in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ischemic preconditioning (PreC) and postconditioning (PostC) are the most potent cardioprotective strategies inhibiting ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injuries.The aim of our study was to identify the gene profiles regulated upon preconditioning and postconditioning in the mouse heart in vivo.

DESIGN
Analysis used myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) RNA as control samples for comparison to the experimental samples taken after an ischemic preconditioning (PreC), a postconditioning (PosC) or a 30min delayed PostC (Post30) treatment. Comparisons were made across multiple arrays with raw data pulled from different channels for data analysis and comparison to the control data.
