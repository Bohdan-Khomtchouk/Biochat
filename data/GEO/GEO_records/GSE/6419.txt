TITLE
Expression data from mouse bladder urothelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Host responses to intracellular UPEC communities We used laser capture microdissection and microarrays to identify urothelial transcripts differentially expressed in response to proximity to intracellular UPEC. Keywords: spatial/cell type analysis

DESIGN
Transcription within four distinct populations of urothelial cells was profiled in biological duplicate: (i) uninfected, (ii) mock-infected (sterile 1x PBS), (iii) IBC-distal (cells residing > 10 cell diameters from IBCs in the section plane), and (iv) IBC-proximal (cells residing < 10 cell diameters from IBCs in the section plane).
