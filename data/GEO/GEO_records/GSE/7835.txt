TITLE
Modulating hypoxia-inducible transcription by disrupting the HIF-1-DNA interface

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription mediated by hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1) contributes to tumor angiogenesis and metastasis but is also involved in the activation of cell-death pathways and normal physiological processes.  Given the complexity of HIF-1 signaling it could be advantageous to target a subset of HIF-1 effectors rather than the entire pathway.  We compared the genome-wide effects of three molecules that each interfere with the HIF-1-DNA interaction: a polyamide targeted to the hypoxia response element (HRE), siRNA targeted to HIF-1α, and echinomycin, a DNA binding natural product with a similar but less specific sequence preference to the polyamide.  The polyamide affects a subset of hypoxia-induced genes that are consistent with the binding site preferences of the polyamide.  For comparison, siRNA targeted to HIF-1α and echinomycin each affect the expression of nearly every gene induced by hypoxia.  Remarkably, the total number of genes affected by either polyamide or HIF-1α siRNA over a range of thresholds is comparable.  The data shows how polyamides can be used to affect a subset of a pathway regulated by a transcription factor.  In addition, this study offers a unique comparison of three complementary approaches towards exogenous control of endogenous gene expression.

DESIGN
Hypoxia-mimetic DFO (deferoxamine)-stimulated U251 cells that were treated with polyamide 1, HIF-1a siRNA, and echinomycin were compared to control cells that were also DFO-stimulated.  Cells not stimulated with DFO were also compared to the DFO-stimulated controls.  Three biological replicates were included for each treatment/condition.
