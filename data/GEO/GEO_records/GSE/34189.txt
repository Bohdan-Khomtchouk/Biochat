TITLE
Neural invasion induces cachexia via astrocytic activation of neural route in pancreatic cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pancreatic cancer is characterized by a high frequency of cachexia, pain and neural invasion (N-inv). Neural damage is occurred by N-inv and modulates pain and muscle atrophy via the activation of astrocyte in the connected spine. The activated astrocyte by N-inv, thus, may affect cachexia in pancreatic cancer. Clinical studies in patients and autopsy cases with pancreatic cancer have revealed that N-inv is related to cachexia and astrocytic activation. We established a novel murine model of cancer cachexia using N-inv of human pancreatic cancer cells. Mice with N-inv showed a loss of body weight, skeletal muscle, and fat mass without appetite loss, which are compatible with an animal model of cancer cachexia. Activation of astrocytes in the spinal cord connected with N-inv was observed in our model. Experimental cachexia was suppressed by disrupting neural routes or inhibiting the activation of astrocytes. These data provide the first evidence that N-inv induces cachexia via astrocytic activation of neural route in pancreatic cancer.

DESIGN
We produced neural invasion (N-inv) model using intraneural injection of Capan-1 cells to left sciatic nerve of male SCID mouse. For controls, subcutaneous model (SC) and PBS model were produced. Microarray analysis was performed using the first lumbar cord (L1) from PBS, SC, and N-inv mice at 6 w (n = 2 each).
