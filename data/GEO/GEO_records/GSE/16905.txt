TITLE
ChIP-chip of Spo14 and Mvp1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Genome-wide localization of two new RNA pol II interacting proteins. We use C-LYTAG to map binding sites of Spo14 and Mvp1 along the S. cerevisiae genome. Two biological replicates of each experiment were done. Keywords: ChIp-chip

DESIGN
Two independent biological replicates of each IP. We used three macroarrays: V5R2-L1-20, V5R2-L1-21 and V5R2-L1-22 that were hybridized with Whole Cell Extract (WCE) and then with two biological samples of immunoprecipitated (IP) Mvp1 (V5R2-L1-20 and V5R2-L1-21) and Spo14 (V5R2-L1-20 and V5R2-L1-22)
