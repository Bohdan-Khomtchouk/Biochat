TITLE
Genome-wide map of RNA polymerase occupancy of Salmonella enterica cells during cytosolic Mg2+ limitation.

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
We report the identification of genes displaying altered RNA polymerase occupancy in Salmonella enterica cells experiencing cytosolic magnesium starvation.

DESIGN
Comparison of RNA polymerase occupancies of cells experiencing cytosolic magnesium starvation with those that are experience physiological levels of cytosolic  magnesium.

PLATFORM
GPL24040 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium)
