TITLE
Unprecedented life- and healthspan extension and genome preservation by diet restriction in DNA repair deficient progeroid Ercc1∆/- mice [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigate the anti-aging response induced by dietary restriction (DR) on gene expression level. For this, we carried out Ribosomal RNA depleted Total RNA sequencing in 16 weeks old Ercc1∆/- ad libidum (AL), DR and wt mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from fresh liver samples from 16 weeks old Ercc1∆/- AL, DR and wt mice. Ribosomal RNA was depleted from the extracts by using RiboMinus kit (Ambion) then sequenced  according to the Illumina TruSeq v3 protocol on HiSeq2000 platform.

PLATFORM
