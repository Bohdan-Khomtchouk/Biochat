TITLE
Conversion of mouse fibroblast to hepatocyte-like cells by defined factors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Plasticity of differentiated cells has been proved by nuclear transfer, induced pluripotent cells and transdifferentiation. Here we show that by transduction of 3 factors (Hnf1alpha, Gata4, and Foxa3) and p19Arf inactivation, tail-tip fibroblasts can be converted to hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells, expressing hepatocyte marker genes, and acquiring many mature hepatocyte functions in vitro and in vivo.

DESIGN
p19Arf-null TTFs were tranfected with 3 liver enriched transcription factors, then changed to modified Block's medium. To enrich iHep cells, epithelial cells were enriched by partial trypsin digestion.
