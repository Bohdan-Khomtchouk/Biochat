TITLE
Sucrose modulation of the Arabidopsis thaliana guard-cell transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to evaluate the effect of sucrose on gene expression in guard cells.  Strips of Arabidopsis leaves were incubated with sucrose or mannitol or no sugars, then the leaves were freeze dried and guard cells were dissected from the leaf strips and analyzed.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from guard cells dissected from leaf strips that had been treated with sucrose or with mannitol or no sugars as controls.  Triplicate biological replicates were prepared for the treatments and controls.  The RNA was amplified twice with T7 RNA polymerase and hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays.
