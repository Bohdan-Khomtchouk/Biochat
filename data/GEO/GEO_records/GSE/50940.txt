TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of rat hippocampus after status epilepticus induced by amygdala stimulation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small and endogenously expressed non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of protein-coding genes at the translational level. Emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs play critical roles in central nervous system under physiological and pathological conditions. However, their expression and functions in status epilepticus (SE) have not been well characterized thus far. Here, we characterized miRNA expression profile in rat hippocampus at 24 hours following SE induced by amygdala stimulation.

DESIGN
Hippocampus miRNA profiles of experimental group and control group were generated by deep sequencing, using Hiseq 2000.
