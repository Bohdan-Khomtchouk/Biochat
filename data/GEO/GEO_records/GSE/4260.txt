TITLE
Cumulus-oocyte complex temporal expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cumulus-oocyte complexes were isolated a seperate time-points to generate temporal complexes.  Targets from two biological replicates at each time point (0h, 8h, 16h post-hCG treatment) were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes with temporal expression patterns. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
2 eCG-primed (48h) pooled cumulus-oocyte complexes, 2 eCG-primed (48h) hCG-treated (8h) pooled cumulus-oocyte complexes, and 2 eCG-primed (48h) hCG-treated (16h) pooled cumulus-oocyte complexes replicates were analyzed
