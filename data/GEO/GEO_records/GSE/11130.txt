SUMMARY
Total RNA was extracted from skin biopsies before and after imatinib (Gleevec) treatment using Qiagen RNeasy fibrous tissue kit. RNA was amplified using the Ambion Amino Allyl MessageAmp II aRNA kit. Amplified skin RNA (labeled with Cy5) and amplified Stratagene Human Universal Reference RNA (labeled with Cy3) were competitively hybridized to HEEBO microarrays in duplicate as described ( ). 161a/b: Patient 1, pre-Gleevec treatment 170a/b: Patient 1, post-Gleevec treatment 215a/b: Patient 2, pre-Gleevec treatment 232a/b: Patient 2, post-Gleevec treatment A compound treatment design type is where the response to administration of a compound or chemical (including biological compounds such as hormones) is assayed. Compound Based Treatment: Treated with 100 mg Gleevec twice daily for 3 months or 200 mg Gleevec daily for 6 months Keywords: compound_treatment_design
