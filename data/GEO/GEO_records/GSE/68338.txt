TITLE
HeLa cells: Control vs. GPRC5A depletion at different stages of adhesion to Matrigel

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of HeLa cervical carcinoma cells comparing cells with siRNA- or shRNA-mediated depletion of GPRC5A vs. cells carrying non-targeting siRNA or shRNA after 45 min and 6 h of adhesion to 10% Matrigel matrix. The goal was to determine the effect of GPRC5A depeltion on the global gene expression following the adhesion process.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, GPRC5A depletion vs. control cells, two time points (45 min and 6 h of adhesion to Matrigel). Biological replicates: 2 replicates per silencing construct, 2 silencing RNAi constructs for GPRC5A vs. two non-targeting RNAi constructs

PLATFORM
GPL16699 Agilent-039494 SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray 039381 (Feature Number version)
