TITLE
Expression profiling of cia-cGAS knockout LT-HSC cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of global gene expression levels between circular RNA cia-cGAS knockout LT-HSCs and cia-cGAS WT cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling using sorted LT-HSC cells from WT and cia-cGAS knockout mice. Total RNA extracted from WT and cia-cGAS knockout cells were quantified by the NanoDrop ND-1000 and RNA integrity was assessed by standard denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. The sample preparation and microarray hybridization were performed based on the NimbleGenâ€™s standard protocols.

PLATFORM
GPL15887 NimbleGen Mouse gene expression array [100718_MM9_EXP] (gene-level version)
