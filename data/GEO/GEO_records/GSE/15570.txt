TITLE
Effect of aging on the meiotic cell cycle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Identify which  stages of meiosis are impaired in replicative aging cells Transcriptional profile of aging yeast cells (young and old) incubated in sporulation-inducing conditions compared to new-born cells grown in vegetative conditions.

DESIGN
Two conditions experiments. Young and Old cells incubated in sporulation-inducing conditions. Control strain was same strain used for the experimental samples but grown in vegetative conditions.
