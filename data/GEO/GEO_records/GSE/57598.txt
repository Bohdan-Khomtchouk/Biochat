TITLE
Next-generation sequencing facilitates quantitative analysis of hepatic sex-differences in ZSF1 rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify sex-specific hepatic genes in Zucker spontaneously hypertensive fatty rats (ZSF1), a rat model for diabetic nephropathy.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression in liver samples between 6 female and 6 male obese ZSF1 rats. Each sample were analyzed as a separate sample.

PLATFORM
