TITLE
A global profile of replication polymerase usage

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have established a novel sequencing approach to characterise usage of replicative DNA polymerases in S. pombe. This approach allows us to determine  the roles of DNA polymerase delta and epsilon in lagging strand and leading strand DNA synthesis, respectively in genome-wide scale. Utilising the dataset of usage of these polymerases, we also successfully identified DNA replication initiation sites at high resolution. Furthermore, our informatics analysis establishes genome-wide datasets of fork direction rates, replication timing and the probability of replication termination.

DESIGN
We mapped ribonucleotide-incorporation by the mutated DNA polymerase delta and epsilon at single-nucleotide resolution and subsequent informatics analysis was performed to generate datasets listed here.
