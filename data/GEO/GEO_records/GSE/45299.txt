TITLE
Genes affected by Satb1 deficiency in HSC, LMPP and CLP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand  gene expression signatures between wild-type and Satb1-deficient cells

DESIGN
To examine genes regulated by Satb1 expression, sets of microarrays were conducted with Lin- c-kitHi Sca-1+ Flt3- HSC-enriched cells, Lin- c-kitHi Sca-1+ Flt3+LMPP-enriched cells, and Lin- c-kitLo Sca-1Lo IL7RÎ±+ CLP-enriched cells derived from E18.5 FL of Satb1-null mice or their WT littermates.

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
