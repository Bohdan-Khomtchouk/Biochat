TITLE
Comparison of Bradyrhizobium japonicum parent strain LO grown under low or high iron conditions

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium japonicum

SUMMARY
The purpose of the study is to identify iron-responsive genes in the bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Parent strain LO was grown under iron limitation or under iron sufficiency and compared to each other by whole genome microarray analysis. Keywords: Comparison of cells grown under low or high iron conditons

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from three biological replicates for each condition, and prepared for microarray analysis using Affymetrix chips. A complete description of these experiments are found in Yang et al., 2006, Mol. Microbiol. 60: 427-437.
