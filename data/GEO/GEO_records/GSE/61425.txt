TITLE
The miR-155/PU.1 axis acts on Pax5 to enable efficient terminal B cell differentiation [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-155 inhibits PU.1 expression, leading to the initiation of the initiation of plasma cell differentiation pathway. Additional PU.1 targets include a network of genes whose products are involved in adhesion, with direct links to B:T interactions.

DESIGN
Sequencing analysis of B cell transcriptome using Illumina TruSeq mRNA sample prep kit and Illumina platform. RNA was isolated from ex-vivo LPS and IL-4 activated (96h) splenic B cells from wild type, PU.1[155-/155-] and miR-155[-/-] mice. 4-5 biological replicates per genotype and condition.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
