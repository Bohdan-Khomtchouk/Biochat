TITLE
RNA-seq of E11.5 TrkC neurons of Runx3-P2+/- and Runx3-P2-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the role of Runx3 in TrkC neurons we performed RNA-seq on E11.5 TrkC neurons isolated from cervical ganglia of Runx3-P2+/- and Runx3-P2-/- mice

DESIGN
Runx3-P2 mice express GFP in TrkC neurons enabling the FACS  isolation of TrkC neurons from E11.5 embryos, Heterozygote Runx3-P2+/-(n=pool of 4) and homozygote Runx3-P2-/- (n=pool of 4) TrkC/GFP neurons were isolated,

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
