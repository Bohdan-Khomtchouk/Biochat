TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of wild-type and Brpf1-null fetal liver LSK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the impact of hematopoietic-specific Brpf1 gene inactivation, LSK (Lin-Sca1+cKit1+) cells were sorted from wild-type and Brpf1-null fetal liver cells for RNA-Seq.

DESIGN
Four E14.5 embryos were used to pool sufficient LSK cells for total RNA isolation and subsequent sequencing on HiSq2500. Two independent pairs of wild-type and mutant RNA samples (each of which contained LSK cells pooled from four embryos) were used for oligo-dT primed RNA Seq.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
