Lysine-specific demethylase 1 metastasis of androgen-independent PCa cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify the LSD1 target genes in metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) was shown to control gene expression and cell proliferation of androgen-dependent prostate cancer (PCa) cells, whereas the role of LSD1 in androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer remains elusive. Here, we show that depletion of LSD1 leads to increased migration and invasion of androgen-independent PCa cells. Transcriptome and cistrome analyses reveal that LSD1 regulates expression of lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPAR6) and cytoskeletal genes including the focal adhesion adaptor protein paxillin (PXN). Enhanced LPAR6 signalling upon LSD1 depletion promotes migration with concomitant phosphorylation of PXN. In mice LPAR6 overexpression enhances, whereas knockdown of LPAR6 abolishes metastasis of androgen-independent PCa cells. Taken together, we uncover a novel mechanism of how LSD1 controls metastasis and identify LPAR6 as a promising therapeutic target to treat metastatic prostate cancer.
