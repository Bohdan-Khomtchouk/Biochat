TITLE
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 spxB- mutant vs. D39 wild-type

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39

SUMMARY
Comparison of the Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 spxB- mutant vs D39. For DNA microarray analysis, D39 wild-type and two independently obtained D39spxB- mutants were grown as four, two and two biological replicates, respectively, in Glc-M17 under semi-aerobic conditions and harvested at an OD595 of approximately 0.25 (mid-exponential). The RNA of both D39spxB- strains was compared to D39 and the combined data was analyzed. All other procedures regarding microarray analyses were done as described before. A gene was considered differentially expressed when the fold change was ≥ 2, ≤ 0.5, with a Bayes p ≤ 0.00001 and when at least 7 measurements were available.

DESIGN
One condition design comparision of two strains including a dye swap.

PLATFORM
