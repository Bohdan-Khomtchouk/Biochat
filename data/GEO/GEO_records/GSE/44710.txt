TITLE
Independent Regulation of Metabolism but Coordinated Control of Tissue Development by Epidermal Specific Transcription Factors in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We identified target genes for NHR-25 by ChIP-seq at L1 stage of C. elegans. Transcription factor genes were tagged with GFP and their expression examined at L1 stage. Since there are no direct target genes known for NHR-25 that can be used for assessment of enrichment efficiency by quantitative PCR (qPCR), we chose to repeat ChIP-seq experiment of another GFP tagged transcription factor, PHA-4 for which the ChIP-seq was performed during a pilot experiment of modENCODE project using the same transgenic strain and antibody (a gift from Tony Hyman lab).

DESIGN
pha-4 and nhr-25 transgenic worm were studied in Fed L1 stage.
