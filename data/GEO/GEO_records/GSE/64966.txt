TITLE
Non-viral generation of marmoset monkey iPS cells by a six-factor-in-one-vector approach

ORGANISM
Callithrix jacchus

SUMMARY
The analysis compares primary fibroblasts initially used for reprogramming, established marmoset ES cells and a marmoset  iPS cell line which was generated witha non-viral approach using a six-factor-in-one-vector approach

DESIGN
Cells were grown under standard conditions for marmoset pluripotent stem cells and primary fibroblasts without additional treatment. For each cell type at least four independent cell preparations were used.
