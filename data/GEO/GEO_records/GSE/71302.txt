TITLE
miR-200c Targets CDK2 and Suppresses Tumorigenesis in Renal Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) expression profiles are widely investigated in the major cancers, but their specific roles and functions in cancers have not yet to be fully elucidated. We investigated expression profiles of miRNAs in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) and in matched normal kidney tissues (NCTs) by using a miRNAs microarray platform which covers a total of 851 human miRNAs.

DESIGN
Tumor tissue samples were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen after surgery, and then stored in a deep freezer at -80Â°C. Total RNA was extracted from 5 ccRCC tissues and paired NCTs and expression profiles of miRNAs were screened by using a miRNA microarray platform.
