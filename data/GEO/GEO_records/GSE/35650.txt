TITLE
Gene Expression profiles of Bapx1 sorted cells from gut of wildtype (WT) and Bapx1 null (HOMO) E12.5 mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aims to look at gene expresion profiles between wildtype and Bapx1 knockout cells of the gut in a E12.5 mouse embryo. Instead of looking at the whole gut, only cells expressing Bapx1 were sorted by Fluroscent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and subjected to expression profiling by microarray.

DESIGN
EGFP was knocked into the Bapx1 locus by homologous recombination in mESC followed by generation of stable mice line. Wildtype and homozygous embryos expressing EGFP was was used to dissected out the gut and Fluroscent activated cell sorting was used to sort out cell expressing Bapx1 as marked by EGFP. Total RNA was extracted and hybidized to an Illumina WG6 v2 mouse array.
