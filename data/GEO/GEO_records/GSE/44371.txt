TITLE
Human MCF7 cells: Mock control vs. siRNA transfected against calreticulin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human MCF7 cells comparing mock control MCF7cells with MCF7cells transfected by siRNA against calreticulin. The latter was shown to be of having significantly decreased expression of calreticulin followed by significant decrease in migrative and invasive potentials of the MCF7 cells. Goal was to determine the effect of calreticulin knockdown on the global gene expression of MCF7 cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Mock control MCF7 cells vs. calreticulin siRNA knockdown MCF7 cells. Biological replicates: 3 mock control replicates, 3 transfected replicates.
