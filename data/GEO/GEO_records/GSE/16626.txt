TITLE
Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene expression in response to thioridazine (THZ)

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles of Mtb after treatment at the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) or 4 X MIC at an early stage (up to 6 hours) was compared to untreated Mtb.

DESIGN
Our experiment is designed to in order to ensure that the primary effects (0-6h) of the drugs and any dose (1X MIC and 4X MIC)  responses would be captured.
