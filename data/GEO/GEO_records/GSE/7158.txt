TITLE
Genome Wide Gene Expression Study of Circulating Monocytes in human with extremely high vs. low bone mass

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peak bone mass (PBM) is an important determinant of osteoporosis. Circulating monocytes may serve as early progenitors of osteoclasts and produce important molecules for bone metabolism. To search for genes functionally important for osteoclastogenesis, we performed a whole genome gene differential expression study of circulating monocytes in human subjects with extremely low vs. high peak bone mass.
