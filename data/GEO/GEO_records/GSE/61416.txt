TITLE
Microarray analysis of the effects of a γ-tocopherol-rich mixture of tocopherols on global gene expression in the prostates of TRAMP mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used whole mouse genome microarrays  to the effects of γ-TmT on global gene expression in the prostate

DESIGN
TRAMP and age-matched C57BL/6 mice were administered either 600 mg/kg of γ-TmT or a control vehicle via oral gavage. Twelve hours after dosing, prostate tissues were collected for RNA extraction.

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
