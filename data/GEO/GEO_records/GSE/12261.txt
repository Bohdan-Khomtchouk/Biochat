TITLE
Global effects of 2-methoxyestradiol on smooth muscle cell hyperproliferation and vascular remodeling in atherosclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail transcriptional changes in cultured human smooth muscle cells in response to acute and chronic 2-methoxyestradiol treatment 2-ME, an endogenous metabolite. of estradiol, not only exerts cytotoxic effects on cancer cells but it also protects against multiple proliferative disorders, including atherosclerosis and injury-induced intimal thickening Keywords: treatment vs. control

DESIGN
Human aortic smooth muscle cells cultures with/without 2-methoxyestradiol (acute/chronic treatment)
