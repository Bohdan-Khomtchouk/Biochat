TITLE
Active Promoters give rise to false positive 'Phantom Peaks' in ChIP-Seq experiments

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We applied ChIP-seq to map the chromosomal binding sites for two nucleosome remodeling complexes containing the ATPase ISWI, ACF and RSF, in Drosophila embryos. Employing a panel of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against their signature subunits, ACF1 and RSF1, robust profiles were obtained indicating that both remodelers co-occupied a large set of active promoters. For further validation we repeated the mapping using chromatin of mutant embryos that do not express ACF1 or RSF1. Surprisingly, the ChIP-seq profiles were unchanged, suggesting that they were not due to specific immunoprecipitation. Conservative analysis lists about 3000 chromosomal loci, mostly active promoters that are prone to non-specific enrichment in ChIP and give rise to ‘Phantom Peaks’. These peaks are not obtained with pre-immune serum and are not prominent in input chromatin.

DESIGN
Examination of various ACF1 and RSF1 antibodies in Drosophila melanogaster embryos which are wildtype or mutant for the antibody targets.
