TITLE
Aging hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine how aging impacts gene expression in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), human CD34+ cells from bone marrow (34BM) and mobilized stem cell products (34P38NPBSC) were examined using microarray-based expression profiling. Differential expression changes were confirmed by microarray comparisons of younger and older expanded T-cell populations.
