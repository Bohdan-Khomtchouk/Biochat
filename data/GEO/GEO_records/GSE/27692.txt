TITLE
Molecular profiles for GTL16 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression and copy number variation arrays for parental GTL16 and GTL16 clones resistant to c-Met inhibitor.

DESIGN
Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 and SNP 6.0 chips were used to assess gene expression and copy number variation, respectively, of GTL16 and resistant GTL16 clones.
