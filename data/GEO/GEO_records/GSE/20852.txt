TITLE
PTIP promotes chromatin changes critical for immunoglobulin class switch recombination

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Programmed genetic rearrangements in lymphocytes require transcription at antigen receptor genes to promote accessibility for initiating double-strand break (DSB) formation critical for DNA recombination and repair. Here we show that activated B cells deficient in the PTIP component of the MLL3 (mixed-lineage leukemia 3) /MLL4 complex display impaired histone methylation (H3K4me3) and transcription initiation of downstream switch regions at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (Igh) locus leading to defective immunoglobulin class-switching.  We also show that PTIP accumulation at DSBs contributes to class-switch recombination (CSR) and genome stability independently from Igh switch transcription. These results demonstrate that PTIP promotes specific chromatin changes that control the accessibility of the Igh locus to CSR, and suggest a non-redundant role for the MLL3/MLL4 complex in altering antibody effector function.

DESIGN
Genome-wide analysis of histone modifications, PTIP, and Pol II in PTIP-WT and PTIP-KO mouse activated B cells.
