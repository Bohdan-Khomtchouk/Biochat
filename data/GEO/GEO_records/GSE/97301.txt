TITLE
Gene expression in Peyronie disease, tunica albuginea, and corpora cavernosum in cultured cells from human penis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cells from normal tissues and from a Peyronie Disease plaque of human penis were cultured and RNA was extracted. The aim was to investigate differences in gene expression in the abnormal plaque as well as to establish baseline expression data in normal tissues for comparison.

DESIGN
Cells were incubated in six well plates in the presence or absence of TGFb, a known inducer of Peyronie Disease-like plaque in animal systems. RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent and the RNA was further purified for DNA microarray analysis using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Micro kit. RNA samples were analyzed by the UCLA DNA Core using the Affymetrix human Gene 1.0 ST system. Data were normalized by the UCLA core.
