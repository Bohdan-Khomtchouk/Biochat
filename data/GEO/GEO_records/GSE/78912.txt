TITLE
microRNAs in Wnt/b-catenin dependent murine HCC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wnt/b-catening dependent HCC mouse models was used to assess microRNA profiles  downstream of Wnt/b-catening pathway in mice HCC

DESIGN
APC fl/fl (n=3) mice developed Wnt/b-catenin dependent HCC and were compared to APC +/+ (n=3) control mice (no tumour)
