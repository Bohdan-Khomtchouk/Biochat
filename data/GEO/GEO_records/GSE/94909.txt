TITLE
Gene expression data from aminoglycoside-treated vaginal tissues.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57 Bl/6 mice were treated subcutaneously with Depo-provera. Five days after Depo treatment mice were treated intravaginally with 1mg neomcyin or equivalent volume of saline every day for six days. On the seventh day, mice were scarificed, vaginal tissue harvested and RNA extracted. Matrix normalized data is provided as neomycin expression data normalized against pbs expression data.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from vaginal tissues of neomycin or pbs control mice.
