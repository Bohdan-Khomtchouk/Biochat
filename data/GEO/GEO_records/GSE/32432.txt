TITLE
Expression data from in utero exposure to genistein, vinclozolin and the mixture of genistein and vinclozolin on the mammary gland

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Morphogenesis of the mammary gland relies on the precise developmental control of morphological elements including TEBs, ducts and lobules. In the peripubertal mammary gland, rising levels of ovarian hormones control this development through a tightly controlled genetic program where specific sets of genes are up-regulated. We used microarrays to detail the program of gene expression underlying different classes of up-regulated genes during the peripubertal process after administration of endocrine disruptors during the fetal and neonatal development.

DESIGN
Rat mammary glands were selected at two peripubertal periods (days 35 and 50), after administration of genistein and vinclozolin during the fetal and neonatal development,  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.. We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of mammary gland for each treatment, and at each developmental stage, in order to increase the temporal and specific effect resolution of time course and endocrine disruption.
