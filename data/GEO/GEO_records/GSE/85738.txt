TITLE
Paused RNA polymerase II inhibits new transcriptional initiation [ChIP-nexus]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pauses downstream of the transcription initiation site before beginning productive elongation. This pause is a key component of metazoan gene expression regulation. Some promoters have a strong disposition for Pol II pausing and often mediate faster, more synchronous changes in expression. This requires multiple rounds of transcription and thus cannot rely solely on pause release. But it is unclear how pausing affects the initiation of new transcripts during consecutive rounds of transcription. Using our recently developed ChIP-nexus method, we find that Pol II pausing inhibits new initiation. We propose that paused Pol II helps prevent new initiation between transcription bursts, which may reduce noise.

DESIGN
ChIP-nexus was performed against Pol II, TBP, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIF, TAF2, XPB and NELF-E in Drosophila melanogaster Kc167 cells.
