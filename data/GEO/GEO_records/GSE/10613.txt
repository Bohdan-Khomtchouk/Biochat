TITLE
Convergence of Mutation and Epigenetic Alterations Identifies Common Target Genes in Breast and Colon Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The identification and characterization of tumor suppressor genes has enhanced our understanding of the biology of cancer and enabled the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.  Whereas in past decades, a handful of tumor suppressors have been slowly identified using techniques such as linkage analysis, large-scale sequencing of the cancer genome has enabled the rapid identification of a large number of genes that are mutated in cancer.  However, determining which of these many genes play key roles in cancer development has proven challenging.  Specifically, recent sequencing of human breast and colon cancers has revealed a large number of somatic gene mutations, but virtually all are heterozygous, occur at low frequency, and are tumor-type specific.
