TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of CTCF in distal limbs at mouse E12.5 using anti-CTCF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq for CTCF using the autopod from E12.5 embryo and confirmed the binding pattern previously reported by a ChIP-on-Chip approach using the same embryonic tissue (Soshnikova et al., 2010). Our results show CTCF-mediated gating of long-range contacts at the HoxD locus.
