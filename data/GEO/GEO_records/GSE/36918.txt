TITLE
Site-specific cytosine-5 methylation by the mouse RNA methyltransferases Dnmt2 and NSun2 promotes tRNA stability and protein synthesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) cell lines and liver samples from Dnmt2 and Nsun2 single mutant, double mutant and wildtype mice were used to identify potential mRNA substrates of both proteins.

DESIGN
MEFs were derived from day 13.5 embryos and immortalized by transfection with a plasmid expressing the SV40 large-T antigen. Total RNA of MEFs cell line at passage 9 and total RNA extracted from 2 months old mouse liver tissues of Dnmt2, Nsun2 single mutant, double mutant and wildtype mice were arrayed on Illumina MouseRef8 v2 chips.

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
