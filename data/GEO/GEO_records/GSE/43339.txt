TITLE
Gene expression profiling of murine liver NK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The NK cell pool is composed of distinct NK cell subsets with divergent phenotypic and functional features. In order to determine whether DX5- and DX5+ NK cells from murine livers represent different NK cell subsets, DX5- and DX5+ liver NK cells of adult mice were respectively sorted for gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.

DESIGN
DX5-NK1.1+CD3- cells and DX5+NK1.1+CD3- cells were sorted from the liver of naive B6 wild-type mice. RNA of each sample was then extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays to detail differences between DX5- and DX5+ liver NK cells in gene expression.
