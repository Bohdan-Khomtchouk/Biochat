SUMMARY
MDS patients are characterized as the deletion in chromosome 17. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from MDS fibroblasts. We performed SNP microarray analysis using Affymetrix axiom EUR array platform.

DESIGN
Affymetrix axiom EUR arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from MDS fibroblasts and iPSCs.
