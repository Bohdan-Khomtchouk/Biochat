TITLE
Functional genomics of acclimation and adaptation in response to thermal stress in Daphnia

ORGANISM
Daphnia pulex

SUMMARY
In this study we use nimblegen high-density arrays to examine gene expression regulation in a common-garden experiment varying thermal environments. We report genome-wide patterns of gene expression in two heat tolerant southern and two heat-sensitive northern clones of Daphnia pulex exposed to either optimal (18°C) or substressful (28°C) temperatures.

DESIGN
Four competitive hybridizations of heat tolerant clones BW102 (hereafter B) and KSP3 (hereafter K),  and heat sensitive clones EB1 (hereafter E) and CHQ3 (hereafter   C) in response to thermal stress of either 18 degrees Celcius (here after 18) or 28 degrees (hereafter 28) in a loop design where each hybridization was replicated four times with two dye-swaps nested in each set of replicates.
