TITLE
The structure of gene networks that constrain and promote diversification in Heliconius melpomene

ORGANISM
Heliconius melpomene malleti ; Heliconius melpomene plesseni

SUMMARY
Comparison of whole genome and tiled gene expression between different colour pattern races of H. melpomene in developing wings.

DESIGN
A total of 96 ds-cDNA samples labelled with Cy3 were hybridized onto 8 custom-designed Roche NimbleGen 12x135K format microarrays (Roche NimbleGen) for a total of 96 identical subarrays with 135,000 probes of 60 bp each and each hybridising a separate sample. The number of samples corresponded to two races, four stages and four tissue sections (forewing proximal, forewing distal, hindwing and eye), all of them with three independent replicates.
