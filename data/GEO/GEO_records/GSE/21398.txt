TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profile of flag leaf from fertile and sterile lines of rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To examine the role of formation of a strong sink during leaf senescence, we compared the expression profile of the flag leaf of three different sterile mutant lines with fertile plants. The fertile and sterile lines showed basically similar expression profiles of flag leaves sampled at the same time. However, the fertile lines showed more rapid and enhanced change in transcriptome as compared to the sterile lines indicating that leaf senescence initiated independent of sink formation and is accelerated by sink formation.
