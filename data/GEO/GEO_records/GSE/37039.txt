TITLE
Histone H3 K56 acetylation in wild-type histone shuffle strain (YBL574)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
ChIP-on chip assays to measure the change in histone H3 K56 acetylation over the yeast genome in wild-type YBL574 yeast strains compared to H3K36A mutant strains.

DESIGN
Two color experiment. Mutant vs WT cells. Biological replicates=3 per IP per cell type.

PLATFORM
