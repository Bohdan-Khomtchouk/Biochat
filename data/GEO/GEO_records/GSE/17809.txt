TITLE
DnaN overexpression does not affect replication in oriN cells

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
overexpressing DnaN did not affect the genomic DNA pattern in a strain that replicated form the plasmid origin of replication oriN and is deleted for the endogenous origin of replication oriC

DESIGN
Comparison of DNA profiles of strains before and after the overexpression of dnaN

PLATFORM
