TITLE
DNMT3B overexpression contributes to aberrant DNA methylation and MYC-driven tumor maintenance in T-ALL and Burkitt’s lymphoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed methylation profiling using RRBS-seq to investigate the role of DNMT3B in MYC-driven tumor maintenance. Comparing tumor cells before and upon DNMT3B knock-down revealed genome-wide changes in the DNA methylation pattern.

DESIGN
Samples used in this study correspond to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines derived from EμSRα-tTA;tet-o-MYC mice.

PLATFORM
GPL21493 Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Mus musculus)
