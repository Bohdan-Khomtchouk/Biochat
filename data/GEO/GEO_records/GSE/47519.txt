TITLE
Global miRNA expression status of human hematopoietic stem–progenitor cells modulates myelopoiesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated how suppression of the most upstream microRNA–processing RNase, Drosha, affects the differentiation of human CD34+ hematopoietic stem–progenitor cells (HSPCs). We hypothesized that knock-down of Drosha would alter blood lineage development by modulating the expression of microRNAs. Lentiviral delivery to HSPCs of a short-hairpin targeting Drosha resulted in a viable phenotype with promotion of myeloid, and especially monocytic, maturation and suppression of apoptosis. Our results show that Drosha deficiency triggered a parallel upregulation of components of the RNAi machinery, including DGCR8, Dicer and Ago2. Deep sequencing analyses revealed global miRNA deficiency after Drosha short-hairpin treatment with relative maintenance of mature miR-223 expression. Restoration of miR-223 to normal levels after Drosha knock-down further enhanced monocytic maturation concomitant with the modulation of myeloid transcription factors that promoted monocytic differentiation. Our results support a miRNA accentuation model in which relative enhancement of miR-223 increases levels of PU.1 thereby promoting monocytic differentiation.

DESIGN
CD34+ HSPCs were isolated from umbilical cord blood and transduced with an empty lentivector (EV) or a lentivector encoding a short-hairpin RNA targeting the pri-miRNA–processing enzyme, Drosha (shDrosha). EV and shDrosha transduced HSPCs were grown in liquid culture promoting myelopoiesis and sampled on days 0 and 7 for total RNA collection. Total RNA was size fractionated to enrich for the small RNA population and deep sequenced using ABI's SOLiD 4.0 platform.
