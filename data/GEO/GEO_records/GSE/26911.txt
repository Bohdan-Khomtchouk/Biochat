TITLE
Comparative gene expression profile  of Ngn3-overexpressing cultured hippocampal neurons vs the corresponding control populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of Ngn3-overexpressing cultured hippocampal neurons was compared to the profile of the corresponding control populations.  (neurons expressing GFP). Neurogenin3, a proneural transcription factor controlled by Notch receptor, is involved in hippocampal neuron differentiation and synapses, but little is known about the molecular bases of Ngn3 activity in neurons. Microarray analysis indicated that overexpression of Ngn3 upregulated a number of genes related with cytoskeleton dynamics. One of then was Fmn1 whose protein is associated with actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Overexpression of the isoform Fmn1-Ib in cultured hippocampal neurons induced an increase in the number of primary dendrites and in the number of glutamatergic synaptic inputs without affecting GABAergic synapses resulting in a modification in the balance between excitation and inhibition. The same changes were provoked by overexpression of Ngn3. In addition downregulation of Fmn1 by the use of Fmn1-siRNAs impaired such morphological and synaptic changes induced by Ngn3 overexpression in neurons. These results reveal a previously unknown involvement of Formin1 in dendritic and synaptic plasticity as a key protein in the Nng3 signaling pathway that contributes to understanding of molecular mechanisms of the neuronal differentiation.

DESIGN
Cultured hippocampal neurons were transduced using Sindbis virus bearing myc-tagged Ngn3 or GFP as control. Cells were lysed and total RNA was extracted.Gene expression profiles were obtained for each sample and compared
