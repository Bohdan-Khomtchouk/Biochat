TITLE
GAP aflR- vs WT timecourse

ORGANISM
Aspergillus flavus

SUMMARY
The carcinogen aflatoxin is synthesized by a cluster of genes that are regulated by the transcriptional factor, AflR.  Most, but not all of these genes, have a consensus binding site for AflR in their 5â€™ untranslated region.  Because aflR resides within the biosynthetic cluster, is has been suggested that it regulates only genes within the cluster.  The objective of this study was to identify those genes transcriptionally regulated by AflR and to determine if any of those genes reside outside the aflatoxin biosynthetic cluster.  To address this objective, we employed a cDNA microarray of 5,002 genes from Aspergillus flavus to monitor the expression of genes in a wild type and an aflR deletion strain of A. parasiticus.
