TITLE
Effect of LANA deletion on the host gene expression during de novo KSHV infection of SLK cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human SLK cells were infected with wildtype (wt) and LANA knockout (KO) Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), separately for 3 days. Cellular gene expression changes were identified upon the wild type and LANA KO KSHV virus infection compared to the uninfected SLK cells using the human gene expression microarray U133plus2.0.

DESIGN
2 independent biological replicates from uninfected SLK cells, wild type KSHV infected SLK cells at 72hrs post-infection (hpi) , and LANA KO infected SLK cells at 72 hrs post-infection were collected and RNA was prepared for microarray analysis.
