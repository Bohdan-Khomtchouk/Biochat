TITLE
Identification of Direct Targets of SND1 and VND7

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study was to find genes directly regulated by SND1 and VND7.

DESIGN
SND1XVE- or VND7XVE-expressing cells were treated with cycloheximide alone (control) or with cycloheximide plus estradiol (experimental) to identify genes directly activated by SND1 or VND7.
