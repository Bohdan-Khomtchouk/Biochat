TITLE
Identification of MKK3-dependent wounding-induced genes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra16-01_mkk3_wounding - identification of mkk3-dependent wounding-induced genes - Is MKK3 involved in the transcriptional regulation of wounding-induced genes? - Col and mkk3 KO plants were wounded with a forceps. Leaves were harvested 2h after the stress.

DESIGN
12 dye-swap - gene knock out, genotype comparison, normal vs transgenic comparison, treated vs untreated comparison

PLATFORM
GPL18904 Agilent-047069 CATMAv7 [Probe Name Version]
