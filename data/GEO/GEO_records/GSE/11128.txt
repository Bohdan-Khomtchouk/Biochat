ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Specification of germ cell fate is fundamental in development.  With a highly representative single-cell microarray and rigorous quantitative-PCR analysis, we defined the genome-wide transcription dynamics that create primordial germ cells (PGCs) from the epiblast, a process that exclusively segregates them from their somatic neighbors.  We also analyzed the effect of the loss of Blimp1, a key transcriptional regulator, on these dynamics.  Our analysis revealed that PGC specification involves complex, yet highly ordered regulation of a large number of genes, proceeding under the strong influence of mesoderm induction with active repression of specific programs such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, Hox gene activation, cell-cycle progression and DNA methyltransferase machinery.  Remarkably, Blimp1 is essential for repressing nearly all the genes normally down-regulated in PGCs relative to their somatic neighbors, whereas it is dispensable for the activation of approximately half of the genes up-regulated in PGCs.
