TITLE
Comparison of the gene expression profiles between iPS-OSH, iPS-J, ESC and MEF.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
iPS-OSH was the novel iPS cells generated from our lab, the microarray analysis was used for determining the gene expression profiles of iPS-OSH. iPS-J was provided from Dr. Yamanaka (Riken, APS0001). Microarray analysis was used to compare the difference of gene expression profiles in iPS-OSH, iPS-J, ESC and MEF.

DESIGN
The total RNA extracted from iPS-OSH, iPS-J, ESC and MEF was used for the microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profiles.
