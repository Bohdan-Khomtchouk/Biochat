TITLE
Expression analysis of proliferative phase Arabidopsis thaliana endosperm

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Laser capture microdissection (LCM) provides a useful method for isolating specific cells or tissues from biological samples. Here, we adapted microdissection protocols to allow high-resolution transcript analysis of different tissues from developing Arabidopsis seed. However, to obtain enough RNA for microarray analyses it was necessary to amplify the RNA. Microarray analyses, using endosperm derived RNA amplified by two-round IVT, reproducibly identified endosperm enriched marker genes. Keywords: LCM Endosperm Arabidopsis
