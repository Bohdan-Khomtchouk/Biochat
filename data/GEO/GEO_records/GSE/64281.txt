TITLE
Expression data for human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line HK1 stimulated with EGF or TGF-β recombinant protein.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As regulators in gene expression, microRNAs take part in most biological process including cell differentiation, apoptosis, cell cycle and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In order to evaluate their roles during the growth factors-induced EMT process, microRNA expression profile changes induced by EGF or TGF-β treatment on nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line HK-1 cells were analyzed by means of the Affymetrix genome wide microarray system.

DESIGN
Human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line HK-1 was starved for 12 hours before stimulation with EGF (50 ng/mL) or TGF-β (10ng/ml) or Control (PBS) for 36 hours in RPMI-1640 medium (with 1% serum) to establish the in vitro model of EMT. Total RNA were extracted and detected by Affymetrix® GeneChip® miRNA Arrays.
