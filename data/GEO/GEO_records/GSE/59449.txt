TITLE
Expression data from MCF7 breast epithelial cells in normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
G9a is able to silence gene expression in hypoxic condition by increasing histone H3K9me2. We have identified a set of genes that are negatively regulated by G9a in hypoxia-dependent manner. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from MCF7 breast epithelial cells that have been transfected with control (WT) or G9a shRNAs (KD) and exposed to either normoxia or hypoxia. These data are used to obtain 829 genes that are differentially expressed in response to hypoxia, and 205 genes that are sentisive to G9a level.

DESIGN
4 samples were analysed. We generated comparisons between WT and KD in normoxic as well as hypoxic condition. Genes differentially expressed in hypoxic condition were selected followed by selection of genes that lose this differential expression upon G9a knockdown.
