TITLE
Gene transcription in ovine fetal perirenal adipose tissue.

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was used to measure the levels of  gene transcription in perirenal adipose tissue in late gestation sheep fetuses (~ 2 weeks before birth). Through the discovery of SNP in the population, allele specific expression was identified.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of perirenal adipose tissue from sheep fetuses at 132 days of gestation (132 d post conception (dpc); term =150Â±3d)   were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing platform. Samples from 18 animals  were analysed.
