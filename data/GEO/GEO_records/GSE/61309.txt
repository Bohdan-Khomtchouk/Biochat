TITLE
Transcriptomics modifications in inner stem tissues of the flax lignified bast fiber mutant1 (lbf1)

ORGANISM
Linum usitatissimum

SUMMARY
Comparison of whole genome transcriptomics between stem inner tissues from flax lignified bast fiber mutant1 (lbf1) and wild-type

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from inner stem tissues of 3 wt and 6 lbf1 mutant flax plants harvested at vegetative stage and used to evaluate differences in transcript accumulation potentially associated with the mutant phenotype

PLATFORM
GPL19181 Agilent-045382 UGSF flax 45K v1.0
