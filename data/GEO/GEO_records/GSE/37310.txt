TITLE
Insecticide resistance mechanisms Myzus persicae: Genotypes Insecticide vs. Genotypes Control

ORGANISM
Myzus persicae

SUMMARY
Transcripcional responses in three genotypes of Muzus persicae, each exhibiting different resistance mechanisms, in response to an anti.cholinesterase insecticide

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment in threee different genotypes: Insecticide vs. acetone plus water. Genotypes S (exhibiting no resistance mechanism) Biological replicates: 3. Genotypes RS (resistant through a kdr sodium channel mutation) Biological replicates: 2.  Genotypes MR (carrying kdr and MACE mutations) Biological replicates: 2.
