TITLE
Differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression between obese African Americans and Hispanic Youths

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Obesity is a major risk factor for several chronic diseases including diabetes, fatty liver disease and cancer. Despite similar propensities for obesity, Hispanics and African Americans exhibit unique and distinct differences in obesity related outcomes such as greater risk of, obesity-related cancers in AA and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Hispanics. This study was aimed to determine whether differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) gene expression in obese, Hispanic and AA young adults might explain ethnic differences in obesity-related phenotypes.
