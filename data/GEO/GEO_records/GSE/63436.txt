TITLE
Comparison of gene expression changes in Streptococcus pyogenes in the presence of zinc

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
Manuscript title: Zinc disrupts central carbon metabolism and capsule biosynthesis in Streptococcus pyogenes. Macrophages and neutrophils release free zinc to eliminate phagocytosed bacterial pathogens. The study investigates the effect of how zinc toxicity affects Streptococcus pyogenes. Therefore, a microarray analysis was performed in S. pyogenes cells to determine gene expression changes when exposed to high levels of zinc. We discovered that a pathway involved in tagatose-6-phosphate metabolism was upregulated when the cells are under zinc stress.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of each condition tested were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL10822 JCVI PFGRC Streptococcus pyogenes 21K v2 array designed primarily based on strain MGAS5005
