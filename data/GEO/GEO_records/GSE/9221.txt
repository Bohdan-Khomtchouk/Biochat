TITLE
Genome-Wide Transcriptional Responses of Nitrosomonas europaea to cadmium

ORGANISM
Nitrosomonas europaea

SUMMARY
Heavy metals have been postulated as significant nitrification inhibitor in wastewater treatment plant. The effect of heavy metals such as Cd2+, Cu2+ and Hg2+ to nitrifying bacterium, Nitrosomonas europaea, was studied in pseudo-steady state batch reactor. Under incubation of Nitrosomonas europaea with 1 ?M CdCl2 for 1 hour, transcripts for 66 of 2460 genes were found at high level, yet transcripts of 50 genes were found at low level. Mercury resistance genes (merACDPT) showed 277-fold up regulation. Keywords: cadmium, stress response, global transcription, mercury resistance genes, merA,

DESIGN
The 1 uM CdCl2 caused more than 50 % inhibition in physiological response for 1 hour incubation. Transcriptional levels of the cells inhibited by cadmium were compared with the cells under control condition.
