TITLE
Signaling Role of Acetoacetate in Accelerating Muscle Regeneration and Ameliorating Muscular Dystrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Acetoacetate (AA) is a ketone body and acts as a fuel to supply energy for cellular activity of various tissues. Here, we performed differential RNA-Seq analyses of proliferating and differentiating C2C12 myoblasts in the present or absent of AA. Differentially regulated genes and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that altered expression of the AA-mediated genes in both GM (growth medium) and DM (differentiation medium) were highly enriched in the signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation and differentiation, however, the genes encoding enzymes in biochemical pathways of ketolysis for energy production were not transcriptionally changed in the cells cultured in either GM or DM in response to AA. Notably the genes differentially expressed between GM and DM were also significantly regulated by AA. This indicates that AA-mediated myogenic cell function by transcriptional regulation of the genes required for cell proliferation and differentiation. Taken together, the data from our multi-parameter analyses consistently support the notion that AA plays a non-metabolic role in regulating muscle cell function.

DESIGN
We sequenced mRNA from C2C12 cells in GM or DM treated with AA for 12 h or not to generate genes response to AA during C2C12 proliferation and differentiation. Three of duplication was performed. Examination of mRNA levels in proliferating or differentiating C2C12 cells between AA-treated groups and control groups.
