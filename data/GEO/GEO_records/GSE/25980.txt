TITLE
In vitro and in vivo analysis of hypoxic gene expression in rat gliomas

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In vivo profiling of hypoxic gene expression in gliomas using the hypoxia marker EF5 and laser-capture microdissection We have employed the hypoxia marker EF5 coupled with laser capture microdissection to isolate RNA from viable hypoxic and normoxic regions of 9L experimental gliomas.

DESIGN
We report the identification of the hypoxic gene expression profile in a solid tumor using a prototypical hypoxia marker EF5, Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) and Microarray Gene Expression Profiling (EF5-LCM-MGEP). We have utilized LCM to isolate total RNA from normoxic and hypoxic regions in the rat 9L glioma tumor model grown in its isogenic host (Fischer rat). Microarray analysis of the isolated RNA generated an in vivo hypoxia expression profile. For comparison, we also analyzed RNA samples isolated from rat 9L glioma cells in culture exposed to hypoxia or normoxia.
