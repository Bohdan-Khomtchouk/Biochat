TITLE
TRNP1 regulates expansion and folding of the mammalian cerebral cortex by control of radial glial fate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Evolution of the mammalian brain encompassed a remarkable increase in size of cerebral cortex, including tangential and radial expansion, but the mechanisms underlying these key parameters are still largely unknown. Here, we identified the novel DNA associated protein TRNP1 as a regulator of cerebral cortical expansion in both these dimensions. Gain and loss of function experiments in the mouse cerebral cortex in vivo demonstrate that high Trnp1 levels promote neural stem cell self-renewal and tangential expansion, while lower levels promote radial expansion resulting in a potent increase in the generation of intermediate progenitors and outer radial glial cells resulting in folding of the otherwise smooth murine cerebral cortex. Remarkably, TRNP1 expression levels exhibit regional differences also in the cerebral cortex of human fetuses anticipating radial or tangential expansion respectively. Thus, the dynamic regulation of TRNP1 is critical to regulate tangential and radial expansion of the cerebral cortex  in mammals.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression microarray analysis on embryonic mouse cerebral cortex derived from Trnp1 knockdown and control animals.
