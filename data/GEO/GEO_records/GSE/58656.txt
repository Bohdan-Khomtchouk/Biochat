TITLE
A Myc-driven self-reinforcing regulatory network maintains mouse embryonic stem cell identity (BeadChip)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We address the molecular mechanisms through which Myc supports mESC identity, by performing gene expression profile analyses of Myc- and LIF-maintained ESCs, together with Epiblast Stem Cell (EpiSC), as a control for a primed state of stemness. We then investigated whether the Myc-driven self-reinforcing circuit, installed in Myc-dependent ESCs, could support the maintenance of ES cell identity in absence of the originating stimulus, namely the MycER activation achieved by OHT stimulation. To this end, we derived ESCs from Myc-dependent cells, following MycER inactivation upon withdrawal of OHT and profile their gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from LIF-, Myc- and -Myc-ESCs at the indicated passages were processed to profile gene expression by microarray analysis.  Gene-expression profiling was also perfomed on EpiSC as control for primed stem cell state.
