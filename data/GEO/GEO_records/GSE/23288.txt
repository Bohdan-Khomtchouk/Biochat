TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Cymelarsan resistant and Cymelarsan sensitive strains of Trypanosoma brucei.

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma brucei brucei

SUMMARY
A drug sensitive stock of T.b.brucei (STIB247) was used to generate a drug resistant strain (247MelCyR), expressing  130-fold increase in resistance to the melaminophenyl arsenical Cymelarsan (MelCy) by subcurative treatment in mice. Expression of the Cymelarsan resistant phenotype was maintained in 247MelCyR following adaptation to procyclic form in vitro culture. Here we have compared the transcriptomes of the STIB247 and 247MelCyR strains from procyclic cell culture, using digital gene expression (DGE) analysis.

DESIGN
Digital gene expression analysis was performed on RNA derived from 2 biological replicates each of Cymelarsan resistant (247MelCyR) and Cymelarsan sensitive (STIB 247), T.b.brucei procyclic cell culture.
