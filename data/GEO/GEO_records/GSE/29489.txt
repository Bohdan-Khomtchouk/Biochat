TITLE
ChIP-chip of BMP2 or control treated human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with anti-beta-catenin or anti-ppar-gamma antibodies on promoter regions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reduced bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR)2 expression in patients with pulmonary arterial (PA) hypertension (PAH), can impair PA endothelial cell (EC) function. We now characterize, in human PAECs, a novel BMPR2-mediated transcriptionally active complex between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma and beta-catenin (BC), and show that disruption of this complex impairs BMP mediated HPAEC survival. Using whole genome wide ChIP-Chip promoter analysis we delineate PPARG-BC dependent transcription of target genes that include apelin.

DESIGN
Comparison of ppar-gamma and beta-catenin occupancy on promoter regions from human pulmonary artery endothelial cells after either treatment with BMP2 (10ng/ml) or control. A total of 8 samples were created using NimbleGen human HG18 promoter arrays.
