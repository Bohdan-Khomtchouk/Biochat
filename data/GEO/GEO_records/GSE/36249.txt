TITLE
Affymetrix Cotton Genome  array expression data of root tissue of Gossypium herbaceum under drought stress and watered condition

ORGANISM
Gossypium barbadense

SUMMARY
Genome-wide Transcriptional Analysis of Genes Associated with Drought Stress in Gossypium herbaceum root This experiment was designed to investigate the molecular mechanism associated with drought tolerance in root tissue of Gossypium herbaceum. The gene expression profiles of the root tissue using Affymetrix Cotton Genome Array were compared with drought tolerant and drought sensitive genotype of G.herbaceum under drought stress and watered condition. Many genes in various molecular function or biological processes were over- or under-represented between drought tolerant and sensitive genotype, suggesting various molecular mechanism and biochemical pathways are interlinked and tolerant genotype have developed multiple mechanisms as an adaptory behavior against drought stress.
