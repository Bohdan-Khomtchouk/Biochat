TITLE
Characterization of small RNAs and their targets in Amborella trichopoda

ORGANISM
Amborella trichopoda

SUMMARY
The small RNAs and their targets were characterized in Amborella genome by deep sequencing the small RNA populations of leaf tissue and opened-female flower tissue. The small RNA targets were also validated from degradome populations of leaf tissue and opened-female flower tissue.

DESIGN
We generated integrative maps of small RNA profiles (sRNA-seq) and degradome (PARE-seq) profiles to characterize the miRNAs and their targets from Amborella.
