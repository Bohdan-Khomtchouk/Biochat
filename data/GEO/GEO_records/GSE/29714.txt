TITLE
Comprehensive Analysis of mRNA Methylation Reveals Enrichment in 3' UTRs and Near Stop Codons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here, we use a novel technique for locating regions of N6-adenosine methylation (m6A) throughout the transcriptome and present a profile of m6A sites in the mouse brain. Our use of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation combined with RNA-seq (MeRIP-Seq) identifies thousands of RNAs which contain m6A sites. In addition, we find that regions of m6A formation are particularly enriched near stop codons, which might provide clues into the potential funciton of this highly prevalent RNA modificaiton.

DESIGN
Examination of m6A sites in murine brain RNA and human embryonic kidney cells.
