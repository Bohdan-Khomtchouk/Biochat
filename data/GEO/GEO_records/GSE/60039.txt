TITLE
Commensal bacteria protect against food allergen sensitization

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Analysis of colonic epithelial cell gene expression in germ-free, Bacteroides uniformis-colonized, and Clostridia-colonized gnotobiotic mice. Bacteria were isolated from our SPF mouse facility and were used to selectively colonize germ-free mice.

DESIGN
Germ free mice were left germ free or were colonized with Bacteroides uniformis or a consortium of Clostridia. Total RNA was extraced from colonic epithelial cells.
