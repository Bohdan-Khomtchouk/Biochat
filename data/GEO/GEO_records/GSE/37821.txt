TITLE
The H3K27 demethylase Utx facilitates somatic and germ cell epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pluripotency can be induced in somatic cells by ectopic expression of defined transcription factors, however the identity of epigenetic regulators driving the progression of cellular reprogramming requires further investigation. Here we uncover a non-redundant role for the JmjC-domain-containing protein histone H3 methylated Lys 27 (H3K27) demethylase Utx, as a critical regulator for the induction, but not for the maintenance, of primed and na√Øve pluripotency in mice and in humans. Utx depletion results in aberrant H3K27me3 repressive chromatin demethylation dynamics, which subsequently hampers the reactivation of pluripotency promoting genes during reprogramming. Remarkably, Utx deficient primordial germ cells (PGCs) display a cell autonomous aberrant epigenetic reprogramming in vivo during their embryonic maturation, resulting in the lack of functional contribution to the germ-line lineage.

DESIGN
H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 were measured genome-wide in the following cell types:  Utx+/Y (WT) and Utx-/Y (KO) mouse ES cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) before and after DOX induction (initiating reprogramming by OSKM factors).
