TITLE
Gene expression profile of two colorectal cancer HT29 and DLD-1 cell lines cultivated in 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional cell culture enriched with laminin rich extracellular matrix proteins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Conventional monolayer cell cultures used in cancer research accumulated basic knowledge of carcinogenesis which correlates with basic observations in tumor biology. Nevertheless, attempts to transfer accumulated cancer biology knowledge to clinical applications fails in most of the cases. Gathered data suggest that 2D cell culture models lack many features of tumor tissue in vivo. Although it has been demonstrated that cancer cells are generally more resistant to various types of treatments when cultured in extracellular matrix (ECM) based 3D cultures it is not clear if this phenomenon is attributed to the ECM dependent gain of function or the loss of non-physiological cellular state demonstrated while cultured at 2D conditions. To address the question of which universal molecular mechanisms if any are gained/lost in ECM-dependent manner we carried out genome wide gene expression analysis of human colorectal carcinoma DLD-1 and HT-29 cell lines cultured in 2D or ECM based 3D conditions.
