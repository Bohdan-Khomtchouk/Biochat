TITLE
Type IV pili promote early biofilm formation by Clostridium difficile

ORGANISM
Clostridioides difficile R20291

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of Clostridium difficile R20291 in biofilm formation, planktonic state and grown on blood agar

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed on Clostridium difficile R20291 in three different conditions: Biofilm formation, plantonic state and grown on blood agar plates. Each condtion has 3 replicates.
