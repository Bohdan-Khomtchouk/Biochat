TITLE
The BTK Inhibitor CC-292 shows activity in Mantle Cell Lymphoma and synergizes with Lenalidomide and NIK Inhibitors depending on NFÎºB mutational status

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mantle Cell lymphoma (MCL) were treated with the BTK inhibitor 1mM CC-292 for 48h We used microarrays to uncover the mechanisms underlying CC-292 activity in Mantle Cell lymphoma (MCL)

DESIGN
Global RNA expression was done in two MCL cell lines treated in vitro with CC-292 for 48h
