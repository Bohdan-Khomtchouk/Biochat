TITLE
Natural variation in gene expression between normal human individuals studies using Hu2304 cDNA arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hu2304 arrays have been printed on aminosilane glass slides using 50% DMSO as the spotting solution (Quackenbush protocol; chapter 4). It has 2304 gene probes (including positive and negative controls) printed in duplicates. The probes for this array were primarily selected from the 384 well plates that contained maximum representation of genes expressed in blood (based on EST information). Keywords: Studying natural variation

DESIGN
Eleven normal human individuals with a wider age group of 10-58 years were recruited . These eleven individuals comprised of four male individuals (M9, M22, M182, M185), three female individuals (F15, F183, F184) and a dizygotic female twin pair (F18, F19). Eight pair wise comparisons (somewhat randomly without loop strategy due to sample limitations) were carried out between these ten individuals using Hu2304 arrays including seven pair wise comparisons between unrelated individuals (M9:M182, F15:F183, F15:F184, F15:M185, F18:M22, F18:M23 and F19:F24) and one pair wise comparison between dizygotic female twin pair (F18:F19).
