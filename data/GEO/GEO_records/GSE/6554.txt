TITLE
Natural variation in gene expression between normal human individuals studies using Hu2304 cDNA arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hu2304 arrays have been printed on aminosilane glass slides using 50% DMSO as the spotting solution (Quackenbush protocol; chapter 4). It has 2304 gene probes (including positive and negative controls) printed in duplicates. The probes for this array were primarily selected from the 384 well plates that contained maximum representation of genes expressed in blood (based on EST information). Keywords: Studying natural variation
