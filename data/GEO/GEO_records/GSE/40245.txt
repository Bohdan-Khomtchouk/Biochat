TITLE
Identification of glucose-TOR signaling early target genes in Arabidopsis seedling autotrophic transition stage

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to explore the molecular network of glucose-TOR signaling in Arabidopsis seedling autotrophic transition stage. We used the whole-genome microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression mediated by glucose and TOR.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis WT and estradiol inducible RNAi-tor seedlings were germinated in low light condition for 3 days to deplete seed nutrient supply. Fifteen mM glucose was adding back to reactivate the quiescent seedlings and the samples were harvested for RNA isolation.  Transcript profiles were analyzed and compared between with and without glucose treatment to identify early glucose-TOR target genes. Each experimental condition was repeated three times and total 12 samples were generated.
