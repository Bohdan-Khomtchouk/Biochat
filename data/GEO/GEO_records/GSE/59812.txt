TITLE
Gene expression profile of glycolaldehdye-treated yeast cells vs glycolaldehdye-nontreated cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of yeast under the glycolaldehdye stress (newly discovered fermentation inhibitor) was evaluated in the experiment

DESIGN
Two-condition design, 10 mM glycolaldehdye-treated and nontreated yeast cells, three replicates were run for each condition

PLATFORM
GPL9294 Agilent-015072 Yeast Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Probe Name version)
