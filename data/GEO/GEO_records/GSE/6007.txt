TITLE
Comparison of miRNA profile of Foxp3-transduced activated T cells with control vector-transduced activated T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Activated T cells were transduced with either Foxp3-IRES-GFP or IRES-GFP control vector. Low molecular weight RNA from cells was extracted 72h or 96h later and hybridised to microarrays containing oligonucleotide probes corresponding to known miRNA sequences. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Four arrays representing two timepoints dyeswaps of each.

PLATFORM
