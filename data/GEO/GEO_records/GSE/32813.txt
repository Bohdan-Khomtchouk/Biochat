ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3719 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Gary Karpen. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: The goal of these experiments are to validate and confirm the locations of 125 chromosomal proteins across the Drosophila melanogaster genome. To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual non-histone chromosomal proteins in Drosophila BG3 and S2 tissue culture cells, and then using antibodies to perform Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) using genomic tiling arrays. Comparison of a protein factor's binding profiles before and after depletion will increase the confidence of our predictions. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf
