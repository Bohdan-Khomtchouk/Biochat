TITLE
The yeast PP2A-CDC55 phosphatase regulates the transcriptional response to hyperosmolarity stress by regulating Msn2 and Msn4 [Time course 1]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The yeast PP2A-Cdc55 Serine/Threonine phosphatase regulates transcription under certain conditions. It is required for full activation of the environmental stress response mediated by the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4. PP2A-Cdc55 contributes to sustained nuclear accumulation of Msn2 and Msn4 and extended chromatin recruitment under stress conditions such as hyperosmolarity stress. Transcript profiles of Msn2 and Msn4 double mutants are similar to cdc55 and the corresponding triple mutants. This argues for a Msn2/4 specific function of PP2A-Cdc55.

DESIGN
Time course of 10 20 and 30 minutes hyperosmolarity treated yeast cells of wild type (W303), msn2msn4, cdc55, msn2msn4cdc55 genetic background.
