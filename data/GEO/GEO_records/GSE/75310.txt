TITLE
DNA Methylation in PRDM8 is a Biomarker for Dyskeratosis Congenita

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) is characterized by impaired telomere maintenance and reveals clinical features of premature aging. So far, diagnosis of DKC relies particularly on telomere length screening raising the need for additional biomarkers. In this study, we analysed global DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of DKC patients. Age-associated DNAm changes were not generally accelerated in DKC. However, we observed significant hypermethylation in the gene for PR domain containing 8 (PRDM8). Notably, the same genomic region revealed hypermethylation in aplastic anemia (AA), and Down syndrome (DS), indicating that there might be an association with premature aging syndromes. Site-specific analysis of DNAm level in PRDM8 with pyrosequencing and MassArray validated aberrant hypermethylation in 14 DKC patients and 27 AA patients. Notably, telomere length was not directly correlated with DNAm in PRDM8, indicating that the two methods are complementary. In conclusion, DNAm at PRDM8 provides a new biomarker to support diagnosis of of AA and DKC.
