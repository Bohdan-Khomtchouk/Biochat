TITLE
Expression data of human tonsilar CD4 positive T cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells are one of the regulatory T cell subsets that are characterized by the production of high amount of IL-10 and lack of FOXP3 expression. Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) is a CD4 homologue molecule and we have previously reported that LAG3 is expressed on IL-10 producing regulatory T cells. However, naturally occurring Tr1 cells in human secondary lymphoid tissue have not been detected. We identified CD4+CD25-LAG3+ T cells in human tonsil. We compared mRNA expression of five CD4+ T cell subsets in tonsil using microarray analysis (CD4+CD25-LAG3+ T cells, CD4+CD25-CXCR5+PD-1+ follicular helper T cells (TFH), CD4+CD25+ T cells, CD4+CD25-LAG3-CD45RO+ cells and CD4+CD25-LAG3-CD45RO- cells).

DESIGN
A human tonsil was obtained from a patient undergoing routine tonsillectomy, and five tonsillar CD4+ T cell subsets were sorted (each 1 x 10^5 cells). There is no biological replication.
