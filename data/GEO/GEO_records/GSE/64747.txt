TITLE
Mode of action analysis: Distinct Staphylococcus aureus transcriptome changes upon antivirulence hydroxy amide treatment

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the antivirulent hydroxy amide (R*,R*)-3 mode of action, next generation sequencing was applied to analyze the transcriptome of NCTC 8325 cells treated with either compound or DMSO as control.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates for compound treated and also two biological replicates for DMSO treated Staphylococcus aureus cultures were analysed.
