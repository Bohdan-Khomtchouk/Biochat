TITLE
GATA3 restrains Notch signaling activity and represses NK cell development to induce human T cell commitment following Notch-induced T-lineage specification (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The stepwise conversion of multipotent precursors into committed T-cell progenitors depends on several transcriptional regulators, but the interplay between these factors is still obscure. This is particularly true in human since the core early Notch signalling pathway also supports NK cell development and requires tight regulation for efficient T-lineage commitment and differentiation. Here, we show that GATA3, in contrast to TCF1, induces T-lineage commitment following NOTCH1-induced T-lineage specification through direct regulation of at least 3 distinct processes: repression of NK-cell fate, activation of T-lineage genes to promote further differentiation, and downmodulation of Notch signalling activity. GATA3-mediated repression of the NOTCH1 target gene DTX1 hereby is essential to induce T-lineage commitment at the expense of NK cell differentiation. Thus, human T-lineage commitment is dependent on the precise collaboration of several transcriptional regulators that integrate through both positive and negative regulatory loops.
