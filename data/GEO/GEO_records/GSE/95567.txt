TITLE
In vivo probing of nascent RNA structures reveals principles of cotranscriptional folding

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Defining the in vivo folding pathway of cellular RNAs is essential to understand how they reach their final native conformation. We here introduce a novel method, named Structural Probing of Elongating Transcripts (SPET-seq), that permits single-base resolution analysis of transcription intermediates’ secondary structures on a transcriptome-wide scale, enabling base-resolution analysis of the RNA folding events. Our results suggest that cotranscriptional RNA folding in vivo is a mixture of cooperative folding events, in which local RNA secondary structure elements are formed as they get transcribed, and non-cooperative events, in which 5΄-halves of long-range helices get sequestered into transient non-native interactions until their 3΄ counterparts have been transcribed. Together our work provides the first transcriptome-scale overview of RNA cotranscriptional folding in a living organism.
