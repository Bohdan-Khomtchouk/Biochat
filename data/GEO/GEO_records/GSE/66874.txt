TITLE
Expression data of the BMDMs from GPS2 WT and MKO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders like insulin resistance and diabetes. We previously identified GPS2 as a clinical relavant repressor of metaflammation. No animal KO models were used to study its physiological function in vivo. The role of GPS2 in macrophage activation and inflammation is also largely unknown. Here we developed a GPS2 myeloid specific KO mice to study the regulation of GPS2 in macrophage inflammation.  We found GPS2 ablation was linked with significant upregulation in inflammation markers in BMDMs from this array.

DESIGN
WT and GPS2 KO BMDMs were differentiated and cultured. Total mRNA was extracted from unstimulated BMDM (n=3 in each group) and hybridized on affymetrix microarrays.
