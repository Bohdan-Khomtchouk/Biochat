TITLE
Gene expression profile related to rice internode growth under two nitrogen management practices

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the gene expression profile related to rice internode growth under different nitrogen management practices, Agilent two color microarray chips were used to profile the differentially expressed genes of rice first internode between two nitrogen management. A rice cultivars Yin-Jing-Ruan-Zhan was used as material. First basal internode of YJRZ was taken at 30 days after transplanting, and RNA was extracted for microarray assay. Materials from OPT were label by Cy5 and FFP by Cy3.

DESIGN
Two nitrogen management practice treatments were applied in the main field: the farmersâ€™ N-fertilizer management practice (FFP treatment) and optimized nitrogen applicationapproach (OPT treatment). Two channels microarray assays were conducted between rice first nodes from OPT and FFP.
