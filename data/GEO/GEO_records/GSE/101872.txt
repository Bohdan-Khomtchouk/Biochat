TITLE
RNA Missplicing in Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq splicing data from the corneal endothelia of FECD patients and controls reveal hundreds of differential alternative splicing events. These include events previously characterized in the context of myotonic dystrophy type 1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as well as splicing changes in genes related to proposed mechanisms of FECD pathogenesis

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was used to compare corneal endothelial specimens from subjects with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy and control subjects

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
