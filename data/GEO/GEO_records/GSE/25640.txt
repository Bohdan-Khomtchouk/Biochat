TITLE
Expression data from wild type or FIZZ2 knockout murine lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the possible fibrotic role of FIZZ2, bleomycin was used to induce pulmonary fibrosis in wild type and FIZZZ2 knockout mice, lungs were then harvested and processed for RNA isolation. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression regulated by FIZZ2 during fibrotic process.

DESIGN
Bleomycin/saline treated wild type or FIZZ2 knockout lungs at day 21 post injection were harvested for RNA isolation and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
