TITLE
The dose-dependent role of PU.1 in Myeloid differentiation [small RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A doxycycline-inducible system was used to induce PU.1 expression in cultured myeloid cell lines. The parent cell line used was BN (Kamath et al., Leukemia 22:1214-1225, 2008). Induction of PU.1 expression was previously demonstrated to lead to cell cycle exit and decreased expression of cell cycle genes. The goal of this study is expression profiling of small RNAs in cells with reduced or elevated PU.1 expression.

DESIGN
MiRNA expression profilers were generated by sequencing small RNAs from uninduced cells (3) and cells induced with 1000 ng/ml doxycycline for 72 hours (3). Reads were aligned to MirBase and differential expression determined using DeSeq2.
