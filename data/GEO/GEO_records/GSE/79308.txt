TITLE
PNAs-A15 effects on non-small cell lung cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profile of parental wild type non-small cell lung cancer, NCI-H460, and cancer stem cell-rich (CSC-rich) populations treated with PNAs-A15 for 6 h. Results provide the information that PNAs-A15, a peptide nucleic acid of A-repeats length 15 bp, suppressed up-regulated A-repeats containing genes in both parental wild type and CSC-rich cells.

DESIGN
In this study, we isolate cancer stem cell-rich (CSC-rich) population from a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, NCI-H460, by selectively propagating the cells in a spheroid culture condition. The parental wild type H460 and CSC-rich cells were maintained at 37Â°C in 5% CO2 under sterile conditions in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium. Cells were treated with PNAs-A15 in 6-well microplates for 6 h. Total RNA was isolated and hybridized on the HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip. The RNA expressions were evaluated.
