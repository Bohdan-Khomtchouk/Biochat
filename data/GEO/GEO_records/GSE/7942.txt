TITLE
Effect of atrazine and sucrose on xenobiotic tolerance in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs05-05_atrazine - effect of atrazine and sucrose on arabidopsis transcriptome - Growth in the presence of sucrose was shown to confer to Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, under conditions of in vitro culture, a very high level of tolerance to the herbicide atrazine and to other photosynthesis inhibitors (Sulmon et al., 2004). The CATMA investigation will be useful to reveal the gene networks implicated in the mechanisms of xenobiotics tolerance.  - Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) were surface-sterilized inbayrochlore/ethanol (1:1, v/v), rinsed in absolute ethanol and dried overnight. Germination and growth were carried out under axenic conditions in square Petri dishes. After seeds were sowed, Petri dishes were placed at 4degreeC for 48 h in order to break dormancy and homogenize germination, and then transferred to a control growth chamber at 22degreeC under a 16-h light period regime at 4500 lux for 4 weeks. Growth medium consisted of 0.8% (w/v) agar in 1x Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal salt mix (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) adjusted to pH 5.7. After 4 weeks of cultivation on vertical plates plantlets were transferred on fresh medium complemented or not with atrazine 10 uM and with sucrose 80mM or mannitol 80 mM which were directly added during preparation of agar-MS media prior to sterilisation. Atrazine was sterilized by microfiltration through 0.2 um cellulose acetate filters (Polylabo, Strasbourg, France) and then axenically added to melted agar-MS medium prior to pouring into Petri dishes. Then plantlets were harvested after 24 hours of transfer and extracted for RNA. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
