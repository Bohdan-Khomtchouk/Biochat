TITLE
Chromatin interaction map of promoters of a human lymphoblastoid cell line using capture in situ Hi-C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated an interaction map using capture in situ Hi-C in human LCL

DESIGN
One sample of a human LCL was grown. In situ Hi-C was performed and the sequencing library was captured using 120 RNA probes.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
