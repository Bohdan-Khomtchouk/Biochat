TITLE
Molecular mechanisms underlying the development of Sonic Hedgehog subtype medulloblastoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Medulloblastoma (MB) is a highly malignant primary brain tumor that originates from the cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs) in the cerebellum or posterior fossa. The overactivation of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signal pathway accounts for the occurrence of 30% clinical cases of MB. Shh engagement with the inhibitory receptor Patched 1 derepresses the second receptor, Smoothened (Smo), and thereby activates the Gli transcriptional factors, allowing for the expression of a cohort of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of Shh signaling-driven carcinogenesis, e.g. the Gli target genes that play pivotal roles in the transformation of CGNPs, remain largely unknown. To screen for the genes involved in the development of Shh subtype MB, we attempt to analyze genes differentially expressed between CGNPs and MB cells, which will hopefully provide clues for the elucidation of key molecular events that mediate the onset of this specific type of nervous system malignancy.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, the transgenic mice that express a constitutively active Smo in cerebellar granule cells [C57BL/6-Tg(Neurod2-Smo*A1)199Jols/J, Jackson Laboratory stock #: 008831] were used as a model for MB. The tumors were dissected from 4-month-old mice and cells were dissociated and used as MB samples. Meanwhile, CGNPs were isolated from the same strain of newborn mice (4 to 6-day-old). Three cases of paired MB and CGNP cells were subjected to microarray analysis of gene expression profiles using the Agilent Arraystar Mouse LncRNA Microarray V3.0.
