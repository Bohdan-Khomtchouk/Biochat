TITLE
Expression data from Pin1 KO and WT mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The prolyl isomerase PIN1 has been identified as a regulator of phosphorylation signalling that catalyses the conversion of specific phosphorylated motifs between the two completely distinct conformations in a subset of proteins. PIN1 regulates diverse cellular processes, including growth-signal responses, cell-cycle progression, cellular stress responses, neuronal function and immune responses. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and neuron cells (NCs) in Pin1 KO and WT mice

DESIGN
Lin-MECs and NCs from two pairs of three month old Pin1 KO and WT littermates were analyzed. Microarray expression profiles were collected using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Expression Array 430A.

PLATFORM
