TITLE
Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Innate immune cells control acute eosinophilic lung inflammation induced by cystein proteases. Here we characterize the dynamic change of gene expression profile in basophils, natural helper cells and eosinophils during lung inflammation via cystein protease

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in individual cell populations, basophils, natural helper cells and eosinophils of the lung from na√Øve mice and papain treated mice.

PLATFORM
GPL18480 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Mus musculus)
