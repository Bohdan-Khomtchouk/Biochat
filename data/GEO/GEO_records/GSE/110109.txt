TITLE
Gene expression profile of SoNar-high and SoNar-low fetal liver blood cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To dissect the metabolic state of fetal liver HSCs, we have developed a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor (SoNar) for tracking cytosolic NADH and NAD+ redox states and constructed the transgenic mouse. Based on the NADH/NAD+ ratio, we have sorted SoNar-high and SoNar-low fetal liver blood cells to employ whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to regulate fetal liver HSC metabolism.

DESIGN
SoNar-high and SoNar-low two population blood cells from E13.5 fetal liver were sorted to measure gene expression.

PLATFORM
