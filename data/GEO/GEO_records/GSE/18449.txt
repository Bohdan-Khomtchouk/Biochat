SUMMARY
affy_hypoctemp_medicago - The characterization of several genotypes of the model Legume Medicago truncatula showed a genetic variability for germination and hypocotyl heterotrophic growth at low temperature and optimal temperature. The most important contrast was between the accessions Jemalong A17 and F83005.5. In order to find genes differently expressed between temperatures and genotypes, the present work focuses on transcriptome profiling during hypocotyl heterotrophic growth under low (10°C) and optimal (20°C) temperature conditions for both genotypes. We used Jemalong A17 and F83005.5 seeds coming from the Medicago truncatula Biological Resource Center in Montpellier, produced in 2006. Experiments were performed in the dark to mimic pre-emergence growth. Pots (6.5 cm diameter, 10 cm high) were incubated in growth chambers either at 10°C or 20°C. They were filled with 500g sand and 100ml of a nutrient solution for young seedlings growth (Saglio and Pradet, 1980). Per pot, five scarified seeds were sown at 1.5 cm depth. Seedlings were harvested at three times: 35°Cd (degree day), 50°Cd and 100°Cd. At each timepoint, about 50 seedlings were harvested and hypocotyl lengths was measured. Hypocotyl were cut and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extractions.
