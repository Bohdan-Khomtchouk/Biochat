TITLE
Gene expression response in roots of Medicago truncatula mutants treated with Myc LCOs

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
Legumes interact with soil fungi, leading to the development of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) roots. Diffusible AM fungal signals were identified as sulphated and non-sulphated LCOs (sMyc-LCOs and nsMyc-LCOs). Applying Myc-LCOs on roots of symbiotic mutants, we used GeneChips to detail the global programme of gene expression in these mutants in response to the external application of Myc-LCOs.
