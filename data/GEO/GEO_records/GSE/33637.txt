TITLE
Gene expression response in roots of Medicago truncatula mutants treated with Myc LCOs

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Legumes interact with soil fungi, leading to the development of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) roots. Diffusible AM fungal signals were identified as sulphated and non-sulphated LCOs (sMyc-LCOs and nsMyc-LCOs). Applying Myc-LCOs on roots of symbiotic mutants, we used GeneChips to detail the global programme of gene expression in these mutants in response to the external application of Myc-LCOs.

DESIGN
To harvest tissues for transcriptome profiling, three biological replicates consisting of 10 plantlets per treatment were selected. After 6 h of incubation in the climate chamber, 10 plantlets per batch were removed from the treatment (Myc-LCOs) or control solutions and harvested. During harvest, one mm of the root tip of each plantlet was removed and discarded. The remaining 2 to 2.5 cm of the distal root region were cut off and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen.
