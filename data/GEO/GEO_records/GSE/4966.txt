TITLE
Sugarcane transcriptome - Phosphate starvation

ORGANISM
Saccharum hybrid cultivar SP80-3280

SUMMARY
Rooted sugarcane plantlets, originated from in vitro meristem culture (genotype SP80-3280, CTC, Brazil), were greenhouse acclimatized by initial cultivation on 1/20th strength Hoagland and Arnon (1950) nutrient solution. Nutrient solutions were aired from an oil-less compressor and replaced every 7 days, increasing nutrient concentration to ¼ strength in 3 weeks. Plants were then individually transferred to 2.8 L pots filled with fresh ¼ strength nutrient solution.  After one week, half of the plants were transferred to fresh solution containing 250 µM Pi, while the other half was transferred to nutrient solution deprived of phosphate (Pi), with H2PO4 being replaced by H2SO4 (Muchhal et al., 1996). Roots from six plants from each treatment (0 and 250 µM Pi) were harvested 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after exposure to phosphate starvation and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For each time point and each treatment, root samples were aggregated in three pools of two samples each. Extraction of total RNA was performed separately on each sample pool. Keywords: time course of stress response

DESIGN
RNA from experimental sample and from its respective control sample (untreated plants) was used for hybridization to dual channel arrays. Two biological replicates were used for each experimental point. The quantification of each hybridization was submitted in two files, one for each slide side (technical replicates).
