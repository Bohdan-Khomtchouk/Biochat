TITLE
Triptolide alters the miRNA expression profiles in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared miRNA expression profiles among 5 groups of HepG2 cells treated with various concentrations (0,100,200 nM) of triptolide for 12 h or 24 h.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, triptolide intervention vs. without intervention. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 treated, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL11434 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 6th generation - hsa, mmu & rno
