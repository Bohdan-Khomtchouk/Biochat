TITLE
Selective defoliation affects plant growth, fruit transcriptional ripening program and flavonoid metabolism in grapevine.

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of basal leaf removal applied in Sangiovese cultivar at two different phonological stages, pre-bloom and veraison, on berry composition. As very few papers were published about the regulation of gene expression induced by vineyard management techniques, we report the first global transcriptomic analysis (integrated with agronomic and biochemical data) aiming to determine the molecular mechanisms that control Sangiovese berry composition. The comparison of gene expression profiles of defoliated vines at pre-bloom and at veraison with the control, revealed a common transcriptional response at the end of veraison in both treated berries, but also a more extensive transcriptome rearrangement in pre-bloom defoliated ones, which could be linked to the strong biochemical changes detected in the berry after pre-bloom veraison.

DESIGN
Total RNA recovered from a pool of berries derived from three control plants (C) was compared to total RNA from a pool of berries derived from three defoliated vines at pre-bloom (PB, JD 147,6 basal leaves and  relative laterals removed from each shoot) and three defoliated vines at veraison (V, JD 211,6 basal leaves and  relative laterals removed from each shoot) at beginning of veraison (BV), end of veraison (EV) and harvest (H). For each sampling date microarray analyses were conducted for three different biological replicates for treatment.
