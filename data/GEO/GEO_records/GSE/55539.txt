TITLE
Expression data from human subcutaneous adipocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An Affimetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array was used to study the effect of oleoylethnolamide on gene expression. The addition of 0.01 mM oleoylethanolamide (OEA) to human subcutaneous adipocytes significantly affected the expression of 1013 genes, with 556 being up-regulated and 457 being down-regulated.

DESIGN
Human subcutaneous adipocytes were incubated with oleoylethanolamide (0.01 mM). After 24 hr, the gene expression in human subcutanous adipocytes was analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays.
