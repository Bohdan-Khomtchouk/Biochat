TITLE
Distinct expression profiles of soft tissue sarcomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Soft tissue sarcomas (STTs) are neoplasms of mesenchymal cells, and are composed of more than 60 subtypes. Although many of these STTs could be distinguished from each other by morphology and limited IHC biomarkers, the precise diagnosis of STTs with similar morphology is still difficult to achieve. Therefore developing novel diagnosis biomarker and molecular signatures will be very helpful to pathologist in clinic.

DESIGN
Within this study, 3â€™ end RNA Sequencing (3SEQ) was used to expression profile different subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas.
