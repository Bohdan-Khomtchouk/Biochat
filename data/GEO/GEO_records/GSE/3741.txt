TITLE
Sequence specific recognition of RNA hairpins by the SAM domain of Vts1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Identifying transcripts that are associated with the post transcriptional regulator Vts1 in yeast by co-immuno precipitation. Keywords: RNA pulldown, Co-IP

DESIGN
Vts1-FLAG was overexpressed in vts1 deleted yeast cells, co-immuno precipitated and microarray probed together with cDNA from total RNA to detrmine ratio of enrichments by Vts1 pull downs.
