TITLE
Activin A-driven differentiation timecourse with human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activin A is known to induce endodermal differentiation in human embryonic stem cells under low-serum or certain defined media conditions. To gain insights into global gene expression changes during Activin A-induced differentiation, gene expression was monitored by means of microarrays in short intervals until 4 days of treatment. Keywords: Differentiation timecourse experiment
