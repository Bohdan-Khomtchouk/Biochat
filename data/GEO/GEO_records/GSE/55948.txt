TITLE
Condensin association with chromosomes depends on a DNA binding domain formed by its HEAT-repeat subunits

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Condensin protein complexes play central roles in the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes during mitotic and meiotic cell divisions. How condensin interacts with its chromatin substrates to promote sister chromatid decatenation and segregation is largely unknown. Previous work suggested that condensin, in addition to encircling chromatin fibers topologically within the large ring-shaped structure formed by its structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) and kleisin subunits, contacts DNA directly. Here we describe the discovery of a binding domain for double-stranded DNA helices formed by condensinâ€™s HEAT-repeat subunits. Using detailed mapping data of the interfaces between the HEAT-repeat and the kleisin subunits, we generated mutant complexes that lack the Ycg1/CAP-G HEAT-repeat subunit. These tetrameric condensin complexes fail to associate stably with chromosomes in yeast and human cells. We suggest that condensin controls chromosome architecture by stabilizing chromatin loops of chromatin fibers through interaction with its unconventional HEAT-repeat DNA binding domain.
