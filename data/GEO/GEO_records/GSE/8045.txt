TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling in A549 Lung Cancer Cell Line Following siRNA Mediated Knock-down of ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 are highly expressed in non small cell cell lung cancer. Neither the mechanism nor the biological significance  for such over expression have  been studied. We used microarrays to analyze changes in A549 lung cancer cell line in which ALDH activity was reduced using  lentiviral mediated expression of siRNA  against both isozymes (Lenti 1+3) Keywords: Gene Profiling after ALDH Knock Down

DESIGN
A549 lung cancer cell lines were transduced with lentiviral vectors containing specific siRNA sequences against ALDH1A1, ALDH3A1, both vectors  (Lenti 1+3 cells), and against the green flourescent protein (GFP) gene (GFP cells, used as control).
