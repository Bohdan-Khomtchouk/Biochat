TITLE
IFN-Î³ Upregulates Survivin and Ifi202 Expression to Induce Survival and Proliferation of Tumor-Specific T Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) comparing activation-induced gene expression profiles induced by tumor-specific antigen (Ag) and CD3 mAb. CTLs were stimulated with either Ag or CD3 mAb for 3 and 24 h, respectively. The stimulated CTLs were compared to un-stimulated CTLs. The objective was to identify differential gene expression profiles induced by the two activation (Ag vs CD3 mAb) conditions.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiments, un-stimulated vs stimulated CTLs. Biological replicates: 3 replicates for each comparison. Unstimulated CTLs were compared to stimulated CTLs (Ag and CD3 mAb, respectively).
