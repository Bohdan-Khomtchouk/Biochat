TITLE
Identification of an LHX target cis-regulatory element through LHX6 ChIP-seq.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing (seq) from mouse E11.5 maxillary arches using anti-LHX6 antibody to identify LHX target cis-regulatory elements.

DESIGN
Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing using only wild-type E11.5 maxillary arch tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL15103 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Mus musculus)
