TITLE
Expression data from ccRCC specimens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify a  therapeutic candidate target molecule for ccRCC, we analyzed the microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures in ccRCC clinical specimens.

DESIGN
9 matched pair (normal tissue and ccRCC tissue) plus 7 ccRCC tissue were analyzed for miRNA-microarray

PLATFORM
