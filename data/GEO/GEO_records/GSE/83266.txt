TITLE
The β-catenin/CBP-antagonist ICG-001 inhibits pediatric glioma tumorigenicity in a Wnt-independent manner

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In pediatric glioma cell lines, treatment with ICG-001 had no inhibitory effect on canonical Wnt-target genes but induced significant up regulation of various known β-catenin target genes in both cell lines and top 20 GO-annotations of down-regulated genes by ICG-001  were associated with biosynthetic and metabolic processes and cell cycle division processes.

DESIGN
Pediatric cell lines were treated with ICG-001 or DMSO for 48h

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
