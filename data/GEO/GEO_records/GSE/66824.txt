TITLE
Genomic and Clinical Effects Associated with a Relaxation Response Mind-Body Intervention in Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Inflammatory Bowel Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with chronic illnesses such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) often have reduced quality of life. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain/discomfort associated with altered bowel function, such as diarrhea or constipation, without gross structural changes or inflammation [1]; IBD is characterized by gross inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract which can result in symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea and bloody stools.  IBS and IBD can profoundly affect quality of life and are influenced by stress and resiliency.The impact of mind-body interventions (MBIs) on IBS and IBD patients has not previously been examined. In this study IBS and  IBD patients were enrolled in a 9-week relaxation response based mind-body group intervention (RR-MBI), focusing on elicitation of the RR and cognitive skill building. We performed Peripheral blood transcriptome analysis to identify genomic correlates of the RR-MBI.

DESIGN
This pilot, single center, single-arm, open-label study utilized an RR-MBI for the treatment of IBS and IBD using elicitation of the RR through meditation techniques and cognitive skill building, as established by the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital (BHI).Blood was collected at baseline and after 9 weeks for transcriptional expression profiling in PAXgene (Qiagen) tubes. Total RNA was isolated from whole blood samples and gene expression profile was assessed on IBS and IBD patients with paired pre- and post-intervention samples using HT U133 Plus PM Array plates (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
