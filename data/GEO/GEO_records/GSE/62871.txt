TITLE
Right atrial tissue gene expression data from human patients in sinus rhythm (SR) and patients whom post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) developed

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify pathway and mechanism undergoing post operative atrial fibrilation, we check transcriptomic expression of patients with and without post operative atrial fibrillation development and compare up and down regulated genes and their pathways Right atrial appendage were obtained from patients without any signs of cardiomyopathy undergoing coronary artery bypass graft.

Prospective study
