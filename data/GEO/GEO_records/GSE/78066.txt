TITLE
Global gene expression changes during immune complex-induced neutrophil activation (wild type and Card9‒/‒ cells)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
--- Raw data of the Supplementary Table 1 of the Nature Communications article 'Neutrophil-specific deletion of the CARD9 gene expression regulator suppresses autoantibody-induced inflammation in vivo' We used microarray to obtain global gene expression data of immobilised immune complex-activated mouse neutrophils in the presence and absence of the gene expression regulator molecule CARD9.

DESIGN
Mouse neutrophils were isolated from the bone marrow and were plated on human serum albumin & anti-human serum albumin antibody-coated surfaces at a 4 x 106 cell concentration. Human serum albumin-coated surfaces served as controls. The cells were stimulated for 4 hours before RNA preparation. The experiments were done at 3 independent timepoints.
