TITLE
Prediction of neurological outcomes shortly after cardiac arrest

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prediction of neurological outcomes shortly after cardiac arrest would represent a major breakthrough. We tested the ability of gene expression profiles of blood cells to predict outcome in cardiac arrest patients.

DESIGN
35 consecutive cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (33Â°C for 24h) were included in this prospective  monocentre study. Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) was determined at discharge and 6 months later. All patients had blood sampling at the end of hypothermia. Gene expression profiles of blood cells were determined using 25,000~gene microarray in two groups of patients: good outcome (CPC 1-2) and bad outcome (CPC 3-5).
