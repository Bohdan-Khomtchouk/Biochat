TITLE
Human Herpesvirus 6A encoded miRNAs: A role in viral lytic replication

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of size selection of small RNA species isolated from Jjhan cells harboring the human herpesvirus 6A genome. We ammassed > 3.4million reads of sequence from three different sources: Normal Brain cell total RNA, Jjhan total RNA and HHV-6A BAC transfected Jjhan total RNA.  Sequences were mapped to the HHV-6A Uganda 1102 strain genome (GenBank: X83413.1) with no less than 100% match for reads > 20nt and < 23nt. The resulting pool of candidates was mapped to the HHV-6A genome.

DESIGN
Single pass 36nt sequencing of samples either with or without HHV-6a genomes present.
