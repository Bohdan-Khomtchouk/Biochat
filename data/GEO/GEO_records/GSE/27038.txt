TITLE
Expression data from the Ire1α null and control murine livers in the absence or presence of ER stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ire1α conditional null or control mice of 3-months old were injected intraperitoneally with TM or vehicle. At 8 hours after the injection, total RNA was isolated from murine liver tissue and subjected to Affymetrix microarray analysis.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to profile the global programme of gene expression in the livers of Ire1α null and control mice in the absence or presence of ER stress.
