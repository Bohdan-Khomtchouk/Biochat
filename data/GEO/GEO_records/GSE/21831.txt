TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Streptococcus mutans biofilms in response to starch and sucrose.

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling to investigate the response of Streptococcus mutans biofilms to starch and sucrose at distinct stages of biofilm development.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted and purified from four replicate samples of each biofilm sample of interest and labeled with Cy3. For each replicate, labeled RNA was hybridized to slides along with Cy5-labeled reference RNA, extracted from S. mutans UA159 cells grown to mid-log.

PLATFORM
GPL8255 Streptococcus mutans 10.7K oligonucleotide array version 1
