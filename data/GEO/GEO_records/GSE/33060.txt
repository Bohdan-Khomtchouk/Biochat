TITLE
Sequentially acting Sox transcription factors in neural lineage development [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report sequential binding but unique functions of different Sox transcription factors during distinct stages of neural differentiation

DESIGN
Loss of function experiment for Sox2/Sox3 in neural progenitor cells and gene expression profile for Sox11 expressing (PSA NCAM sorted) early formed neurons.
