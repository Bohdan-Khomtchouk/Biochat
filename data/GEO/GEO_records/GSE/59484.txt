TITLE
Expression data for miR-33a over-expression in CD133-negative D456MG cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiR-33a is involved in the maintenance of Glioma Initiating Cells (GIC) and tumor progression. MicroRNA-33a could promote GIC growth and self-renewal by regulating two pathways including cAMP/PKA pathway and Notch pathway. We used microarrays to identify the direct target genes of miR-33a in a glioblastoma cell line D456MG. We used microarrays to detail the global change of gene expression after miR-33a over-expression and identified target genes during this process.

DESIGN
Cells were infected with lenti-virus expressing a control vector (pWPXLD) or human primary miR-33a. Then RNA was extracted and gene expression was profiled by Affymetrix microarray.
