TITLE
High Temperature on Immune Response of Grass Carp

ORGANISM
Ctenopharyngodon idella

SUMMARY
Effect of High Temperature on Immune Response of Grass Carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) by Transcriptome Analysis

DESIGN
To understand the immune response mechanisms of this fish in high temperature circumstance, the transcriptomic profiles of the spleens from grass carp groups undergoing heat stress and normal temperature were investigated.

PLATFORM
