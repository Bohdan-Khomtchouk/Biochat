TITLE
Identification of an NKX3.1-G9a-UTY regulatory network that controls prostate differentiation (Mouse_15M_SV_Affy)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptome of seminal vesicle from 15-month-old Nkx3.1+/+ mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from seminal vesicle from 15-month-old Nkx3.1+/+ mice. Seminal vesicle was harvested, RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). cDNA was labeled using a BioArray High-Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChips (Mu74AV2).

PLATFORM
