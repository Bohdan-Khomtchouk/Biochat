TITLE
Functional and molecular characterization of mouse Gata2-independent hematopoietic progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Gata2 transcription factor is a pivotal regulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) development and maintenance. Gata2 functions in the embryo during endothelial cell to hematopoietic cell transition (EHT) to affect hematopoietic cluster, HPC and HSC formation. Although previous studies of cell populations phenotypically enriched in HPCs and HSCs show expression of Gata2, there has been no direct study of Gata2 expressing cells during normal hematopoiesis. In this study we generate a Gata2 Venus reporter mouse model with unperturbed Gata2 expression to examine the hematopoietic function and transcriptome of Gata2 expressing and nonexpressing cells.

DESIGN
Gata2Venus- HPCs 1 replicate, Gata2Venus+ HPCs 1 replicate
