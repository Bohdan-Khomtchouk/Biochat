TITLE
Longissimus cervicis muscle of beef steers with divergent Warner Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF) residuals following different post-mortem treatments (electrically stimulated v. non-stimulated)

ORGANISM
Bos taurus x Bos indicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of bovine skeletal muscle comparing expression differences of a population of beef cattle selected for divergent response (shear force residuals) to post-mortem treatment (electrical stimulation)

DESIGN
4 condition experiment utilizing 47 total samples (originally 48, one sample could not be used). Samples were broken in to high/low groups based on residual WBSF following electrical stimulation (ES) and without electrical stimulation (NES). There are 4 groups based on residual WBSF: High-ES (12), Low-ES (11), High-NES (12), and Low-NES (12)

PLATFORM
GPL11649 Agilent-023647 B. taurus (Bovine) Oligo Microarray v2 (Probe Name version)
