TITLE
Gene expression studies in normal, dysplastic and malignant cervical tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of normal cervix, CIN's and cancer cervix, with an intent to identify genes involved in the malignant transformation of normal cervix and to identify genes which can be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis. Identification of genes for predicting radiation response using microarray gene expression studies Keywords: Patient tissue samples

DESIGN
Two dye experiments using Universal control RNA (Stratagene) and RNA from tissues. Biological replicates: Normal = 5; CIN1=4; CIN3=3; Cervical cancers = 28. One replicate per array.
