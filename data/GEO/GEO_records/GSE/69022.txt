TITLE
Transcriptional responses of Pseudomonas veronii 1YdBTEX2 to the exposure to laboratory induced matric and solute stresses

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas veronii 1YdBTEX2

SUMMARY
We study the transcriptional reactions of bacteria interesting for biodegradation under laboratory conditions that mimic water stress. We compared the transcriptomes of cultures growing exponential phase under optimal conditions versus their responses to an osmotic shock of 30 min in exponential phase. The osmotic shock consisted in a reduction of water potential induced by salt (NaCl, solute stress) or by polyethylene glycol (PEG8000, matric stress). The stress was such that cells are not more than 20% affected in their maximum growth rate.

DESIGN
The purpose of this study is to compare the responses of Pseudomonas veronii 1YdBTEX2 under solute and matric shock stresses (30min of exposition). These transcriptome responses will be compared with those experiences by other strain potentially useful for bioremediation in order to understand better their behaviour in inoculations in soil.
