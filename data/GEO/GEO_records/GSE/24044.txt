TITLE
KDM6B-induced gene expression changes in transfected CD10-positive GC B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have investigated the effect of lysine-specific demethylase 6B (KDM6B) on gene expression in normal human germinal center (GC) B cells using a non-viral vector-based system.

DESIGN
Gene expression was compared between KDM6B-transfected and control vector-transfected GC B cells from three patients. RNA from the MACS-sorted transfected GC B cells was amplified. 10ug of fragmented cRNA was hybridized to HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Differentially expressed genes were identified using Affymetrix GCOS pairwise analysis.
