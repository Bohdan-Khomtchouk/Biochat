TITLE
Paracrine stimulation  effect of autologous salispheres on mouse salivary  gland

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Human salispheres, a culture of stem/progenitor cells, represent a potential therapy for radiation induced hyposalivation. Radiation-induced hyposalivation dramatically reduces quality of life of patients. We have demonstrated the potential of human salispheres to engraft and differentiate when transplanted into a mouse model of hyposalivation, in the manuscript associated with these data. We also demonstrate the functional recovery of irradiated salivary glands  (SGs) following human salisphere transplantation, by the measurement of saliva production. We previously employed Illumina microarrays to determine if transplanted human salisphere cells exert a paracrine stimulatory effect on recipient mouse SGs. Results of this array unveiled a large cohort of immuneresponse genes unregulated following human salisphere transplantation. In order to negate this immune response and unveil any true paracrein stimulatory effects, we performed autologous transplantation of salispheres from NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice, the same model employed in our first microarray study, in the irradiated SGs of NSG mice.

DESIGN
6 samples were analysed in total. Total RNA from 3 irradiated control SGs (5Gy irradiation) and 3 salivary glands transplanted with 100,000 NSG salispheres.
