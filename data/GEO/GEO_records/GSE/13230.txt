TITLE
Met1 or DB7 tumor gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Metastasis predictive gene signatures can result from either somatic mutation, inherited polyrmorphism or both.  This experiment is designed to look at the gene expression differences due to differences in somatic mutations in the initiating oncogene, PyMT.  Met1 is from a fully metastatic FVB mammary tumor cell line, DB7 contains a mutation that permits tumor formation, but suppresses metastatic ability. Keywords: Basal transcription profiles

DESIGN
Mammary tumors from adult F1 animals from (AKR/J x PyMT) and (DBA/2J x PyMT) outcrosses was collected and arrayed on Affymetrics chip to identify basal differences in gene expression between the different genotypes
