TITLE
Analysis of global changes in gene expression induced by human polynucleotide phosphorylase (hPNPaseold-35)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Polynucleotide Phosphorylase (hPNPaseold-35) is an evolutionarily conserved 3’→5’ exoribonuclease implicated in the regulation of numerous physiological processes like maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, mtRNA import and aging-associated inflammation. From an RNase perspective, little is known about the RNA or miRNA species it targets for degradation or whose expression it regulates; except for c-myc and miR-221.

DESIGN
To further elucidate the functional implications of hPNPaseold-35 in cellular physiology, we knocked-down and overexpressed hPNPaseold-35 in melanoma and HeLa cells, resectively, and performed gene expression analyses to identify differentially expressed transcripts. Biological triplicates were run on microarrays.
