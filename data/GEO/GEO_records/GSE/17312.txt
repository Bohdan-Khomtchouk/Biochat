BI Human Reference Epigenome Mapping Project

ORGANISM
Roadmap Epigenomics

SUMMARY
The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium aims to produce a public resource of epigenomic maps for stem cells and primary ex vivo tissues selected to represent the normal counterparts of tissues and organ systems frequently involved in human disease. Characterization of the reference epigenome in humans by use of ChIP-Seq in a diverse panel of ES cells, tissue stem cells, reprogrammed stem cells, primary cells and tissues **************** For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to: ****************
