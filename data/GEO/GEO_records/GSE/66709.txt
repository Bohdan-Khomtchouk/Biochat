TITLE
LRP8-Reelin-regulated Neuronal (LRN) Enhancer signature underlying learning and memory formation (4C-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comprehensive landscape of epigenomic events regulated by the Reelin signaling through activation of specific cohort of cis-regulatory enhancer elements (LRN-enhancers), which involves the proteolytical processing of the LRP8 receptor by the gamma-secretase activity and is required for learning and memory behavior

DESIGN
All 4C-Seq experiments were designed to evaluate the physycal interaction between selected Fos promoter and putative regulatory enhancers regions

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
