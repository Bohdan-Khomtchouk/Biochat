TITLE
Stromal contribution to expression signatures of colorectal cancer (rectal samples)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We noticed that a recently identified poor prognosis stem/serrated molecular subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by up-regulation of transcripts known to be also expressed by stromal cells. To better define the origin of such transcripts, we analyzed  RNAseq and microarray datasets from CRC mouse xenografts, where human cancer cells are supported by murine stroma. The analysis revealed that mRNA levels of stem/serrated subtype genes are mostly due to stromal expression, even when the stromal fraction is below 5%. Indeed, a classifier based on genes exclusively expressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts was significantly associated, in multiple datasets, to poor prognosis of CRC and to radioresistance of rectal cancer.

DESIGN
Molecular Characterization of 72 primary rectal cancer formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens including 58 pretreatment specimens, 14 surgical specimens. The study was approved by the ethic institutional review board for " Biobanking and use of human tissues for experimental studies " of the Pathology Service of the Azienda Ospedaliera Citt√† della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Torino, Italy. The project provided a verbal  informed consent from the patients due to the retrospective approach of the study, which did not impact on their treatment. All the cases were anonymously recorded. The IRB approved this consent procedure.
