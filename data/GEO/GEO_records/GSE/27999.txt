TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of mouse kidney at the developmental day 15 under iron deficient diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
While it is clear that iron deficiency affects both human and rodent development, and particularly kidney development, the precise pathological changes that occur with iron deficiency have not been distinguished. For example, it is not clear which compartment of the kidney is predominantly affected nor it is clear either which stage of development or which cell type require the most iron. In this study, we used an in vivo mouse model of iron deficiency in order to better understand the targeting of iron in the developing kidney.

DESIGN
Mouse kidneys at the embrionic stage E15 were used for the total RNA extraction

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
