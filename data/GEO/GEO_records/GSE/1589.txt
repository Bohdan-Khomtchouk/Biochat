TITLE
Targets of HNF1b, HNF4a2 and HNF6 in INS-1 cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
A rat insulinoma cell line (INS-1) was generated that contains a FRT site for FLP recombinase mediated site specific integration of specific genes. In addition, the line contains the tetracycline repressor allowing tetracycline (tet) induction of the introduced gene. By comparing the gene expression profiles of uninduced and tet-induced cells, target genes of introduced transcription factors HNF1b, HNF4a2, and HNF6 (onecut1) were identified. Two different clones containing the same transcription factor were analyzed in the non-induced and tet-induced (24 h) state. Keywords: ordered
