TITLE
Transcriptional Response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551 to treatment with 140 mM NaCl for 1 hr

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
To identify mediators of the osmotic stress response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), we performed transcriptional profiling of WT CDC1551 following treatment with 140 mM NaCl for 1 hr relative to an untreated control.  140 mM NaCl was chosen to reflect the approximate osmolarity of human plasma (i.e., 280 mOsm/L), which may be relevant during the course of infection.

DESIGN
CDC1551 was treated with 140 mM NaCl for 1 h and compared to the same strain treated with 0 mM NaCl for 0 h.  4 biological replicates, independently grown and harvested.  One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL17617 JCVI PFGRC Mycobacterium tuberculosis 22K v4 array designed primarily based on strain H37Rv (orf version)
