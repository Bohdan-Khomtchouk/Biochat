TITLE
A genome-wide study reveals a pathway for small RNA-mediated recognition of UV-induced DNA lesions (smallRNAs)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study reports that the DNA DAMAGE-BINDING PROTEIN 2 (DDB2) and ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1) form a chromatin-bound complex, which facilitates recognition of photo-lesions.

DESIGN
siRNAs populations after UV exposure

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana) GPL17639 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
