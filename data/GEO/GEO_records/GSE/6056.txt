TITLE
A role for Dicer in immune regulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A study of the miRNA profile CD4 T cells compared to T reg cells; of activated and naive T cells; and the miRNA profile conferred by enforced expression of Foxp3. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Fifteen arrays broken down into three broader experiments as referenced by series GSE6003 - a comparison of miRNA profile of natural T reg cells with conventional CD4+CD25- T cells; GSE6006 - a comparison of miRNA profile of activated T cells to naive T cells; and GSE6007 - comparison of miRNA profile of Foxp3-transduced activated T cells with control vector-transduced activated T cells.
