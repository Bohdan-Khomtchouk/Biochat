TITLE
Retroviral Replicating Vectors Deliver Cytosine Deaminase Leading to Targeted 5-FU-Mediated Cytotoxicity in Multiple Human Cancer Types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Toca 511 is a modified Retroviral Replicating Vector based on Moloney g‑retrovirus with an amphotropic envelope. As an investigational cancer treatment, Toca 511 preferentially infects cancer cells without direct cell lysis and encodes an enhanced yeast cytosine deaminase that converts the antifungal drug 5‑fluorocytosine to the anticancer drug, 5-fluorouracil. A panel of established human cancers cell lines, derived from glioblastoma, colon, and breast cancer tissue was used to evaluate parameters critical for effective anticancer activity. As part of these analyses, we profiled relative mRNA levels across these cell lines via RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
mRNA expression profiles across nine human cancer cell lines.
