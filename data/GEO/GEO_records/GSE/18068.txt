TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome sequencing at different stages of Drosophila development, RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains total RNA sequencing data generated on Solexa Genome Analyzer for whole Drosophila animals at 12 different time-points of development. Keywords: Epigenetics For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
For each time-point (E-0-4h, E-4-8h, E-8-12h, E-12-16h, E-16-20h, E20-24h, L1, L2, L3, Pupae, Adult Males and Adult Females) a total RNA extraction has been performed. After conversion into double stranded DNA, the samples have been sequenced in duplicate on Solexa Genome Analyzer following Solexa sequencing procedure.
