TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis 14-day-old  seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Chitin, a polymer of N-acetyl-glucosamne, is a component of the cell walls of many plant fungal pathogens. During the infection process, the released chitin fragments (such as chitooctaose) from fungal cell walls by plant enzymes can trigger plant defense response and gene activation. The current work studies the regulation of Arabidopsis genes by the purified chitin fragment chitooctaose. We used the Affymetric Arabidopsis whole gene arrays to study the gene expression caused by chitin (chitooctaose). Keywords: chitooctaose vs water treatments, with 3 biological replicates
