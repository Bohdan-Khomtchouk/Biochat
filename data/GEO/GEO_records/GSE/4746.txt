TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis 14-day-old  seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Chitin, a polymer of N-acetyl-glucosamne, is a component of the cell walls of many plant fungal pathogens. During the infection process, the released chitin fragments (such as chitooctaose) from fungal cell walls by plant enzymes can trigger plant defense response and gene activation. The current work studies the regulation of Arabidopsis genes by the purified chitin fragment chitooctaose. We used the Affymetric Arabidopsis whole gene arrays to study the gene expression caused by chitin (chitooctaose). Keywords: chitooctaose vs water treatments, with 3 biological replicates

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seedlings grown hydroponically for 14 days were treated with the purified chitin fragment chitooctaose at a final concentration of 1 um for 3 minutes. The controls were similarli treated with an equivalent amount of ddH2O. Three biological replicates were obtained.
