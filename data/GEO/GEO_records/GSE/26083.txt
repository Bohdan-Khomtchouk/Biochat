Genome-wide maps of Tamoxifen resistance MCF7 cell line

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We report the ER alpha regulatory network of Tamoxifen resistance MCF7 cell line using the Chromatin immunoprecipitated high-throughput sequencing technology (ChIP-seq). By Integrating the gene expression data (previously reported) with the ChIP-seq data, we generated ER alpha regulatory network and pathways. For ER alpha regulatory network, hub TFs with enriched motifs were identified from ER alpha peak together with PolII peaks. We then scan the position weight matrix (PWM) of ER alpha peak region of certain gene to find out the regulatory relationship between hub TF and normal TF. For regulatory pathway, genes were grouped base on their expression value at 4 different time point. Then the hub TF that plays important role in each time point of each group was identified. This study provides a framework for the application of ChIP-seq and gene expression data for the construction of ER alpha regulatory network.
