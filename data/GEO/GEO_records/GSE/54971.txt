TITLE
Formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements with next generation sequencing (FAIRE-seq) in primary human macrophages and foam cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the open chromatin landscape in primary human macrophages and foam cells using FAIRE-seq

DESIGN
CD14+ monocytes were isolated from the blood of 3 healthy volunteers. Monocytes were differentiated into macrophages by culture for 7 days with 50ng/ml macrophage colony stimulating factor and then treated for 48 hours with either oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) to induce foam cell formation or with a control buffer that lacked oxLDL. The resulting six samples were then subjected to FAIRE-seq using an established protocol (Simon JM, Giresi PG, Davis IJ, Lieb JD. Using formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to isolate active regulatory DNA. Nature protocols 2012;7:256-67).
