TITLE
Expression data from low nitrate culture in root in maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays subsp. mays

SUMMARY
Nitrate is the major source of nitrogen available for many crop plants and is often the limiting factor for plant growth and agricultural productivity especially for maize. Many studies have been done identifying the transcriptome changes under low nitrate conditions. However, the microRNAs (miRNAs) varied under nitrate limiting conditions in maize has not been reported. MiRNAs play important roles in abiotic stress responses and nutrient deprivation. Root is the organ that plants transport nitrate. we used the microarray systems to perform a genome-wide search to detect miRNAs responding to the chronic and transient nitrate limiting conditions in maize.

DESIGN
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous RNAs that are regulators of gene expression in plants and animals. And, miRNAs have been known for years to be important for phosphate, sulphate and copper deprivation responses in plants. In Arabidopsis, small RNA deep sequencing associated with nitrate response had been analyzed. However, information about the way by which miRNA are regulated by abiotic stresses in general and by low nitrate in particular is unavailable for maize. In this study, we used GeneChipÂ® microarray systems to perform a genome-wide search to detect miRNAs responding to the chronic and transient nitrate limiting conditions in roots in maize.
