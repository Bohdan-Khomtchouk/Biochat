TITLE
Expression data from low nitrate culture in root in maize

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Nitrate is the major source of nitrogen available for many crop plants and is often the limiting factor for plant growth and agricultural productivity especially for maize. Many studies have been done identifying the transcriptome changes under low nitrate conditions. However, the microRNAs (miRNAs) varied under nitrate limiting conditions in maize has not been reported. MiRNAs play important roles in abiotic stress responses and nutrient deprivation. Root is the organ that plants transport nitrate. we used the microarray systems to perform a genome-wide search to detect miRNAs responding to the chronic and transient nitrate limiting conditions in maize.
