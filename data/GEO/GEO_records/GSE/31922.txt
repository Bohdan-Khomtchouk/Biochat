SUMMARY
Conduct gene profiling experiment from a melanoma cell line which silenced galectin-3 gene expression to understand different phenotypic properties observed during tumor growth.

DESIGN
A melanoma cell line which silenced galectin-3 gene expression was obtained. This cell line was used in overexpression experiments, using a galectin-3 coding plasmid. Both galectin-3 negative and positive cells were obtained in syngeneic wild type and galectin-3 knockout mice. Altogether, we had evidence that while galectin-3 derived from the tumor cells impaired tumor growth, galectin-3 derived from stromal cells apparently favored tumor growth. Angiogenic response within tumors derived from galectin-3 expressing melanoma cells was delayed as compared to control conditions. Cells recruited to these distinct microenvironments seem to control tumor growth. Gene profiling of this tissue will allow for an integrative view of the process that was somehow orchestrated by galectin-3.
