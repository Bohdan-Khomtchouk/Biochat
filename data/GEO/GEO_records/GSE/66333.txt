TITLE
Neuronal DNA damage response-associated dysregulation of signalling pathways and cholesterol metabolism at th earliest stages of Alzheimer-type pathology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High levels of oxidative stress and an associated neuronal DDR occur at the earliest stages of Alzheimer pathology (low Braak stage), and is associated with cognitive impairment. The aim of the present study was to combine immuno-LCM and microarray analysis to characterize the neuronal transcriptome at low Braak stages (Braak 0-II), with respect to the neuronal DDR,  in post-mortem human frontal cortex  derived from the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (MRC-CFAS).

DESIGN
Pyramidal neurones were isolated from age, sex and brain pH-matched cases derived from the MRC-CFAS cohort, using immuno laser capture microdissection.  The extracted RNA was amplified and applied to HGU133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix gene arrays.  Genes were considered differentially expressed at p < 0.001 in all 4 individual cases in each DDR group [8 cases in total: 4 cases high neuronal DDR & 4 cases low neuronal DDR].
