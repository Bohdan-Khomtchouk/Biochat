TITLE
miRNA* loading on Ago2

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In flies, microRNAs (miRNAs) are synthesized as a short imperfect duplex, where the miRNA is paired to another small RNA, dubbed the " miRNA* " . Usually, miRNA*s are degraded in the last steps of miRNA maturation, but we found evidence that some of them can be loaded on the Ago2 protein.

DESIGN
Small RNAs (18-29 nt) from fly heads (WT, ago2 mutants, dcr-2 homozygous and heterozygous mutants) were sequenced using a Solexa Genome Analyzer instrument. The ago2 cDNA library was loaded twice on the instrument, yielding two technical replicates.
