TITLE
Gene expression profiles of LNCaP miR-582-5p cells and LNCaP empty vector cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate targets of miR-582-5p that which might participate in the transition to CRPC, we evaluated the gene expression profiles of LNCaP miR-582-5p cells and LNCaP EV cells using DNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
We evaluated the gene expression profiles of LNCaP miR-582-5p cells and LNCaP EV cells using DNA microarray with GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST array.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
