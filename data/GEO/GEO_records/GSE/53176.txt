TITLE
Heterochromatin protein 1 secures survival and transmission of malaria parasites

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum 3D7

SUMMARY
The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum relies on clonally variant gene expression in order to escape immune recognition and secure continuous proliferation during blood stage infection. Here, we studied the role of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), an evolutionary conserved regulator of heritable gene silencing, in the biology of P. falciparum blood stage parasites. We demonstrate that conditional PfHP1 depletion de-represses hundreds of heterochromatic virulence genes and disrupts the elusive mechanism underlying mutually exclusive expression and antigenic variation of PfEMP1. Intriguingly, we also discovered that the PfHP1-dependent regulation of an ApiAP2 transcription factor controls the switch from asexual parasite proliferation to sexual differentiation. This uncovers the first mechanistic insight into the unknown pathway triggering gametocyte conversion and establishes a new concept of HP1-dependent cell fate decision in unicellular eukaryotes.

DESIGN
P. falciparum 3D7 parasites expressing endogenous PfHP1-GFP-DD were grown in presence of 4nM WR/625nM Shield-1 (3D7/HP1ON) or 4nM WR (3D7/HP1OFF). RNA extracted from these samples at eleven consecutive time points each was processed for microarray analysis.
