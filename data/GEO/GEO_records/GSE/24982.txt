TITLE
mRNA expression profiling in the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of  L4 and L5 Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) in the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain. The goal of the study was to identify genes involved in neuropathic pain

DESIGN
This series of samples comprises of contralateral and ipsilateral L4 and L5 DRG tissue collected 4 weeks after rats underwent a L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) or a sham operation with no L5 spinal nerve ligation. This defines 8 groups (i) contralateral L4 DRG from the sham cohort (n=5), (ii) ipsilateral L4 DRG from sham cohort (n=5), (iii) contralateral L4 DRG from SNL cohort (n=5), (iv) ipsilateral L4 DRG from the SNL chort (n=5), (v) contralateral L5 DRG from the sham cohort (n=5), (vi) ipsilateral L5 DRG from sham cohort (n=5), (vii) contralateral L5 DRG from SNL cohort (n=5), (viii) ipsilateral L5 DRG from the SNL cohort (n=5)
