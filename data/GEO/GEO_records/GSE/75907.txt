TITLE
Genome-wide landscape and functional necessity of heart enhancers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptional changes in the heart resulting from the loss of cardiac enhancers. As there remains a limited understanding of the phenotypic consequences of enhancer mutations, we examined the impact of loss of function mutations by deleting two enhancers near heart disease genes in mice.  In both cases, we observed loss of target gene expression, as well as cardiac phenotypes consistent with heart disease in humans, highlighting the functional importance of enhancers for normal heart function, as well as the potential contribution of enhancer mutations to heart disease.

DESIGN
Hearts were dissected from wild-type and enhancer-null mice (either embryonic or adult) and processed for deep RNA-seq analysis.
