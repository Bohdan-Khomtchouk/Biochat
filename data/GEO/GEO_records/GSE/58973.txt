TITLE
RNAseq data from in vitro-stimulated (24 hours) murine relfl/flCD19-Cre and CD19-Cre splenic B cells purified by magnetic cell separation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAseq analysis of CD40 + IgM in vitro-stimulated (24 hours) murine relfl/flCD19-Cre (furtheron designated as REL) and CD19-Cre (furtheron designated as WT) splenic B cells identifies genes regulated by the transcription factor c-REL in activated B cells.

DESIGN
Splenic B cells from 12-week old relfl/flCD19-Cre and CD19-Cre littermate mice were isolated by magnetic cell separation from splenic mononuclear cells and stimulated in vitro for 24 hours with anti-CD40 and anti-IgM. RNA was isolated and submitted for RNA-sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument for 30 million single-ended reads.
