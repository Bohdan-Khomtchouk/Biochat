TITLE
Knock-down of the methyltransferase Kmt6 reliefs H3K27me3 and results in induction of cryptic and otherwise silent secondary metabolite gene clusters in Fusarium fujikuroi [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Fusarium fujikuroi

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq of H3K27me3 in wild type Fusarium fujikuroi grown in synthetic ICI medium with low nitrogen conditions.

DESIGN
Three replicates of F. fujikuroi wild-type strain were grown in low nitrogen. ChIP-Seq was performed with anti-H3K27me3 antibody.
