TITLE
Full genome qRT PCR of Staphylococcus aureus strains USA300 and TB15 during infection of 5 organs

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
We used high-throughput qRT-PCR analysis to obtain full genome qRT- PCR data for the Staphylococcus aureus strains USA300 (wild type) and TB15 (mutant). Both strains were collected  during infection from 4 mouse organs ( skin, kidney, lung,liver) as well as from human neutrophil infection.

DESIGN
One sample per strain per organ was used in the analysis. Each sample was tested in duplicates for each primer pair on the same PCR plate. We intended to compare gene expressions of  USA300 (wild type) and TB15 (mutant) strains in each organ separately
