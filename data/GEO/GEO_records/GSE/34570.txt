TITLE
Expression data from c-Src inhibited osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The tyrosine kinase c-Src has a crucial role in maintaining osteoblast in a less differentiated status, as already described in the literature. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in osteoblasts treated with a well known c-Src inhibitor (PP1).

DESIGN
Osteoblast primary cultures were isolated from calvaria of 7 days-old CD1 mice. These cell were starved and treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 2 micromolar PP1 for 24 hours. Then RNA was extracted and hybridizated on Affymetrix microarray.
