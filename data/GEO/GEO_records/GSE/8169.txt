TITLE
The Arabidopsis chromodomain-containing LHP1 colocalizes with histone H3 lysine27 trimethylation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The POLYCOMB proteins are required for maintenance of silent chromatin states mediated by H3K27 trimethylation in animals, but POLYCOMB homologues are not found in plant genomes. Using DamID-chip, we found that the Arabidopsis chromodomain-containing protein LHP1 localizes to chromatin associated with H3K27me3 genome-wide. Furthermore, the LHP1 chromodomain binds H3K27me3 with high affinity. These results suggest that LHP1 shares similar functions with POLYCOMB. Keywords: DamID-Chip

DESIGN
Four replicates of DamID-chip and four replicates of Dam-only control

PLATFORM
GPL1979 AtTile1F to Arabidopsis Tiling 1.0F
