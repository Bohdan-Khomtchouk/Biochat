TITLE
SRp20 regulates Genome-wide Alternative RNA splicing events in U2OS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the effects of SRp20 on genome-wide RNA splicing in tumor cells, we utilized Exonhit SpliceArray to compare genome-wide changes of RNA splicing and transcription in U2OS cells with or without knockdown of SRp20 by RNAi.

DESIGN
U2OS cells were treated by SRp20 siRNA or non-specific siRNA, each performed in triplicate. A human genome-wide splice-array assay was performed by using a service provider ExonHit Therapeutics, Inc (Gaithersburg, MD). Fifty ng of total RNA isolated from U2OS cells with or without knockdown of SRp20 was quality controlled and analyzed by using Affymetrix GeneChip platform to profile the expression of 20,649 genes and splicing events of 19,066 genes.
