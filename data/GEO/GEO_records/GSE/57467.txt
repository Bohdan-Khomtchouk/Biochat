TITLE
Genomic Run On (GRO): determination of the nascent transcriptional rates and mRNA levels in several yeast mutants.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In order to maintain the appropriate level of mRNA it is necessary coordinate simultaneously all the steps along the mRNA life cycle. It has been shown that several factors act in the regulation of gene expression as global coordinators. Thus, some kind of information is transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, imprinted in the mRNA. In this way, it is conceivable the existence of mechanisms that ensure the balance between mRNA synthesis and degradation through the information flow from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and vice versa, as a crosstalk among both process to ensure the proper mRNA homeostasis in the cell. In this study, we have used null mutants related with transcription and mRNA degradation and we find that the lack of those factors impacts both over transcription and RNA stability at genome wide levels to compensate the impaired effect produce by the loss of each studied factor.

DESIGN
This study focus on the transcriptional activity of RNA pol II in yeast genes. S. cerevisiae cells grown in YPD or YPGal to exponential phase were subjected to Genomic Run On.  Data were normalized by the ArrayStat software. Home-made macroarrays containing 6035 ORF were used.
