TITLE
Yap and Taz regulate retinal pigment epithelial cell fate

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The optic vesicle comprises a pool of bi-potential progenitor cells from  which the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and neural retina fates  segregate during ocular morphogenesis. Several transcription factors and signaling pathways have been shown to be important for RPE  maintenance and differentiation, but an understanding of the initial  fate specification and determination of this ocular cell type is lacking.  We show that Yap/Taz-Tead activity is necessary and sufficient for  optic vesicle progenitors to adopt RPE identity in zebrafish. A Teadresponsive  transgene is expressed within the domain of the optic cup  from which RPE arises, and Yap immunoreactivity localizes to the  nuclei of prospective RPE cells. yap (yap1) mutants lack a subset of  RPE cells and/or exhibit coloboma. Loss of RPE in yap mutants is  exacerbated in combination with taz (wwtr1) mutant alleles such that,  when Yap and Taz are both absent, optic vesicle progenitor cells  completely lose their ability to form RPE. The mechanism of Yap dependent  RPE cell type determination is reliant on both nuclear  localization of Yap and interaction with a Tead co-factor. In contrast to  loss of Yap and Taz, overexpression of either protein within optic  vesicle progenitors leads to ectopic pigmentation in a dosagedependent  manner. Overall, this study identifies Yap and Taz as key  early regulators of RPE genesis and provides a mechanistic  framework for understanding the congenital ocular defects of  Sveinssonâ€™s chorioretinal atrophy and congenital retinal coloboma.

DESIGN
60 pooled eyes from 36 hpf wild type or vsx2:Gal4/dsRed:14xUAS:YapS87A embryos were pooled for one sample.  Three wild type and three vsx2:Gal4/dsRed:14xUAS:YapS87A pools were analyzed for RNA.
