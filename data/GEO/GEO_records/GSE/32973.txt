TITLE
Massive analysis of rice small RNAs: Mechanistic implications of regulated miRNAs and variants for differential target RNA cleavage

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Small RNAs have variety of important roles in plant development, stress responses, and other processes. They exert their influence by guiding mRNA cleavage, translational repression, and chromatin modification. To identify novel and regulated rice miRNAs, 62 small RNA libraries were constructed from rice plants and deeply sequenced with Illumina technology. The libraries represent several tissues from control plants and plants subjected to different environmental stress treatments. More than 94 million genome-matched reads were obtained resulting in more than 16 million distinct small RNA sequences. This allowed an evaluation with current criteria of about 400 annotated miRNAs and the finding that among these, about 150 had siRNA-like characteristics. Seventy nine new miRNAs were identified and miRNAs were distinguished that are regulated in response to water stress, nutrient stress, or temperature stress. Among the new examples of miRNA regulation were members of the same miRNA family that were differentially regulated in different organs and had distinct sequences Some of these distinct family members result in differential target cleavage and provide new insight about how an agriculturally important rice phenotype could be controlled in the panicle. This high resolution analysis of rice miRNAs should be relevant to plant miRNAs in general, particularly in the Poaceae.

DESIGN
Examination of different tissue types and  tissues treated with various environmental and nutrient stresses in rice by high throughput sequencing for small RNA profiling
