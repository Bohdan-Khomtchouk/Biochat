TITLE
small RNA-seq of Physcomitrella patens rdr mutants

ORGANISM
Physcomitrella patens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effects of rdr2 and rdr6 mutations upon small RNAs in Physcomitrella patens , small RNA-seq was performed.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples were obtained from wild-type, rdr2, and rdr6, and subject to small RNA-seq via the protocol described by Zheng et al. (2010) (PMID: 20941385)

PLATFORM
GPL9916 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Physcomitrella patens)
