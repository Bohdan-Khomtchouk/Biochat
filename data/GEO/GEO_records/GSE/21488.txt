TITLE
Genome-wide target discovery of transcripton factor E2F4 by ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor E2F4 is a member of the E2F family of regulators which has critical roles in cell cycle control and differentiation. In order to fully understand the physiological roles of E2F4 and the regulatory networks it mediates, and to reveal its relationships with other members of the E2F family, it is essential to comprehensively identify E2F4 target sites throughout the genome. Here, we investigated genome-wide E2F4 targets in human lymphoblastoid cells using the recently developed unbiased target discovery technique of ChIP sequencing.

DESIGN
We sequecned E2F4 ChIP and corresponding Input

PLATFORM
