TITLE
Brain RNA-seq one day after knockdown of the corazonin receptor in Harpegnathos ants

ORGANISM
Harpegnathos saltator

SUMMARY
This experiment aimed at determining the immediate (d1) transcriptional consequences of knockding down the corazonin receptor in the ant brain.

DESIGN
Dueling Harpegnathos individuals were removed from the transition colony and injected with corazonin receptor or GFP siRNAs to perform mRNA knockdown

PLATFORM
