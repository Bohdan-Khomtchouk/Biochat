TITLE
Epstein-Barr Viral miRNAs Broadly Inhibit Adaptive Immunity Early in Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Human gammaherpesvirus 4

SUMMARY
We revealed that, early in infection of human primary B cells, EBV's miRNAs regulate a wide array of immune functions encompassing antigen processing, HLAs and co-stimulatory molecules, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions.

DESIGN
Screening of mRNAs that are regulated by EBV's miRNAs examining transcriptomes and RISC-enriched RNAs from six human donors.
