TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression in the skin of WT and LynDeltaN mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The caspase cleaved form of the tyrosine kinase Lyn (LynDeltaN) mediates a psoriasis-like inflammatory syndrome in mice. To gain insights into the molecular mechanism of LynDeltaN in the control of this infllammatory process, we performed the pangenomic profile of  WT and LynDN skin from 5 day-old mice just before the entire inflammatory syndrom takes place.

DESIGN
Skin samples from 3 wt and 3 LynDN  transgenic mice were compared in a dye-swap experiment.
