TITLE
Differentiation analysis of Mouse Posterior Neural tube

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Posterior embryonic axis develops from neuromesodermal progenitors which differentiate into neural tube and paraxial mesoderm

DESIGN
Neural tube (NT) were dissected into 6 pieces in Stage E9.5 Mouse embryo. The experiment was designed to have biological duplicate in each pieces. Neural Tube was taken from 2 embryos to generate this dataset
