TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of GATA1, GATA2, RUNX1, FLI1 and SCL binding in primary human megakaryocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have mapped the binding sites for the five key regulators GATA1, GATA2, RUNX1, FLI1 and TAL1/SCL in primary human megakaryocytes. Statistical analysis identified subsets of enriched as well as depleted combinatorial binding patterns. In particular simultaneous binding by all 5 factors was highly enriched and occurred in the vicinity of many genes known to be involved in blood and megakaryocyte development. Knock down in zebrafish of 8 of these genes with no previously known role in hematopoiesis, revealed all to be essential for thrombocyte and/or erythroid development. Combinatorial analysis of multi-factor ChIP-Seq datasets coupled with a high-throughput in vivo screen therefore offers a powerful strategy to identify novel essential regulators of complex mammalian differentiation processes.

DESIGN
5 transcription factors and rabbit-IgG in megakaryocytes.
