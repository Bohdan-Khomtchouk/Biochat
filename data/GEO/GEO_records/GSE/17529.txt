TITLE
Tuber melanosporum gene expression in different tissues

ORGANISM
Corylus avellana ; Tuber melanosporum

SUMMARY
The Transcriptome of different tissues and developmental stages of Tuber melanosporum was analyzed. The array probes were designed from gene models taken from the French Genoscope - Centre National de Séquençage Tuber melanosporum genome sequence version 1. One aim of this study was to verify the expression of the automatically annotated gene models in various tissues and to use this transcriptional information to confirm, to correct or to reject gene models. Another goal was to identify tissue-specific gene expression, e.g. mycorrhiza up-regulated transcripts or fruiting body up-regulated transcripts for further detailed analyses.

DESIGN
The T. melanosporum custom-exon expression array (4 x 72K) manufactured by Roche NimbleGen Systems Limited (Madison, WI) contained five independent, nonidentical, 60-mer probes per gene model coding sequence. Included in the oligoarray were 12,232 annotated gene models, 3,913 random 60-mer control probes and labelling controls. Sequences used for the oligonucleotide design were from an early draft of the gene catalog containing several TE families. For 1,876 gene models, technical duplicates were included on the array. We performed 16 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from various tissues. Four samples were originated from ectomycorrhizae, five samples derived from fruiting bodies and seven samples from free-living mycelium . All samples were labeled with Cy3.
