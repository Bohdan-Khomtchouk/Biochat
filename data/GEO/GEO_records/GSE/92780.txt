TITLE
Heterogeneous tumor-immune microenvironments among differentially growing metastases in an ovarian cancer patient

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present an exceptional responder case of a patient with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, treated with multiple chemotherapy regimens, who exhibited regression of some metastatic lesions with concomitant progression of other lesion during a treatment-free period. Using an immunogenomics approach, we found that progressing metastases were infiltrated by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, exhibited oligoclonal expansion of specific T-cell subsets, and showed indications of neoepitope depletion. These findings imply that multiple distinct tumor immune microenvironments co-exist within a single individual and may explain in part the heterogenous fates of metastatic lesions often observed in the clinic post therapy. The goal of this particular experiment was quantify RNA expression using microarrays, and then evaluate differentially expressed genes and pathways between the different tumor samples.

DESIGN
Samples analyzed:1) Primary high-grade serous ovarian cancer, 2) Growing spleen metastasis, 3) Shrinking right upper quadrant metastasis, 4) Stable liver metastasis, 5) Growing vaginal cuff metastasis. No control healthy tissues were availabl.e
