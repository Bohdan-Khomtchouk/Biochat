TITLE
Global Gene expression profile of Phorone exposed to Chemically Transformed C3H10T1/2 cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we have investigated the changes in transformed cells that occur after GSH depletion and may be critical to accentuate the attenuation of carcinogenesis. The in vitro carcinogenesis method and GSH depletor Phorone (PHO) were used. We found that exposure of transformed C3H10T1/2 cells to PHO (2mM) caused attenuation of transformed cell growth as seen in soft agar assay. Loss of cellular GSH content, increase in intracellular ROS generation, and DNA strand break formation also occurred. A microarray based study using 8x60k oligonucleotide array in duplicate revealed changes in global gene expression profile. Our study has identified changes in expression of many genes that may contribute in abatement of carcinogenesis.
