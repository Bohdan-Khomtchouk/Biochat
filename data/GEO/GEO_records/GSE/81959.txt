TITLE
Effects of Sex, Strain, and Energy Intake on Hallmarks of Aging in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Calorie restriction (CR) is the most robust non-genetic intervention to universally delay the onset of age-related diseases and extend mean and maximum lifespan. However, species, strain, sex, diet, age of onset, and level of CR are emerging as important variables to consider for a successful CR response. Here, we investigated the role of strain, sex and level of CR on outcomes of health and survival in mice. Response to CR varied from lifespan extension to no effect on survival, while consistently delaying the onset and impact of diseases independently of strain, sex and level of dietary restriction. CR led to transcriptional and metabolomics changes in the liver indicating anaplerotic filling of the Krebs cycle together with fatty acid fueling of mitochondria. Additionally, CR prevented the age-associated decline in the proteostasis network. Further, CR increased mitochondrial number and preserved their ultrastructure and function with age. Abrogation of mitochondrial function by deletion of fumarate hydratase or malate dehydrogenase 2 negated the life-prolonging effects of CR in yeast and worms. In F1 hybrid strains of mice, the lifespan response to CR tracked with the dam, indicating that the mitochondrial haplotype is an important regulator of CR. Our data illustrate the complexity of the CR responses within a single animal species in the context of aging, with a clear separation of outcomes related to health and survival, highlighting the complexities of translation of CR into human interventions.

DESIGN
The study examines the effects of sex (male/female), mouse strain (DBA2/J versus C57BL/J), and diet (Ad libitum, 20% caloric restriction (20%CR), or 40%CR) using six biological replicate samples per group.
