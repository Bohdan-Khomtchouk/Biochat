TITLE
Integrated analysis of mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq reveals the potential roles of sex-biased miRNA-mRNA pairs in gonad tissue of dark sleeper (Odontobutis potamophila)

ORGANISM
Odontobutis potamophila

SUMMARY
We used next-generation sequencing technology to characterize mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq of testes and ovaries of Odontobutis potamophila to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation. We were able to find miRNA-mRNA pairs using bioinformatics analysis and miRNA prediction algorithms.

DESIGN
mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq examination of testes and ovaries in Odontobutis potamophila (Each sample type has three biological replicates).

PLATFORM
