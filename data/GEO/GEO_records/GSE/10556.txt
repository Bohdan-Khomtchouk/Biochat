TITLE
Comparision of expression profile between wild-type and Slc39a13 knockout chondrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to explore molecules whose expression is controlled by Slc39a13, we investigated gene expression profiling of primary chondrocyte isolated from wild-type and Slc39a13 knockout mice. Keywords: knockout vs wild-type
