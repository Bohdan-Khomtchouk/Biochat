TITLE
Disruption of STAT3 signaling promotes KRAS induced lung tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oncogenic STAT3 functions are known in various malignancies. We found that STAT3 plays an unexpected tumor suppressive role in KRAS-mutant non-small-cell-lung cancer (NSCLC). In mice, tissue-specific inactivation of Stat3 resulted in increased Kras (G12D)-driven NSCLC initiation and malignant progression leading to markedly reduced survival. Clinically, low STAT3 expression levels correlate with poor survival in human lung adenocarcinoma patients with smoking history. Consistently, KRAS-mutant lung tumors showed reduced STAT3 levels. Mechanistically, we show that STAT3 controls NFκB-induced IL-8-expression by sequestering NFκB in the cytoplasm while IL-8 in turn regulates myeloid tumor infiltration and tumor vascularization thereby promoting tumor progression. These results identify a novel STAT3-NFκB-IL-8 axis in KRAS-mutant NSCLC with therapeutic and prognostic relevance
