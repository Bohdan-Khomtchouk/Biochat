TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of NMN-induced disease resistance in  Arabidopsis thaliana.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We performed transcriptome analysis using an Agilent Arabidopsis ver.3 44k Microarray (Palo Alto, CA, USA) to profile effect of NMN treatment in uninoculated leaves and inoculated leaves with F. graminearum.

DESIGN
Four condition experiments. NMN-treated vs water-treated leaves. Inoculated leaves with F. graminearum after pretreatment of NMN vs Inoculated leaves after pretreatment of water. Two biological replicates.
