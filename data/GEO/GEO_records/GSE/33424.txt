TITLE
Expression data from human cord blood CD161++/CD161+/CD161- CD8+ T cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray to compare gene expression between CD161++/CD161+/CD161-CD8+ T cells from human cord blood.

DESIGN
Lymphocytes from freshly obtained human cord blood samples were isolated by Ficoll density centrifugation. CD8+ T cells were purified by negative selection using magnetic beads and subsequently labelled with fluorescent antibodies prior to sorting using MoFlo MLS cell sorter (Dako).
