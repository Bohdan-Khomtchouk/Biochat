TITLE
In vitro study of gene expression and response to chemotherapy across 50 human-melanoma derived cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify patterns of gene expression that correlate with response to treatment with either melphalan or temozolomide we measured both gene expression using microarray genechips and response to drug using a standard in vitro cell proliferation assay.  Senstivity to melphalan was measured 48hrs after drug treatment while sensitivity to temozolomide was measured 12 days after drug treatment. Keywords: Patterns of gene expression predictive of response to chemotherapy with melphalan or temozolomide in melanoma
