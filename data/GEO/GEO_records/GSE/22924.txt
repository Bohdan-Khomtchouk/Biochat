TITLE
Lodgepole pine_Bark_Grosmannia clavigera_inoculation

ORGANISM
Pinus contorta

SUMMARY
Using 21K spruce microarray (that contains 21.8 thousand unique transcripts) we performed analysis of the transcriptome response of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) inoculated with the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) vectored fungal pathogen Grosmannia clavigera or treated with wounding. This microarray analysis revealed large transcriptome reorganization with close to 2000 transcripts (10% of the studied transcriptome) differentially expressed within two weeks of treatment, with the wounding response affecting close to 2% of the lodgepole pine transcriptome.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from the bark of lodgepole pine inoculated with Grosmannia clavigera, treated with wounding, or untreated control for three time points (6h, 2days and 2 weeks). Three independent biological replicates were included for each treatment and each time point. Three hybridizations were performed for each comparison of different treatments (fungal, wounding, control) within each time point (6 hours, 2 days, 2 weeks) and one hybridization was performed for the comparison of the same treatments between time points (total 36 hybridizations/slides).
