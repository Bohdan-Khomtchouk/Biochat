SUMMARY
Using 21K spruce microarray (that contains 21.8 thousand unique transcripts) we performed analysis of the transcriptome response of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) inoculated with the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) vectored fungal pathogen Grosmannia clavigera or treated with wounding. This microarray analysis revealed large transcriptome reorganization with close to 2000 transcripts (10% of the studied transcriptome) differentially expressed within two weeks of treatment, with the wounding response affecting close to 2% of the lodgepole pine transcriptome.
