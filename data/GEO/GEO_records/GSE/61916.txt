TITLE
Genome-wide maps of PARP-1-bound nucleosomes (human)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PARP-1 binds to specific nucleosomes to regulate gene activity. While PARP-1's role in transcription inititaion is known, a surprising finding here was that PARP-1 is highly enriched at exon-intron and intron-exon boundaries, sort of demarcting exons. Thius indicating a role in alternative splicing.
