TITLE
Comparative GeneChip expression profiling of four brain regions

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Study on selective vulnerability of certain brain regions to oxidative stress. Here we selected 4 brain regions (hippocampal CA1 and CA3, cerebral cortex, and cerebellar granular layer) to study this phenomenon. Keywords: Comparative analysis of different regions of the brain.

DESIGN
Neurons were collected from the 4 regions of the rat brain and subjected to Affymetrix RAE230A analysis, in order to identify genes related to the differential vulnerability of the neurons to oxidative stress.
