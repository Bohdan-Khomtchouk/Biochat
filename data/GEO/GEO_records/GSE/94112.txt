TITLE
Whole Genome microarray analysis BMDMs from cmo (Pstpip2 functional knockout), cmo IL1R+/-, and cmo IL-1R-/- mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Because the cmo mouse (model of human CRMO) is protected from disease on an IL1R-/- background, a gene expression microarray experiment was performed to determine which genes are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of disease in the context of the absence of IL1R activity. RNA was extracted from cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages from the three mouse strains and analyzed for differential gene expression.

DESIGN
RNA from three mice was used for the three different strains (cmo, cmo IL1R+/-, IL1R-/-), for a total of 9 samples.
