TITLE
Down-regulation of linc00598 affects cell cycle related genes in HEK293t cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
linc00598 is a nuclear localized long noncoding RNA which transcribed in downstream of FoxO1. Previous studies showed that several nuclear retained lncRNAs function as transcriptional regulators. To find out the function of linc00598 as a transcriptional regulator, we performed microarray analysis using linc00598 knock down stable HEK293t cells. The results showed that positive cell cycle regulation related genes including cyclin D2 were regulated transcriptionally by linc00598. It was also observed that knock down of linc00598 induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibit proliferation. Therefore linc00598 represents a novel cell cycle regulatory lncRNA and may be involved in promoting transformation of human cells.

DESIGN
We used lentiviral based shRNAs to knockdown linc00598 in human HEK293t cells. We harvested total RNA from linc00598 knockdown and control knockdown samples and subjected the total RNA to microarray analysis (two replicates for each condition)
