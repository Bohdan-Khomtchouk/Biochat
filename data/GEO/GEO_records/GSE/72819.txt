TITLE
Gene expression of baseline biopsies from etrolizumab-treated ulcerative colitis (UC) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing was performed on RNA isolated from baseline biopsies from UC patients enrolled in the Phase II EUCALYPTUS study of etrolizumab. Gene expression differences were identified in a subset of anti-TNF na√Øve patients that achieved clinical remission at 10 weeks in response to etrolizumab.

DESIGN
Baseline colonic biopsies from UC patients treated with etrolizumab were sequenced by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencing System.
