TITLE
Comparison between immune cells from mice challenged with Bacille Calmette Gu√©rin (BCG)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microglia and macrophages are immune cells that differ in the inflammatory response to immune challenge.  The purpose of this study was to  profile mRNA levels (transcriptome) to better understand differences between immune cells 7 days after BCG challenge

DESIGN
total RNA samples were obtained from 12 mice 7 days after  and immune cell type and were subjected to paired-end RNA sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
