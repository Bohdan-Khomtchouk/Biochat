TITLE
Transcripts enriched in microsome fraction in ribosome-independent manner

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To identify the transcripts fractionated into microsome fraction in ribosome-independent manner, we isolate rough microsome fraction by sucrose density gradient ultracengrifugation, then the rough microsome fraction is centrifugated following treatment with puromycine and EDTA in high-salt buffer to remove ribosomes. The pellet and surpernatant are named naked microsome fraction (NM) and stripped ribosome fraction (SR), respectively.  By calculating the ratio of the level of each mRNA in NM and SR, we identify the enriched transcripts in NM.

DESIGN
Transcript profiles of subcellular fractions from S2-DRSC Drosophila cultured cell
