TITLE
Effects of RUNX1 knockdown in AR signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and AR downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. We identified RUNX1 is an androgen-regulated gene. In order to investigate the RUNX1 function in prostate cancer cells, we performed gene expression in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines after siRUNX1 treatment. We also treated cells with vehicle or androgen to analyzed the effects of RUNX1 on AR function.

DESIGN
Observation of androgen dependent gene expression changes after treatmet with siRNAs targeting RUNX1 with microarray.
