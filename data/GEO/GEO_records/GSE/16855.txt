TITLE
Expression data from OBGF400 cell line (porcine olfactory bulb neuroblast origin)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The phenotypically characterized hTERT immortalized porcine olfactory bulb neuroblast cell line (OBGF400) was subjected to an extensive whole genome-scaled expression profile for establishing their use as an in vitro neuronal disease model system. Microarrays were used to provide a comprehensive knowledge underlying the genomic complexity and overall gene expression capacity of the immortalized OBGF400 cells. The analysis revealed the elaborate signaling mechanisms of this unique subpopulation of porcine neuronally committed progenitors that mirrors the intricate organization of postnatal neurongenic zones.

DESIGN
Total cellular RNA extracts from independent OBGF400 (neuroblasts) and PK15 (non-neuronal, epithelial origin) cell cultures (9 each) were pooled into a total of 3 biological replicates per cell line. The concentrations and purity of the pooled RNA preparations were determined using the BioAgilent RNA assay prior to hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Porcine Genome Expression Arrays. To ascertain the genes that were preferentially expressed by the OBGF400 neuroblasts, we used the PK15 cellular array in an effort to exclude somatic cell background.
