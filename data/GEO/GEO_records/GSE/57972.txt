TITLE
Analysis of aortic gene expression in ovariectomized ApoE-deficient mice substituted with medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethisterone acetate or placebo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Agilent 4x44k Whole Mouse Genome v1 Microarrays were used to analyze aortic transcriptome of mice substituted with medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethisterone acetate or placebo after having been ovariectomized. The aim of this experiment was to detect genes regulated in the gestagen-treated groups as compared to placebo that might be involved in thrombotic events

DESIGN
Aortic gene expression was analyzed in ApoE-deficient mice after ovariectomy and 90 days of hormone- or placebo-treatment (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone acetate) and feeding a high-fat Western-type diet.
