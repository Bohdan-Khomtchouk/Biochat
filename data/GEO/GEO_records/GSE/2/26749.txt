TITLE
Gene expression of cerebellar Purkinje cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed gene-expression analysis of mouse Purkinje cells as a model “single-type neuron”. DNA microarray analysis detected at least 7,055 genes in Purkinje cells, most of which are classified into functional molecule categories. Our comparative analysis between Purkinje cells and the granule cell layer showed that the characteristic expression pattern in Purkinje cells was particularly represented by “the neural communication system” components.

DESIGN
Pukinje cells and granule cell layer of the mouse cerebellum were collected by laser microdissection for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
