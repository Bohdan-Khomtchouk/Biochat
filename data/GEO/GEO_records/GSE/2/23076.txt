TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles in a Rabbit Model of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We previously reported the establishment of a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) model of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in which peptide immunization led to lupus-like autoantibody production including anti-Sm, -RNP, -SS-A, -SS-B and -dsDNA. Some neurological symptoms in form of seizures and nystagmus were observed.  The animals used in the previous and in the present study were from a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases colony of rabbits that were pedigreed, immunoglobulin allotype-defined but not inbred. Their genetic heterogeneity may correspond to that found among patients of a given ethnicity.  We extended the information about this rabbit model of SLE by microarray based expression profiling. We first demonstrated that human expression arrays could be used with rabbit RNA to yield information on molecular pathways. We then designed a study evaluating gene expression profiles in 8 groups of control and SLE rabbits (46 rabbits in total). Genes significantly upregulated in SLE rabbits were associated with NK cytotoxicity, antigen presentation, leukocyte migration, cytokine activity, protein kinases, RNA spliceosomal ribonucleoproteins, intracellular signaling cascades, and glutamate receptor activity. These results link increased immune activation with up-regulation of components associated with neurological and anti-RNP responses, demonstrating the utility of the rabbit SLE model to uncover biological pathways related to SLE-induced clinical symptoms, including Neuropsychiatric Lupus. Our finding of distinct gene expression patterns in rabbits that made anti-dsDNA compared to those that only made other anti-nuclear antibodies should be further investigated in subsets of SLE patients with different autoantibody profiles.
