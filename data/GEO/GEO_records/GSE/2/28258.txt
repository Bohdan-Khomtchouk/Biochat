TITLE
Alternative splicing changes in A. fumigatus sensitized mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dysregulation of alternative splicing of mRNA precursors is known to  contribute to numerous human diseases. In this study we carried out  the first systematic search for asthma-associated changes in  alternative splicing events, using a model of Aspergillus fumigatus (A.  fumigatus)-sensitized mice and an exon junction microarray to detect  potential changes in alternative splicing. One of the  sensitization-associated changes identified in the search was a shift  in alternative splicing of the mRNA encoding cFLIP, a modulator of the  caspase- mediated extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Expanding these studies  to human asthma patients, we discovered a significant decrease in the  expression of both cFLIP isoforms in severe corticosteroid- resistant  asthmatics. Although it is unclear whether these changes were due  solely to differences in alternative splicing, these findings provide evidence that dysregulation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway is part  of the underlying immunopathogenesis of severe refractory asthma.

DESIGN
The technical side of the microarray experiment was essentially the  Illumina protocol.
