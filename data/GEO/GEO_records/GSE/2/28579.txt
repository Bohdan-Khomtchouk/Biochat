TITLE
Tye7 regulates yeast Ty1 retrotransposon sense and antisense transcription in response to adenylic nucleotides stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of adenine starvation on the global yeast transcriptome. In this work, global transcription analyses were combined with measurements of intracellular nucleotides pools by HPLC.

DESIGN
The bas1delta strain grown with or without adenine was compared to the WT strain grown with or without adenine. For each comparison, we performed 2 technical replicates, swapping dyes.
