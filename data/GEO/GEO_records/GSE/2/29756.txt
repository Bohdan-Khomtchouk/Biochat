TITLE
Queen conch (Strombus gigas) ovarian gene expression in the Florida Keys: offshore versus nearshore

ORGANISM
Strombus gigas

SUMMARY
Reproduction of queen conchs at nearshore sites in the Florida Keys is known to be impaired (Delgado et al. 2004). A recent microarray study of male queen conchs collected from the Florida Keys during the early part of the reproductive season (February, 2007) indicated that NS conchs show differences in expression of spermatogenesis-related and small GTPase signaling transcripts (Spade et al. 2010). The current study investigates gene expression in the ovary of female queen conchs from the same sampling effort in February, 2007.

DESIGN
One-color (Cy3) oligonucleotide array experiment. Each array sample is an individual biological replicate. The study includes four biological replicates offshore and three biological replicate nearshore. Offshore conchs exhibit normal reproduction, and so were considered the reference group in the analysis.
