TITLE
HeLa gene expression profile

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression in HeLa cells was profiled using Affymetrix gene expression Human HG-U133_Plus_2 array.  Transcript signal was mapped against the chromosome coordinates (probe-by-probe basis) using the HG-U133A_2 Annotations CSV file for hg18 build of the human genome provided by Affymetrix.
