TITLE
Expression analysis of Wv/Wv fetal gonads

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Following sex determination, XY and XX gonads develop into a testis and an ovary, respectively. Depending on the sex of the gonad, resident germ cells will subsequently be committed to either spermatogenesis or oogenesis. In this study we took advantage of the Wv/Wv mouse genetic model, in which gonads are almost devoided of germ cells, to uncover gene expression underlying fetal germ cell development.

DESIGN
Male and Female gonads were collected at 12, 14 and 16 days post coitum (dpc) from wild-type and Wv/Wv mouse embryos. Total RNAs were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Expression signals from male and female gonads or from wild-type and mutant gonads were compared to identify sexually dimorphic genes as well as genes expressed in germ cell during fetal gonad development.
