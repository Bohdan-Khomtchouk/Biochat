TITLE
Gene expression in astrocytes upon sustained GSK-3 inhibition by small molecule

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify molecular targets that mediates the stimulation of astrocyte's migration upon sustained specific inhibition of GSK-3, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling. Murine cortical-striatal astrocytes grown in primary culture were treated in vitro for 48 h with either 1 micromolar Ro3303544, or control medium (final equivalent concentration of DMSO), or washed-out for 48h in control medium after an initial 48h treatment with 1 micromolar Ro3303544.

DESIGN
The three different conditions: Ctrl, Ro and wash-out (each in duplicate) were compared.
