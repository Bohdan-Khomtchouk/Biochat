TITLE
CcpA regulon in L. plantarum

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
This data set contains samples from Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 wild type and its CcpA mutant derivative. Both strains were grown in duplicate (samples L and R) and at four different growth stages samples were taken (early, mid and late log phase, early stationary phase). Samples were compared to each other within one strain and between the two strains. This allows the comparison of the wild type strain to its CcpA derivative in time. Further it allows comparison within one strain during different growth stages.
