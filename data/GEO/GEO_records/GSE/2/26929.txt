TITLE
Expression data from yeast strain VIN13 overexpressing the transcription factor SOK2

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Industrial wine yeast strains are geno- and phenotypically highly diversified, and have adapted to the ecological niches provided by industrial wine making environments. These strains have been selected for very specific and diverse purposes, and the adaptation of these strains to the oenological environment is a function of the specific expression profiles of their genomes. It has been proposed that some of the primary targets of yeast adaptation are functional binding sites of transcription factors (TF) and the transcription factors themselves. Sequence divergence or regulatory changes related to specific transcription factors would lead to far-reaching changes in overall gene expression patterns, which will in turn impact on specific phenotypic characteristics of different yeast species/ strains. Variations in transcriptional regulation between different wine yeast strains could thus be responsible for rapid adaptation to different fermentative requirements in the context of commercial wine-making. In this study, we compare the transcriptional profiles of five different wine yeast strains in simulated wine-making conditions: Comparative analyses of gene expression profiles in the context of TF regulatory networks provided new insights into the molecular basis for variations in gene expression in these industrial strains. We also show that the metabolic phenotype of one strain can indeed be shifted in the direction of another by modifying the expression of key transcription factors. SOK2 was one target transcription factor identified in this study. This expression factor was overexpressed in order to validate our hypotheses that altered expression levels of key transcription factors could shift metabolism in a directed, predicted manner.
