TITLE
Human glioma cells treated with irradiation and/or CCI-779

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of human glioma cell line LN-308. Cells were treated with the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 or irradiated with a single dose of 4 Gy or a combination of both. The objective of this studywas to evaluate CCI-779 as a radio-sensitizing agent and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

DESIGN
Irradiated, CCI-779-, DMSO- (vehicle control) or combination treated LN-308 samples were hybridized against pooled untreated LN-308 samples as reference (CCI+Irradiation vs. Ref; CCI vs. Ref; DMSO+Irradiation vs Ref; DMSO vs. Ref).Three independent replicates were generated for each treatment and control, respectively.
