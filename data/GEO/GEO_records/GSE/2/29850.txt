TITLE
Identification of Notch targets in human endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were transduced with either MIY-N1IC (Notch1 intracellular domain) or MIY vector control. The cells were sorted for YFP, and RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and analyzed by the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Results were analyzed using the GCRMA algorithm to identify genes with a minimum of 2-fold induction or reduction. This global gene expression study was used to identify Notch targets in the endothelium.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of primary HUVECs transduced with N1IC. HUVEC primary cells were isolated, transduced with N1IC or vector (MIY) control in three biological replicates, and evaluated on Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.
