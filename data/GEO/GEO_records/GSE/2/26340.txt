TITLE
Effect of expression of M.HpyAVIB, a C5 cytosine methyltransferase on the E. coli BL21 (DE3) transcriptome

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Helicobacter pylori genome is rich in restriction - modification (R-M) systems. Around 4 % of the genome codes for components of R-M systems. hpyAVIBM, which codes for a putative phase-variable C5 - cytosine methyltransferase (MTase) from H. pylori lacks a cognate restriction enzyme.
