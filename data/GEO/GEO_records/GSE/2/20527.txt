TITLE
Effect of BMP4 and noggin on gene expression in murine R1 ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To confirm that the SMAD1/5- and SMAD4-associated genes are direct transcriptional regulators in mESCs in response to BMP, we treated undifferentiated R1 ES cells with BMP4 or with the BMP4 antagonist noggin, which can inhibit BMP signaling effectively for 4 h.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated R1 ES cells were treated for 4 h with BMP4 or with the BMP4 antagonist noggin, which can inhibit BMP signaling effectively. Untreated R1 ES cells served as the control.
