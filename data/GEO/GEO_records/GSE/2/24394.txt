TITLE
Gene expression affected by the AtWOX14 gene mutation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au09-02_wox14 - wox13 orthologous group - The WOX13 OG contained the most conserved plant WOX proteins including the only WOX detected in the highly proliferating basal unicellular and photosynthetic organism Ostreococcus tauri. In Arabidopsis thaliana, AtWOX13 was dynamically expressed during primary and lateral root initiation and development, in gynoecium and during embryo development. An intriguing clade, represented by the functional AtWOX14 gene inside the WOX13 OG, was only found in the Brassicaceae. Compared to AtWOX13, the gene expression profile of AtWOX14 was restricted to the early stages of lateral root formation and specific to developing anthers. A mutational insertion upstream of the AtWOX14 homeodomain sequence led to abnormal root development, a delay in the floral transition and premature anther differentiation. Our scope is to establish a functional link to organ initiation and development in Arabidopsis by identifying genes that are deregulated in the wox14 mutant background. - Transcriptome analyses of the transposon donor line N8514 and the wox14 mutant seedlings grown for 6 and 10 days (growth stages 1.02 and 1.04) in LD condition (i. e. 4 days of cold treatment on 0.5 MS medium, 1% sucrose, 0.7% agar + respectively 6 and 10 days of in vitro growth in LD condition). Keywords: gene knock out
