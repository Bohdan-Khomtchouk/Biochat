TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomewide gene expression analysis of lymphoid cell lines of Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin and acute leukemia origin

DESIGN
Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays were hybridized to determine the gene expression profile of Hodgkin (L428, L1236, KM-H2, HDLM-2, L540, L540Cy), non-Hodgkin (Namalwa, SU-DHL-4) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Reh) cell lines; all hybridizations were done in biological duplicates (except L540, L50Cy, SU-DHL-4).
