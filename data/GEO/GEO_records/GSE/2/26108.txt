TITLE
Gene expression in colon tissue of rats fed digestion resistant carbohydrates

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Conventionally raised and germ-free newly weaned male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a basal diet or a diet supplemented with digestion resistant carbohydrates in the form of inulin, resistant starch or konjac flour.  Gene expression in colon tissue was measured to characterise interaction between food, microbes and host.

DESIGN
2 colour microarray, reference design.  Biological replicates: 6 for all groups except for conventionally raised rats fed inulin, which consisted of 5 biological replicates
