TITLE
Expression data from wild-type and Zmpste24-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) at an early passage (passage 3, P3)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Zmpste24 is a metalloproteinase processing prelamin A into mature lamin A, a nuclear structure protein. Zmpste24-/- mice which accumulate prelamin A in cells recapitulate accelerated aging phenotypes observed in human premature aging disorder, Hutchinson Gilford progeria sydrome (HGPS). Zmpste24-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited genomic instabiliy and accelerated aging at cellular level, which is premature senescence. We performed microarray analysis on Zmpste24-/- MEFs, compared to wild-type littermates' MEFs, at an early passage (P3), which is a pre-symptom stage before cellular senescence occurs in the mutant MEFs, in order to examine gene expression profile and figure out the underneath mechanism triggering the premature aging process.

DESIGN
Early passage wild-type and Zmpste24-/- MEFs were collected for RNA extraction, the quality of RNAs were determinded by Electrophoresis Assay (2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent) and RNA extractions were used for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
