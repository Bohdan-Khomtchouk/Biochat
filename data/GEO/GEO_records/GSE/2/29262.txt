TITLE
Functional Plasticity of Regulatory T Cell Function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) can suppress a wide variety of cell types, in diverse organ sites and inflammatory conditions.  While Tregs possess multiple suppressive mechanisms, the number required for maximal function is unclear.  Furthermore, whether any inter-relationship orcross-regulatory mechanisms exist that areused to orchestrate and control their utilization is unknown.  Here we assessed the functional capacity of Tregs lacking the ability to secrete both interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-35, which individually are required for maximal Treg activity.  Surprisingly, IL-10/IL-35-double deficient Tregswere fully functionalin vitro and in vivo. Loss of IL-10 and IL-35 was compensated for by a concurrent increase in cathepsin E (CTSE) expression, enhanced TRAIL (Tnfsf10)expression and soluble TRAIL release, rendering IL-10/IL-35-double deficient Tregsfunctionally dependent on TRAIL in vitro and in vivo.  Lastly, while C57BL/6 Tregs are IL-10/IL-35-dependent, Balb/c Tregs, which express high levels of CTSE and enhanced TRAIL expression, are TRAIL-dependent.These data reveal that cross-regulatory pathways exist, which control the utilization of suppressive mechanisms,thereby providing Tregfunctional plasticity.

DESIGN
Isolate natural Tregs from the different knockout mouse
