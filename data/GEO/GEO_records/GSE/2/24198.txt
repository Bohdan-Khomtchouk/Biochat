TITLE
Deep-sequencing of total RNA from manually dissected wild-type and kyp-2m/KYPp Arabidopsis embryos

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This dataset provide deep-profiling of the embryonic transcriptome of total RNA at an early developmental stage (2-to-4 cells stage) and at the globular stage in Arabidopsis. Embryos were derived from either a cross between a Landsberg erecta (Ler) maternal parent and a Columbia (Col0) paternal parent or a cross between a kyp-2 Ler maternal parent and a Columbia paternal parent. Embryos were manually dissected ensuring no contamination with maternal seed coat or endosperm.

DESIGN
6 samples: crosses between Ler and Col, or kyp-2 (Ler) and Col; Ler seed coat at 2-4cells embryo stage # SC_2.
