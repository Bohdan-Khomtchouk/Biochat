TITLE
MYBPH, a novel transcriptional target of NKX2-1/TTF-1, inhibits ROCK1 and actomyosin assembly, and reduces cell motility and tumor metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell migration driven by actomyosin filament assembly is a critical step in tumour invasion and metastasis. Herein, we report identification of myosin binding protein H (MYBPH) as a transcriptional target of NKX2-1 (also known as TTF-1 and TITF1), a lineage-survival oncogene in lung adenocarcinoma. MYBPH inhibits assembly competence-conferring phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) as well as activating phosphorylation of LIM domain kinase (LIMK). These are unexpectedly implemented through direct physical interaction of MYBPH with Rho kinase 1 (ROCK1) rather than with RLC. In addition, MYBPH is shown to directly bind with non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC IIA), resulting in inhibition of NMHC IIA assembly. Thus, MYBPH plays multi-facetted roles in negative regulation of actomyosin organization, which in turn reduces cell motility, invasion, and metastasis. Finally, we also show that MYBPH is epigenetically inactivated by promoter DNA methylation in a fraction of lung adenocarcinomas abundantly expressing NKX2-1, which appears to be in accordance with its deleterious function for lung adenocarcinoma invasion and metastasis, as well as with the paradoxical association of NKX2-1 expression with favourable prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients.

DESIGN
Dye-swap experiment, vector control vs. transiently transfectanted with TTF-1 in HPL1D, immortalized human peripheral lung epithelial cell line.
