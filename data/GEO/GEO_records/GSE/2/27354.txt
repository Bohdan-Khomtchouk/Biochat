TITLE
Glycogene expression changes between different passages in the 4T1 Mouse metastatic breast cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This laboratory's focus is on the immune response to carbohydrate antigens, with an emphasis on modalities to analyze and to increase the immune response. We are also interested in carbohydrate drug targeting. The hypothesis is that these 2 variants have different cell surface carbohydrate expression, which results in different adhesion patterns, which ultimately results in different metastasis patterns. Evidence for expression differences and loss of the variants ability to metastasize to the lung could have clinical implications in the prevention of metastasis to different organs.
