TITLE
ETS2 and Mesp1 trans-differentiate human dermal fibroblasts into cardiac progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We explored the role of mammalian ETS1/2 and Mesp homologues of cardiogenic transcription factors of Ciona intestinalis, to convert primary human dermal fibroblasts into cardiac progenitors. ETS1/2 and Mesp homologues of cardiogenic transcription factors of Ciona intestinalis, to convert primary human dermal fibroblasts into cardiac progenitors. Here we show murine Ets2 has an obligatory role for directing cardiac progenitors during cardiopoesis in embryonic stem cells. ETS2 converted fibroblasts into KDR/Flk1+ replicative cells but, like the purported cardiac master regulatory gene Mesp1, could not by itself generate cardiac progenitors de novo from fibroblasts. Co-expression of both Ets2 and Mesp1, however, successfully reprogrammed differentiated fibroblasts into cardiac progenitors, as shown by the de novo appearance of core cardiac transcription factors, gap junction proteins, sarcomeric proteins, electrical activity and contractility. ETS2 and Mesp1 sit at the pinnacle of the cardiopoesis regulatory hierarchy and are well suited for treating human heart disease.

DESIGN
All sample were done in triplicates, controls were NHDF and ETS2 only infected cells. NHDF were first infected with Doxycyline redulated (Doxy-) ETS2 lentivirus and supplemented with doxycycline for 1 week, sequentially cells were infected with Doxy-Mesp1 and treated for 1 more week. Cells were then aggegated to form EB and hangdrop for 1 week, at the end of that period cells were plated and samples were taken every 24 hrs
