TITLE
Molecular Mechanisms of Bortezomib Resistant Adenocarcinoma cells [CGH data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number and Gene expression profiling of HT-29 wild-type and bortezomib resistant cell lines Identification of mechanisms of bortezomib resistance

DESIGN
Copy number differences between HT-29 cell line variants and a HapMap control population of 9 female samples were identified using the Agilent 1M Human CGH microarray
