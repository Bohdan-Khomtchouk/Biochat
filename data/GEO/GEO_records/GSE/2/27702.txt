TITLE
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses Avoid Effective Inflammatory Response of Human Macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Macrophages were infected with low (PR8) and high pathogenic influenza viruses (FPV and H5N1). To our surprise a genome-wide comparative systems biology approach revealed that in contrast PR8 infections with HPAIV H5N1 and FPV result in a reduced immune response of human macrophages contradicting a primary role of this cell type for the cytokine storm. Our data point to a viral strategy of HPAIV to bypass a major amplifier of the initial local inflammatory response thereby hampering antiviral effector mechanisms and facilitating virus spreading and systemic disease.
