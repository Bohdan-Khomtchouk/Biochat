TITLE
RNA-seq of two paired normal and cancer tissues in two stage III colorectal cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The RNA from two paired normal and colorectal tumor tissue were sequenced by Illumina genome analyzer. 0.8 to 1.1 million reads were generated. Sequencing data was aligned with human RNA, human mitochondrial DNA and human genomic DNA by BWA.  Base calling and Phred-like score was calculated by SAMTools.

DESIGN
Whole transcriptome sequence of paired normal and tumor tissues obtained from two colorectal cancer patients
