TITLE
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of iNPCs induced by 6 or 5 TFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To clarify the gene expression profile of iNPC, microarray analysis was performed using iNPCs induced by 6 TFs (Pax6, Hmga2, Etv6, Gatad2b, Nfxl1, and Esx1) and 5 TFs (Esx1 was omitted from 6 TFs). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering indicated that iNPC is expressing a global transcriptional profile more similar to that of NPCs rather than that of MEFs, and suggested that the TFs present in the pool acted as inducing TFs.

DESIGN
iNPCs were induced from MEF using 6 or 5 transcription factors. iNPCs were induced from MEF (MEFSH, derived from mice carrying IRES-Hygro in Sox allele) using retroviral vectors (pMXs-IRESNeo) of 6 or 5 transcription factors. Four weeks after the infection, Hygromycin was added and cultured for 1 week before the harvest. NSBAg2 and NSEB5-2C were used for the data of NPC. GSM396240 and GSM336010 were used for the data of ESC.GSM651349 and GSM336011 were used for the data of MEF.
