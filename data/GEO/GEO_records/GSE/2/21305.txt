TITLE
Profiling neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y with Paraquat treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with paraquat, a neurotoxic herbicide which both catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induces mitochondrial damage in animal models was profiled using Affimetrix Exon 1.0 ST GeneChipsÂ®

DESIGN
Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells was compared with respect to Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with Paraquat. Parqaut treatment was done as described by Maracchioni, A., Totaro, A., Angelini, D.F., Di Penta, A., Bernardi, G., Carri, M.T., and Achsel, T. (2007) J Neurochem 100, 142-153
