TITLE
ADIPOSE TISSUE PATHWAYS INVOLVED IN WEIGHT LOSS OF CANCER CACHEXIA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The regulatory gene pathways underlying the loss of adipose tissue in cancer cachexia are unknown and were explored using pangenomic transcriptome profiling.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles (Human Gene 1.0 ST) of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue were studied in gastrointestinal cancer patients with (N=13) or without (N=14) cachexia. Data analyses were performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) Version 1.4.
