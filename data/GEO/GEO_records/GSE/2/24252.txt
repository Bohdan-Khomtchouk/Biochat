TITLE
miRNA profiling in adult rat cardiomyocytes and myocyte-derived progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TLDA miRNA profiling on purified rat cardiomyocytes (Myo) (Ctl) and myocyte-derived progenitor cells (MDCs) demonstrated significant dedifferentiation of myocytes and identity of stemness, cell cycle progression and proliferation in MDCs after continuous culture in mitogen-rich medium for about 2 weeks.
