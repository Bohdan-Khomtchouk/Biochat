TITLE
Neuroblastoma Neuro2A Cell Differentiation induced by retinoic acid-treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate a role of mKIAA genes in early stage of neurite outgrowth, in vitro time course experiment was performed using the mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells and all-trans-retinoic acid. Six time points of 8 biological replicates were performed.These data were normalized by median intensities and subtracted background intensities. NOTE: Outlier involved several data were not deposited. Keywords: time-course
