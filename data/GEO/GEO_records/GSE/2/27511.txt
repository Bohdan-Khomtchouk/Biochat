TITLE
Immunomagnetic enrichment and flow cytometric isolation of breast cancer circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for genomic characterization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a novel approach to isolate tumor cells with high purity from blood via immunomagnetic enrichment followed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (IE/FACS) and examined copy number alterations in these cells. Magnetic beads coated with EpCAM mAb were added to blood to enrich for tumor cells. Enriched samples were then subjected to FACS analysis using differentially labeled mAbs to distinguish tumor cells (EpCAM+) from leukocytes (CD45+) during sorting. DNA from isolated tumor cells was subjected to whole genome amplification (WGA) and copy number analysis via array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The assay was evaluated using BT474 and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines and in CTCs from 5 metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with matched archival primary tumors and later extended to an additional 97 MBC patients.
