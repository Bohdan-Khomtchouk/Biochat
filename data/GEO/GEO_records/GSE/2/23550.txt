TITLE
Circadian cycling of genome-wide histone methylation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Daily (circadian) clocks are essential for regulating and coordinating physiology in mammals. Modulation of local chromatin structure has been shown for only a small number of genes, principally thought to be directly modulated by Clock-mediated histone acetylation. Here we show that genome-wide changes of active and suppressive histone marks control global chromatin architecture over the day and night.
