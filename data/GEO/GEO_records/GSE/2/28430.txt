TITLE
Circadian expression data of Synechococcus in WT, rpoD6-null, sasA-null and rpaA-null strains

ORGANISM
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

SUMMARY
In the unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, most genes show rhythmic expression controlled by the Kai-based clock under continuous light conditions (LL). We found that rpoD6-null mutants impaired expression of clock-controlled genes peaking at hours 8-10 in LL, while sasA-null or rpaA-null mutants each arrested the expression profiles at subjective dawn.
