TITLE
Gene expression profiles of the egg and synergid cell in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To reveal comprehensive gene expression profiles and their characteristics of the rice egg and synergid cell, we performed cell type-specific microarray analysis using nonenzymatic cell isolation technique. 40 and 50 genes expressed specifically in the egg cell and synergid cell were identified by cluster analysis using microarray results including that of control samples. Furthermore, we found that the differences in the gene expression profiles of the egg cell and the synergid cell were more extensive than previously realized, indicating that these reproductive cells are specified during the short period encompassing the three sequential mitotic nuclear divisions after generation of the megaspore.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis in five samples (egg cell, synergid cell, ovary with or without mannitol treatment, and whole plant) were performed. Three biological replicates were prepared for each sample.
