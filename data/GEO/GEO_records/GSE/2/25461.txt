TITLE
Gene expression of three prostate lobes, ventral prostate (VP), dorsal lateral prostate (DLP), and anterior prostate (AP), by cholesterol diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Understanding the systemic regulation of normal prostate gene expression by cholesterol diet is critical for deciphering the mechanisms responsible for the transition from healthy to pathogenic prostate conditions. To understand mechanism under cholesterol effect on prostate, we performed microarray analysis using prostate tissues from SCID or C57BL/6 mice feed with varying diet conditions containing high, low or normal cholesterol.
