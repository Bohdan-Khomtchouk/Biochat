TITLE
Up regulation of lactosamine containing glycans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Schwarting's research is focused on the analysis of developmentally regulated cell surface molecules and their role in axon guidance and neuronal migration, using the olfactory system as a model. The interaction of cell surface glycans with endogenous lectins in the extracellular matrix provides one mechanism by which axons can utilize specific pathways as they grow towards their targets.
