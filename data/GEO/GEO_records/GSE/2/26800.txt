TITLE
Intratumoral genomic heterogeneity in submucosal-invasive gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated CNAs of 59 tumor samples from 27 patients with submucosal-invasive gastric cancers (SMGC) by 44k oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH).

DESIGN
23 mucosal portion of SMGC vs 23 paired submucosal (SM) portion of SMGC, 9 SM portion vs 9 paired lymph node (LN) metastasis, 12 SMGC with LN metastasis vs 15 SMGC without LN metastasis
