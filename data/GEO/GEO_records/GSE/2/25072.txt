TITLE
Expression profiling data of Mta1 from E9.0 mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mta1 gene expression reveals new targets and functions. Mta1 functions in p53 dependent and independent manner. Genes regulated by Mta1 in the presence and absence of p53 were indetified This expression data contains 5 different samples (MEFs) 1.wild type 2. Mta1 knockout 3. Mta1 re-expression in the knock out MEFs 4. P53 knockout and 5. Mta1 over expression in P53 knock out MEFs. Various sample comparisons were done and genes with p-value < 0.05 and fold change â‰¥ 2.0 were considered statistically significant

DESIGN
5 samples (triplicates of each, total 15) were analyzed. We generated pairwise comparisons between the WT vs Mta1-KO; Mta1-KO vs Mta1-KO/Mta1; P53-KO vs P53-KO/Mta1.
