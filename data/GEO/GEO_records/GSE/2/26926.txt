TITLE
Transcriptomic profile of Clostridium thermocellum ATCC27405 using switchgrass as carbon source

ORGANISM
Ruminiclostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405

SUMMARY
Clostridium thermocellum is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, thermophilic bacterium that ferments cellulose into ethanol. It is a candidate industrial consolidated bioprocess (CBP) biocatalyst for lignocellulosic bioethanol production to produce bioethanol directly from cellulosic biomass. However, few transcriptomic studies have been reported so far for C. thermocellum using biomass as carbon source. In this study, samples were taken from exponential and stationary phases of C. thermocellum cells growing in MTC media with pretreated switchgrass as carbon source, and transcriptomic profiling change of C. thermocellum during different growth phase was investigated using both expression array and tiling array. This study will help the understanding of gene expression of C. thermocellum using cellulosic biomass as carbon source and the knowledge will facilitate future metabolic engineering effort for strain improvement.

DESIGN
[HX12 expression array]: A eleven array study using total RNA recovered from wild-type cultures of Clostridium thermocellum at different growth phase of  T2 and T3 with switchgrass as carbon source. Two biological replicates used for each phase. [3Plex tiling array]: A six array study using total RNA recovered from wild-type cultures of Clostridium thermocellum at different growth phase of  T2 and T3 with switchgrass as carbon source. Two biological replicates used for each phase.
