TITLE
Disrupted processing of long pre-mRNAs and widespread RNA missplicing are components of neuronal vulnerability from loss of nuclear TDP-43 (CLIP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing was used to identify binding sites within 6,304 genes as the brain RNA targets for TDP-43, an RNA binding protein which when mutated causes Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Use of massively parallel sequencing and splicing-sensitive junction arrays revealed that levels of 601 mRNAs are changed (including Fus/Tls, progranulin, and other transcripts encoding neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins) and 965 altered splicing events are detected (including in sortilin, the receptor for progranulin), following depletion of TDP-43 from adult brain with antisense oligonucleotides. RNAs whose levels are most depleted by reduction in TDP-43 are derived from genes with very long introns and which encode proteins involved in synaptic activity. Lastly, TDP-43 was found to auto-regulate its synthesis, in part by directly binding and enhancing splicing of an intron within the 3â€™ untranslated region of its own transcript, thereby triggering nonsense mediated RNA degradation.

DESIGN
CLIP of Tdp-43 in 8 week mouse brain.
