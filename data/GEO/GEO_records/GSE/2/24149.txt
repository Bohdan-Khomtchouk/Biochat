TITLE
MicroRNAs as potential biomarkers for APE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) remains among the most formidable challenges facing public health practice in the 21st century. Accurate diagnosis of APE is severely hindered by the lack of biomarkers with both high sensitivity and specificity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) involve various pathophysiologic processes underlying multitudinous diseases. Accmulating evidences point to the fact that miRNAs may serve as ideal biomarkers.The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of plasma miRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosis of APE.

DESIGN
Two TaqMan miRNA arrays were performed on plasma of 10 APE patients and 10 healthy controls.
