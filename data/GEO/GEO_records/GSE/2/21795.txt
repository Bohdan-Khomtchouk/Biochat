TITLE
Misregulation of alternative splicing of BIN1 leads to T-tubule alterations and muscle weakness in myotonic dystrophy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Myotonic dystrophes (DM), the most common adult muscular dystrophy, are the first recognized examples of RNA-mediated diseases in which expression of mutant RNAs containing expanded CUG or CCUG repeats interfere with the splicing of other mRNAs. Using whole-genome microarrays, we found that alternative splicing of the BIN1 mRNA is altered in DM skeletal muscle tissues, resulting in the expression of an inactive form of BIN1 deprived of phosphoinositide-binding and membrane-tubulating activities. BIN1 is involved in tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane and is essential for biogenesis of the muscle T-tubules, which are specialized skeletal muscle membrane structures essential to correct excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. Mutations in the BIN1 gene cause centronuclear myopathy (CNM) that shares some histopathological features with DM, and both diseases are characterized by muscle weakness. Consistent with a loss-of-function of BIN1, muscle T-tubules were altered in DM patients, and membrane tubulation was restored upon expression of the correct splicing form of BIN1 in DM muscle cells. By deciphering the mechanism of BIN1 splicing mis-regulation we demonstrate that the splicing regulator, MBNL1, which is sequestered by expanded CUG and CCUG in DM, binds the BIN1 pre-mRNA and regulates directly its alternative splicing. Finally, reproducing BIN1 splicing alteration in mice is sufficient to reproduce the DM features of T-tubule alterations and muscle weakness. We propose that alteration of BIN1 alternative splicing regulation leads to muscle weakness, a predominant pathological feature of DM.
