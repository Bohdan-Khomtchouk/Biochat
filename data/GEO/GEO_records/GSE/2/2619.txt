TITLE
Udt1-1 anther and Wild type_anther

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
A series of microarray experiments by using RNA sources from UDT1-1 mutant type- and wild type-anthers at stages from meiosis to young microspore. In conjuction, microarray experiments by using RNA sources from wild type_Palea/lemmas in the flowering stage and wild type anther at pollen mitosis were performed in a time course design and compared to the microarrays of UDT1-1 mutant type- and wild type-anthers. Keywords: time-course
