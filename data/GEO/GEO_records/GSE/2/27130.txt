TITLE
Anti-cancer drug sensitive DNA methylation marker research

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and colon cancer and assosiation study between anti-cancer drug respond group and non-respond group.  The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in 118 paired anti-cancer drug response tested colon cancer and adjacent normal tissues

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 248 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
