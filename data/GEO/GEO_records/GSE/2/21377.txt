TITLE
Low P stress transcriptome of control rice variety (Dongjin-byeo) and NtPT1-trasngenic rice (PT 1-7-8)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To understand expression of candidate gene located on QTLs for phosphate sensitivity traits under low P using NtPT1-transgenic rice with increased Pi uptake efficiency and gene expression profile at the V3-stage seedling through the 60K Rice Whole Genome Microarray

DESIGN
Uniformly germinated seedlings were transferred to a hydroponic system filled with aerated standard solution (normal P, 320 μM Pi) and grown for 2 weeks in a glasshouse at 25°C/18°C (day/night) under a natural photoperiod (about 16 h). The composition and concentration of each element in the standard solution were as follows: N (1.43 mM), P (0.32 mM), K (0.51 mM), Ca (0.75 mM), Mg (1.64 mM), Fe (59.37 μM), B (18.92 μM), Mn (9.50 μM), Mo (0.10 μM), Zn (0.15 μM), Cu (0.16 μM), and citric acid (70.72 μM) (Yoshida et al., 1976). Some of the two-week-old seedlings were transferred to the low P solution (the same nutrient solution containing 32 μM Pi) over a period of 5 days to expose them to P-deficiency condition. Control plants were maintained in the standard solution for the entire period.
