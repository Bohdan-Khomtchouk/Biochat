TITLE
Roles of RDR701 and DCLs in Rice PhasiRNA biogenesis

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In this study, we analyzed function of the rice RDR701 and various DCLs proteins in small RNA processing. small RNA deep sequencing analyses revealed that RDR701 and OsDCL4 is involved in tasiRNAs and 21- and 24-nt phasiRNAs biogenesis. Further analyses indicate RDR701 coupling with OsDCL4 and OsDCL3b are required for the biogenesis of 21- and 24-nt phasiRNAs, respectively. The triggering miRNAs for intial both size phasiRNAs,are also shown RDR701- and OsDCL4-dependent, suggesting two sequential round activity of RDR701 in associated with different DCLs are essential for rice phasiRNAs biogenesis.
