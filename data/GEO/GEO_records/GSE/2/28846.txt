TITLE
Expression data of cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of aggressive versus non-aggressive ovarian, breast, melanoma, and prostate cancer cell lines

DESIGN
Expression profiles of aggressive versus non-aggressive ovarian, breast, melanoma, and prostate cancer cell lines was determined. 231MFP, C8161, SKOV3, DU145, and PC3 are aggressive and MCF7, MUM2C, OVCAR3, and LNCaP are non-aggressive cancer cells. We are not comparing across all of the cell lines--just between C8161 and MUM2C, SKOV3 and OVCAR3, 231MFP and MCF7, and LNCaP/DU145/PC3. Therefore the normalization strategies used are different. We have not used the same normalization strategy
