TITLE
Gene expression-based, individualized diagnostic GC/ABC prediction for relapse/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Individualized diagnosis prediction classifiers were successfully constructed through expression profiling of a total of 8,644 genes in 49 patients with relapse/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma, prospectively treated in a randomized trial. keyword(s): Diagnosis prediction

DESIGN
All lymphoma cases were predicted as belonging either to germical center B-cell like DLBCL or activated B cell like DLBCL based on the expression of a set of 54 genes (140 probes).
