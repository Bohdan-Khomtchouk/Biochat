TITLE
Murine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) transduced with pAPM lentiviruses overexpressing miR-221 vs control overexpressing miR-221m.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow-derived mast cells were derived from three different female C57Bl/6 mice of similar age. Cells were transduced with pAPM lentiviruses either overexpressing microRNA-221 or a non functional microRNA-221 mutant, termed miR-221m, where four point-mutations were introduced in the seed sequence of miR-221. The samples overexpressing miR-221m were used as references for the corresponding miR-221 overexpressing BMMCs from the same mouse (mouse matched reference). The experiment was performed in order to gain more insights about the molecular mechanisms underlying miR-221 effects in mast cells.
