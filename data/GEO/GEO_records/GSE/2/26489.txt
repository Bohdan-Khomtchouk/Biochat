TITLE
Gene expression under normoxia and hypoxia in mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse and human somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by the transduction of four transcription factors, Oct 3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Conducting reprogramming in hypoxic conditions was shown to result in improved efficiency for both mouse and human cells. To examine the effect of hypoxic cultivation, we performed microarray analyses using mouse embryonic fibroblasts cultivated under normoxia and hypoxia.
