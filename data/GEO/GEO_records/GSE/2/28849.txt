TITLE
Coupled evolution of transcription and mRNA degradation.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We measured mRNA levels of two yeast species (S.cerevisiae and S.paradoxus) and their hybrid, at four time-points (0, 20min, 40min, 60min) following transcription arrest using 1,10-Phenantroline (150ug/ml). This data was used to infer mRNA degradation rates of orthologous genes, study the divergence of mRNA degradation rates and the contribution of cis and trans mutations.
