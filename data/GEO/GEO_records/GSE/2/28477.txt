SUMMARY
Winged bean (WB), Psophocarpus tetragonolobus, is a tropical legume, the potential of which is not yet been understood. We found that a 5 week-oral administration of WB seed extract inhibited wrinkle formation induced by repeated tape stripping (TS), which is a model of lichenification in human chronic eczematous dermatitis. To elucidate mechanism of the effect of WB on this model, we applied microarray analysis.
