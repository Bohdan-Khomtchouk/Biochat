TITLE
Genes regulated by HoxA3 in endothelial and hematopoietic progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used a murine ES cell line in which HoxA3 expression is under control of a tetracycline-responsive element and differentiated these cells as embryoid bodies (EBs). Endothelial (Flk-1 VE-cadherin double positive, FV) and hematopoieitc progenitors (c-Kit CD41 double positive, K41) were isolated from differentiated EBs that had been induced for 6 hours by doxycycline (Dox) treatment.

DESIGN
Here we show genes regulated upon HoxA3 upregulation (6 hours doxycycline treatment) in hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors.
