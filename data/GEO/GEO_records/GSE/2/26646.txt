TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of LecRKVI.2 over-expressor plants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The arabidopsis L-type lectin receptor kinase-VI.2 positively regulates bacterial PAMP-triggered immunity. We used microarrays and performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis of LecRKVI.2 over-expressing plants and identified number of upregulated genes involved against bacterial resistance.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 5-week-old Arabidopsis plants for RNA extraction and hybridisation on Affymetrix microarrays.
