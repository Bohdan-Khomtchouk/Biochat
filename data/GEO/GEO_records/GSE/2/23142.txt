TITLE
miRNA profile in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an endogenous conserved class of non-coding 20–22 nt small RNAs that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level by mostly binding to 3′-UTR of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translation inhibition. Recent reports demonstrate a role for miRNA expression in the disease progression and outcome. By now, many researcher focusing on miRNA expression profiles in Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma have been reported. Nevertheless, there is still a little information available about specific miRNA expression pattern and their roles in ESCC. To develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for esophageal squamous cancer, we first investigated the expression profile of miRNA in three pairs of ESCC clinical samples.
