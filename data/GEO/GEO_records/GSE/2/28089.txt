TITLE
IPH-926 human lobular breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IPH-926 is an anticancer drug-resistant tumor cell line derived from a chemo-refractory human infiltrating lobular breast cancer (ILBC). IPH-926 ILBC cells were subjected to gene expression profiling using an Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 array.

DESIGN
To characterize the global gene expression of IPH-926, cells were subjected to transcriptional profiling using the Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 technology. The correct identity of the IPH-926 cells subjected to gene expression profiling was authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling.
