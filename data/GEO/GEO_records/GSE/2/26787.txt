TITLE
Comparison of endometrial expression in patients which underwent previous recurrent abortions, implantation failure after IVF/ICSI compared to control fertile

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify pre-conceptional endometrial dysregulations, we compared the endometrial expression between fertile and IF and RM patients

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted and used for hybridizing Affymetrix chips (GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus2.0 Array). Data were normalised by gcRMA method and raw p-values adjusted by Bonferroni procedure (1%). Endometrial biopsy was performed in non conceptional cycle in the middle luteal phase-(5 women were selected in each group).
