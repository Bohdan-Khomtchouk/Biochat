TITLE
Quantification of allele-specific expression patterns in Arabidopsis by tag profiling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
we demonstrate that 3' end tag profiling vi deep sequencing is a powerful approach to mesure allele-specific expression genome-wide.

DESIGN
examination of gene expression in A. thaliana, A. lyrata and the F1 hybrid
