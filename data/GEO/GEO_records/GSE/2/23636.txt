TITLE
Population genetic structure of the Ashkenazi Jewish population

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Ashkenazi Jewish population has long been considered a genetic isolate and presumed to have the genetic signatures of founder effects and isolation. We genotyped a large cohort of Ashkenazi Jews and analyzed their genetic structure compared to other worldwide populations.

DESIGN
We genotyped 471 normal control Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with the Affymetrix 6.0 array and analyzed their genetic structure relative to other Europe and worldwide populations.  We measured heterozygosity, linkage disequilibrium, identity-by-descent and used extended haplotype tests of positive selection.
