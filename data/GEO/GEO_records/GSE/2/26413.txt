TITLE
mutants versus wt - Transcriptome analysis of mutants impaired in post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra09-03_sgs - mutants versus wt - Identification of new genes regulated by SGS1 and SGS6/UBP5 (two genes involved in PTGS) by analysis of the transcriptomes of sgs1 and sgs6 mutants compared to wild-type plants in the shoots of seedlings. The comparison between the transcriptomes of sgs3, chr11, chr17 simple mutants impaired differently in PTGS and development (juvenile-to-adult transition and bolting), and the transcriptomes of the sgs3 chr11, sgs3 chr17 double mutants showed additive effects on development (juvenile-to-adult transition and bolting), which allows a better understanding of the genetic link existing between SGS3 and its potential partners, CHR11 (which interacts with SGS3 in a two-hybrid assay and BiFC) and CHR17, 2 homologous proteins of the SWI/SNF2 family. Transcriptome comparison between mutants and wild-type plants L1 in the shoots of seedlings.
