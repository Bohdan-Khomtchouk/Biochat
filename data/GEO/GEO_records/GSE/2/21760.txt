TITLE
Expression data from human HeLa cells exposed to interferon gamma for 2, 4, and 6 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is known to possess important regulatory functions in the immune response. To gain a better and first comprehensive insight into the mechanisms of remodelling of  UPS related gene expression inresponse to interferon-gamma, we undertook a comparative gene expression profiling during interferon-gamma stimulation at very early time points. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Human HeLa cells were harvested at 3 different periods of time following stimulation with interferon-gamma for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
