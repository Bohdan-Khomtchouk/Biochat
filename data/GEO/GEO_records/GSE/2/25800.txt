TITLE
Identification of Transcription Factor MEP-1::GFP Binding Regions in Embryos

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_2600 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Michael Snyder. For full list of modENCODE projects, see Project Goal: We are identifying the DNA binding sites for 300 transcription factors in C. elegans. Each transcription factor gene is tagged with the same GFP fusion protein, permitting validation of the gene's correct spatio-temporal expression pattern in transgenic animals.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation on each strain is peformed using an anti-GFP antibody, and any bound DNA is deep-sequenced using Solexa GA2 technology.
