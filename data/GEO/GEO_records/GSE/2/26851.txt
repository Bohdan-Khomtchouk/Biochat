SUMMARY
A common polymorphism at codon 72 in the p53 tumor suppressor gene encodes either proline(P72) or arginine(R72). These two variants might possess altered biological function which influences p53’s transcriptional, senescence and apoptotic functions. We found that P72 has increased apoptosis when compare to R72. To further identify unknown p53 target genes which might play a role in the increased apoptosis in P72 thymocytes, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform. Mouse thymocytes were isolated from the thymuses of mice that were untreated (0 hour) or following 2 or 4 hours of exposure to 5 Gray of gamma radiation.

DESIGN
Mouse thymocytes were isolated from the thymuses of mice that were untreated (0 hour) or following 2 or 4 hours of exposure to 5 Gray of gamma radiation. Four independent experiments were performed at each time point (P72 and R72) and at each timepoint 2 mice of each genotype were used, and their thymocytes were pooled together.
