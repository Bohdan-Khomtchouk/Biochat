TITLE
Diurnal changes of HDAC3, Rev-erbα, NCoR and Pol II recruitment to the mouse liver genome and of H3K9Ac

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We reported a diurnal changes in the recruitment of HDAC3, Rev-erbα, NCoR and Pol II to the mouse liver genome as well as H3K9 acetylation in vivo at ZT10 and ZT22.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq profiling of HDAC3, Rev-erbα, NCoR and Pol II binding and H3K9Ac in mouse liver harvested at 2 different times (ZT10 and ZT22) of the day
