TITLE
Gene level expression profiling of colorectal cancer tissue samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By the use of whole genome transcription analysis, we aimed to develop a gene expression classifier to increase the likelihood of identifying stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) samples with a poor prognostic outcome. Gene expression measurement were measured by the GeneChipÂ® Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays from Affymetrix.

DESIGN
We analyzed genome-wide expression at the gene-level for an independent series of colorectal cancer tissue biopsies using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform.
