TITLE
Protein Interactome Reveals Converging Molecular Pathways Among Autism Disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed aCGH analysis using a custom Agilent oligonucleotide array to analyze 288 probands with idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) of autism samples. The array is customized to high resolution coverage of exons for genes identified as encoding proteins included in a detailed protein interaction network for autism.

DESIGN
aCGH analysis of 288 idiopathic autism samples. Controls are sex-matched commercial control DNAs from Promega (Madison, WI).
