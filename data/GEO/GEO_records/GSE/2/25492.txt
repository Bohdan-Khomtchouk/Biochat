TITLE
Copy number analysis of spontaneously transformed hTERT-immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present evidence for cytogenetic changes in two transformed ovarian surface epithelium cell lines, TOSE1 and TOSE4. hTERT-immortalised ovarian surface epithelial cell line spontaneously transformed as measured by growth in soft agar. These cells were grown on plastic, and genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for cytogenetic changes.
