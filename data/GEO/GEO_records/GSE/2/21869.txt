TITLE
Expression profiles of evolved clones isolated at various stages during adaptive experimental evolution of E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
An Eschericia coli strain was constructed in which the PaeR7 restriction-modification gene complex was present under an unstable condition on a partially duplicated chromosomal region so that it may continuously attack the host genome to accelerate its evolution. This strain was grown for more than a hundred of generations through repeated cycles of saturation and dilution. The winners of this competition showed faster growth than the ancestor. Analysis of their genome and transcriptome revealed that they have acquired rearrangements in genes affecting their growth. The global expression pattern changes may have realized growth advantage during the adaptation experiment. Keywords: time course during adaptive evloution
