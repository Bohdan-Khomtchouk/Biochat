TITLE
Host responses in chicken embryonic fibroblasts infected with different strains of Toxoplasma gondii [F1 progeny]

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous protozoan pathogen able to infect both mammalian and avian hosts.  Surprisingly, just three strains appear to account for the majority of isolates from Europe and N. America. To test the hypothesis that strain divergence might be driven by differences between mammalian and avian response to infection, we examine in vitro strain-dependent host responses in a representative avian host, the chicken.
