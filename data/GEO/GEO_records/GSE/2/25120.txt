TITLE
Identifying putative candidate genes and pathways involved in immune responses to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
This study compares differences in gene expression between RNAs from lung and bronchial lymph node (BLN) tissue of high (H), low (L) PRRSV burden pigs or a pooled reference (R) using the swine protein-annotated long oligonucleotide microarray. Pathway analyses were carried out on a large scale to determine biological processes, pathways and networks that differ between the H, L and R responses.

DESIGN
Samples corresponding to animals with High and Low response to PRRSV infection were hyridized in a common reference design
