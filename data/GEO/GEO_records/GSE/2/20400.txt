TITLE
Expression profiling analysis of NOX4 mutant mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NADPH oxidases are the only know enzyme family that has reactive oxygen species (ROS, e.g. superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) as their main metabolic product. They are therefore a prima candidate gene family to define a molecular source for ROS in physiology and pathophysiology. The type 4 NADPH oxidase (NOX4) is the most abundant isoform with the highest basal expression levels.The Nox4 knockout mouse was designed using a cre/lox recombination technique which allows to create either constitutive (type III recombination) and conditional (type I recombination) knockout alleles.

DESIGN
cDNA microarray experiments of brain, kidney, muscle and pancreas of four male mutant mice versus a RNA pool of four male wild type mice. For each animal two technical replicates were performed including a dye swap experiment. All animals with the same age of 17 weeks on a C57BL/6 background.
