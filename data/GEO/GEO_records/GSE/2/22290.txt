Breast tumor DNA methylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using primary breast tumors from 162 women from the Kaiser Division of Research Pathways Study and the Illumina GoldenGate methylation bead-array platform, we measured CpG loci associated with cancer-related genes 162 tumor specimens from the initial diagnostic biopsy were obtained from the KPNC tumor biorepository for methylation analysis. All tumor specimens were from patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

DESIGN

Further study details are provided in Kwan ML et al. Cancer Causes Control 2008. Written informed consent is obtained from all participants before they are enrolled in the study.
