ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_716 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Susan Celniker. For full list of modENCODE projects, see Project Goal: We will generate over 600 RNA samples in biological triplicate and use them to generate expression profile maps detailing the sites of transcription across the fly genome using whole genome tiling arrays at 38 bp resolution as a broad survey of the transcriptome and 7 bp arrays resolution to identify at high resolution transcripts ends, splice sites, and small RNAs. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and Keywords: Transcript tiling array analysis
