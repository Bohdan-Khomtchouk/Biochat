TITLE
Different Mutants in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough

SUMMARY
Using gene expression changes at mid-log phase data from microarray experiments, we investigated the roles of global transcription regulators in D. vulgaris.

DESIGN
Comparison of cells treated with DVU2097, DVU3111, DVU0379, DVU2547 Mutant to untreated Wildtype cells at times of 0 min
