TITLE
Altered gene expressions of leukocyte transendothelial migration and cell communication pathways in periodontitis-affected gingival tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expressions relate to the pathogenesis of periodontitis and have a crucial role in local tissue destruction and susceptibility to the disease. The aims of the present study were to explore comprehensive gene expressions/transcriptomes in periodontitis-affected gingival tissues, and to identify specific biological processes. The purpose of the present study was 1) to compare comprehensive gene expression/transcriptomes of periodontitis-affected gingival tissues with those of healthy tissues by using microarray and data mining technologies, and 2) to analyze significantly differentially expressed genes which belong to pathological pathways in periodontitis by qRT-PCR.

DESIGN
Two distinct gingival samples including healthy and periodontal-affected gingiva were taken from 3 patients with severe chronic periodontitis. Total RNAs from 6 gingival tissue samples were used for microarray and data-mining analyses. Comparisons, gene ontology, and pathway frequency analyses were performed and identified significant biological pathways in periodontitis. Quantitative reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyse using 14 chronic periodontitis patients including 3 patients listed above and 14 healthy individuals showed 9 differentially expressed genes in leukocyte migration and cell communication pathways.
