TITLE
Expression data of human eGFP-SOX17+ endoderm cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using homologous recombination in human ESC, we inserted an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) transgene into a locus encoding a postulated marker of human endoderm, SOX17 in H9 human embryonic stem cells. This allowed purification of SOX17+ hESC endodermal progeny by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to generate microarray gene expression profile.

DESIGN
Using Wnt3 and Activin to differentiate hSOX17-2 to stage 1 cells, and subsequently FGF10 and cyclopamine to stage 2 cells,  we isolated eGFP+ cells by FACS at each stage, performed microarray analysis.
