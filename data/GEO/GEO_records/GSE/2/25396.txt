TITLE
Expression data from dark-grown AtGATA2 (At2g45050) overexpression transgenic line, homozygous bri1-116 and Col-0 wild type

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Molecular genetic analyses support important roles for the AtGATA2 gene in brassinolide (BR) and light regulation of plant development. The overexpression line 6-9 of AtGATA2 suppresses the etiolated phenotype of Col-0 grown in the dark. Using microarray analysis, we identified genes differentially expressed in the AtGATA2ox transgenic line 6-9 compared to wild type, and genes differentially expressed in the AtGATA2ox transgenic line 6-9 compared to the bri1-116 single mutant.  Consistent with the phenotypic similarity of bri1-116 and AtGATA2, overall about 93% of the co-regulated genes were affected in the same way by GATA2-ox and bri1-116.

DESIGN
AtGATA2-regulated genes have been identified by comparing genes differentially expressed by the Col control and bri1-116, which could find the crosslink between light and BR regulations of plant development.
