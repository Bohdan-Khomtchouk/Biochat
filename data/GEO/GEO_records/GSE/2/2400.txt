TITLE
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: SOD1 mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS) related genes. Material from three hSOD1(G93A) transgenic mice was compared to material from three non-transgenic control mice using an alternating loop design on two-colour cDNA microarrays. Statistical data management and analysis: postgreSQL relational database (www.postgresql.org), Perl, and R (www.r-project.org); pin-wise lowess-regression based normalisation (Yang et al., 2002 [PMID: 11842121]); mixed ANOVA-model.
