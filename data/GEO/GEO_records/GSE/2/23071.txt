TITLE
Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed genetic characteristics related to solvent formation and xylose utilization in Clostridium acetobutylicum EA 2018

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of gene expression in EA 2018 relative to that of ATCC824 revealed several key genes related to solvent formation. For example, spo0A and adhEII have higher expression level, and most of the acid formation related genes have lower expression level in EA 2018.
