TITLE
Expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines following hydrogen peroxide bolus at 5 times

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The general expression profile in human lymphoblastoid cell lines treated with 9 uM, 90 uM or 900 uM bolus of hydrogen peroxide at 0, 4,12,24, and 48 hours.  Four cell lines (GM07055, GM14569, GM14467, and 12057) were treated separately and total RNA was pooled in equal amounts prior to labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST microarray.

DESIGN
Four lymphoblastoid cell lines (GM07055, GM12057, GM14569, and GM14467) were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ).  24 hours before bolus treatments, cells were cultured at a density of 1 x10^6 cells/mL to create 17 cultures for each cell line (a total of 68 samples).  At the beginning of the experiment, one culture was collected from each cell line and total RNA prepared, this was equally pooled and prepared for microarray analysis (time zero, treatment zero).  Each cell line was then treated with a 9 (4 cultures), 90 (4 cultures), or 900 uM hydrogen peroxide bolus (4 cultures) or water (4 cultures).  Four, 12, 24 or 48 hours following the hydrogen peroxide bolus, cells were collected for each cell line of each treatment and total RNA prepared.  RNA from the four cell lines were equalling pooled for each time and each hydrogen peroxide (or water) bolus amount resulting in a total of 16 additional samples which were also labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST microarrays.
