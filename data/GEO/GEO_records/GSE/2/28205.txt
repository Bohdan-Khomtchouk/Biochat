TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of MET transformed osteoblast clones (MET-HOB) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) where osteoblast differentiation was induced

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The osteogenic differentiation process consists in a well-coordinated multi-step sequence of events, in which each stage is characterized by the expression of distinct protein markers, as well as by individual morphological features. In order to precisely identify the step at which cells are permissive to MET-driven transformation, we used expression profiling. We compared the transcriptional profiles of MET-HOB and MSC cells where osteoblast differentiation was induced.

DESIGN
Using microarrays, we evaluated the expression profiles of MET-HOB and MSC cells where osteoblast differentiation was induced, by culturing cells in the presence of ascorbic acid, Î±-glycerophosphate and dexamethasone for 7, 14 and 21 days
