Study the training exercise effects in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and aged-matched healthy individuals. Skeletal muscle biopsies from 9 stable COPD patients with normal fat free mass index (FFMI, 21Kg/m2) (COPDN), 6 COPD patients with low FFMI  (16Kg/m2) (COPL), and 12 healthy sedentary subjects (FFMI 21Kg/m2) before and after 8 weeks of a supervised endurance exercise program were analyzed.
