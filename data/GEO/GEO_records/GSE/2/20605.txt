TITLE
R. microplus expression profiles of larvae pre-attachment and feeding adult female stages in B. indicus and B. taurus

ORGANISM
Rhipicephalus microplus

SUMMARY
Comparative microarray analysis of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus expression profiles of larvae pre-attachment and feeding adult female stages on Bos indicus and B. taurus cattle Global analysis of gene expression changes in R. microplus during larval, pre-attachment and early adult stages of its life cycle feeding on Bos indicus and Bos taurus cattle were compared using gene expression microarray analysis. Among the 13 601 R. microplus transcripts from BmiGI Version 2 we identified 297 up and 17 down regulated transcripts were differentially expressed   between R. microplus feeding on tick resistant cattle [Bos indicus (Brahman)] compared to R. microplus feeding on tick susceptible cattle [Bos taurus (Holstein-Friesian)]. These include genes encoding enzymes involved in primary metabolism, and genes related to stress, defence, cell wall modification, cellular signaling, receptor and cuticle. Microarrays were validated by qRT-PCR analysis of selected transcripts including the validation of three housekeeping genes. The analysis of all tick stages under survey suggested a coordinated regulation of defence proteins, proteases, and protease inhibitors to achieve successful attachment and survival of R. microplus on different host breeds particularly Bos indicus cattle.

DESIGN
The microarray was conducted by NimbleGen Systems Inc following the method reported by Saldivar [Saldivar L et al., Insect Mol Biol 2008, 17(6):597-606]. 10 samples: 2 larva, 2 pre-attachment larva in B. indicus and 2 in B. taurus, and 2 adult ticks in B. indicus and 2 in B. taurus
