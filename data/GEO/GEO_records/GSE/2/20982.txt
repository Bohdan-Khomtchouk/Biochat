TITLE
Murine small intestinal crypt cell line IEC-6: control vs. TGF-beta stimulated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA profiling of rat small intestinal crypt cell IEC-6. Comparing control untreated with cells treated with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). TGF-beta stimulated cell differentiation, as observed in the stimulation of intestinal epithelial cell markers (alkaline phophotase, villin, aminopeptidase N, etc.).
