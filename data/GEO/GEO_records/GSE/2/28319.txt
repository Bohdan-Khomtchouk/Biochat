TITLE
Genome-wide landscape of liver X receptor chromatin binding and gene regulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression: Identification of primary target genes of liver X receptor (LXR) in an immune-related cellular model (THP-1 cells) to study, in conjunction with LXR binding data from ChIP-seq, the genome-wide mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by LXR. ChIP-Seq: We performed ChIP-seq in macrophage-type PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells after stimulation with the potent synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 (T09). As a reference we performed microarray gene expression analysis in the same cellular model. We identified in total 1357 LXR binding locations on chromatin (FDR < 1%), of which 526 were observed after T09 treatment. De novo analysis of LXR site sequences identified DR4-type binding sites as major motif.

DESIGN
gene expression: THP-1 cells were treated for 4 h with 1 µM T09 or vehicle (DMSO) ChIP-Seq: PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were treated for 60 min with 1 µM T09 or vehicle (DMSO)
