TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis comparing SKOV3ip1 and the taxane-resistant SKOV3TRip2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to compare mRNA expression profiles between the parental SKOV3ip1 and taxane-resistant SKOV3TRip2 in order to determine what genes are mediating taxane resistance

DESIGN
3 separate collections of each cell line were made, with cells at 75-80% confluence growing on 2-dimentional culture plates, and RNA extracted with RNAeasy kit Authors were unable to retrieve raw data.
