TITLE
Highly parallel SNP genotyping reveals high-resolution landscape of mono-allelic Ube3a expression associated with locus-wide antisense transcription.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the allele- and strand-specific transcriptional landscape of a megabase-wide genomic region of mouse Ube3a (ubiquitin protein ligase E3A) by means of a highly parallel SNP genotyping platform. We have successfully identified maternal-specific expression of Ube3a and its antisense counterpart (Ube3a-ATS) in brain, but not in liver. Because of the use of inter-subspecies hybrid mice, this megabase-wide analysis provided high-resolution picture of the transcriptional patterns of this region. First, we showed that brain-specific maternal expression of Ube3a is restricted to the second half part of the locus, but is absent from the first half part. Balance of allelic expression is altered in the middle of the locus. Second, we showed that expression of the brain-specific Ube3a-ATS appeared to be terminated in the region upstream to the Ube3a transcription start site. The present study highlights the importance of locus-wide competition between sense and antisense transcripts.

DESIGN
We have listed up SNP sites within Ube3a-Snurf/Snrpn region between C57BL/6J and MSM/Ms. SNP sites were loaded onto Illumina GoldenGate Assay platform, and were assayed by targeting total RNA came from brain and liver of F1 hybrid mice.
