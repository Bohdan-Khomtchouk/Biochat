TITLE
Deep sequencing analysis of human red blood cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small RNAs isolated from RBCs were size fractionated by gel electrophoresis and used for the creation of 6 libraries. For the library from healthy children (library 1), RNA from 4 individuals was pooled. Libraries were multiplexed and analyzed on a 454 sequencing platform 26 yielding 569,621 sequence reads after demultiplexing into the 6 libraries

DESIGN
Analysis of 6 small RNA libraries from human red blood cells
