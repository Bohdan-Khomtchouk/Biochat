TITLE
Larval host gene expression study in Drosophila post parasitic wasp-infection

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Upon pathogenic infection, drosophila larval host mounts an immune response. Parasitic wasps inject venom that contain virulence factors during oviposition, which can elicit host immune response, and in some cases, suppress host immune responses altogether. Several microarray experiments have been performed on different classes of parasitic wasps. We wanted to compare how Ganaspis xanthopoda-infected hosts respond compared to other classes of parasitic wasps.
