TITLE
della-regulation in darkness versus light-DELLAs contribute to skotomorphogenesis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs09-09_della-dark - della-regulation in darkness versus light - Identification of DELLA-dependent downstream targets in darkness - Aim was to determine downstream target of DELLA proteins involved in skotomorphogenesis. Wt, ga1-3, ga1-3_rga_gai_rgl1_rgl2_rgl3 global seeds were sterilized, sown on MS agar plates then put for stratification for 3 days at 4°C. Plates were placed in growth cabinet at 22°C for 5 days in darkness or in continous light. Keywords: gene knock out

DESIGN
9 dye-swap - CATMA arrays
