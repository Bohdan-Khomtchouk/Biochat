TITLE
Bglu3 congenic mice - gene expression in liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A congenic line was constructed by introgressing a C3H chromosome 1 region harboring Bglu3 into C57BL/6 apoE-/- background. RNA was extracted from liver using a QIAGEN kit . Total RNA was pooled in an equal amount from 3 mice for each group. Standard Affymetrix procedures were performed using 8ug of total RNA. Microarrays were used to detect gene expression in the liver  of Bglu3 congenic mice and C57BL/6 apoE-deficient mouse strains fed a western diet.

DESIGN
2 groups of mice were studied: C57BL/6 apoE-/- control mice and Bglu3 congenic mice.  After fed a  Western diet for 12 weeks, liver was harvested and total RNA prepared.
