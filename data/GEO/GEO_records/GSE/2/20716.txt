TITLE
PBMC expression profiles of BCG vaccine protected infants and of BCG vaccinated infants who develop tuberculosis disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMC from 10 week old infants vaccinated with BCG at birth. During follow-up 26 infants developed tuberculosis (TB) (non-protected by BCG) and 20 infants did not develop TB despite documented exposure (protected by BCG). PBMC were stimulated with media only or reconstituted BCG for 4 and 12 hours. Results provide insight into the mechanisms behind the failure of BCG to protect against disease.

DESIGN
Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments
