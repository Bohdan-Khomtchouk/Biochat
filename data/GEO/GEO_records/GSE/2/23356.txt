TITLE
human aggressive fibromatosis tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study examines the expression profile of cells from human aggressive fibromatosis tumors.

DESIGN
Cells from human aggressive fibromatosis tumors were manually minced, and visible clumps were removed. Enzymatic digestion using 10 mg/mL of collagenase IV, 2.4 units/mL Dispase, 0.05% trypsin, was used for 45 min at 37Â°C.  Cells were then centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 5 min and washed thrice in PBS. RNA was extracted using RNA was extracted using Trisol as per the manufacturer's instructions, and used for gene profiling studies.
