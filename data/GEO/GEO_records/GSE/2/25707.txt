TITLE
Synergistic activation by p38MAPK and glucocorticoid signaling mediates induction of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages expressing the novel CD20 homolog MS4A8A

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) incubated with dexamethasone & IL4 (Dexa+IL4), B16F1 tumor conditioned medium (cmB16), and B16F1 tumor conditioned medium supplemented with dexamethasone & IL4 (cmB16+dexa+IL4). Results allow detection of genes that require synergistic stimulation of tumor factors and Th2 cytokines.

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells were isolated from the tibias and femurs of C57BL/6 mice. M-CSF at a concentration of 30 ng/ml was added to the culture medium [DMEM, 10% FCS, and penicillin/streptomycin]. After 4 days, the culture medium was replaced by fresh DMEM or B16F1 conditioned medium. As indicated, IL-4 (10 ng/ml), dexamethasone (5 × 10−7M), Iwas added. Cells were harvested 3 days later for RNA isolation.
