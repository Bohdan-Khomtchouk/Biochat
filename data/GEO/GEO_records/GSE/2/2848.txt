TITLE
Auxin Response Factor mediated flower gene expression

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of ARF6 and ARF8 to flower gene expression. Flowers from arf6 arf8 plants undergo a developmental arrest at approximately stage 12, just prior to flower opening. Flowers from wild-type, ARF6/arf6 arf8/arf8, and arf6 arf8 plants were separated into stage 1-10 flowers, stage 11+12 flowers, and stage 13-14 flowers to define the developmental stages at which ARF6 and ARF8 are required for gene expression. Keywords: comparison of wild type and arf6 arf8 mutants
