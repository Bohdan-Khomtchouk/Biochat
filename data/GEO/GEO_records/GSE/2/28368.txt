TITLE
DNA methylation data from nasal epithelial cells of human smokers and nonsmokers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are investigating the methylation profiles associated with cigarette smoke exposure. We used arrays to compare the DNA methylation profiles in healthy human smokers and nonsmokers.

DESIGN
Nasal epithelial cells were extracted from 12 volunteers (6 smokers, 6 nonsmokers), and grown until fully differentiated. DNA was extracted from samples, and bisulfite converted, hybridized, and scanned to IlluminaMethylation27 BeadChip arrays.
