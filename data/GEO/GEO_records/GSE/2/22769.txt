TITLE
Systems analysis of the Merck Ad5/HIV vaccine reveals robust induction of a core innate immune gene network: in vitro analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we applied a systems approach to define human innate immune signatures following MRKAd5/HIV immunization and to analyze the effects of pre-existing Ad5 immunity. To determine whether vaccine-induced changes could be ascribed to cell-intrinsic responses rather than cell population fluxes, fresh PBMC from independent Ad5Neg donors were stimulated in vitro with MRKAd5 vector lacking HIV-1 transgenes (MRKAd5).

DESIGN
22 total samples were analyzed.  14 of these are from in vivo vaccination of seven Ad5 seronegative subjects at two time points (0hr and 24hrs). 8 of these are from 24hr in vitro stimulation of PBMCs from four independent Ad5 seronegative donors with MRKAd5 empty vector or GTS buffer (Mock) at 20,000 viral particles per cell.
