TITLE
A global view of the complexity of the porcine transcriptome using a full-sib pair with extreme phenotypes in growth and fat deposit by deep RNA sequencing (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Pig is an important animal model for human obesity and diseases. However, the complexity of the porcine transcriptome is not yet fully elucidated. Here we have used massively parallel high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-Seq) to generate a high-resolution map of the porcine transcriptome and miRNA in liver (LI), longissimus dorsi (LD) and abdominal fat (AF) from an F2 female full-sib pair with extreme phenotypes in growth and fat deposit. On the basis of the porcine annotated genes against the UCSC database, we identified 21,414 annotated genes in our RNA-Seq analysis and 48,045-122,931 novel transcript fragments, which could be clustered into 17,085-29,499 novel transcriptional active regions (nTARs). We found that ~18.8% of the detected known genes showed alternative splicing patterns, and alternative 3’ splicing was the most common type of alternative splicing events in pigs. We also detected that more than 22.7% of the known genes identified here were extended at their 5’ and/or 3’ end. We identified 2,796, 1,551 and 835 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively, in AF, LI and LD between the two individuals.

DESIGN
Examining the complexity of the pig transcriptome in three organs (liver, abdominal fat, longissimus dorsi muscle) from a female full-sib pair.
