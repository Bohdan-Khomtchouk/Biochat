TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Transgenic Myc-Driven Liver Tumor Formation and Regression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes were examined in transgenic MYC-driven liver cancers at different time points as tumors formed and upon early regression.  Time points evaluated include: Control (non-tumor bearing), Pre-tumor (mice were removed from doxyclycine in their diet to induce MYC oncogene expression for 4-5 weeks), Tumor (tumor nodules from mice that had been off of doxycycline for 8-9 weeks) and Early tumor regression (tumor-bearing mice were placed back on doxycycline for 72 hrs to inhibit MYC oncogene expresion). MYC-Driven Mouse Tumor Models are described in Schahaf, et al., Nature, 2004 and Goga, et al., Nature Medicine, 2007.

DESIGN
11 Total Samples:  3 Control, 4 Pre-Tumor, 4 Tumor, 4 Early Tumor Regression.  Control =  LAP-tTA transgenic mice.  Others = TRE-MYC x LAP-tTA double transgenic mice (doxy off).
