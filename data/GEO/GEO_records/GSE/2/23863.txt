TITLE
Regional Immune Response to Trichostrongylis colubriformis - Gene Expression during Challenge of Immunized Sheep

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Afferent Lymph was collected from up to 5 pen raised, nematode naïve, outbreed Romney sheep (Tag No’s 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1006) over a 12 week period. During this time a Pre-Infection sample was collected, the sheep were immunised by 3 truncated (2 week) T. colubiformis infections (40,000 Tc) followed by a Challenge Infection with 40,000 T. colubiformis L3 (Challenge Infection weeks 1-3). The Challenge Infection will enable us to determine changes in gene expression when the sheep gut rejects the parasitic nematodes.

DESIGN
The overall design is summarised in the below table.
