TITLE
Study of gene expression of human liver Hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) affects millions of people worldwide and is a lethal malignancy for which there are no effective therapies. To identify prognostic gene markers for liver cancer, we conducted transcriptome profiling of frozen tissues (tumor and non-tumor) from 300 early-to-advanced stage HCCs plus 40 cirrhotic and 6 normal livers.

DESIGN
We have profiles 268 HCC tumor, 243 adjacent non-tumor, 40 cirrhotic and 6 healthy liver samples.
