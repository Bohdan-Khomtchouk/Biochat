Timecourse of Gene Expression responses to cAMP in S49 Cells

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Abstract Although a substantial number of hormones and drugs increase cellular cAMP levels, the global impact of cAMP and its major effector mechanism, protein kinase A (PKA), on gene expression is not known. Here we show that treatment of wild-type S49 lymphoma cells for 24 h with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), a PKA-selective cAMP analog, alters the expression of ~4500 of ~13,600 unique genes. By contrast, gene expression was unaltered in Kinâ€“ S49 cells (that lack PKA) incubated with CPT-cAMP. Changes in mRNA and protein expression of several cell-cycle regulators accompanied cAMP-induced G1-phase cell-cycle arrest of wild-type S49 cells. Within 2 h, CPT-cAMP altered expression of 152 genes that contain evolutionarily conserved cAMP-response elements (CRE) within 5 kb of transcriptional start sites, including the circadian clock gene Per1. Thus, cAMP through its activation of PKA produces extensive transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. These transcriptional networks include a primary group of CRE-containing genes and secondary networks that include the circadian clock. Keywords: time-course
