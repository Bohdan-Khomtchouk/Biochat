TITLE
Tet1 and hydroxymethylcytosine in transcription and DNA methylation fidelity (ChIP/DIP-Seq data)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the genome-wide binding of Tet1 in control (shScr) and Tet1 knockdown (shTet1) mouse ES cells using two different Tet1 antibodies (Tet1-C and Tet1-N). Furthermore, we generated genome-wide mapping of hydroxymethyl cytosine (hmC) and methyl cytosine (mC). We find that hmC, in contrast to mC, is also found at transcription start sites (TSSs), and that there is a significant overlap between Tet1 binding and hmC positive regions. Surprisingly, our results also suggest, that Tet1 has a role in transcriptional repression. We showed that Tet1 associates with Sin3A co-repressor complex, and by performing ChIP-sequencing of Sin3A, we find co-localisation of Tet1 and Sin3a throughout the genome

DESIGN
Examination of Tet1 and Sin3A binding as well as hmC and mC localization in mouse ES cells
