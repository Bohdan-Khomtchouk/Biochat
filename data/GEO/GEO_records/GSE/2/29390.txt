TITLE
First Development, Characterization and Experimental Validation of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) 44 K Agilent gene expression microarray

ORGANISM
Helianthus annuus

SUMMARY
We describe the design, cleaning and annotation of the gene index for sunflower and the construction of the microarray platform. In addition, we validate this tool by means of the analysis of global changes in gene expression profiles in response to water deficit as a physiological event which induces senescence, taken as a model experiment, for which reference genes have also been identified and validated (Fernandez et al., 2011). Our results show that Helianthus annuus L. microarray is suitable for a functional genomics approach across many different possible treatments and conditions to be carried out. Actually, it is already being used for other experiments showing a precise and accurate level of trustability along different gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
Analysis of global changes in gene expression profiles in response to water deficit, 44K Agilent one color array
