Transcriptional profiling of an Fd-GOGAT1/GLU1 mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of an Fd-GOGAT1/GLU1 mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana reveals a multiple stress response and extensive reprogramming of the transcriptome Glutamate plays a central position in the synthesis of a variety of organic molecules in plants and is synthesised from nitrate through a series of enzymatic reactions. Glutamate synthases catalyse the last step in this pathway and two types are present in plants: NADH- or ferredoxin-dependent. Here we report a genome wide microarray analysis of the transcriptional reprogramming that occurs in leaves and roots of the A. thaliana mutant glu1-2 knocked-down in the expression of Fd-GOGAT1 (GLU1; At5g04140), one of the two genes of A. thaliana encoding ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase.

DESIGN
Rosette leaves and roots from the glu1-2 mutant, which is a T-DNA knockout of a ferredoxin dependent glutamate synthase in Arabidopsis (locus ID: At5g04140), were analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays. As a reference control, leaves and roots from Col(0) plants were used. The glu1-2 mutant is derived from a Col(0) accession. Four independent biological replicas from leaves and roots were used in the analysis (from both glu1-2 and Col(0) reference). In total 16 hybridizations were done.
