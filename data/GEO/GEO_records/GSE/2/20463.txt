TITLE
Homo sapiens MSCs: Normoxia vs. Hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human mesenchymal stem cells comparing normoxic MSCs cells with hypoxic MSCs cells. Hypoxia may inhibit senescence of MSCs during expansion. Goal was to determine the effects of hypoxia on global MSCs gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Normoxic MSCs vs. Hypoxic MSCs.
