TITLE
SuperSAGE data from skunk cabbage spadices

ORGANISM
Symplocarpus renifolius

SUMMARY
This study aims at investigating the gene expression profile of thermogenic skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus renifolius). Using Super-SAGE, we compared the gene expression profile of different developmental stages of skunk cabbage spadices.

DESIGN
To obtain the SuperSAGE libraries, we followed the original SuperSAGE protocol described by Matsumura and colleagues (Matsumura et al., 2003) with some modification. Total RNA of spadices in different developmental stage (immature, female, bisexual, and male) were isolated using RNAiso reagent. The SuperSAGE library was directly sequenced with a large-scale pyrosequencing method.
