TITLE
Expression data from the mouse liver with constitutively active NF-kB

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Activation of hepatic NF-kB signaling induces inflammation and ultimately fibrosis. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression which is regulated by hepatic NF-kB signaling.

DESIGN
We generated transgenic mice which express a constitutively active IKK2 controlled under the LAP promotor. The liver samples were collected from transgenic mice as well as from control animals at the age of 4 weeks. RNA extraction was performed from these liver samples and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
