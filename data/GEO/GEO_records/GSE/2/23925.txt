TITLE
Gene expression in germinal center light zone, dark zone, and naïve B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays of gene expression in mouse germinal center B cells photoactivated in the light zone or dark zone, and of naïve cells for comparison. We used microarray data to identify genes differentially expressed by B cells in the light and dark zones of the germinal center.

DESIGN
Light and dark zone cells were photoactivated in day 7 germinal centers and sorted by flow cytometry. Naïve splenic B cells(IgD+CD19+) were sorted for comparison.
