TITLE
Gene expression profiling of miR-regulated genes in proliferating C2C12

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression upon the over-expression of seven different differentiation-associated, E1A-regulated microRNAs.

DESIGN
seven different microRNAs (miR-1, miR-34a, miR-22, miR-365, miR-29a, miR-145 and Let-7b) and a negative control (AllStar, Qiagen) were over-expressed at 50nM for 36hrs in proliferating myoblasts. Three independent biological experiments were performed.
