TITLE
The mRNA expression patterns in macaque brains from prenatal to neonatal

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We search for developmental changes specific to humans by examining gene expression profiles in the human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque prefrontal and cerebellar cortex. In both brain regions, developmental patterns were more evolved in humans than in chimpanzees. To distinguish whether the human specific developmental pattern represent novel human-specific developmental patterns or a shift in the timing of the existing patterns, we measured mRNA expression patterns in macaque brains from prenatal to neonatal. Our results show that the major human-specific developmental patterns identified in the PFC reflects an extreme shift in timing of synaptic development.
