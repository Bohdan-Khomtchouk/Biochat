TITLE
Affymetrix Arrays Interrogated with Tumor/Normal Pancreatic Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes in the chromosome 3p12 pathway to tumorigenesis in pancreatic cancer, we screened two expression platforms and then as a third platform interrogated pancreatic cancer tumor/normal samples for differential expression.  Data from the third expression platform experiments are shown herein.

DESIGN
Frozen tumor and adjacent normal tissue were obtained from untreated, retrospective pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples available from the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center tumor bank and our collaborator (MLF). Total RNA from matched tumor/adjacent normal samples (8 paired samples) was utilized to interrogate the GeneChip U133 plus 2.0 array and resultant bioinformatic analysis performed to identify differentially expressed sequences across all three platforms.
