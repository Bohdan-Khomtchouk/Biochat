TITLE
Chromosome-biased binding and gene reguation by the C. elegans DRM complex [ChIP-chip]

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
DRM is a conserved transcription factor complex that includes E2F/DP and pRB  family proteins and plays important roles in development and cancer. Here we analyze genome-wide binding and function of the C. elegans DRM subunit LIN-54. We demonstrate that LIN-54 DNA-binding activity is required for the DRM  complex to efficiently bind and regulate target genes containing adjacent putative  E2F/DP and LIN-54 binding sites. We show that LIN-54 binds to the promoters of  genes involved in cell division, development, and reproduction, and acts  differently in the germline versus the soma. The E2F/DP-LIN-54 binding motif,  individual target genes, and overall DRM function are conserved among worms,  flies, and humans. Despite this conservation, we discovered one striking feature  of C. elegans DRM not shared in flies or humans: it is depleted from X  chromosomes. We show that DRM binding, the E2F-LIN-54 hybrid motif, and  LIN-54-regulated genes are all autosome-enriched.

DESIGN
Chromatin-immunoprecipitation of mixed staged wild-type C.elegans (N2, Bristol strain) was performed using non-commercial anti-LIN-54 antibody raised in guinea pig (Harrison et at. 2006).
