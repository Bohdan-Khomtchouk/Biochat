TITLE
Expression data from LysMCre/Cre and KLF2∆/∆ (LysMCre/Cre: KLF2 FL/FL) primary peritoneal macrophages treated with LPS for 6hours

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of LysMCre/Cre and KLF2∆/∆ primary peritoneal macrophages following 6 hours of LPS treatment. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression following LPS stimulation of  LysMCre/Cre and KLF2∆/∆ primary peritoneal macrophages. We identified distinct classes of  genes that were altered following LPS stimulation.

DESIGN
We injected 3 pairs of LysMCre/Cre (n=3) and KLF2∆/∆ (n=3) mice with 2 ml of thioglycolate broth intraperitoneally.  After 72 hours of thioglycolate injection, total cell suspension from peritoneal cavity were collected. These cells were seeded on 100mm tissue culture plates. Cells were allowed to attach for 4 hours and unattached cells were removed by washing with cell culture medium. These cells were placed in humidified incubator for additional 24 hours before LPS treatment. LPS was diluted to final concentration of 100ng/ml in culture medium and this medium was placed on peritoneal macrophages derived from LysM Cre/Cre and KLF2∆/∆ mice for 6hours. Cells were lysed and total RNA was isolated and subjected to  hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
