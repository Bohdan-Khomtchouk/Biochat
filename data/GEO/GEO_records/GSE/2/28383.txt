TITLE
Testosterone-dependent and independent transcriptional networks in the hypothalamus of Gpr54 and Kiss1 knockout male mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Humans and mice with loss of function mutations in GPR54 (KISS1R) or kisspeptin (KISS1) do not progress through puberty, caused by a failure to release GnRH. The transcriptional networks regulated by these proteins in the hypothalamus have yet to be explored by genome-wide methods. Using micro-dissected hypothalamic tissues to isolate RNA from our mice, we first set out to define the transcriptional differences among the wild type and knockout mice. Since the GPR54-kisspeptin axis is subject to hormonal feedback and the knockout mice are pre-pubertal, we also tested the hormonal dependence/independence of each differentially expressed transcript. To avoid variation in gene expression due to fluctuations in the levels of circulating hormones during the female estrous cycle, only male mice were used in this study.

DESIGN
17 samples were successfully hybridized; 4 GKO, 5 KKO, 3 WT 3 weeks old, 5 WT 6 weeks old.  We compared GKO to KKO, GKO to WT, KKO to WT and all KO to all WT.
