TITLE
SRF Overexpression Leads to Altered Expression of MicroRNAs and Contributes to Cardiac Hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of SRF in the regulation of microRNA expression and microRNA biogenesis in cardiac hypertrophy has not been well established. In this report, we employed a distinct transgenic mouse model to study the impact of SRF on cardiac microRNA expression and microRNA biogenesis. Cardiac-specific overexpression of SRF (SRF-Tg) led to altered expression of a number of microRNAs.
