TITLE
Hepatic Gene Expression Profiling of 5'AMP Induced Hypometabolism in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice injected IP with 5'-AMP enter a hypometabolic state that is an induced hybernation (AIHM). Recovery from this AIHM is marked by reverse flip (RF) behavior Illumina arrays were used to profile control, AIHM and RF aminals in RNA prepared from the liver.

DESIGN
Animals were injected with vehicle or 0.5 mg/g body weight 5'-adenosine monophosphate. At 6 hours (AIHM) or 12 hours (RF) animals were killed and total RNA prepared from the liver.
