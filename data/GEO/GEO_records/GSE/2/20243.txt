TITLE
Identification of soluble factors overexpressed in brain endothelial cell (EC) lines compared to non-brain EC lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression in brain lines was compared to non-brain cell lines to identify growth factors uniquely expressed in brain lines

DESIGN
In this study, human endothelial cells isolated from brain and non-brain sources were cultured for 1 week & total RNA was isolated from the cells.   RNA was amplified, labeled and hybridized to a spotted array containing oligos from the Operon human H034K chip set.
