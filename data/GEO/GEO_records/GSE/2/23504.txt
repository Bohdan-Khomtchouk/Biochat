TITLE
Interplay between manganese and zinc homeostasis in the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
ICP-MS analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 reveals a high cell-associated manganese (Mn(II)) concentration that is comparable to that of zinc (Zn(II)).  Stressing these cells with 100-200 µM Zn(II) leads to a slow-growth phenotype and a reduction in total Mn(II) concentration, with no decrease in the concentrations of other metal ions. Supplementation of the growth media with as little as 10 µM Mn(II) fully restores wildtype growth patterns and normal levels of cell-associated Mn(II).  DNA microarray analysis reveals that zinc stress induces the expected upregulation of czcD (encoding a zinc effluxer), but also a pleiotropic transcriptional response suggestive of mild cell wall stress. Genes encoding a nitric oxide detoxification system (nmlR) and the Mn(II) uptake system (psaABC) are also induced.  We conclude that Zn(II) toxicity results in a cytoplasmic Mn(II) deficiency, possibly caused by competition at the Mn(II) uptake transporter protein PsaA.
