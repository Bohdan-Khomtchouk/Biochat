TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with Parkinson’s disease and control subjects.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To get insight into systemic molecular events associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD), an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, we compared gene expression patterns of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from elderly healthy controls and from PD patients.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic profiling of patients with Parkinson’s disease and control subjects. RNA were extracted  from peripheral mononuclear blood cells and were hybridized on 4x44k Agilent expression microarrays.
