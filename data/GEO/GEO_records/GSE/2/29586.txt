TITLE
The expression level of microRNA after knockdown of Twist1 or Bmi1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To screen the microRNA regulated by Twist1 and Bmi1

DESIGN
Establish stable transfectants of pSUPER-sh-Twist1 or pSUPER-sh-Bmi1 in OECM1 cells and analyze the miRNA expression level of  by microRNA microarray. OECM1 transfected with pSUPER-sh-scr was used as a control experiment.
