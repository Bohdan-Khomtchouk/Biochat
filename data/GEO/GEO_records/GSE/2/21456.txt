TITLE
Expression profile of TTHA0252-deficient Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
In order to find function of TTHA0252 protein from T. thermophilus HB8, we observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of the TTHA0252-deficient strain grown in a rich medium at 70Â°C for 360,540, and 680 min.
