TITLE
Expression data from E13.5 Fz4-/- and Fz4+/+ kidneys

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fz4 and Fz8 cooperate in regulating the branching morhpogenesis of the developing kidney during mouse embryonic development, hence determines the eventual kidney size. We used microarrays to study the global gene expression profiles regulated by Fz4 and Fz8 signaling during early kidney development, and to understand the collaboration between the signaling events mediated by Fz4 and Fz8

DESIGN
Kidney rudiments were dissected from E13.5 mouse embryos for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix MOE430.2 arrays. Three biological replicates of each genotype were analyzed.
