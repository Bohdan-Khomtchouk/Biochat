TITLE
Gene expression analysis of 2 different prostate tumor cell lines isolated from 30 wks old TRAMP mice compared to normal prostate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression of 2 novel prostate tumor cell lines isolated from TRAMP mice and compared to normal prostate. T1525 cell line is a well differentiated adenocarcinoma with epithelial features, whereas T23 cell line displays the molecular signature of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from prostate tumor cell lines isolated from 30 wks old TRAMP mice, compared to normal prostate
