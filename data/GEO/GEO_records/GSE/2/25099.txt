TITLE
Expression data from 57 patients with oral cancer and 22 normal persons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to aid the development of patient-tailored diagnostics and therapeutics, we attempted to identify a genetic signature associated with disease prognosis in OSCC.  A genome-wide analysis of transcription with the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array was conducted. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from 57 specimens from patients with OSCC and 22 oral tissues from normal persons.

DESIGN
79 samples were analyzed. We compared gene expression levels between patients with and without OSCC. In addition, among 57 patients with OSCC, we also compared the expression levels between patients with and without amplicons scattered in chromosome 8q22.2~24.3.
