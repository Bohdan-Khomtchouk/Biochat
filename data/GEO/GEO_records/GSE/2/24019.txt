TITLE
wip overexpressing plants-Transcriptome analysis of WIP overexpressing plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
adt10-01_wip2 - wip overexpressing plants - Identification of genes induced or repressed by WIP genes - The objective is to identify genes responsible for the phenotypes observed in WIP overexpressing lines. WIP transcription factors are involved in reproductive and vegetative development by acting on the remodeling of various tissues. The WIP related processes have a major impact, in particular on reproduction (sex determination, fertilization, development of the seed). The way of action of these transcription factors is probably conserved, their effect depending only on their specificity of expression. Two WIP genes, NTT and TT1, was overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. The objective is to compare the common deregulated genes (and in particular repressed) in the transcriptome of these two overexpressor lines, to highlight their mode of action and the way they act on the tissue in which they are expressed. Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic),normal vs transgenic comparaison

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - CATMA arrays
