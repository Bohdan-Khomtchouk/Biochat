TITLE
Functional evidence that Drosha over-expression in cervical squamous cell carcinoma affects cell phenotype and microRNA profiles [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of mRNA expression profiles in W12 Series 1 cervical ectokeratinocytes at passage number 22 versus 19 (during which time the cells gain an invasive phenotype) As these cells demonstrate gain of chromosome 5p during this time, mRNA expression profiling data interrogated for over-expressed genes on 5p that may be important in cervical neoplastic progression.

DESIGN
Analyzed global mRNA expresion profiles from W12 Series 1 cells (3 replicates at passage 22 versus 3 replicates at passage 19)
