TITLE
A global transcriptional regulatory role for c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide location analysis of transcription factor of c-Myc and Max was conducted using RenLab Hu6K array in Daudi cells.  In comparison, the GWLA was also done for general transcription factor RNA polymerase II and TAF1, and sequence specific transcription factor E2F1 in the same cell line.
