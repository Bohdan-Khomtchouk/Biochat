TITLE
Glyco-gene expression in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells treated with ManNAc analogs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analogs of ManNAc, the committed precursor of sialic acid, decrease metastatic potential and trigger apoptosis in cancer cells.   Adding Lev to ManNAc analogs increases their toxicity due to an ill-understood mechanism.  Comparing gene expression profiles of cells treated with Ac4ManNLev and Ac4ManNAc will provide insight into the similarities and differences of these analogs. Specifically, MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells will be treated with Ac4ManNLev and Ac4ManNAc at doses that inhibit cell growth and induce the cell to undergo apoptosis later.  RNA will be harvested in the early stage of cell arrest in order to identify genes altered by Ac4ManNLev and Ac4ManNAc.

DESIGN
RNA preparations from three conditions, were sent to Microarray Core (E). One as control (Ethanol), and two experimental groups: high concentration Ac4ManNAc (100 uM) and high concentration Ac4ManNLev (100 uM). The aim is to gain insight into apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Specifically, the Ac4ManNLev samples will be comprared to a less potent ManNAc analog. The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.
