TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB12 grown on xylo-oligosaccharides

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis

SUMMARY
Comparison of the growth of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB12 in MRS (without carbon source) with either 2% XOS (xylo-oligosaccharides) or 2% glucose using whole-genome transcriptome analysis.

DESIGN
The sample GSM509238 (glucose against XOS) is a dye-swap of sample GSM509239 (XOS against glucose).
