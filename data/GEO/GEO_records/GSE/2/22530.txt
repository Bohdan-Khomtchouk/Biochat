TITLE
Sirt1-microRNA profile

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sirt1, a NAD-dependent deacetylase, has been shown involved in many complex biological functions. We previously demonstrated that Sirt-1 gain of function is neuroprotective in a model of neurodegenenration. We recently found that Sirt1 loss of function (Sirt1Δ mouse) impairs learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity. We used microarray screening to identify potential miRNAs that may be regulated by Sirt1 and ivolved in learning and memory. Total RNA from the hippocampus of SIRT1Δ and control mice was extracted and used for microRNA expression level evaluation.
