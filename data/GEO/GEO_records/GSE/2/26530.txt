TITLE
Digital gene expression profiling of primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We determined the genome-wide digital gene expression (DGE) profiles of primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells from 28 patients and fractionated blood cells from healthy blood donors taking advantage of “second generation” sequencing technology. The patients included in the study represent distinct subtypes of B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL and T-cell lineage ALL (T-ALL) and the controls are fractionated CD19+ and CD3+ cells.
