TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of pluripotency marker expression of ESKM-iPS cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
iPS cells, produced in in presence of exogeneously expressed E-cadherin and abcence of viral Oct4 were compared with conventional produced OSKM-iPS cells and murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) or MEFs

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from iPSCs and mESCs grown in presence of LIF on gelatin-coated plates for 4 days and from murine embryonic fibroblasts grown in standard medium (DMEM-Glutamax, high-glucose, 10 % FBS, 1X non-essential amino acids, penicillin/ streptomycin
