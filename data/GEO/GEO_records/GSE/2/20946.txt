TITLE
Concerted action of Helios and Ikaros balances the strength of B cell receptor signaling and controls the expression of inositol 5-phosphatase SHIP

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Inositol 5-phosphatase SHIP is differentially expressed in Ikaros and Helios deficient cells. In the absense of Ikaros SHIP is upregulated where as in the absense of Helios it is downregulated. Ikaros binds to the promoter of the SHIP gene. Article provides insight into the mechanisms of action Ikaros employs to regulate BCR signaling.

DESIGN
Two replicates of Ikaros deficient and wild type DT40 avian B cells.
