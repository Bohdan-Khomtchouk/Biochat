TITLE
Regulation of transcription by HIP1 protein interactor (HIPPI) in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIPPI is a novel transcription factor that regulates caspase1 gene expression. To find out new transcriptional targets of HIPPI and to investigate the effect of HIPPI on cellular transcriptome, microarray study is performed using HeLa cells exogenously transfected with Green Fluorescent Protein tagged HIPPI (GFP-Hippi) construct

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from HeLa cells transfected with empty GFP vector served as control and Total RNA extracted from HeLa cells transfected with GFP-Hippi construct served as test. Biological replicates: 4
