TITLE
Mammary carcinomas in WAP-SV40 transgenic mice [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic expression in mice of two synergistically acting SV40 early region encoded proteins, large (LT) and small (sT) tumor antigens, in the mammary epithelium recapitulates loss of p53 and Rb function and deregulation of PP2A-controlled mitogenic pathways in human breast cancer. In primiparous mice, WAP-promoter driven expression of SV40 proteins induces well and poorly differentiated mammary adenocarcinomas. We performed a correlative aCGH and gene expression analysis of 25 monofocal tumors, representing four histopathological grades, to explore the molecular traits of SV40-induced mammary tumors and to emphasize the relevance of this tumor model for human breast tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of 25 mammary carcinoma samples of two different WAP-SV40 mouse lines, T1 and NP8. Three involuted mammary gland tissues were included in the study as reference samples.
