TITLE
Expression data from aged, calorically restricted rat hippocampal regions CA1, CA3, and DG

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Aging is associated with a decline in hippocampal mediated learning and memory, a process wich can be ameliorated by dietary (caloric) restriction. We used Affymetrix gene expression analysis to monitor changes in three regions of the hippocampus (CA1, CA3, DG) of middle aged (18 months) and old (28 month) rats that were exposed to dietary restriction. Old rats were determined to be good performers (GP) or poor performers (PP) in behavioral tests to assess thier hippocampal function.

DESIGN
We used Affymetrix gene expression analysis to monitor changes in three regions of the hippocampus (CA1, CA3, DG) of middle aged (18 months) and old (28 month) rats that were exposed to dietary restriction.
