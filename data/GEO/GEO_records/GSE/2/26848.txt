TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis wt and ga1-3, brm-1, ga1-3/brm-1 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis brm plants depleted in a SWI/SNF-type ATPase BRM have decreased level of endogenous gibberellins and a phenotype that in many respects resembles the phenotype of mutants with repressed GA signaling or biosynthesis, like ga1-3. ga1-3/brm double mutant showed several additive and synergistic effects. To examine whether the phenotypic traits of brm, ga1-3 and ga1-3/brm lines are reflected at the gene expression level, we compared the expression profiles of brm, ga1-3, ga1-3/brm and wild-type plants using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on total RNA isolated from shoots of 18-d-old wt, brm, ga1-3, and ga1-3/brm seedlings. Three biological replicates were examined for each genotype. Plants were grown simultaneously under the same conditions.
