TITLE
Small RNA of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon

ORGANISM
Brachypodium distachyon

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of Brachypodium distachyon small RNA from panicles (flowers) was done to analyze the genome-wide distribution patterns of 1) total small RNA reads and loci, 2) 21 and 24 nucleotide repeat-normalized reads and 3) 21 and 24 nucleotide phased siRNA clusters relative to gene and transposable element density.

DESIGN
Small RNA were extracted from total RNA by size fractionation and converted to DNA amplicons by serial adaptor ligation to both ends followed by RT-PCR.  DNA amplicons were sequenced using an Ilumina Genome Analyzer.  Resulting sequences were computationally trimmed to remove 3' adaptor sequences. Raw data for GSM506621 was not provided.
