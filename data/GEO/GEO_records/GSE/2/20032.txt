TITLE
Comparison of Genes in Imiquimod-treated and Control Tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the study is to examine changes in tumor gene expression after imiquimod treatment.  RNA was extracted from spontaneous tumors in control mice (n=4) and in imiquimod-treated mice (n=4).  Gene expression was compared between the control group and the treated group.  In the imiquimod treatment group, the mice received topical treatment of 5% imiquimod cream (Aldara) on shaved skin at the site of spontaneous tumors for one treatment cycle (3 consecutive days).

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 4 spontaneous tumors from neu-tg mice treated with topical imiquimod for 1 cycle and 4 spontaneous tumors from control mice
