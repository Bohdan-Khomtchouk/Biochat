TITLE
P. aeruginosa PA14 WT in LB medium vs in LB with 10 mM adenosine medium

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
To investigate the impact of adenosine on gene expression of wild-type PA14.

DESIGN
To investigate the impact of adenosine on gene expression of wild-type PA14, cells were harvested after incubating for 7 h in LB medium and LB with 10 mM adenosine medium, and RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using a bead beater (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK ) with RNAlater buffer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to stabilize the RNA.
