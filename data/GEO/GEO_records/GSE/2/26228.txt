TITLE
C. elegans pdf-1 gene knockout effect

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
This study aims to quantify the effect of pdf-1 gene knockout in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans at the RNA level. Gene expression of pdf-1 (lsc27) mutant animals is compared to wild type gene (N2) expression. RNA levels of all differentially expressed genes have been verified by means of qPCR on idependent samples.

DESIGN
For each condition, four biologically independent samples of approximately 12000 young adult worms are analysed. Samples were compared in dye-swap.
