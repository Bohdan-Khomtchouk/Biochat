TITLE
Maize tumors caused by Ustilago maydis require organ-specific genes in host and pathogen

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Two-organism transcriptome profiling of infected seedling, adult leaf, and tassel demonstrated that both the host and pathogen exhibit organ-specific expression programs.  Phenotypic screening of U. maydis mutants deleted for suites of secreted protein genes and maize growth mutants demonstrated organ-restricted tumorigenesis.  Two-dye, competitive hybridizations were performed on Agilent oligo arrays. Keywords: maize, pathogen, fungus, Ustilago, organ-specificity

DESIGN
Comparisons were done 1) between mock and infected samples at 1dpi and 3dpi for seedlings and at 3dpi and 9dpi for adult leave and tassels, 2) between the three 3dpi infected samples, 3) between timepoints of infected samples.
