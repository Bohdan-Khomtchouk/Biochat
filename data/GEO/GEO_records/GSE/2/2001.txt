TITLE
Skeletal Muscle Response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To improve our understanding of the genetic reprogramming during the early phase of skeletal adaptation in response to endurance training, we employed cDNA microarray analysis to examine changes in mRNA expression in mouse plantaris muscle after a single bout voluntary running. Control untrained mice were compared with with R3h, R12h, P3h, P6h, P12h, P24h and R4w mice.  We conclude that a single bout of voluntary running is sufficient to induce active remodeling processes, including cell proliferation, by a coordinated regulation of the genome in response to signals elicited from increased neuromuscular activity.
