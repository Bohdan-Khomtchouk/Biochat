TITLE
AEG-1 silencing induced gene expression alteration in glioma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment is designed to evaluate gene expression alteration following AEG-1 (MTDH) silencing in glioma cells. AEG-1 is found to be a potential regulator through interaction with other transcription factor. We intended to investigate the enriched transcription factor dependent downstream gene sets regulated by AEG-1 form the differential expressed genes we obtained from AEG-1 silencing.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from U87MG glioma cells stably silencing AEG-1 and correspondent pSuper Retro vector cells respectively. Passage 5 of the indicated cells after infection and selection were harvested for RNA extraction.
