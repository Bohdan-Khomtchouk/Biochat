TITLE
Ischemic Pre- and Post Conditioning has pronounced effects on Gene Expression Profiles in the Rat Liver after Ischemia/Reperfusion

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Ischemia/reperfusion injuries is a known complication to hepatic surgery. Ischemic pre- (IPC) and postconditioning (IPO) protects the liver against ischemia/reperfusion-injuries. Expression profiling were performed on liver biopsies seeking to identify molecular mediators of the protective properties.
