TITLE
[E-MTAB-407] GENCODE PCR-Seq Batch II

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
As part of the ENCODE consortium the GENCODE project is producing a reference gene set through manual and automated gene prediction. Selected transcript models are verified experimentally by RT-PCR amplification followed by sequencing. This is batch II, based on annotation from April 2009.
