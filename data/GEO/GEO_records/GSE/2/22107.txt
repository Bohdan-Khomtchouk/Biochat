TITLE
Responses of fully proliferating Arabidopsis leaves to short-term osmotic stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Drought is an important environmental factor affecting plant growth and biomass production. Despite this importance little is known on the molecular mechanisms regulating plant growth under water limiting conditions. The main goal of this work was to investigate, using a combination of growth and molecular profiling techniques, how stress arrests CELl proliferation in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves upon osmotic stress imposition.

DESIGN
Plants were grown on nylon meshes overlaying control 0.5MS media. At 9 DAS when third leaf is fully proliferating seedlings were transfered to either mannitol (25mM) or control plates, and proliferating leaves were micro-dissected at 1.5h, 3h, 12h and 24h after stress imposition and using RNAlater solution (25mM). Samples were from three independent biological experiments. Each sample was pooled from multiple plants and multiple plates in one experiment. RNA samples were submitted to ATH1 array hybridization.
