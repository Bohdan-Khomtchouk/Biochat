TITLE
HIV-1 infection in human PBMCs in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Affymetix HG Focus GeneChip to measure the expression levels of HIV seronegative and seropositive individuals in human PBMCs in vivo. GSM39104 -GSM39115 are HIV seronegative samples; GSM39116-GSM39137 are HIV seropositive but drug naive samples; GSM39138-GSM39147 are HIV seropositive samples used to test serostatus biomarker; GSM39148-GSM39170 are HIV seropositive individuals whose CD4 cells decrease over time; GSM39171-GSM39187 are HIV seropositive individuals whose CD4 cells increase over time; GSM39188-GSM39190 are HIV seropositive samples used to test CD4 cell increase/decrease over time.
