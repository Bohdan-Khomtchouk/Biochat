TITLE
Expression Profiling of Inflammatory Breast Cancer Cells Treated with the Novel Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor, CG-1521 (Affymetrix HuGene-1_0)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studies of gene expression profiles using the whole genome wide microarray analysis in SUM149PT cells (ER-, p53mut) and SUM190PT cells (ER-, p53mut) when treated with 5 or 7.5 µM CG-1521 alone and in combination with 10 nM 17β-Estradiol. Comparisons between each treatment group provides evidence for the dysregulation of genes associated with the spindle assembly checkpoint.
