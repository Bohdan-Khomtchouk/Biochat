TITLE
Transcriptome changes in Emericella nidulans due to oxidative stress - primary experimental data

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Late exponential growth phase (18 h) Emericella nidulans mycelia were transferred to minimal media also supplemented with 1.8 mM diamide, 75 mM H2O2 or 0.8 mM menadione (sodium bisulfite addition compound) and transcriptome profiles were recorded at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6 and 9 h incubation times. Double printed EST-based (2x4352 spots) DNA chips were used to monitor changes in cDNA populations prepared from mRNA pools isolated from oxidative stress exposed and untreated control cultures. Gene expression ratios were estimated with Genisphere (Hatfield, PA, USA) 3DNA Submicro EX Expression Array Detection Kit. Expression data were read with a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments). Intensity ratios were calculated with GenePix Pro 3.0 software. Note, processed data after LOESS-type normalization are presented on Series GSE2085 and all the signs were also reversed during data processing to reach proper log2(treated/control) channel intensity ratios. Keywords: time-course
