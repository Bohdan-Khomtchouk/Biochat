TITLE
Gene expression data by the leaves of Eriobotrya japonica (Ej) on the LPS-stimulated human gingival fibroblast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The leaf of Eriobotrya japonica (Ej) has been used for a long time as an oriental medicine to treat pulmonary inflammatory diseases. This study investigated the gene expression changes by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in the cultured human gingival fibroblast and the gene expression changes by the leaves of Ej when challenged with LPS using a microarray chip.

DESIGN
Human gingival fibroblast were divided into four experimental groups; ① C: Control, ② LPS: LPS-treatment only, ③ Ej20: LPS- and Ej20-treatments ④ Ej40: LPS- and Ej40-treatments.  Total RNA was isolated from each experimental fibroblast (4 experimental group × 1 sample of each experimental group = total 4 samples).
