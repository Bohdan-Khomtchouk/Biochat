TITLE
C-peptide regulates early transcription in rat proximal tubular cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
C-peptide exerts beneficial effects on glomerular hyperfiltration in type I diabetic patients. As C-peptide localizes to the nucleus, we investigated the transcriptional activities of C-peptide in proximal tubular cells isolated from diabetic rats.

DESIGN
Two groups of proximal tubular cells isolated from type I diabetic rats: 1 treated with C-peptide, and 1 untreated. 2-3 replicates per group.
