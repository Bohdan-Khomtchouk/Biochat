miRNA sequencing of 10 pairs samples between kidney normal tissues and cancer tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we combined their genome-wide profiles of tumors and normal adjacent tissues in 10 ccRCC patients. The results showed that 283 miRNAs were down-regulated and 187 up-regulated, meanwhile 7473 mRNAs were up-regulated and 3439 down-regulated in ccRCC. Expressions of 12 miRNAs and genes were validated in 10 patients we studied by RT-qPCR (validation rate from 60% to 100%). Differentially expressed gene analysis showed the collective change of miR-200 and SLC22A gene family, and pathway analysis revealed down-regulation of multiple metabolic pathways and up-regulation of focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, etc. Moreover, A miRNA cluster located in chromosome Xq27.3 were significantly down-regulated in ccRCC, which were verified in 53 ccRCC patients by RT-qPCR (validation rate from 63.8% to 88.6%).56 and 586 potentially novel miRNAs and mRNA we detected according to statistical analyses. In addition, 14 miRNA candidates were randomly selected to validate using qRT-PCR and Sanger sequcencing technology, 10 of out 14 could be successfully amplified,.Plus, the sequences of all 5 randomly selected amplified products were confirmed by cloned Sanger sequencing.Our data demonstrated a combined profiling of miRNAs and mRNAs in ccRCC, which showed the decreased metabolism and the perturbation of renal cell function. Moreover, this study identified the expression alteration of a miRNA cluster on Xq27.3, which suggested its potential function in carcinogenesis of ccRCC
