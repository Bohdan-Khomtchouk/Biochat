TITLE
Gene Expression patterns in mouse B16-OVA melanoma tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This laboratory focuses on selectin mediated recruitment during adoptive immunotherapy for metastatic cancer. This study seeks to determine changes in the expression levels of Fucosyltransferases, Selectins, and cytokines in normal and inflamed mouse skin, melanoma tumor tissue of different sizes, and tumor cells grown in culture. Since the ability to treat the tumor effectively is directly related to the size of the tumor, differences in glyco-expression patterns may be of interest. In this study, five groups were hybridized and analyzed using the GLYCOv2 array.
