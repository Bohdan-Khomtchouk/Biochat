TITLE
Genome-wide Analyses of Transcription Factor GATA3-Mediated Gene Regulation in Distinct T Cell Types

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report genome-wide characterization of GATA3 binding sites in eleven well-defined developmental and effector cell types of the T lymphocyte lineage.  By utilizing a conditional allele of GATA3, we investigated the impact of GATA3 expression on the mRNA expression patterns in several of these cell types.  Correlation of GATA3 binding with gene expression changes indicates that GATA3 regulates a large number of stage- and cell-specific genes involved in multiple signaling and transcriptional pathways critical for T cell differentiation and immune responses.

DESIGN
1) RNA-Seq: Examination of RNA transcript levels in 6 cell types in wild-type and Gata3-knockout cells. 2) ChIP-Seq: Examination of GATA3 binding sites in 11 cell types. 3) Methyl-Seq: Examination of histone modification levels in DP cells from wild-type and Gata3-knockout mice.
