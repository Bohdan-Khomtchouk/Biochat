TITLE
Late-stage embryonic gene expression in three cartilaginous fishes

ORGANISM
Leucoraja erinacea

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of pooled late stage embryos from Leucoraja erinacea, Scyliorhinus canicula and Callorhinchus milii show that HOXC cluster genes are not expressed in the two elasmobranch fishes, L. erinacea and S. canicula.  This finding supports the observations that these genes are not found in whole genome shotgun sequencing of L. erinacea or genomic clones from S. canicula.

DESIGN
Profile gene expression in pooled late stage embryos from three species (L. erinacea, S. canicula and C. milii)
