TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures on immunity for bursal peptide BPP-II

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further elucidate the mechanism of BPP-II on immunity on the broad molecular level, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to examine gene expression patterns during BPP-II treatment in a mouse derived hybridoma culture system. Hybridoma cell was treated ex vivo, and robust normalization of the data identified 2478 differentially expressed probe sets exhibiting minimum 1.5-fold changes that distinguished between BPP-II and control samples. Various pathwayswere significantly impacted by BPP-II treatment, and gene Ontology annotations show changes in the expression of molecules involved in immune and immunocyte related cellular processes. Expression of 8 genes (MS4A2，CD86，CD80， Fas，CDKN2A，CBLC, FGF21 and Fyn) from this signature was quantified in the RNA samples by QRT-PCR, confirming low variability between the predicted response patterns.

DESIGN
BPP-II induced gene expression in hybridoma cell was measured at 4 hours after exposure to doses of 0ug/ml and 0.2ug/ml.  Two independent experiments were performed using different cells for each experiment.
