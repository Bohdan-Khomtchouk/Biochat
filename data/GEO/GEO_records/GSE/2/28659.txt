TITLE
High resolution microRNA signatures in human whole saliva

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent studies have reported both mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) in saliva, but little information has been documented on the quality and yield of RNA collected. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop an improved RNA isolation method from saliva and to identify major miRNA species in human whole saliva.

DESIGN
RNA samples were isolated from normal human saliva using a combined protocol based on the Oragene RNA collection kit and the mirVana miRNA isolation kit in tandem. RNA samples were analyzed for quality and subjected to miRNA array analysis. Twelve representing 6 males and 6 females, were selected for miRNA profiling using the TaqMan® Low Density Array Card (TLDA) Human miRNA Panel v2.0 (Applied Biosystems). The analysis of expression of the > 700 miRNAs was performed by the DNA Core at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research Center at the University of Florida, according to the manufacturer’s protocol except the pre-amplification step was omitted. The NormFinder algorithm was used to identify the optimal normalization of miRNA among the 25 most abundantly expressed miRNAs detected.
