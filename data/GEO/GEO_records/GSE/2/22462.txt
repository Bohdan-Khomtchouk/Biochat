TITLE
Acclimation Effects on Acute Thermal Stress in the goby, Gillichthys mirabilis

ORGANISM
Gillichthys mirabilis

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify transcriptional resonses to acute heat stress following differential acclimation in the highly eurythermal goby fish, Gillichthys mirabilis.  G. mirabilis were acclimated to 3 temperatures (9C, 19C and 28C) for one month and then exposed to an acute heat ramp at 4C/hr and sampled during the timecourse.  Gill tissues were dissected and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed into cDNA, labeled with cy5 and hybridized against a common reference (cy3) on 2-color cDNA microarray developed for this species. Significant genes were determined by expression differences between groups (one-way ANOVA, FDR < 0.05) .
