TITLE
Genome wide profiling of PAX8 binding stes in PCCL3 rat cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of PAX8 binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with ultra-high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in PCCL3 rat cells. Results provide insight into the contribution of this regulatory factor to transcription genome-wide.

DESIGN
We generate a genome wide map of PAX8 binding sites in PCCL3 cells using as negative control an input DNA obtained just prior to Pax8 immunoprecipitation
