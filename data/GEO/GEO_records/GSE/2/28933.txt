TITLE
Changes in glycogene expression during maturation of dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. van Kooyk's laboratory is interested in investigating the expression of glycosyltransferases in dendritic cells and the changes in expression associated with maturation. Dr. van Kooyk's laboratory is exploring the function of antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DC), that regulate viral-antigen recognition, DC trafficking and T cell binding--all processes that initiate immunity or tolerance. Essential in this is the recognition of ligands by C-type lectins and the functional consequences of differential terminal glycosylation that may regulate DC function.

DESIGN
RNA preparations from monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) from Ai and Bi (immature DC), Am and Bm (mature DC), and C (monocyte) from healthy human donors were sent to the Microarray Core (E).  The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays
