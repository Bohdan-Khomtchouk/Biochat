TITLE
Genome wide maps of Dmc1 in testis of Hop2 null mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of ChIP-seq targeted at the meiosis-specific protein DMC1 to reveal the genome-wide distribution of initiation of meiotic recombination. The mouse model here employed is Hop2-/- because it is unable to repair the DNA double-stranded breaks and therefore the DMC1 signal is more persistent. We also provide the resulting dataset of ChIP-seq targeted at RAD51 which is not meiosis specific but is also targeted at initiation of recombination loci in meiotic tissue. In addition, we report DMC1 ChIP-seq on wild type mouse pup testis. Finally, we present ChIP-seq targeted at H3K4me3 in testis and liver tissues.
