TITLE
Gene expression data from teratomas formed by C57BL/6 (B6) ES and EiPS cells in B6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic fibroblast from C57BL/6 (B6) mice were reprogrammed to EiPS without exogenous DNA integration using an single episomal vector. The EiPS cells and B6 ES cells were then transplanted into B6 mice to form teratomas. We used microarrays to profile the gene expression differences between the teratomas formed by B6 ES cells and EiPS cells.

DESIGN
Pooled RNA from two teratomas formed by B6 ES or two regression teratomas formed by EiPS were selected for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
