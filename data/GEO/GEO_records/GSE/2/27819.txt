TITLE
Multiple means to the same end: The genetic basis of acquired stress resistance in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A series of experiments comparing the gene expression response before and after 30 min 0.7M NaCl exposure in WT and mutant yeast strains. Mutant strains were identified as having a defect in acquiring resistance to H2O2 following mild NaCl pretreatment. The mutants in this study were taken from the Yeast Knock-Out Collection, mat a.

DESIGN
Unstressed cells vs cells exposed to 0.7M NaCl for 30 min; 5 replicates for WT, 3 replicates for hog1∆, msn2∆, mck1∆, pde2∆, rim101∆, and 2 replicates for the remaining mutants.
