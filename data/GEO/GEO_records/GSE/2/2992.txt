Soy peptide up-regulates tumor suppressor and other chemopreventive genes in prostate epithelial cells

SUMMARY
Numerous studies have identified certain components of soybean as having anticancer properties. Lunasin, a unique 43-amino acid soybean peptide, has been shown to suppress carcinogenesis in mammalian cells and mouse models. It has been hypothesized that lunasin modulates changes in chromatin organization by modifying histone tails, thereby, resulting in the expression of chemopreventive genes. In this report, microarray analysis was used to reveal a novel property of lunasin – its ability to up-regulate tumor suppressor and other chemopreventive genes in prostate epithelial cells. The effects of exogenous lunasin on the comprehensive gene expression profiles revealed that a total of 123 genes had a greater than twofold change in expression in the lunasin-treated cells as compared to the mock-treated cells. Of these genes, 121 genes were up-regulated in normal RWPE-1 cells and only two genes were up-regulated in malignant RWPE-2 epithelial cells. The genes up-regulated in RWPE-1 cells include those involved in tumor suppression, apoptosis, and the control of cell division. The results shed new light on lunasin’s previously observed chemopreventive properties. We propose that lunasin prevents cancer in vitro and in small animal models by up-regulating the expression of genes that prevent the onset of the disease.
