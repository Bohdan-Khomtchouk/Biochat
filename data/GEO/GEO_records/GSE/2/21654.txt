TITLE
Expression data from 22 Pancreatic Cancer Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to analyze the global expression patterns for 22 commercially available pancreatic cancer cell lines

DESIGN
22 pancreatic cancer cell lines were grown to 80% confluence in DMEM/FBS/PenStrep media and then harvested for total RNA
