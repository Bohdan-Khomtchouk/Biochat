TITLE
Genome-wide Expression Assay Comparison Across Frozen and Fixed Postmortem Brain Tissue Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison between in vitro transcription- and cDNA-mediated annealing, selection and ligation (DASL)-based assays on brain-specific reference RNA, and postmortem frozen and formalin fixed brain tissue from autistic and control cases.  Investigation of data preprocessing techniques for DASL-assayed RNA samples from frozen brain tissue.
