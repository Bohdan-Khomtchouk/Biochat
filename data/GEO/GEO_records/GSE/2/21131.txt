TITLE
Illumina microarray experiment on LSD1 deletion ES cell with Lsd1Lox/Δ3 and Lsd1Δ3/Δ3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which demethylates mono- and di- methylated histone H3-Lys4 as part of a complex including CoREST and histone deacetylases (HDAC), is essential for embryonic development in the mouse beyond e6.5 days. Here, we demonstrate that LSD1 expression and therefore function, is restricted to the epiblast of the post- implantation embryo. Conditional deletion of LSD1 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, in vitro counterpart of the epiblast, revealed a reduction in CoREST protein, a subsequent decrease in associated HDAC  activity and a global increase in Histone H3 Lys56 acetylation.  Despite this biochemical perturbation, LSD1 deleted ES cells proliferate normally and retain stem cell characteristics. Loss of LSD1 causes the aberrant expression of 588 genes, including a number of transcription factors with roles in tissue development such as brachyury, Hoxb7, Hoxd8 and RARγ. Brachyury, a key-regulator of mesodermal differentiation, is a direct target gene of LSD1 and is over-expressed in e6.5 day Lsd1 genetrap embryos. Thus, LSD1 is required for the appropriate expression of key developmental regulators, via the stabilization of the LSD1/CoREST/HDAC complex, during early embryonic development.

DESIGN
RNA samples from Lsd1Lox/Δ3 and Lsd1Δ3/Δ3 cells were compared, three biological replicates were performed.
