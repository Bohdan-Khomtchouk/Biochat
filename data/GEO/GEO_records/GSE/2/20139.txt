TITLE
Ath_Agilent_v1_Riechmann array expression profile AP1-GR ap1cal inflorescences - time series (hours)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This experiment describes gene expression after the activation of APETALA1-GR, to study and identify AP1 target genes. We used a 35S:AP1-GR ap1 cal line to induce a synchronized response activating the AP1-GR fusion protein in ap1 cal inflorescence-like meristems through dexamethasone treatment. Tissue samples were collected immediately after the treatment, as well as subsequent timepoints. The expression profiles of the individual samples were then analyzed by gene expression profiling using whole-genome oligonucleotide arrays (Agilent, custom-commercial). Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Four sets of biologically independent tissue samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after the application of dexamethasone (Dex-; activation of the AP1-GR fusion protein) or a mock solution (Mock-; control). Dex- and Mock-derived samples for each timepoint and biological replicate were co-hybridized; one sample was labeled with Cy3 and the other with Cy5. The dyes used for labeling RNA from a given treatment type (Dex and Mock, at a given timepoint) were switched for two of the replicate experiments, to reduce dye-related artifacts. This experimental setup resulted in a total of 5 hybridizations per set (0h, 2h, 4, 8h, and 12h; Dex vs. Mock at each timepoint), and an even number (2) of hybridizations of each dye polarity per timepoint. The combined ratio data results are available as a supplementary file on the Series record.
