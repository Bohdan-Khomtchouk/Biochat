TITLE
Differential expression of Aspergillus genes during the induction of aflatoxin biosynthesis

ORGANISM
Aspergillus flavus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of A. parasiticus grown under conditions conducive and nonconductive for aflatoxin production was evaluated using glass slide microarrays containing the 753 ESTs. A complex regulatory network governs the biosynthesis of aflatoxin. While several genes involved in aflatoxin production are known, their action alone cannot account for its regulation. Arrays of clones from an Aspergillus flavus cDNA library and glass slide microarrays of ESTs were screened to identify additional genes. An initial screen of the cDNA clone arrays lead to the identification of 753 unique ESTs. Many showed sequence similarity to known metabolic and regulatory genes; however, no function could be ascribed to over 50% of the ESTs. Gene expression analysis of Aspergillus parasiticus grown under conditions conducive and non-conductive for aflatoxin production was evaluated using glass slide microarrays containing the 753 ESTs. Twenty-four genes were more highly expressed during aflatoxin biosynthesis and 18 genes were more highly expressed prior to aflatoxin biosynthesis. No predicted function could be ascribed to 18 of the 24 genes whose elevated expression was associated with aflatoxin biosynthesis. Keywords = Aspergillus Keywords = aflatoxin Keywords: time-course
