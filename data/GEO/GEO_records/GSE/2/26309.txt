TITLE
A Transcriptomic Analysis of NET1 (a RhoA GEF Exchange Factor) in AGS Gastric Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stable knockdown of NET1, a RhoGEF, was achieved in AGS Gastric Cancer cells.  This gene is known to be overexpressed in the disease. Knockdown was achieved using lentiviral shRNA particles.  Gene expression was compared between knockdown and scrambled shRNA treated control cells. Cells were treated with and without LPA, a known activator of RhoA.

DESIGN
Three distinct cell lines were used in this study (all AGS cells); (i) Non Target cell (NT) stably expressing non targetting shRNA (ii) 63 and (iii) 65; the latter two are stable NET1 knockdown cells and are seperatly transduced with separate NET1 targetting shRNA particles.  Cells were treated with and without 10microM LPA for 4 hr.  Experimental replicates were performed for each treatment (A & B), RNA was prepared from each and seperatly hybridised to U133A arrays.
