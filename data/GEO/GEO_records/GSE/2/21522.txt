TITLE
Effect of Rom1 silencing on gene expression in Entamoeba histolytica

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites epigenetically silenced for ameobapore A (G3 parasites) were additionally silenced for the Rhomboid gene Rom1 (EHI_197460) using the mechanism outlined in Mirelman et al. Parasite. 2008 Sep;15(3):266-74 (PMID 18814693). Rom1 silencing was confirmed by RT-PCR. Gene expression in these parasites was compared to that of the parent G3 strain.
