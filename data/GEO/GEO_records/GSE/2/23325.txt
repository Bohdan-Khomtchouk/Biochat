TITLE
Differential expression of genes in pancreatic islet of C57Bl/6J on high fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Male C57Bl/6J mice were fed 45%kcal fat diet (HF) or regular rodent chow (NC) from 4 weeks to 16 weeks of age. Gene expression was compared between RNA obtained from pancreatic islets of HF fed mice and NC mice.

DESIGN
RNA samples from 4 NC group and 4 HF groups were analyzed using GeneChip Mouse Expression Arrays MOE 430v2 (Affymetrix).
