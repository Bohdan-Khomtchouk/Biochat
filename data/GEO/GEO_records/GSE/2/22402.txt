TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression response upon infection with Toxoplasma gondii

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The in vitro effect of infection with different strains of Toxoplasma gondii was tested 24 hours after infection of Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFF) The strains tested include RH, VEG, and transgenic strains of RH overexpressing ROP38 or ROP21

DESIGN
Total RNA of Toxoplasma gondii infected HFF cell was compared to uninfected cells
