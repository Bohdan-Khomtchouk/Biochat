TITLE
Transcriptome profiling and expression analyses of genes critical to wheat adaptation to low temperature

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Understanding the mechanism of low temperature (LT) adaptation is crucial to the development of cold-tolerant crops.  To identify the genes involved in the development of LT tolerance in the crown of hexaploid wheat we examined the global changes in genes expression during cold-treatment using the Affymetrix Wheat Genome Chip.

DESIGN
Time-series experiment with 4 genotypes x 8 time-points X 3 biological replicates in random block design; 96 hybridizations
