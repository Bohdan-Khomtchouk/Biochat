TITLE
Expression Analysis of Rice Chromosome 4 Using Tiling Microarray

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptional activity of rice chromosom 4 using a tiling path microarray based on PCR-generated genomic DNA fragments. Five organ samples from various developmental stages and cultured cells were examined. Keywords: ordered
