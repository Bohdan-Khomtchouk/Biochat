TITLE
Exploration of the sulfur metabolism in the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis

ORGANISM
Kluyveromyces lactis

SUMMARY
A comparison between high and low sulfur source supplies, i.e., sulfate, methionine or cystine, was carried out in order to identify key steps in the biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of the sulfur amino acids. the transcriptomic study was carried out using Agilent 8X15k slides with a custom oligoset designed by V. Loux using the Kluyveromyces lactisORFeome extracted from genolevures database

DESIGN
Two conditions experiment, high versus low sulfur conditions (sulfate, cystine or methionine with a ratio of 1 to 1000). Three biological experiments with a dye swap for each for methionine, cystine and sulfate.
