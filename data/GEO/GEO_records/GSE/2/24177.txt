TITLE
Gene expression changes in response to drought stress in Arabidopsis reveal early responses leading to acclimation in plant growth

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant drought stress response and resistance are complex biological processes that merit systems-level analyses to dissect drought stress encountered by crops in the field. We have used gene expression profiling of Arabidopsis plants subjected to a controlled, sublethal, moderate drought (mDr) treatment to characterize early and late response to drought. We have also compared these profiles to those from plants treated with soil water deficit (progressive) drought (pDr) to reveal acclimation responses in plants.

DESIGN
Controlled moderate drought (mDr) was maintained by giving Arabidopsis (Columbia) plants water to keep the soil moisture level at 30% of field capacity, which is 200% or 2 g H2O g-1 dry soil. Water was withheld at 30 days after sowing (DAS). For progressive drought (pDr) treatment, plants were grown in a growth room as described above, water was withheld at 35 DAS, and were allowed to dry until the required pDr level was reached. For RNA isolation, two biological replicate samples of 5 pooled plants were collected at early (day1) and late stage (day10) for mDr, and first day of wilting for pDr, along with controls for mDr and pDr. Samples were hybridized to the Affymetrix (ATH1 25K) GeneChip.
