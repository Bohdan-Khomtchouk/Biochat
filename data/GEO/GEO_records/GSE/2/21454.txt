TITLE
Gene expression analysis of fetal liver pro-B cells upon deletion of Early B-cell Factor 1 (Ebf1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using cultured pro-B cells from mice carrying two Ebf1 alleles flanked with loxP sites and an inducible Cre recombinase, target genes of Ebf 1 and the effect of Ebf1 deletion on the cells was analyzed
