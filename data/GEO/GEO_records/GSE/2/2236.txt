TITLE
heart/muscle-specific MnSOD-deficient mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the pathological significance of excess oxidative stress in the heart, we generated heart/muscle-specific manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) -deficient mice on a C57BL/6 background using the Cre-loxP system uder the control of the muscle reatin kinase (MCK) promoter. The mutant mice developed progressive congestive heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy and physical disability and died with a median survival rate of 15.4 Â± 4.0 weeks. The pathological changes in our model were compatible with human cardiac aging. To investigate the transcriptional alterations in the mutant heart, we carried out an Affymetrix microarray analysis for comparison between the mutant and normal heart at 16 weeks of age.
