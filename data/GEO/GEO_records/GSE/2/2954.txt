TITLE
Single-nucleosome mapping of histone modifications in S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have used a high-resolution tiled microarray, with single-nucleosome resolution, to investigate the in vivo occurrence of combinations of 12 histone modifications on thousands of nucleosomes in actively growing S. cerevisiae. We found that histone modifications do not occur independently; there are roughly two groups of co-occurring modifications.  We find no evidence for a deterministic code of many discrete states, but instead see blended, continuous patterns that distinguish nucleosomes at one location (promoter nucleosomes, for example) from those at another location (over the 3â€™ ends of coding regions, for example). These results are consistent with the idea of a simple, redundant histone code, in which multiple modifications share the same role. Keywords: ChIP-chip
