SUMMARY
In neuroblastoma (NB), the presence of segmental chromosome alterations (SCA) is associated with a higher risk of relapse, even when occurring together with numerical chromosome alterations (NCA). Furthermore, recent evidence shows that SCAs play a role in tumor progression. In order to analyze the role of SCAs in infants with NB, we have performed an extensive retrospective array-CGH analysis of tumours from infants enrolled in the European INES 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3 trials. Tumour samples from 221/300 enrolled patients could be analyzed. SCAs were observed in 11%, 20% and 59% of infants enrolled in trial 99.1 (localised unresectable NB), 99.2 (INSS stage 4s) and 99.3 (INSS stage 4), respectively (p < 0.001), and were associated with the presence of bone metastasis (p < 0.003). Progression-free survival was poorer in patients whose tumours harbored at least one SCA, in the whole population as well as in trials 99.1 and 99.2. In multivariate analysis, taking into account single genetic alterations, the protocol arm and genomic profile, the SCA genomic profile was the strongest predictor of poor outcome. Although overall survival was excellent, patients with stage 4s disease and a SCA genomic profile had a higher risk of relapse also in the absence of clinical symptoms at diagnosis and required a higher treatment burden for salvage. In conclusion, in infants with NB, a SCA genomic profile is useful to identify patients who will require upfront treatment even in the absence of other clinical indication for therapy, whereas an NCA genomic profile can identify a patient subpopulation in whom treatment reduction can be considered safe.
