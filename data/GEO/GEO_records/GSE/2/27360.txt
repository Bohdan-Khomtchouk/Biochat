TITLE
Analysis of gene expression profiles after UVB irradiation in human keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Liu's research group is interested in studying the expression and functions of galectin-3, -7 and -12, in particular the roles of these proteins in inflammation and neoplasm. Members of the galectin family are known to participate in cellular homeostasis by modulating cell growth, controlling cell cycle progression, and inducing or inhibiting apoptosis. It is known that some galectins have similar functions. However, it is not fully understood whether they work cooperatively or not. As the outermost barrier of the body, skin is directly and frequently exposed to a prooxidative environment, including solar ultraviolet A (UVA), ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, and air pollution. Several reports have shown that exposure of cells to UV increase or decrease the levels of galectins. For example, the amounts of galectin-7 mRNA and protein are increased rapidly after UVB irradiation of keratinocytes (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1999; 96:11329-34). Heat shock and subculturing decrease, while alkylating agents and UV-light increase galectin-3 (Cell Physiol Biochem 2000; 10:149-58). To analyze the change of all galectin gene expression profiles after UVB irradiation and to determine the presence or absence of coordinate regulation, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of keratinocytes exposed to UVB. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were irradiated with 200 J/m2 of UVB. Total RNA will be extracted at 0, 6, 12 and 24 h after irradiation (duplicate) for analysis on the Glyco gene chip.
