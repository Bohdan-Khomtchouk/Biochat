TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Staphyloccoccus aureus USA300 vs USA300 agr knockout.

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
The study aims to compare gene expression patterns of Staphyloccoccus aureus USA300 wild type (reference) vs USA300 agr knockout(query). The agr quorum sensing system is an important regulator of density dependent gene expression. To determine the role of agr in USA300 virulence a agr mutant was constructed and differential gene expression compared to the parental wildtype.

DESIGN
Wild type and an agr mutant USA300 strain were grown in TSA broth over a time course. RNA samples were harvested at early, mid-log, late log and early station ary phase. Samples were hybridized on aminosilane coated slides with 70-mer oligos.  Gene expression patterns of the WT and mutant strains were compared.
