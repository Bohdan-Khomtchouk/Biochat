TITLE
Delineation of Two Clinically and Molecularly Distinct Subgroups of Posterior Fossa Ependymoma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite histological similarity of ependymomas from throughout the neuraxis, the disease likely comprises multiple independent entities, each with a distinct molecular pathogenesis. Transcriptional profiling of two large independent cohorts of ependymomas reveals the existence of two demographically, transcriptionally, genetically and clinically distinct groups of posterior fossa (PF) ependymoma. Group A patients are younger, have laterally located tumors with a balanced genome, and are much more likely to exhibit recurrence, metastasis, and death as compared to Group B patients. Identification and optimization of immunohistochemical markers for PF ependymoma subgroups allowed validation of our findings on a third group of independent ependymomas using a human ependymoma tissue microarray, and provides a tool for prospective prognostication and stratification of PF ependymoma patients. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
