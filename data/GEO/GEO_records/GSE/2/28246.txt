TITLE
Differential expression of microRNA associated with photoperiod in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In Drosophila, the rapid shortening of the day during the autumn induces an arrest of ovarian development (diapause) in females.   The molecular basis underlying this photoperiodic seasonal response is yet unknown.   Here we analyse the global expression changes in transcripts and microRNA (miRNA) associated with photoperiodic diapause response, focusing on the head transcriptome as the putative location of the photoperiodic timer.
