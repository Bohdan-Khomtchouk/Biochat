TITLE
Design of an improved host platform for the over expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The objective of this work was to design an improved host platform for recombinant protein expression in E. coli. The approach involves first to create a library of the E. coli genomic DNA in different expression vectors and screen for probable transcripts which may lead to slow growing colonies and also simultaneously over-expression of recombinant proteins.  To observe its effect on host performance, these genes were knocked out from the E. coli genome. A CG2 strain has been created by knocking in vhb gene gene downstream of the acetate promoter and knocking down ribB gene in DH5Î± and transformed with Recombinant GFP cloned in pBAD33.
