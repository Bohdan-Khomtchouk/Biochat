TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of 16HBE14 human bronchial epithelial cells in response to Neisseria

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We looked at host gene expression signatures common and specfic to occasionally pathogenic N. meningitidis and commensal N. lactamica. We hypothesise that similar host cell responses during early interactions with N. meningitidis and N. lactamica could inform common mechanisms of colonisation of commensals while differential host cell responses could be capable of altering the outcome of the colonisation process.
