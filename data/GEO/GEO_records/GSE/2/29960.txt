TITLE
Yeast spore germination: time course

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The process of Saccharomyces cerevisiae spore germination includes breakage of dormancy, morphological changes and resumption of vegetative growth. We have determined the global transcriptional response during the first two hours of spore germination in response to rich growth medium and glucose alone, and identified possible transcription factors regulating the different transcriptional programs.

DESIGN
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y55 spores subjected to YPD and glucose 2%. Samples are taken in triplicates (except for glucose 0 min were duplicates were taken) in time course series after glucose and nutrient addition. Total of 18 samples. RNA from dormant spores was used as reference RNA for all microarrays.
