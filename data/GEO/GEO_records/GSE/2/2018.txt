SUMMARY
Bronchoalveolar lavage samples collected from lung transplant recipients.  Numeric portion of sample name is an arbitrary patient ID and AxBx number indicates the perivascular (A) and bronchiolar (B) scores from biopsies collected on the same day as the BAL fluid was collected.  Several patients have more than one sample in this series and can be determined by patient number followed by a lower case letter.  Acute rejection state is determined by the combined A and B score - specifically, a combined AB score of 2 or greater is considered an acute rejection.
