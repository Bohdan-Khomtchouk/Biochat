TITLE
Whole tissue mRNA expression from severely obese individuals: subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Subcutaneous adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue samples were obtained from severely obese individuals that underwent bariatric surgery. The goal of this study was to compare genome-wide gene expression levels in the two tissue types from healthy and unhealthy severely obese individuals. Whole-transcriptome subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression levels were determined in 73 individuals with a BMI > 35 kg/m2. Whole-transcriptome visceral adipose tissue gene expression levels were determined in 69 individuals with a BMI > 35 kg/m2. Modules of co-expressed genes likely to be functionally related were identfied and correlated with BMI, plasma levels of glucose, insulin, HbA1c, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, ALAT, ASAT, C-reactive protein, and LDL- and HDL cholesterol.

DESIGN
Gene expression data was determined for untreated whole subcutaneous adipose tissue (n=73) from unrelated Dutch severely obese individuals. Gene expression data was determined for untreated whole visceral adipose tissue (n=69) from unrelated Dutch severely obese individuals.
