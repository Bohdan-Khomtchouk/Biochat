TITLE
Autoregulation of fixK2 gene expression in Bradyrhizobium japonicum

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110

SUMMARY
Expression data from B. japonicum bll2758::aphII strain (7414) grown micro-oxically. This study includes also the expression data of a fixK2 and a fixJ mutant grown in free-living micro-oxic condition (samples GSM313721 to GSM313734 in GEO record number GSE12491) and the wild type strain grown micro-oxically (samples GSM210246 to GSM210268 in GEO record number GSE8478).
