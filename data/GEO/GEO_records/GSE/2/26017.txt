TITLE
Agilent_E. coli O157 response to Chrysanthemum herba

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
According to our study, Chrysanthemum lavandulifolum extract showed excellent antibiotic effects on Escherichia coli O157:H7. A notable point is that the antibiotic efficacy of the herb extract is on the all three proven targets for main antibiotic drugs that are bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, bacterial protein synthesis and bacterial DNA replication and repair.  This multi-target efficacy of the herbal antibiotics may be used as more effective and safe drugs that substitute existing antibiotics.

DESIGN
Up- or downregulated gene expressions in E. coli O157:H7 (EDL932) which exposure to Chrysanthemum lavandulifolum (CL) methyl chloride (MC) fraction for 24 hours was measured.
