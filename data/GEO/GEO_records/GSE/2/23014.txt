TITLE
Comprehensive profiling of the early lung immune responses in the mouse model of tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The lung host immune responses following M.tuberculosis infection in the mouse model of tuberculosis were assayed by studying the gene expression profiles at day 0, day 12, 15 and 21 post infection

DESIGN
Mice were infected with M.tuberculosis via the aerosol route and the host gene induction during early immune response studied
