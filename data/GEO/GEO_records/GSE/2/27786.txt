TITLE
Gene expression profile of mouse hematopoietic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Each fraction of mouse hematopoietic cells  was purified by cell sorting from bone marrow of 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice, and its gene expression was analyzed.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of each fraction were analyzed using a Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array (Affymetrix).
