TITLE
Obesity related methylation changes in DNA of peripheral blood leukocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a genome wide methylation scan using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip on DNAs extracted from the leukocytes of 7 obese (BMI≥99th percentile for age and sex) and 7 lean (BMI≤10th percentile for age and sex) African American males aged 14-18 years.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 14 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
