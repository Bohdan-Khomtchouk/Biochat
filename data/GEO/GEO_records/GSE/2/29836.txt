TITLE
Expression analysis of INA6 cells after IL-6 restimulation using TAS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome expression analysis of INA6 cells on Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0 array set. Cells were restimulated with IL-6 for 1 hour after IL-6 has been withdrawn for 13 hours. Expression data were processed with TAS.

DESIGN
We analyzed one Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0R set
