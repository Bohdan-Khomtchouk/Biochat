Differential expression of microRNA profiles from the peripheral blood of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients

SUMMARY
Using microarray, we compared the expression of miRNAs from the peripheral blood of male subjects with T1DM and T2DM with healthy controls. Healthy male controls used were age-matched to the T2DM group patients with mean(SD) 37.3 (7.1) years. Subjects with T1DM were younger [23.3(1.6) years]. Expression was compared and validated using quantitative real-time PCR. Statistical testing (ANOVA, P-value < 0.05) was performed and fold changes with respect to the control were calculated Systolic BP, fasting glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher in T2DM subjects compared with controls (P-value < 0.05). Compared with controls, we identified 37 differentially regulated miRNAs in DM subjects. Among them, 21 miRNAs were upregulated (2-5 fold change, p-value < 0.05) and 16 miRNAs were downregulated (1.5-2 fold change, p-value < 0.05). These miRNAs had gene putative targets primarily involved in regulating pancreatic development and functions, adipocyte differentiation, insulin signaling and glucose-dependent insulin secretion.
