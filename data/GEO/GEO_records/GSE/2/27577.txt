TITLE
Tibialis anterior muscle of myostatin null mice treated with clenbuterol

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of skeletal muscle (tibialis anterior) of 5-week-old male wild type and myostatin null mice given ad libitum access to 20ppm clenbuterol hydrochloride in drinking water or plain tap water for 2 weeks. The objective of the study was to determine overlap in the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy of the two models.

DESIGN
2x2 factorial arrangement of genotype (wild type and myostatin null) and clenbuterol treatment (control and clenbuterol at 20 ppm) with 4 replicates.
