TITLE
Absolute expression level of Yarrowia lipolytica genes

ORGANISM
Yarrowia lipolytica

SUMMARY
Total RNA versus genomic DNA hybridization on custom arrays designed for all Yarrowia lipolytica genes

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected in mid-log phase from Yarrowia lipolytica cells grown in rich medium (abbreviated CM, in house recipe). RNA was then converted to cDNA, Cy3-labeled and hybridized competitively against Cy5 labeled genomic DNA from Yarrowia lipolytica.
