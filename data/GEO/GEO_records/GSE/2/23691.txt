TITLE
Mapping of H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation in zebrafish cells (ChIP-chip)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The genomic distribution of post-translationally modified histones in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome remain largely unraveled. The objective of this study was to (1) design a microarray covering all zebrafish gene promoters and 5' end of coding regions, and (ii) using these arrrays, map the genome-wide distribution of trimethylated H3K4 and H3K27 in the mbryo derived ZF4 cell line.  Specifically, we determined teh enrichment profile of H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and of both (co-enriched) modifications in ZF4 cells. We determined average enrichment profiles through metagene analysis, functional terms enriched among genes marked by either modification, and pathway analysis.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip experiments were performed from duplicate cultures
