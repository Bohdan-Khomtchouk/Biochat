TITLE
HOP homeobox (Hopx) and Histone deacetylase-2 (Hdac2) deficiency effect on the embryonic heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of heart ventricles from Hopx, Hdac2, and both Hopx-Hdac2 deficient embryos at embryonic day E16.5. Results provide insight into the role of Hopx and Hdac2 in cardiac development. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cardiogenesis by Hopx and Hdac2 and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic ventricles were selected at E16.5 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We obtained three independent embryonic ventricles for WT, Hopx-null, Hdac2-null, and Hopx-Hdac2 double null genotypes.
