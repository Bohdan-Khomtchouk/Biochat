TITLE
Transcriptional response of an azole-resistant Candida parapsilosis isolate [fluconazole].

ORGANISM
Candida parapsilosis

SUMMARY
Azole resistance was induced in vitro by growth of a susceptible C. parapsilosis isolate in the presence of fluconazole. Whole genome microarrays were used to compare the transcriptional response of the fluconazole-resistant and susceptible isolates.
