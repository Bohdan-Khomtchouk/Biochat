TITLE
PPARg and IL-4-induced gene expression data from wild-type and STAT6 knockout mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57Bl/6 wild-type and STAT6 KO mice were used to study PPARg and IL-4 signaling. Bone marrow of 3 mice per group was isolated and differentiated to macrophages with M-CSF (20 ng/ml). 20 ng/ml IL-4 was used to induce alternative macrophage activation and 1 uM Rosiglitazone (RSG) was used to activate PPARg. From each mouse 4 samples were generated: 1. M-CSF, 2. M-CSF+RSG, 3. IL-4 and 4. IL-4+RSG. All compounds were added throughout the whole differentiation process, and frech media was added every other day. Control cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO:ethanol). After 10 days, RNA was isolated and gene expression profiles were analyzed using Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarrays from Affymetrix.

DESIGN
3 C57Bl/6 wild-type and 3 STAT6 KO mice were used to isolate bone marrow and from each macrophages were differentiated with or without IL-4 and simultaneously treated with vehicle or RSG. Altogether we analyzed 24 samples with 3 biological replicates as below.
