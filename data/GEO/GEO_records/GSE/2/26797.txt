TITLE
Cryptochrome 1 regulates growth and development in Brassica through alteration in the expression of genes involved in light, phytohormone and stress signalling

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
To cover a comprehensive understanding of the complex regulatory networks controlling cryptochrome 1(CRY1)-mediated photomorphogenic response in Brassica, a genome-wide differential expression analysis was performed for the 5-day-old T3 BnCRY1-OE and wild type seedlings grown under white light (100 µmol m–2s–1) on 0.8% agar-gelled MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium containing 2% sucrose. Total RNA was extracted and cleaned up with the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Prep Kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). The yield and RNA purity were determined spectrophotometrically. Integrity of the RNA was checked using Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). 500 ng RNA of each of the sample was processed for microarray analysis according to Agilent protocol.   Keywords: Cryptochrome, Brassica, photomorphogenesis, differential expression.
