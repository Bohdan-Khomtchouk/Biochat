TITLE
Expression data from DMSO and SP600125 treated neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of from DMSO and SP600125 treated glutamatergic neurons reveals JNK target genes that are transcriptionally regulated by JNK signaling. SP600125 is a known JNK signaling inhibitor and therefore, we used this to test whether the expression of JNK bound genes is affected upon inhibition of JNK kinase activity.
