TITLE
Regulatory T cell lineage specification by Foxp3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Examination of CD4+ T cells from Foxp3-GFP knock-in mice. Aim is to understand the genetic program governed by Foxp3 in T cells by comparison of CD4 T cells subdivided into four groups based on expression of Foxp3 and CD25. Keywords = regulatory T cells Keywords = Foxp3 Keywords: repeat sample
