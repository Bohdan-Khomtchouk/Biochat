TITLE
Gene expression data from yeast exposure to alachlor

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The world-wide used herbicide alachlor is among the priority substances listed in the European Water Framework Directive. We aimed at finding molecular biomarkers in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that may be used to predict potential cytotoxic effects of this xenobiotic while providing mechanistic clues possibly relevant for experimentally less accessible non-target eukaryotes. We used microarrays to carry out a gene expression profiling analysis in S. cereviseae strain BY4741 upon 2 hours exposure to alachlor at concentrations exerting slight to moderate levels of phenotypic effects (inhibition of yeast growth rate). Two exposure scenarios were analysed, namely the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC; ~8% growth inhibition) and the 20%-inhibitory concentration (IC20), compared to control cells not exposed to the herbicide (CT02).
