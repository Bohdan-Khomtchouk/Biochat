TITLE
Conversion of murine extraembryonic trophoblast stem cells into induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Extraembryonic trophoblast stem cells (TSC) can be converted to induced pluripotent stem cells (TSC-iPSCs) by overexpressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc.

DESIGN
TSC lines were derived from mice harboring a doxycycline inducible Oct4 allele and an Oct4-GFP reporter that has been demonstrated to be activated in cells upon acquisition of pluripotency. Oct4-GFP-positive blastocysts were collected at 3.5 dpc and transduced with lentiviruses encoding doxycycline inducible Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc transgenes (4FTSC). 4FTSC lines were passaged 10 times to establish a population of constantly growing, self-renewing TSCs in the presence of FGF4 and fibroblast conditioned media. To induce lineage conversion, 4FTSCs were cultured under ESC/Lif conditions and doxycycline. After 28 days, several colonies displaying ESC-characteristic dome-shaped colony morphology and bright Oct4-GFP fluorescence could be detected. The 4FTSC-derived colonies were isolated mechanically, dissociated by trypsinization, and plated onto MEFs in ESC medium without doxycycline demonstrating the independence of exogenous factors. They will be called TSC-iPSCs (Trophoblast stem cell derived induced pluripotent stem cells). To examine if the extraembryonic lineage-specific mRNA profile was overcome, the gene-expression profiles of TSC-iPSCs and their parental 4FTSCs were analyzed by microarray analyses and compared to control ESCs.
