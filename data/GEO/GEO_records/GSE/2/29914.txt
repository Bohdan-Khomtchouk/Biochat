TITLE
Cardiac microRNA profiling in mice treated with lipopolysacharide

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the microRNA (miR) profile in the hearts of mice that were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and compare this profile with respective profiles that have been published in studies with mice that underwent pressure overload heart failure, 8 mouse samples were hybridized to Sanger 14 Multi-Species miR microarrays. As a result, we observed that particular cardiac miRs that are modulated during pressure overload heart failure are not affected significantly by treatment with LPS

DESIGN
Total RNA from pieces of hearts obtained from 8 C57BL/6 mice that were treated either with saline (4 mice) or with lipopolysacharide (4 mice).
