TITLE
DNA methylation data from mouse iPS cells, ES cells, and ntES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation was studied to determine whether iPS cells retain epigenetic memory at loci associated with its tissue of origin. We used custom Nimblegen microarrays to determine the genome-wide DNA methylation in mouse iPS cells.

DESIGN
We isolated genomic DNA from mouse stem cells and hybridized to custom-designed Nimblegen microarrays (Me and CHARM arrays).
