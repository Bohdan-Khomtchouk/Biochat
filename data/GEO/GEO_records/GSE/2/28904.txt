TITLE
Global transcriptional changes induced by rhinovirus infection in-vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell lines B2B and 16HBE were infected in-vitro with rhinovirus 16 and comparisons were made to mock-infected cultures and cultures exposed to UV-irradiated rhinovirus. Total RNA were extracted and assessed by whole genome expression arrays.

DESIGN
Rhinovirus in-vitro infected cell lines harvested at different time points (T hours) in biological triplicates. Total RNA extracted directly upon harvest.
