TITLE
High through put screen of small RNA in parental, hybrid and allopolyploid wheat

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Speciation via interspecific or intergeneric hybridization and polyploidization triggers genomic responses

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA of diploid Parent, Tetraploid parent, F1 hybrid and hexaploid amhiploid. Four pools of plants for each sample
