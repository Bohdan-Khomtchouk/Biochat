TITLE
ChIP-chip to determine the regulation of the K. lactis hsgs (ChIP of MATa1, MATalpha2, and RME1)

ORGANISM
Kluyveromyces lactis NRRL Y-1140

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip to determine the regulation of the K. lactis hsgs (ChIP of MATa1, MATalpha2, and RME1).  The MATa1 and MATalpha2 ChIPs were performed in an a/alpha cell using N-terminally HA-tagged proteins and the RME1 ChIPs were perfomed in an a cell using C-terminally myc-tagged protein. For the RME1 ChIPs, the cells grown with out phosphate.  For the MATa1 andMATalpha2 ChIPs the cells were grown in YEPD.
