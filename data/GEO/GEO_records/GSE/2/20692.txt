TITLE
mRNA and microRNA microarray analysis on human Jurkat T cells exposed to silver nanoparticles and silver ions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes and pathways involved in AgNPs and Ag ion toxicity, mRNA microarray analysis was conducted on human Jurkat T cells. The results indicate that more DEGs were induced by AgNPs than by Ag ion and AgNPs induced gene expression were not clustered with control and Ag ion induced ones. DEG analysis indicated that metallothionein (MT) 2A, 1H, 1F, and 1A and endonucleases G like 1 (ENDOGL1) were upregulated by AgNPs exposure more than 2 folds compared to control.

DESIGN
Jurkat T cells were exposed to 0.2 mg/L of AgNPs and Ag ions for 24 h. After treatment, total RNA was extracted and mRNA microarray was conducted on control, AgNPs treated and Ag ion treated Jurktat T cells. Microarray analysis were performed in triplicate. Jurkat T cells were exposed to 0.2 mg/L of AgNPs and Ag ions for 24 h. After treatment, total RNA was extracted and miRNA microarray was conducted on control, AgNPs treated and Ag ion treated Jurktat T cells.
