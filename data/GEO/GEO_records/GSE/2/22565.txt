TITLE
Gene expression in wild type and mENT1 knock out mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the functional importance of a nucleoside transporter, the mENT1 (Slc29a1) was knocked out in mice. The gene expression profile was compared between wildtype and mENT1 knock out mice in two tissues.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from heart and kidney from 3 mENT1 knockout and 3 wildtype (FVB/N) mice.Gene expression profiles were compared between the knockout and wild type tissues.
