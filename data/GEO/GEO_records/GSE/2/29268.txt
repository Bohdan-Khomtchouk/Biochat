TITLE
Inhibition of the mitochondrial TCA cycle by monofluoroacetate in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant mitochondria signal to the nucleus leading to altered transcription of nuclear genes by a process called mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR). MRR is implicated in metabolic homeostasis and responses to stress conditions. Transcriptional consequences on nuclear gene expression of mitochondrial perturbations were examined by a microarray analyses. Expression of 606 genes was altered by monofluoroacetate (MFA) inhibition of the TCA cycle in leaves of soil grown Arabidopsis plants in the dark for 10 hours. Functional gene category (MapMan) and cluster analyses showed that genes with expression levels affected by perturbation from MFA inhibition were most similarly affected by biotic stresses such as pathogens, not oxidative stresses. Overall, the data provide further evidence for the presence of mtROS-independent MRR signaling, and support the proposed involvement of MRR and mitochondrial function in plant responses to biotic stress.

DESIGN
Three independent (bio-replicate) experiments were done using three independent plant samples in the treatments. For each, approximately 30 plants were used for the treated sample and about 30 plants were used as the control sample. Plants were treated with 5 mM monofluoroacetate in 0.01% Tween 20 and incubated in the dark at room temperature (25C) for 6 hours. RNA was isolated from the inhibitor treated and control plants and used for microarray experiments. For each independent (bio-replicate) experiment, two microarrays were utilized using Cy3 and Cy5 dye-labeled samples and dye swapping was incorporated- 2 microarrays for each of 3 independent experiments (6 microarrays total).
