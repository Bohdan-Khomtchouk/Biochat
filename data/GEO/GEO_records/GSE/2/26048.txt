TITLE
Whole-genome in vitro expression analysis of F. tularensis isolates grown to mid log phase

ORGANISM
Francisella tularensis

SUMMARY
This study was aimed to perform comparative expression analysis of both virulent and avirulent strains of F. tularensis with a goal to possibly identify genes unique to low and high virulent strains to understand their role, if any in virulence features of an isolate. Initially, thirty strains were selected representing both type A and type B clades of F. tularensis. Five strains failed to grow on Chamberlain's medium (Chamberlain 1965) and were excluded from the study. All the isolates were grown to mid-log phase in Chamberlainâ€™s medium and the total RNA was collected by standard protocols for expression analysis. The samples were analyzed in duplicates. F. tularensis Schu S4, a known virulent strains was used as a reference strain for this study.

DESIGN
Twenty four query strains and one reference strain (FRAN016 Schu S4) were used in the hybridizations. Most of the hybridizations have more than one biological replicates, resulting in a total of fifty five samples analyzed.
