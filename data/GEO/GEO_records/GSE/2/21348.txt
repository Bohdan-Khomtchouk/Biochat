TITLE
Reprogramming of fibroblasts from Fragile-X patients to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) with defined factors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human iPS cells derived from normal and Fragile-X fibroblasts in order to assess the capability of Fragile-X iPS cells to be used as a model for different aspects of Fragile-X syndrome. Microarry analysis used to compare global gene expression between human ES cells, the normal and the mutant iPS cells and the original fibroblasts, to demonstrate that the overall reprogramming process succeeded, and that the FX-iPS cells are fully reprogrammed cells.

DESIGN
RNA samples from hES cells, human fibroblasts and iPS derived from the fibroblasts. Gene expression of those cells was analyzed.
