TITLE
Gene expression data from chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA-155 is frequently over-expressed in CLL and is associated with worse clinical prognosis.  To understand the role of miR-155 in CLL pathogenesis, we used microarrays to identify genes that are expressed at significantly lower levels in CLLs that harbor higher levels of miR-155 expression in an attempt to determine the relevant gene targets of miR-155 in CLL.

DESIGN
MiR-155 levels of 38 CLL samples were determined and ranked.  6 CLLs with the highest and 6 CLLs with the lowest miR-155 within the IgVH unmutated group, and 5 CLLs with the highest and 5 CLLs with the lowest miR-155 within the IgVH mutated group were selected for Affymetrix array analyses.
