Genome-wide analysis of matched microRNA-mRNA time-course data after androgen injection to prostate cancer LNCaP cell line

SUMMARY
Androgen receptor (AR) signalling pathway plays an important role in carcinogenesis and development of prostate cancer. The involvement of microRNA (miRNA) in this process is still largely unknown. In this study, we performed a matched miRNA-mRNA time-course expression profiling to reveal androgen response in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells.We introduced novel statistics Response Score (RS) and Modulation Score (MS) to identify significant androgen-regulated target genes and miRNA-modulated target mRNAs. Based on the analysis, we found several novel androgen-regulated targets, which had significant androgen response in expression pattern, and were highly enriched in predicted androgen responsive elements (AREs). AR-bindings to these AREs were validated with ChIP assay. Furthermore, a set of target mRNAs involved in crucial processes of tumor progression were identified to be significantly regulated by these miRNAs. Therefore, a miRNA-mediated androgen signalling network was inferred, including three novel feedback mechanisms for AR self-modulation. In conclusion, our study provides new approaches to further miRNA regulation research and contributes novel findings into miRNA-mediated pathological effects in prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) subjected to LNCaP cells in vitro at 20min, 40min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 16h, 24h and 48h, compared to the control at 0h.
