Expression data from breast cancer FNA biopsies from patients (US samples)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is Phase II Trial of 4courses of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide follwed by 4 additional courses of weekly docetaxel and capecitabine administered as Preoperative Therapy for Patients with Locally Advanced Breast Cancer, Stages II and III by US oncology (PROTOCOL 02-103) We performed gene set analysis (GSA) using functionally annotated gene sets corresponding to almost all known biological processes in ER-positive/HER2negative and ER-negative/HER2-negative breast cancer, respectively.

DESIGN
Pre-treatment FNA from primary tumors were obtained and RNA extracted and hybridized to afymetrix microarrays according to manufacturer protocol.
