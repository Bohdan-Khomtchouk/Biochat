TITLE
Gene expression profiling of HUVEC under basal (resting) conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the biological variability that exists between different individuals, the resting (untreated) transcriptome from 15 different individuals was examined. Transcripts expressed in a bimodal manor across the 15 biological replicates were identified for further examination.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, HUVEC isolates from 15 different individuals were cultured until passage 4 in fully supplemented growth conditions. RNA was extracted and hybridised onto CodeLink microarrays. The expression profiles in the untreated condition were examined along side a subset of the same biological replicates treated with a cocktail of inflammatory mediators (10ng/ml TNF-α, Il-1β, Il-8) for a period of 24 hours prior to RNA extraction (also submitted).
