TITLE
Expression data from transgenic mice overexpressing RXR-gamma in the skeletal muscle (RXR-gamma mice)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinoid X receptor (RXR)-gamma is a nuclear receptor-type transcription factor expressed mostly in the skeletal muscle, and regulated by nutritional conditions. Previously, we established transgenic mice overexpressing RXR-gamma in the skeletal muscle (RXR-gamma mice), which showed lower blood glucose than the control mice. We used microarrays to investigate their glucose metabolism gene expression change.
