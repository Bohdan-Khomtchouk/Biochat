TITLE
Gene expression profiling of spleen marginal zone B cells and spleen follicular B cells in IRF8 conditional KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conditional IRF8 KO mice (mice with a conditional allele of Irf8 crossed with CD19-Cre mice) showed increased numbers of both Gene expression data spleen marginal zone (MZ) and Gene expression data spleen follicular (FO) B cells compared to control mice. To evaluate gene expression patterns that distinguished FO or MZ B cells derived from conditional KO and control mice, we used Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse gene 1.0 ST Array.

DESIGN
FACS-sorted MZ and FO B cells from individual mouse were used for RNA extraction and Affyarray hybridization. There were six independent biological replications in each group - six cases of MZ B cells and FO cells in IRF8 conditional KO mice and six cases of MZ B cells and FO cells in control WT mice.
