TITLE
Androgen receptor cistrome in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453 with 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in 60-70% of breast cancers independent of estrogen receptor (ER) expression, however its function in breast cancer is largely unknown. Our study identified the high level of AR in ERâ/HER2+ breast tumors and andorgen and AR greatly stimulated growth of MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells. To define the genome-wide AR binding sites, we performed AR ChIP-seq using MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells followig stimulation of DHT. We also identified FOXA1 is a crucial AR cofactor in MDA-MB-453 cells and the FOXA cistrome showed signaficant overlap with AR at both early and late time points of DHT stimulation.

DESIGN
AR ChIP was performed in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells following 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulation for 4h and 16h respectively. FOXA1 ChIP-seq was performed after 4h DHT stimulation in MDA-MB-453 cells.
