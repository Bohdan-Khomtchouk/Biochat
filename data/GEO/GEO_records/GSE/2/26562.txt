TITLE
Gene expression profile of SYT-SSX2-expressing C2C12 myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Synovial sarcoma is a rare malignancy characterized by the presence of a specific chromosomal translocation t(X;18) that results in the formation of a fusion protein SYT-SSX.  Because it is believed that synovial sarcoma arises from mesenchymal stem or progenitor cells, we wanted to determine the changes in gene expression caused by SYT-SSX2 in untransformed mesenchymal progenitor cells - murine C2C12 myoblasts in this experiment.
