TITLE
Responses to ectoparasite salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) in spleen of Atlantic salmon

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling revealed rapid activation of immunity, both local and systemic, which however did not provide protection of fish against the parasite. Major changes of transcriptome responses wwere observed between days 5 and 10

DESIGN
Atlantic salmon was challenged with L. salmonis at the copepod stage. Skin, spleen, and head kidney were sampled from challenged and control fish at 1, 3, 5 dpi (corresponding to the copepod stage); 10 and 15 dpi (chalimus stage). A total of forty samples of spleen and skin form infected salmon (4 individuals from the 5 time points) were used for microarray analyses.. Test samples were labeled with Cy5 and hybridized to pooled control samples labeled with Cy3 from the same time-points. Competitive hybridization to the arrays was followed by washing, scanning, image analysis, and data analysis. Selected genes were analyzed with RT-qPCR.
