TITLE
Regional Immune Response to Trichostrongylis colubriformis - Gene Expression during the Development of Immunity

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Afferent Lymph was collected over a 8 week period from up to 5 pen raised, nematode naïve, outbreed Romney sheep (Tag No’s  1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1006). During this time a Pre-Infection sample was collected, the sheep were immunised by 3 truncated (2 week) T. colubiformis infections (40,000 Tc L3, Immunising Infections 1-3). The treatment regime (shown below) will enable us to determine changes in gene expression during the development of immunity

DESIGN
The overall design is summarised in the below table.
