TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Candida albicans DAY286 culture without ketoconazole versus DAY286 culture with 0.04 Î¼g/ml ketoconazole, both at 20% oxygen (normoxia).

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarray were used to generate the transcriptional profile of C.albicans in the presence of ketoconazole.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from DAY286 grown with or without ketoconazole in YPD medium in normoxia at 30 degree Celsius for 3.5 h, and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5. Four independent biological replicates were compared. 2 dye swaps were perfomed so that 2 out of 4 samples isolated from DAY286 in normoxic culture without ketoconazole were labeled with Cy3, and 2 were labeled with Cy5.
