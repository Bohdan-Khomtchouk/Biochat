TITLE
Co-expression network analysis using DNA oligonucleotide microarrays of experimentally infected pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Co-expression network analysis using DNA oligonucleotide microarrays of experimentally infected pigs. The expression profiles of liver from ten experimentally infected pigs were compared with the profiles of liver from five non-infected contol pigs.

DESIGN
The expression profiles of liver from ten experimentally infected pigs were compared with the profiles of liver from five non-infected contol pigs.
