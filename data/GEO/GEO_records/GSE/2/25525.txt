TITLE
Expression data from 4T1 cells cultured with 3mM glucose and 20mM lactic acid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Via aerobic glycolysis-Warnburg effect, cancer cells can convert 85-90% of glucose they acquire to lactic acid, which is thus ubiquitously abundant in solid tumor environment. We also observed that lactic acid effectively rescues cancer cells from glucose staration. In order to understand the biological function of lacitc acid, we did the microarrays.
