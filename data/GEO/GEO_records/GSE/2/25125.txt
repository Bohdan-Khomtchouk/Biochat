TITLE
PPARg and IL-4-induced gene expression data from PPARg +/- LysCre and PPARg fl/- LysCre mouse bone marrow-derived alternatively activated macrophages and immature dendritic cells (iDCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conditional macrophage-specific PPARg knockout mice were generated on C57Bl/6 background by breeding PPARg fl/- (one allele is floxed, the other is null) and lysozyme Cre transgenic mice. PPARg and IL-4 signaling was analyzed on bone marrow-derived macrophages. Bone marrow of 4 mice per group was isolated and differentiated to alternatively activated macrophages with 20 ng/ml M-CSF and 20 ng/ml IL-4 or to iDCs with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF+20 ng/ml IL-4. 1 uM Rosiglitazone (RSG) was used to activate PPARg. From each mouse 4 samples were generated: 1. M-CSF+IL-4, 2. M-CSF+IL-4+RSG, 3. GM-CSF+IL-4 and 4. GM-CSF+IL-4+RSG. All compounds were added throughout the whole differentiation process, and fresh media was added every other day. Control cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO:ethanol). After 9 days, RNA was isolated and gene expression profiles were analyzed using ABI Mouse Genome Survey Arrays.

DESIGN
4 PPARg +/- LysCre and 4 PPARg fl/- LysCre mice were used to isolate bone marrow and from each alternatively activated macrophages were differentiated with IL-4 and simultaneously treated with vehicle or RSG, iDCs were differentiated with GM-CSF+IL-4 and simultaneously treated with vehicle or RSG. Altogether we analyzed 32 samples with 4 biological replicates as below.
