TITLE
An interspecies analysis reveals sequence determinants of the bivalent chromatin state

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The sequence determinants of chromatin bivalency remain unclear. We analysed sequence determinants of chromatin bivalency genome-wide in several mammalian species and performed a series of transgenic experiments in mouse ES cells.

DESIGN
Genome-wide mapping of H3K27me3 in rat ES cells and ChIP-seq with anti-Ezh2 antibody in transgenic mouse ES cells
