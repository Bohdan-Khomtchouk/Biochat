TITLE
Gene expression of lipid metabolism-related genes correlated with milk fatty acids in dairy cows

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The aim of the present study was to correlate lipid metabolism genes in the mammary gland tissue affected by stage of lactation and nutrition to the resulting milk fatty acids composition in grazing dairy cows, and to classify milk fatty acid (FA) groups based on variations in lipid metabolism gene expression patterns. Identifying the relationship between lipid metabolism genes in the mammary gland tissue and the resulting milk fatty acid composition is expected to greatly contribute to our understanding of milk fatty acid metabolism and to enhance opportunities to improve milk fat composition through nutrition. In fact, SNCA, SCD5, and PNPLA2 lipid metabolism-related genes affected by unsaturated fatty acids supplementation, were found to strongly correlated to different milk FA groups, but also contributed most to the classification of these FA groups, suggesting a significant role in mediating the lipid metabolism in the mammary gland tissue and determining the milk fatty acids composition.

DESIGN
A total of 28 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows in mid-lactation were blocked according to parity (2.4 ± 0.63 years), days in milk (DIM; 153 ± 32.8 days), milk yield (25.7 ± 3.08 kg/d) and fat content (4.3 ± 0.12%). Cows were then randomly assigned to four UFA-sources based on rapeseed, soybean, linseed or a mixture of the three oils for 23 days (Period I) after which, all 28 cows were switched to a control diet for an additional 28 days (Period II). On the last day of both periods, mammary gland biopsies were taken to study genome-wide differences in lipid metabolism gene expression.
