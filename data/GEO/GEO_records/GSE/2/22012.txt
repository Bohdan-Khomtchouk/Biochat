TITLE
Translatome and transcriptome profiling of estradiol response in MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We subjected MCF7 cells to starvation with 0.5% charcoal treated serum for 48h and then we added 17-beta estradiol (E2) at final concentration of 10 nM, profiling before and after 60 minutes of treatment the transcriptome and the translatome, coming from the polysomal pool of mRNAs after sucrose gradient separation. Comparison of translatome profile changes with corresponding transcriptome profile changes represents a way of studying translational control networks and the degree of concordance between cellular controls affecting mRNA abundance and cellular controls affecting mRNA availability to translation. It is well known that E2 is a strong transcriptional regulator, while its translational control activity is less characterized. To provide a direct experimental evaluation of E2 induced translational regulation, we compared translatome and transcriptome profiles of E2 treated cells.

DESIGN
The comparison between transcriptional and polysomal profiling was used for the discovery of general and mRNA-specific changes in the translation state of the serum starved MCF7 cells transcriptome in response to E2 stimulus. To identify translationally regulated mRNA molecules, gene expression signals derived from the polysomal populations were compared by microarrays analysis to those obtained from unfractionated total RNAs. Polysomal RNA and total RNA were isolated from MCF7 cells serum starved and treated with E2. Cells lysates were collected before (t = 0 min) and after (t = 60 min) E2 treatment. All experiments were run in quadruplicates.
