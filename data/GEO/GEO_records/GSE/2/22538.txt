TITLE
Differential expression for rice-gall midge interaction

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We exposed Kavya rice seedlings to different gall midge biotypes, GMB1 and GMB4M, which exhibit incompatible and compatible interactions, respectively.

DESIGN
Expression study in Kavya seedlings using pooled samples of stem meristematic tissues 24, 48, 96, and 120 hr after GMB1 and GMB4M infestation when compared with uninfested control. Three replicates each condition.
