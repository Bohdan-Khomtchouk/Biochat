TITLE
Gene expression profiling of small intestine (SI) NKp46+RORgt+ and NKp46+RORgt- Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to analyze the global transcriptional profiles of small intestine (SI) Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs) expressing the NK cell marker NKp46. Based on differential expression of the RORgt transcription factor SI NKp46+ ILCs can be divided in NKp46+RORgt- and NKp46+RORgt+ cells. While NKp46+RORgt- cells produce IFN-g, like conventional Natural Killer (NK) cells, NKp46+RORgt+ cells secrete IL-22, like Lymphoid Tissue inducer (LTi) cells. We compared the global transcriptional profiles of both NKp46+RORgt- and NKp46+RORgt+ cells to conventional splenic NK cells and to SI NKp46-RORgt+ cells, which contain adult LTi cells. By following this approach, we showed that SI NKp46+RORγt- ILCs correspond to SI NK cells. We also identified a transcriptional program conserved in adult SI NKp46+RORγt+, NKp46-RORγt+ ILCs and fetal LTi.

DESIGN
The various ILC cell populations analyzed in this study were isolated from C57BL/6 RORc(gt)+/GFP reporter mice.  SI NKp46+RORγt- (NKp46+GFP-) cells, SI NKp46+RORγt+ cells (NKp46+GFPlow and NKp46+GFPhigh cells) and NKp46-RORγt+ ILCs, including adult LTi cells , were sorted by flow cytometry from CD3- lamina propria cells of small intestine (SI) of RORc(γt)+/GFP reporter mice . Splenic NKp46+RORγt- (NKp46+GFP-) cells were also sorted as the reference for conventional NK cells. Two replicates of each populations were produced and analyzed.
