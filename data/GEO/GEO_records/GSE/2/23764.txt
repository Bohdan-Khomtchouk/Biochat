TITLE
Expression data from actomyosin contractility regulated genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Actomyosin contractility regulates cell morphology and movement.  The objective of this study was to identify whether actomyosin contractility regulates gene expression in tumour cells and whether such genes are involved in cell morphology and movement.  Gene expression analysis was carried out on highly contractile melanoma cell line A375M2 plated on a deformable collagen matrix under conditions where actomyosin contractility could be altered following treatment with blebbistatin, a direct inhibitor of myosin II, or Rho-kinase inhibitors Y27632 or H1152 that interfere with signalling to myosin II.

DESIGN
18 samples (6 x 3 biological replicates).  Cells were plated on rigid or deformable matrices.  Rounded cells (A375M2 melanoma cells) plated on deformable matrices were left untreated or treated with Rho-kinase inhibitors Y27632, H1152 or blebbistatin an inhibitor of mysoin II.
