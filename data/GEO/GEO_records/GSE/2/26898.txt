TITLE
Evidence for Zoonotic Transmission of a Novel Adenovirus Associated with a Fulminant Pneumonia Outbreak in a Titi Monkey Colony

ORGANISM
Viruses

SUMMARY
We used the Virochip microarray to detect and discover a novel adenovirus, TMAdV (titi monkey adenovirus).  We used custom-commercial microarrays from Agilent Technologies.  The microarray platform GPL11662 consists of 62,976 probes, of which 19,058 probes are 70-mer viral oligonucleotides (the union of the V3 and V4 platforms -- please see Wang, et al., PNAS, 2002; Chiu, et al., Clin Infect Dis, 2006; Chiu, et al., PNAS, 2008).
