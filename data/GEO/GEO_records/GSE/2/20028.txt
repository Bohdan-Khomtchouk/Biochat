TITLE
Identification of miR-145 or miR-133a target genes in squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently identified a subset of down-regulated miRNAs such as miR-145 and miR-133a in squamous cell carcinoma. Cell growth inhibitions occurred in miR-145 and miR-133a transfectants compared with the controls, suggesting that both miRNAs function as tumor suppressors. The aims of our expression studies were identification of these miRNAs target genes.

DESIGN
miR-145 transfected cancer cells vs control cells, miR-133a transfected cancer cells vs control cells
