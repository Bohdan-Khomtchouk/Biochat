TITLE
Gene expression profile of murine cutaneous melanoma after systemic treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) associated or not with melphalan (MEL).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cutaneous melanomas are malignant radio and chemoresistant neoplasias presenting high morbidity and elevated mortality rates. Isolated Limb Perfusion (ILP) with Melphalan (Mel) is used in the treatment of non-resectable locally advanced melanomas of extremity sparing the limb from amputation in 40-50% of the cases. Adding the Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (Tnfa) improves total complete response to 70-90%. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the changes promoted by Mel and Tnfa are not completely understood. In this study we evaluated the impact of systemic Mel and Tnfa administration on tumor growth, analyzed the morphological changes promoted by each treatment, and searched for early molecular targets of Mel and Tnfa, alone or in combination, in a murine melanoma model. Morphological changes were analyzed by histological analysis, while microarray gene expression followed by quantitative RT-PCR were used to search for early molecular targets.  We found that Mel systemic administration accounted for the impairment of tumor-growth (p < 0.001) and improvement of survival. Tnfa co-administration augmented necrosis (p < 0.024) and decreased mitotic rates (p=0.001). We identified a set of 118 potential molecular markers that might be correlated with the observed biologic response to treatment with Melphalan and Tnfa and which could represent potential therapeutic targets in melanoma.
