TITLE
Expression data from Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling (GEP) can reveal characteristic signatures associated with distinct biologic subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We performed GEP on Down syndrome (DS) and comparison non-Down syndrome (NDS) ALL cases to identify biologic differences between these groups.

DESIGN
Ficoll-enriched, cryopreserved diagnostic bone marrow samples were obtained from patients with newly diagnosed B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
