TITLE
Gene expression of cerebellar granule cell layer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed gene-expression analysis of mouse cerebellar granule cell layer as compared to that of Purkinje cells. DNA microarray analysis detected genes in cerebellar granule cell layer, most of which are classified into functional molecule categories. Our comparative analysis between Purkinje cells and the granule cell layer showed that the characteristic expression pattern in Purkinje cells was particularly represented by “the neural communication system” components.

DESIGN
Pukinje cells and granule cell layer of the mouse cerebellum were collected by laser microdissection for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
