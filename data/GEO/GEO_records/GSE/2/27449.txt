TITLE
Changes of mRNA expressin in rat kidney inner medulla in response to dDAVP stimulation/ withdrawal

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The E3 ubiquitin -protein ligases (E3s) plays a role as regulators of protein trafficking and degradation. We aimed to identify E3s in rat kidney which are associated with dDAVP-induced urine concentration.
