TITLE
The transcriptional profilling of the thermosensitive self-incompatible het-R het-V strain undergoing cell death by incompatibility

ORGANISM
Podospora anserina

SUMMARY
In the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina, cell death by incompatibility can be monitored using the conditional self-incompatible (SI) het-R het-V strain. SI strains are homokaryotic strains bearing incompatible het genes in all nuclei. The co-expression of these het genes triggers cell death in all the cells and hence in the entire mycelium. The het-R het-V SI strain, bearing the two incompatible het-R and het-V genes, proved particularly convenient as cell death triggering is thermosensitive (J. Labarère et al., 1973, C R Acad Sci Hebd Seances Acad Sci D, 276) and is induced by a simple shift in growth temperature (from 32°C to 26°C).The development of this cell death reaction has been recorded for 4 h after transfer to the restrictive temperature. A time course (T0h to T4h) of the transcriptomic response to the temperature shift has been explored in parallel within SI (het-R het-V) and wild type (compatible het-r hetV) s strains.

DESIGN
With Platform GPL10116 : reference design with 2 strains: a WT strain and het-R het-V self-incompatible strain (J. Labarère et al., 1973, C R Acad Sci Hebd Seances Acad Sci D, 276).  Each strain with four biological replicates; the common reference is a pool of four conditions M48h, M96h, C48h and C96h ; Conditions are labelled in Cy3 and the common reference in Cy5.
