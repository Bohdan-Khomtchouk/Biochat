TITLE
Expression data from third instar larval eye discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Expression of dE2F1 induces proliferation and apoptosis. We sought to perform an unbiased analysis of the effect of co-expression of miR-11 We used microarrays to identify differentially regulated genes following expression of dE2F1 and/or dme-miR-11 using the GMR-Gal4 driver

DESIGN
Drosophila third instar larvae were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The GMR-Gal4 driver induces expression posterior to the morphogenetic furrow. We compared the gene expression profiles following induction of expression of dE2F1 + dDP and/or dme-miR-11.
