TITLE
Genome wide trimethyl-H3K27 distibution in macrophages from wild-type and Jmjd3-/- macrophages.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Jmjd3 is trimethyl H3K27 specific demethylase required for M2 macrophage polarization. Genomic fragments obtained from wild-type and Jmjd3-/- mouse macrophages were immunoprecipitated with anti H3K27me3 Ab, and deep sequencing was performed.

DESIGN
wild-type and Jmjd3-/- macrophages
