TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis in the mid-gestation human intestine discloses greater immaturity of the colon as compared to ileum

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The occurrence of many neonatal inflammatory intestinal diseases in preterm infants highlights the susceptibility of the immature intestine to respond inadequately to nutrient and microbes. A better understanding of the functional intestinal development is essential for the design of optimal treatments ensuring survival and growth of premature infants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the gene expression profiles of the developing human ileum and colon at mid-gestation. Our results showed that more than 11% of the genes were differentially expressed between ileum and colon. Pathway analysis revealed an even higher level of transcriptional dissimilarity between the developing ileum and the colon including 35% of the significant cellular, molecular and physiological functions and 85% of the canonical pathways. Segment-specific/over-expressed functions in the ileum included a number of amino acid, vitamin and mineral metabolisms and lymphoid tissue structure and development reflecting the high level of maturity of the small intestine as compared to the colon in which cell cycle, cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton, integrin and ERK/MAPK signaling were the predominant functions. All together, functional clustering analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed important functional difference between the two segments namely to an unexpected relative immaturity of the colon.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: three human fetal small intestines vs. three human fetal large intestines.
