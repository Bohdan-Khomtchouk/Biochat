TITLE
The effect of TNFa on endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the transcripts induced by TNFa and how these may interact in inflammatory networks, the transcriptome of HUCECs stimulated with TNFa was examined in 3 different pools each cosisting of 10 different HUVEC isolates.

DESIGN
In the study present here, HUVEC isolates from 3 pools of 10 different individuals were cultured until passage 4 in fully supplemented growth conditions. Passage 4 HUVEC isolates were then treated with TNFa (10ng/ml), with RNA extracted at time points 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 5, and 6hrs after TNFa treatment . RNA was extracted and hybridised onto CodeLink microarrays.
