TITLE
MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF LIVER ALLOGRAFTS FROM OPERATIONALLY TOLERANT TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS (Affymetrix)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In clinical organ transplantation complete cessation of immunosuppressive therapy can be successfully accomplished in selected recipients providing a proof-of-principle that allograft tolerance is attainable in humans. The intra-graft molecular pathways associated with human allograft tolerance, however, have not been comprehensively studied before. In this study we analyzed sequential liver tissue samples collected from liver recipients enrolled in a prospective multicenter immunosuppressive withdrawal clinical trial. Tolerant and non-tolerant recipients differed in the intra-graft expression of genes involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis.These results point to a critical role of iron homeostasis in the regulation of intra-graft alloimmune responses in humans and provide a set of novel biomarkers to conduct drug-weaning trials in liver transplantation.

DESIGN
The complete database comprised the expression measurements of 54,675 genes for liver inmunotolerance groups: 9 Tolerant (TOL) 10 Non Tolerant (Non TOL).A subset of 5 tolerant samples  (TOL POST) were taken 1 year after inmunosuppresive therapy.
