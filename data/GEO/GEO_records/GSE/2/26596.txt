TITLE
Analysis of microRNA expression during Epstein-Barr virus encoded LMP1 and LMP2A transfected in TW03 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epstein-Barr virus has been reported to  regulate cellular microRNA expression in B cells. In the present study, we investigated  the differential microRNAs modulated by Epstein-Barr virus in Naspharyngeal Carcinoma, using CapitalBio corporation's mammalian miRNA arrays.
