TITLE
Identification of Hoxa1 downstream targets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand the role of Hoxa1 during embryogenesis and gain insight to the transcriptional network controlled by this gene, we carried out a large-scale screening for Hoxa1 downstream targets by performing microarray analysis.  Tissue from the rhombomere 3-5 region of wildtype and Hoxa1 null embryos, including neuroectoderm, mesoderm and otic ectoderm was microdissected at the peak of Hoxa1 expression.  RNA from wildtype and Hoxa1Δ/Δ samples was hybridized to the Agilent mouse whole genome array.

DESIGN
Tissue from the rhombomere 3-5 region of wildtype and Hoxa1 null embryos, including neuroectoderm, mesoderm and otic ectoderm was microdissected at the peak of Hoxa1 expression (1-6 somite stage).
