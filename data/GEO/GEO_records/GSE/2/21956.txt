TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Thermoplasma acidophilum DSM 1728

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Thermoplasma acidophilum cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The analysis are further described in Na Sun, Cuiping Pan, Stephan Nickell, Matthias Mann, Wolfgang Baumeister, and Istv√°n Nagy, Quantitative proteome and transcriptome analysis of the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (submitted).

DESIGN
Total RNA of T. acidophilum was isolated with the RNeasy Protect Bacteria Kit (Qiagen). The transcriptomics analysis was performed on TI273075 60mer chips of Roche NimbleGen microarrays (NimbleGen Systems of Iceland, LLC). Probes were selected for all protein sequences (1482) and labelled with Cy3. The median number of probes per sequence is 20, and each probe is replicated 5 times on the chip. The probes are randomly distributed over the surface of the array. Unused features are filled with randomly generated probes of comparable GC content. ArrayStar v2.0 software (DNASTAR, Inc.) was used for the data analysis. Three independent biological replicates were processed for aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively.
