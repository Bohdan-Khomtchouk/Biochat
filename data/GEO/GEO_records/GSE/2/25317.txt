TITLE
OVCAR-3 Cells: Control vs. FBA-TPQ treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study was designed to determine the biological effects of novel marine alkaloid analog, FBA-TPQ on human ovarian cancer cells for its anti-tumor potential and the underlying mechanisms as a novel chemotherapeutic agent. Transcriptional profiling of human ovarian cancer cells comparing control vehicle-treated OVCAR-3(a human ovarian cancer cell line) cells with OVCAR-3 cells treated with 1000nM FBA-TPQ for 24 hours. Goal was to determine the effects of FBA-TPQ on global OVCAR-3 cells gene expression.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, control vehicle-treated OVCAR-3  vs. FBA-TPQ treated-OVCAR-3 cells. Biological replicates: 2 replicates.
