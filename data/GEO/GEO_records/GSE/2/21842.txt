TITLE
Physiological Jak2V617F expression causes a lethal myeloproliferative neoplasm with differential effects on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report a Jak2V617F knock-in mouse myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) model resembling human polycythemia vera (PV). The MPN is serially transplantable and we demonstrate that the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment has the unique capacity for disease initiation but does not have a selective competitive advantage over wild type HSCs. In contrast, myeloid progenitor populations are expanded and skewed towards the erythroid lineage, but cannot transplant the disease. Treatment with a JAK2 kinase inhibitor ameliorated the MPN phenotype, but did not eliminate the disease-initiating population. These findings provide insights into the consequences of JAK2 activation on HSC differentiation and function and have the potential to inform therapeutic approaches to JAK2V617F positive MPN.

DESIGN
LKS cells were isolated from wild type (n=4) and JAK2V617F mutant mice (n=4). RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit according to manufacturers instruction and amplified using NUGEN amplification kit. cDNA was fragmented and biotinylated before hybridization onto Affymetrix Mouse Expression Array 430 2.0.
