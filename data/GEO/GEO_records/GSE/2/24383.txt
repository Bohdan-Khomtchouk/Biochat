TITLE
The conjunctival transcriptome in scarring trachoma for Tanzanians

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Trachoma is a poorly understood immuno-fibrogenic disease process, initiated by Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct). Differences in conjunctival gene expression profiles between Tanzanians with trachomatous conjunctival scarring (with (TSI) and without (TS) inflammation) and controls (C) were investigated to identify relevant host responses. Tarsal conjunctival swab samples were collected for RNA isolation and Ct PCR. Transcriptome-wide microarray experiments were conducted on 41 samples (TSI 13, TS 15, C14). Cases had enrichment in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL1B, IL8, CXCL5, CCL20); Matrix metalloprotienases (MMP7, MMP9, MMP12); components of the cornified envelope / squamous metaplasia (SPRR2a, SPRR2F).

DESIGN
Case - control study. Conjunctival swab samples were collected from people with trachomatious conjunctival scarring with (TSI) and without (TS) clinically visable inflammation compared to normal controls (C). Total RNA extracted and analysed on the Illumina WG-6 platrom. Additional extensive qRT-PCR work done on a large set of case-control pairs.
