TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for 31 Tibetan samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This data was used to identify regions of the genome that have undergone positive selection in a high-altitude Tibetan population.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were used to genotype DNA extracted from blood samples.  This data was used to perform genome-wide scans of positive selection in a native high-altitude Tibetan population.
