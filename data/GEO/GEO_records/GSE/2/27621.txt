TITLE
Dose dependent response of liver gene expression and lipoperoxidation to dietary long chain omega 3 PUFA

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
The cardioprotective effects of long chain (LC) 3PUFA can be achieved at the gene expression level, notably in liver. However, the complexity of biological pathways modulations and the nature of the bioactive molecules are still under investigation. The present study aimed to investigate the dose-response effects of LC 3PUFA on the production of peroxidated metabolites and on global gene expression in liver. The intake of LC ω3PUFA increased, in a dose-dependent manner, their incorporation in liver phospholipids but also the hepatic production of 4-HHE. Pathways related to inflammation were dose-dependently associated with the 3 groups but Group 2 was rather associated with inflammatory effects while Group 3 was anti-inflammatory. LC ω3PUFA had no effect on PPAR-controlled genes. However, they modified, in a dose-dependent manner, the expression of major genes related to lipoprotein metabolism (LDLR, VLDLR, INSIG1 and MTTP), possibly through the FXR signaling pathway. In conclusion, the effect of LC ω3PUFA is dependent on the dose possibly because of the production of peroxidated metabolites such as 4-HHE.

DESIGN
New-Zealand white rabbits were fed (7 wk) a high cholesterol diet and received by daily oral gavages either oleic acid rich oil or a mixture of oils providing 0.1% (Group 1), 0.5% (Group 2) or 1% (Group 3) of energy as docosahexaenoic acid. Specific peroxidated metabolite issued from LC 3PUFA (4-hydroxyhexenal or 4-HHE) were measured by GC/MS/MS and transcription profiling was conducted in liver. Differentially expressed genes were identified using Bioconductor (Moderated p < 0.05, Fold Change > 1.20) and clustered into pathways (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 7.0).
