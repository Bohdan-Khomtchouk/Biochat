TITLE
Human skeletal muscle transcriptional response to exercise

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of training on the global transcriptional response of skeletal muscle to an acute bout of resistance exercise.

DESIGN
Seven young healthy men and women underwent a 12-week supervised progressive unilateral arm resistance exercise (RE) training program. One week after the last session of training, subjects performed an acute bout of bilateral arm RE in which the trained and the untrained arm exercised at the same relative intensity. A muscle biopsy was obtained 4h post exercise from the biceps brachii of the trained and untrained arm. Trained and untrained muscle samples were analyzed for mRNA levels of over 20,000 annotated genes using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays.
