Alterations in skeletal muscle mRNA profile by angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes in skeletal muscle myoblasts in response to over-expression of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2). The hypothesis tested in the present study was that over-expression of Ang-1 or Ang-2 will induce the expression of pro-survival and pro-differentiation genes in skeletal myoblasts while inhibiting the expression of pro-apoptotic genes.  Results provide important information of how mRNA profile of skeletal myoblasts is altered by Ang-1 and ang-2 and provide first evidence that secondary mediators such as leptin may mediate the enhancement of skeletal myoblasts differentiation by Ang-1 and Ang-2.
