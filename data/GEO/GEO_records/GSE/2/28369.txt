TITLE
Expression data from LSK mice that overpexpress Ezh2 versus LSK Control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ezh2 is a protein member of PRC2 and has described like a functional repressor gene. We are investigating the role of Ezh2 in hematopoietic stem cell, aging and leukemia. In the present study, we generated mouse models that allow gain-of-function of Ezh2 in the hematopoietic system. Activation of Ezh2 expression specifically in self-renewing HSCs alters gene expression programs and severely compromises hematopoietic function, leading to the development of myeloproliferative disease.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in LSK that has relationship with the overexpression of Ezh2. LSK were marked and isolated by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting in Trizol.
