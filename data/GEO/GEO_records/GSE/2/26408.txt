TITLE
Signatures of murine B-cell development implicate Yy1 as a regulator of the germinal center-specific program

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Heirarchical development of B-cells involves the induction and supression of large sets of genes that provide the basis for differentiation and, ultimately, antibody production. We used microarrays to define comprehensive differentiation state-specific transcriptional signatures in order to gain insight into B-cell biology. In addition, we compared profiles of normal B-cells to those of murine lymphoma models that are putatively aligned with different states.
