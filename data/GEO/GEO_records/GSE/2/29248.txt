TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of  microRNA expression in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of NSCLC development at microRNA expression level.  Results shows that has-miR-96 is significant up-regulated in the cancer tissue compared with the adjacent normal tissue. Illumina Human v2 MicroRNA expression beadchip

DESIGN
Total microRNA obtained from 6 paired NSCLC cancer tissue and the adjacent normal tissue.
