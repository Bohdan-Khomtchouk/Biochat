TITLE
Minicircle-derived iPS cells - Affymetrix Data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Owing to the risk of insertional mutagenesis, viral transduction has been increasingly replaced by nonviral methods to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. We report the use of ‘minicircle’ DNA, a vector type that is free of bacterial DNA and capable of high expression in cells. Here we use a single minicircle vector to generate transgene-free iPSCs from adult human adipose stem cells. (Note: Our Nature Methods publication included analysis of array data from GSM378832 (Foreskin),  GSM378833-GSM378838 (JT-iPSC), and GSM378817-GSM378820 (H1, H7, H9, H13, H14) in conjunction with this series).

DESIGN
Total RNA from human adipose stem cells (hASC, n = 3 replicate samples),  hASC-derived iPS cells using lentiviral factors (lenti-iPSC, n = 3 replicate samples), and minicircle-derived human iPS cells (mc-iPSC, n = 3 subclones from adipose tissue of three individual patients) was hybridized to nine Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.
