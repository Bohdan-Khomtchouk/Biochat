TITLE
Expression data from human liver with or without type 2 diabetes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The liver may regulate glucose homeostasis by modulating the sensitivity/resistance of peripheral tissues to insulin, by way of the production of secreted proteins, termed hepatokines. To identify hepatic secretory proteins involved in insulin resistance, we performed liver biopsies in humans with or without type 2 diabetes and conducted a comprehensive analysis of gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
Samples for analysis were obtained from ten patients with type 2 diabetes and 7 subjects with normal glucose tolerance, who were admitted to Kanazawa University Hospital. Hepatic tissues were obtained with percutaneous needle liver biopsy, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use.
