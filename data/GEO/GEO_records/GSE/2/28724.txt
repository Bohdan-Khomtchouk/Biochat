TITLE
Expression data from cultured human ovarian carcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hallmark of human cancer is heterogeneity, mirroring the complexity of genetic and epigenetic alterations acquired during oncogenesis.  We extracted RNA of 34 cultured human ovarian carcinoma cell lines and performed expression microarrays so that cultured cell lines can represent in vivo human tumors.

DESIGN
34 ovarian carcinoma cell lines expression data.
