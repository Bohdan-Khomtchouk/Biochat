TITLE
Expression data in UPEC cystitis in female C57BL/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Data defines for the first time a whole bladder transcriptome of UPEC cystitis in female C57BL/6 mice using genome-wide expression profiling to map early host response pathways stemming from UPEC colonization We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in UPEC UTI in mice
