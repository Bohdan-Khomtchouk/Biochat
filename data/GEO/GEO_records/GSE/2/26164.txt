TITLE
Regulation of DNA methylation by CK2-mediated phosphorylation of DNMT3A (Beadchip)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is a central epigenetic modification that has essential roles in cellular processes including chromatin structure, gene regulation, development and disease. The de novo DNA methyltransferases are responsible for the generation of genomic methylation patterns, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we show that phosphorylation of DNMT3A by the CK2 protein kinase regulates the establishment of DNA methylation patterns. We find that DNMT3A is phosphorylated by CK2 at two key residues located near its PWWP domain. We observed that, through phosphorylation of these residues, CK2 negatively regulates DNMT3Aâ€™s ability to methylate DNA and consistent with this, CK2 was found to decrease overall genomic level of 5-methylcytosine. Further, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in CK2-depleted cells revealed that CK2 affects primarily CpG methylation of several heterochromatin repeats as well as Alu elements. Along these lines, we found that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of DNMT3A was required for its proper heterochromatin localization. Our results define phosphorylation as a new mode of regulation of de novo DNA methyltransferase function. These findings further uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism for the regulation of methylation at repetitive elements. They shed new light into the origin of DNA methylation patterns.
