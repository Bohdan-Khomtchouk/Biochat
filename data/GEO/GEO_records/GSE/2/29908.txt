TITLE
Expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cell in patients with type 1 diabetes before and after peripheral stem cell transplantation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHST) was the first therapeutic approaches that can improveβcell function in type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients. This study was designed to investigate the potential mechanisms involved.We applied AHST to nine T1D patients diagnosed within six months and analyzed the acute response in peripheral blood  genomic expression profiling at the six-month follow-up.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear of newly diagnosed type1 diabetes patients at diagnosis and at six months post-transplantation by autologous peripheral stem cell were purified by  LymphoprepTm gradient purification according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) for futher microarray analysis.
