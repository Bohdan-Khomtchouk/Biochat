TITLE
Transcriptome data for human ES, FORESKIN and FORESKIN-derived iPS (ES4SKIN) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Assessing relevant differences between human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and human embryonic stem (ES) cells is important, given that such differences may impact their potential therapeutic use. We used microarray to profile the changes in global gene expression arising from the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells.
