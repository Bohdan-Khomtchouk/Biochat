TITLE
Expression profile of TTHA0175-deficient Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
In order to find function of TTHA0175 protein from T. thermophilus HB8, we observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of the TTHA0175-deficient strain grown in a rich medium at 70Â°C for 300, 480, and 600 min.
