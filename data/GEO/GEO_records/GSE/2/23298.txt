TITLE
Mapping of Polycomb binding in Drosophila larval brain tissue using DamID

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We made Polycomb (PC) and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) chromatin binding maps in central brain tissue from 3rd instar larvae, allowing us to make a direct comparison to our 4C data ( ). Our results demonstrate that our PC and H3K27me3 maps are highly similar, and fit with previously identified hallmarks of PcG-bound chromatin, namely: PC and H3K27me3 co-occur in the genome as large contiguous domains that largely repress transcription of the underlying genes, which encode important regulators of development. Keywords: Genome binding/occupancy profiling by genome tiling array

DESIGN
DamID experiments for Polycomb were performed in Drosophila larval brain tissue. Samples were hybridized to 380k NimbleGen arrays with 300 bp probe spacing.
