TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the effect of long-term cryopreservation on peripheral blood mononuclear cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of effect of long-term cryopreservation on peripheral blood mononuclear cells at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that long-term cryopreservation has an influence on the transcriptome profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results indicated remarkable changes in expression patterns upon cryopreservation of PBMCs, with decreasing signal intensities over time.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of melanoma patients cryopreserved in liqiud nitrogen from 20 to 60 months.
