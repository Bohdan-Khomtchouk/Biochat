TITLE
Paternally-induced transgenerational environmental reprogramming of metabolic gene expression in mammals (small RNA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Characterized the small (19-35 bp) RNA population from control and low protein offspring livers by high throughput sequencing. Eight sequencing lanes, one for each animal, with an average of 3.7 million mappable reads per lane. A number of miRNAs changed expression in the offspring from low protein diet fathers.

DESIGN
Examination of the effect of 2 different paternal diets, control diet  and low-protein diet, on the small RNA expression in the liver of the offsprings. 8 samples: 4 are control diets and 4 are low protein diets
