TITLE
Microgravity effect on C. elegans N2/VC (CERISE, 8days)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Microgravity effect on C. elegans gene expression was analysed by whole genome microarray. The worms were cultivated under microgravity for 8days in the Japanese Module of the International Space Station.

DESIGN
The samples of this study were divided three experimental groups: 1. microgravity for 8days 2. artificial 1G control for 8days on orbit 3. ground 1G control for 8days This study was repeated with three biological and two technical replicates.
