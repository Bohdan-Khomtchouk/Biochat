TITLE
Genome wide screening for alternative splicing events in pancreatic cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays to identify alternative splicing events in 15 samples of PDAC compared to 6 non-tumor samples. Several commercial and open source software approaches for the analysis of differential splicing were tested and a subset of overlapping results was validated using RT-PCR and sequencing.  Splicing variants could be validated in several genes closely related to cancer. Pathway analysis of genes predicted to be alternatively spliced revealed an enrichment of genes in categories closely related to cell-cell interactions and kinase activity.

DESIGN
15 samples of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 6 non tumor pancreatic samples were analyzed for alternative splicing events
