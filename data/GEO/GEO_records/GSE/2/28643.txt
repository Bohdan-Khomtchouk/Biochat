TITLE
ApoD modulation mouse cerebellar transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The lipocalin Apolipoprotein D (ApoD), known to protect the nervous system against oxidative stress (OS) in model organisms, is up-regulated early in the mouse brain in response to the ROS generator paraquat (PQ). However, the processes triggered by this up-regulation have not been explored.

DESIGN
We present here a study of the effect of ApoD on the early transcriptional changes upon OS in the mouse cerebellum using microarray profiling. ApoD-KO and transgenic mice over-expressing ApoD in neurons are compared to wild-type controls.
