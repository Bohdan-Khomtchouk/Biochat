TITLE
Chip-chip from HeLa S3 expressing epitope-tagged H2Abbd, macroH2A and H2A histones: H2Abbd versus H2A, and macroH2A versus H2A, distributions on 13 regions of the HG18 assembly

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The distribution of histone variants H2Abbd and macroH2A in 13 regions of the HG18 assembly have been studied using a variant of the ChIP-on-Chip technique. HeLa S3  cell lines  expressing tagged histones H2A, H2Abbd or macroHA were obtained using retroviral transfer. DNA fractions associated with tagged histones were isolated using a two-step purification procedure that involved affinity chromatography on a column with anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by affinity chromatography on a Ni-agarose column. The obtained genomic DNA samples were analyzed by hybridization with custom NimbleGene genomic microarrays.

DESIGN
Two samples. Test sample 1 is HeLa S3 cells expressing epitope-tagged histone H2Abbd and test sample 2 is HeLa S3 cells expressing epitope-tagged histone macroH2A . The control for both test sample 1 and test sample 2 is HeLa S3 expressing epitope-tagged histone H2A. Two copies of each probe per array were made.
