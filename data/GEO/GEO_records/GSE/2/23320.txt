TITLE
Gene Expression Dynamics of Defined Cell Populations in Developing Drosophila Embryos and Larvae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Microarray profiling of GFP-marked neuronal and non-neuronal cellular populations isolated by FACS at 24h intervals across development of Drosophila larvae.

DESIGN
Multiple independent replicates collected for each population/timepoint combination.  RNA isolated and amplified from FACS-sorted populations.  Hybridized as two-color experiment against a common pooled reference.
