TITLE
Lung cancer signatures in plasma based on proteome profiling of mouse tumor models

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mouse models of cancer recapitulate many of the molecular and biological features of the human disease.  We sought to exploit these experimental merits in a systematic comparative proteomics search for circulating proteins associated with lung tumor development. In-depth quantitative proteomics was applied to plasmas from three mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma driven by mutant EGFR or Kras or induced by urethane exposure and a mouse model of small cell lung cancer driven by loss of Trp53 and Rb. To further refine our lung cancer-specific and broad carcinoma signatures, we intersected these lung cancer proteome profiles with those from other well-established mouse models of pancreatic, ovarian, colon, prostate and breast cancer, as well as two mouse models of inflammation. A set of proteins regulated by Titf1/Nkx2-1, a master transcription factor in cells from the peripheral airways and a known lineage-survival oncogene in lung cancer was identified in plasmas of mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma. An EGFR network of proteins was discerned in the plasma of mice with lung tumors driven by a mutant human EGFR.  Levels of these proteins returned toward baseline upon treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Moreover, a distinct plasma signature was uncovered in the Trp53/Rb mutant small cell lung cancer model that included a set of proteins associated with neuroendocrine development. Our studies have identified novel plasma protein signatures among molecularly or histopathologically defined lung cancer subtypes.
