TITLE
The Role of Nogo in asthma pathogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to determine if there are any genetic differences among lungs of Nogo-A/B knockout mice which may explain their enhanced asthmatic-like responses, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify any genes that may be altered in the lung of Nogo-A/B knockout mice.  RNA was isolated from three biological replicates of mouse lungs from naive WT and Nogo-A/B Knockout mice and run on agilent array.  Two genes was significantly altered in Nogo-A/B Knockout lungs, SPLUNC1 and RTN4 (Nogo) which was significantly decreased and confirmed by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Gene expression in na√Øve mouse lungs of WT and Nogo-A/B knockout mice was measured in three individual biological replicates from each group.
