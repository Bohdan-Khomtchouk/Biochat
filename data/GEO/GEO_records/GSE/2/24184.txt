TITLE
Comparative expression analysis between TTHA0101-deficient mutant and wild-type of Thermus thermophilus HB8

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of TTHA0101 deletion mutant of Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain grown in a rich (TT) medium at 70°C compared with that of wild type.

DESIGN
Four wild-type and three mutant T. thermophilus HB8 strains were each pre-cultured at 70°C for 16 h in 3 ml of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells (2 ml) were inoculated into 1 liter of the same medium and then cultivated at 70°C. Cells were collected after 680 min, and then crude RNA was extracted. In order to compare mRNA expression in the TTHA0101 deletion mutant with that of wild type, the expression of each mRNA was analyzed on a GeneChip.
