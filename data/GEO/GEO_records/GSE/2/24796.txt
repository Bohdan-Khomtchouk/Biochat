TITLE
Effects of Genistein on LNCaP Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling to identify genes significantly modulated by low and high doses of genistein in LNCaP cells. Significant genes were identified using StepMiner analysis and significantly altered pathways with Ingenuity Pathways analysis.  Genistein significantly altered expression of transcripts involved in cell growth, carcinogen defenses and steroid signaling pathways.  The effects of genistein on these pathways were confirmed by directly assessing dose-related effects on LNCaP cell growth, NQO-1 enzymatic activity and PSA protein expression.

DESIGN
A compound treatment design type is where the response to administration of a compound or chemical (including biological compounds such as hormones) is assayed.
