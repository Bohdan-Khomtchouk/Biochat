TITLE
Polyphenols from Myrothamnus flabellifolia Welw. inhibit in vitro adhesion of Porphyromonas gingivalis and exert anti-inflammatory cytoprotective effects in KB cells

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 treated with an anti-adhesive extract from Myrothamnus flabellifolia compared to the untreated strain. Aim: Identification of anti-adhesive plant extracts against cell surface binding of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Materials and Methods: Polyphenol-enriched extract from Myrothamnus flabellifolia (MF) traditionally used for periodontitis was tested for inhibition of P. gingivalis adhesion to KB cells by FACS, for influence on gingipain activity, hemagglutination and by microarray analysis for effects on the bacterial transcriptome. P. gingivalis-induced inflammation parameters were monitored by RT-PCR. Results: MF (100 µg/ml) reduced P. gingivalis adhesion/invasion about 50% by interacting with fimbriae and bacterial OMPs.  Microarray analysis of MF-treated bacteria indicated up-regulation of genes involved in cell adhesion. As confirmed by RT-PCR, fimbrillin- and Arg-gingipain-encoding genes were upregulated by MF. On the protein level, inhibition (70%) of Arg-gingipain activity was observed, while the corresponding Lys-gingipain was hardly influenced. MF also inhibited hemagglutination. While exposure to P. gingivalis resulted in an increased expression of inflammation-related genes in KB cells, pretreatment of KB cells with MF evoked cytoprotective effects concerning IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα gene expression as well as IL-6 release rates. Conclusions: While being cytoprotective, MF exerts strong anti-adhesive effects against P. gingivalis. Thus, MF may be useful for the prevention of P. gingivalis-associated periodontal diseases.
