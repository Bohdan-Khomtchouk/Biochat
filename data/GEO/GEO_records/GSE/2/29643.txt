TITLE
The transcription factor cyclic AMP–responsive element–binding protein H regulates triglyceride metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we report that the transcription factor cyclic AMP–responsive element–binding protein H (CREB-H, encoded by CREB3L3) is required for the maintenance of normal plasma triglyceride concentrations. CREB-H–deficient mice showed hypertriglyceridemia secondary to inefficient triglyceride clearance catalyzed by lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), partly due to defective expression of the Lpl coactivators Apoc2, Apoa4 and Apoa5 and concurrent augmentation of the Lpl inhibitor Apoc3. We identified multiple nonsynonymous mutations in CREB3L3 that produced hypomorphic or nonfunctional CREB-H protein in humans with extreme hypertriglyceridemia, implying a crucial role for CREB-H in human triglyceride metabolism.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from the liver of three WT and three Creb3l3 deficient mice after a 24-h fasting. Littermates were used. Gene expression profiles were examined using Illumina WG-6 microarray chips.
