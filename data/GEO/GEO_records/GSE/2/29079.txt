TITLE
Gene expression profiles of 48 normal and 47 prostate tumor tissue samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Large-scale gene expression profiles were investigated in 48 normal and 47 prostate tumor tissue samples using Affymetrix GeneChip Exon 1.0 ST microarrays.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of human prostate samples using Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays Two disease subtype analyses were performed: - Prostate Tumor vs Benign - TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive vs fusion-negative prostate tumors
