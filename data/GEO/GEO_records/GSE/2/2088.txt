SUMMARY
Two subclasses of lung squamous cell carcinoma with different gene expression profiles and prognosis identified by hierarchical clustering and validated by non-negative matrix factorization . BACKGROUND: Current clinical and histopathological criteria used to define lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are insufficient to predict clinical outcome. We attempted to make a clinically-useful classification based on gene expression profiling. METHODS: We used cDNA microarrays with 40386 elements to analyze the gene expression profiles of 48 surgically resected samples of lung SCC. 9 samples of lung adenocarcinoma and 30 of normal lung were also included to give a total of 87 samples analyzed. After gene filtering, the data were subjected to hierarchical clustering and consensus clustering with the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach. FINDINGS: Initial analysis by hierarchical clustering allowed division of SCCs into two distinct subclasses. An additional independent round of hierarchical clustering and consensus clustering with the NMF approach provided a validation for the classification. Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log rank test pointed to a non-significant difference in survival (p=0.071) but the likelihood of survival to 6 years was significantly different between the two groups (40.5% vs 81.8%, p=0.014, Z-test). Biological process categories characteristic for each subclass were identified statistically and up-regulation of cell-proliferation related genes was evident in the subclass with a poor prognosis. In the subclass with the better survival, genes involved in differentiated intracellular functions, such as the MAPKKK cascade, ceramide metabolism, or regulation of transcription, were up-regulated.
