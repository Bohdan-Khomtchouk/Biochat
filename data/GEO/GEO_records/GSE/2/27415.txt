TITLE
Expression data for HIF1alpha-regulated genes in clear cell renal carcinoma cells (ccRCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed in ccRCC cells, which either express both HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha (either naturally or by virtue of induced expression of HIF1alpha) or express HIF2alpha alone (either naturally or by virtue of a HIF1alpha shRNA), to identify genes regulated by HIF1alpha in ccRCC cells.
