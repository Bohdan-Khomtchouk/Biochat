TITLE
Cisplatin-induced gene expression in DNA adenine methyltransferase (dam) and mismatch repair deficient E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to determine the cisplatin-induced gene expression changes in E. coli deficient in dam and mismatch repair (dam, dam mutS, and mutS mutant strains).  E. coli deficient in dam are hypersensitive to cisplatin.  However introducing an additional mutation in mismatch repair (i.e., a mutation in mutS or mutL) abrogates this sensitivity and essentially restores wildtype levels of resistance. Keywords: Drug-induced expression
