TITLE
Expression analysis of fast-fermenting high-gravity maltose Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y55 mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in three S. cerevisiae Y55 mutants, compared to the wild-type strain.  The UV-induced mutations enable the mutant strains to ferment  high-gravity maltose faster than the WT. The mutants analyzed in this study are further described in Baerends, R.J.S., J.L. Qiu, L. Gautier, and A. Brandt. A high-throughput system for screening of fast-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Manuscript in preparation.
