TITLE
Parietal cell gene expression in the presence and absence of gastrin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Parietal cells were isolated from WT and Gastrin Knockout mice.  Targets from three biological replicates of each were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix murine U74Av2 arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes with gastrin responsiveness. Keywords: repeat
