TITLE
Expression data from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic isolated human islets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray analysis to evaluate differences in the transcriptome of type 2 diabetic human islets compared to non-diabetic islet samples.

DESIGN
Human islets were isolated from the pancreas of organ donors by collagenase digestion followed by density gradient purification, then hand-picked and cultured 2 days in M199 culture medium.
