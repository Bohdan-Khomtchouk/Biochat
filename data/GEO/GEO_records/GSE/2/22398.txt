TITLE
S. coelicolor M752 SMM medium time course study

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
Antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces species is controlled by a complex genetic and biochemical network of global and pathway specific regulators. Details of their precise interactions in mediating temporal and spatial expression of secondary metabolite genes remain poorly defined. In this study, we employed whole-genome microarrays to investigate the temporal transcriptome profiles of S. coelicolor A3(2) M752 mutant strain, which has an in frame deletion of scbR (SCO6265) and compare it to the wild-type M145 strain. scbR encondes a gamma-butyrolactone binding protein (Takano, E., Chakraburtty, R., Nihira, T., Yamada, Y., and Bibb, M. A complex role for the gamma-butyrolactone SCB1 in regulating antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Mol. Microbiol. 2001 41(5), 1015-1028).

DESIGN
The time-course study involved analysis of 8 samples (14hr, 15hr, 16hr, 17hr, 19hr, 20hr, 22hr, 39hr). Sample 22hr was analyzed on duplicate arrays (2 technical replicates). Genomic DNA of S. coelicolor wild type (M145) was used as a reference for all the arrays. cDNA was labeled with Alexa647 and genomic DNA was labeled with Cy3.
