TITLE
Chip-seq of H3 in murine embryonic stem cells, myotubes and pro-B cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nucleosome remodeling results in loss of histone occupancy.  To gain insight into variations in H3 occupancy in different murine cell types, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed to determine genome wide occupancy of H3 in ES cells, myotubes and pro-B cells.

DESIGN
DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing.  ChIP was performed using an antibody against total H3 in murine ES cells in normal culture conditions, murine ES cells treated with the TGF-beta inhibitor (SB431542, 10uM) for 24 hours, myotubes differentiated for 48 hours and pro-B cells under normal culture conditions.
