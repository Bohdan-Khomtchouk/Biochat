TITLE
CpG methylation patterns and decitabine treatment response in acute myeloid leukemia cells and normal hematopoietic precursors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The DNA hypomethylating drug decitabine maintains normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) self-renewal but induces terminal differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. To better understand the basis for this contrasting treatment effect, the baseline expression of key lineage-specifying transcription factor (TF) (eg., CEBPa) and key late differentiation TF (CEBPe), was examined in normal, myelodysplastic (MDS) and AML primary cells and cell lines. To appreciate the role of differentiation in hypomethylation of some CpG by decitabine treatment but not others, promoter CpGs, analyzed by microarray and mass spectrometry, were categorized by the direction of methylation change during normal myeloid differentiation. In MDS/AML cells, high expression of CEBPa, relatively low expression of CEBPe (a gene target of CEBPa), hypermethylation of CEBPe promoter CpG, and the methylation pattern at differentiation sensitive promoter CpGs analyzed by microarray, suggested lineage-commitment and aberrant epigenetic repression of late differentiation genes. DNA hypomethylation in response to decitabine was greatest at CpGs that are hypomethylated during normal myeloid differentiation. In contrast, normal HSPC treated with decitabine retained immature morphology, and methylation significantly decreased at CpG that are hypermethylated during myeloid differentiation. Partial differentiation at baseline, and repression of key late differentiation genes by epigenetic means, likely plays a role in methylation and phenotype responses of AML cells treated with decitabine.

DESIGN
