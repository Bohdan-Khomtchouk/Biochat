TITLE
CD1d orchestrates skin cell survival and inflammation in response to UV linking the etiology of sunburn to skin cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Solar UV represents a ubiquitous environmental physical insult. Thus, to maintain its integrity as an effective barrier, skin must be unusually resistant to cell death. However, UV overexposure causes sunburn1,2 (necrosis and inflammation) and cells that survive harbour damaged DNA, which if not repaired or removed by apoptosis can lead to skin cancer development3-10. CD1d, a transmembrane protein identified in glycolipid antigen presentation11,12 to invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells13,14 is expressed by epithelial cells of most tissues including skin15-17, and shares close homology between humans and mice12. Since CD1d and NKT cells are implicated in regulating UV skin carcinogenesis4,18, we studied susceptibility to UV-induced sunburn in mice either lacking expression of both CD1d and NKT cells or expressing CD1d without NKT cells. Here we show that CD1d, but not NKT cells is necessary for UV to cause sunburn. CD1d causes cells to resist apoptosis in response to UV overexposure as the means to promote cell survival and directs the expression of inflammatory response genes, resulting in tissue destruction and skin inflammation. This previously unknown action of CD1d links the etiology of sunburn to skin cancer. Keywords = CD1d knockout, UV, sunburn, cancer Keywords: other
