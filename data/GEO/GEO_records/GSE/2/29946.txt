TITLE
Genome wide transcriptional analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 response to kappa-opioid U-50,488 in poor nutrient medium

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Here we examined virulence activation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa in response to the synthetic kappa opioid agonist U-50, 488 in nutrient poor media where growth conditions are limited and density dependent quorum sensing is not activated. We used a microarray to define the virulence-related genes in P. aeruginosa grown in liquid poor nutrient medium to determine the effect of kappa-opioid receptor agonist on virulence/lethal phenotype
