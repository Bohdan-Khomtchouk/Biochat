TITLE
Integrated Genomics of Ovarian Xenograft Tumor Progression and Chemotherapy Response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Xenograft ovarian tumors are useful model to test therapeutic candidates in vivo. We used microarrays to gain insight into the expression changes during tumor growth and induced by the vitamin D analog, MT19C at multiple time points.

DESIGN
SKOV-3 cells were grown in 10% FBS/DMEM before injection into mice. Total RNA was collected using standard methods.
