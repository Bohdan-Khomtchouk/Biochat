TITLE
Ralstonia solanacearum effector-specific effect on Medicago truncatula trancriptome

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
affy_ralstonia_peeters_medicago - We have identified two essential virulence determinants (GALA7, a type III secretion effector and HpaP, a chaperone-like protein) of Ralstonia solanacearum for the infection and colonisation of the host plant Medicago truncatula. The scope of this project is to identify the GALA7 and HpaP-specific transcriptome alteration. For this purpose wild type and mutant infected root material (13h and 72h postinfection) will be analysed on M. truncatula affymetrix chips. Medicago truncatula (A17 line) are grown in vitro on Farheus medium (with Nitrogen source) plantlets are inoculated with water R. solanacearum wt, gala7 and hpap mutants, and root tips are collected at 13h and 72h postinoculation. Experiment was performed 3 times independently. 4 bacteria conditions x 2 harvest times x 3 biological repeats = 24 samples Keywords: gene knock out,normal vs disease comparison,time course,treated vs untreated comparison
