TITLE
K24-1/EGFP R5 RNA Timecourse

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
The promoter upstream from eryAI (eryAp) was cloned in front of EGFP in pIJ8660.  This vector was integrated into the chromosome of K24-1, a clean host version of K41-135 (the overproducer strain obtained from Kosan Biosciences).  This strain was then grown in shake flask culture in R5 medium.  RNA was harvested up through three days. The 12 h RNA sample was used as the reference sample for all RNA hybridizations.  A genomic DNA vs. 12 h control was also done to determine initial relative transcript expression. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series. Keywords: time_series_design
