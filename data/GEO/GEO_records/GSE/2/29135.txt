TITLE
MicroRNA profiling and prediction of recurrence/relapse-free survival in stage I lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite surgical treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), one third of patients will eventually have a recurrence. Robust prognostic markers are required to better manage therapy options. MicroRNAs play important roles in human cancers. The purpose of this study is to identify miRNA expression profiles that would better predict prognosis. Small RNAs extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues of 357 stage I NSCLC patients were profiled on the human MicroRNA expression profiling V2 panel (Illumina). The expression differences between cancer subtypes were compared by t tests.  The association of miRNA expression profile with recurrence free survival (RFS) was assessed using partial Cox regression models. Two miRNA signatures that are highly predictive of RFS were identified. The first contained 32 miRNAs derived from 357 stage I NSCLC patients independent of cancer subtype; while the second containing 27 miRNAs was adenocarcinoma specific. Both of them were validated using FFPE and/or fresh frozen tissues in independent data set with 170 stage I patients. This has important prognostic or therapeutic implications for the management of patients.  The identified miRNAs hold great potential as targets for histology-specific treatment or prevention and treatment of recurrent disease.
