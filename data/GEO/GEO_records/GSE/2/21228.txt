TITLE
Identification of SNP candidates associated with chemo-responsiveness in colorectal cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Response rates of 118 colorectal cancer patients to regiments were evaluated by histoculture drug response assay. Affymetrix SNP 6.0 chips were used to determine genotypes of the same colorectal cancer patients. SNPs associated with chemosensitivity to treatment regiments were identified by genome-wide association study. AV: avastin (Bevacizumab), ER: Erbitux (Cetuximab), FXA: bevacizumab + FOLFOX, FXE: Cetuximab + FOLFOX , FRA: Bevacizumab + FOLFIRI, FRE: Cetuximab + FOLFIRI; Numbers (0-100) represent responsiveness to the given drug regimens; the larger, the better responsive to given regimens

DESIGN
SNP association with drug responsiveness
