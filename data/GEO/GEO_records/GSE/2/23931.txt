TITLE
Cloning of 50-75 nt small RNAs associated with Armitage in OSCs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Armitage (Armi) is a component of Yb bodies and  functions in the primary piRNA processing pathway. Armi interaction with Piwi does not require Yb expression; however, without Yb, the Armi-Piwi complex does not localize at Yb bodies and contains few piR-ILs (small RNAs associated with Armitage complex). These results suggest that only upon its localization at Yb bodies does the Armi-Piwi-Yb complex gain an opportunity to interact with piR-ILs. Currently, however, it remains unclear how piR-ILs are loaded onto the Piwi complex at Yb bodies and which protein(s) within the complex is directly bound to them.

DESIGN
1 sample examined: Ovarian somatic cell (OSC) line
