TITLE
Bone marrow transcriptomal differences between wild type, Fancc-deficient, Fancg-deficient, and doubly deficient (Fancc/Fancg) mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Seeking to challenge the current dogma that the nuclear core-complex proteins function in an entirely epistatic manner, Dr. Clapp's group developed a new double-knockout mouse nullizygous for Fancc and Fancg.   Because the hematopoietic phenotype was more severe than single knockout mice, we reasoned that transcriptomal differences would exist and lead to  the identification of molecular defects unique to each FA gene.

DESIGN
RNA was purified from unfractionated and uncultured bone marrow cells from three types of Fanconi anemia gene knockout mice: nullizygous for Fancc, Fancg, or both Fancc and Fancg..   Three wild type C57Bl/6 mice served as controls.  Each of three marrow samples provided one RNA sample (the RNA samples were not pooled).
