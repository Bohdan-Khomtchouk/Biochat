TITLE
Gene expression analysis of host spleen responses to Marek's disease virus infection in susceptible and resistant chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To investigate gene expression profiles in susceptible spleens (SS) and resistant spleens (RS) from MDV-infected chickens and non-infected spleens (NS) from controls. Twelve spleens were chosen from three groups (four samples per group) to be used in chicken genome microarray to examine differential gene expression. In total, there were 4317 and 2593 differentially expressed (DE) genes in SS vs. NS and in SS vs. RS, respectively. However, no DE genes were found in RS vs. NS. The expression of twenty-four genes was verified by qPCR. In this study, we found weak, but detectable host immune response still existed in the late neoplastic transformation phase of MDV infection. Toll-like receptor pathway was affected in susceptible spleens compared to non-infected and resistant spleens. IL10 seemed to be exploited by virus to facilitate tumorigenesis. The expression of many members in insulin growth factor system was altered. IGFBP4 and IGFBP7 might be associated with MD lymphoma transformation. The expression profiles in resistant spleens were similar to those in non-infected spleens, which indicated most genes returned to baseline expression levels. Although latent MDV infection persists in resistant chicken for the whole life, it wonâ€™t interfere with normal function of genes.

DESIGN
Four susceptible spleens with tumors were obtained at 46-55 d.p.i., four resistant spleens were removed from survivors at 55-56 d.p.i. from MDV infected chickens, and four non-infected spleens were from controls at 40-56 d.p.i. Twelve one-color microarrays were utilized to detect differential gene expression among three groups.
