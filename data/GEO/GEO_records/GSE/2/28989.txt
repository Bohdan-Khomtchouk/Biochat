TITLE
Identification and functional analysis of 9p24 amplified genes in human breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For the purpose of characterization of the 9p24 amplicon, we carried out high-resolution array CGH (Agilent 244K chip) analysis of four cancer cell lines, including three breast cancer cell lines, Colo824, HCC1954 and HCC70, and one esophageal cancer cell line, KYSE150.

DESIGN
For each array, female DNA (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as a reference sample and labelled with Cy-3. The samples of interest were each labelled with Cy-5.
