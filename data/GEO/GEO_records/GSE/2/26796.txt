TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of wild-type vs Perp-null mice during tooth development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Little is known about the role of cell-cell adhesion in the development of mineralized tissues. Here we report that PERP, a tetraspan membrane protein essential for epithelial integrity, is a critical regulator of enamel formation. Perp is necessary for proper cell attachment and gene expression during tooth development, and its expression is controlled by P63, a master regulator of stratified epithelial development. During enamel formation, PERP is localized to the interface between the enamel-producing ameloblasts and the stratum intermedium (SI), a layer of cells subjacent to the ameloblasts. Perp-null mice display dramatic enamel defects, which are caused, in part, by the detachment of ameloblasts from the SI. Microarray analysis comparing gene expression in teeth of wild-type and Perp-null mice identified several differentially expressed genes during enamel formation. Analysis of these genes in ameloblast-derived LS8 cells upon knock down of PERP confirmed the role for PERP in the regulation of gene expression. Together, our data show that PERP is necessary for the integrity of the ameloblast-SI interface and that the lack of Perp causes downregulation of genes that are critical for proper enamel formation.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, RNA isolated from WT vs. Perp-null lower 1st molars. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 mutant replicates.
