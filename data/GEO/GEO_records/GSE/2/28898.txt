TITLE
Comparison of IND induced vs. mock treated seedlings: Transcriptome profiling upon induction of the transcription factor IND

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs10-03_ind - comparison of ind induced vs mock treated seedlings - Identification of miRNAs regulated by IND - Transgenic seeds containing an IND transgene under the control of a dexamethasone inducible promoter were germinated and grown in liquid Murashige/Skoog medium under a 16h light/8h darkness light regime. After seven days of growth, seedlings were either mock-treated or treated with 10 micromolar dexamethasone for 24 hours.

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - induced vs non-induced comparison
