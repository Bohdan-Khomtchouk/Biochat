TITLE
Lmnadelta9 mouse gene expression study

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lmnadelta9 mice derived in the C57bl6X129S3/J background have been identified as exhibiting a progeric phenotype. Using this mouse model we show that a truncated variant of Lamin A (Lmnaâˆ†9) causes the proliferative arrest of post-natal  fibroblasts. Arrest is due to the cells inability to produce a functional extracellular matrix (ECM). We used microarrays to compare gene expression of adult primary fibroblasts from wildtype and Lmnadelta9 mice in order to understand whether the Lmnadelta9 adult MEF defective proliferation is due to alterations of specific signaling associated with ECM functions.
