TITLE
Sprouting transcriptome in cortical neurons: aged

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

Selective isolation of total RNA and then whole genome expression analysis of sprouting neurons in peri-infarct cortex of the adult rat after stroke, compared to adjacent neurons that have not sprouted a new connection, in young adult (2 months) and aged (2 years) animals.
