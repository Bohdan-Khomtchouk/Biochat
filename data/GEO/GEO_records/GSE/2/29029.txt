TITLE
Transcriptomic responses of juvenile Pacific whiteleg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, to hypoxia and hypercapnic hypoxia

ORGANISM
Litopenaeus vannamei

SUMMARY
Here we  used microarrays to characterize changes in global gene expression in the hepatopancreas of Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, exposed to short term (4 h) hypoxia (H) or hypercapnic hypoxia (HH) or long term (24 h) H or HH, compared to animals in air-saturated water (normoxia).  The transcriptomes of crustaceans exposed to low O2 and high CO2 contained both shared and treatment-specific signature genes (q ≤ 0.01, FC ≥ 1.5), with shifts characteristic of metabolic depression rather than anaerobic metabolism.  Down-regulated signature genes dominated the transcript profile in three of the four treatments (H 4 h, H 24 h, 4 h HH); many of these genes were involved in amino acid or RNA metabolism or in translation, including several tRNA synthetases.  Unique patterns of gene expression such as increased lipid metabolism and hemocyanin synthesis (H 24 h) and initiation of apoptosis (24 h HH) were tied to specific treatments.  This work contributes insight to the effects that human perturbations might have on estuarine organisms, and the importance of examining the impacts of environmentally relevant combinations of hypoxia and hypercapnia on estuarine populations.

DESIGN
L. vannamei were exposed for 4 or 24 hours to one of the following conditions: normoxia, hypoxia or hypercapnic hypoxia.  Hepatopancreas tissue from individual animals was dissected, total RNA extracted, labelled and hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays with probes for 21,864 L. vannamei unigenes.  Treatments were repeated until a total of 7 biological replicates was obtained for each time:treatment combination, except for the 24 h normoxia group, represented by 6 replicates.
