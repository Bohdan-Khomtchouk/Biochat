Interior spruce_Bark_Leptographium abietinum_inoculation

ORGANISM
Picea

SUMMARY
Using 21K spruce microarray (that contains 21.8 thousand unique transcripts) we performed analysis of the transcriptome response of interior spruce (Picea glauca x engelmannii) inoculated with the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) vectored blue stain fungal pathogen Leptographium abietinum or treated with wounding. This microarray analysis revealed large transcriptome reorganization with close to 2000 transcripts (10% of the studied transcriptome) differentially expressed within two weeks of treatment, with the wounding response affecting close to 5% of the interior spruce transcriptome.
