TITLE
Gene copy number variation in male breast cancer by aCGH

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterization of DNA imbalances in a set of 25 MBC samples analyzed by high resolution CGH arrays in order to detect DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs). These results have been then compared with a female breast cancer dataset deposited with the Gene Expression Omnibus.

DESIGN
Male patients affected by breast cancer have been consecutively selected for this retrospective study: 15 received the primary diagnosis of breast cancer at the NCC of Bari, while 10 at Regina Elena Institute of Rome, Italy. This dataset was compared to GSE12659 (female breast cancer).
