TITLE
Progressive epigenetic changes in milk protein gene loci during functional differentiation of the mammary gland: ChIP-Seq part II

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of chromatin in mammary gland development and differentiation has not been defined. Here we have studied the changes in chromatin conformation in the mammary gland during the lactation cycle at milk protein gene loci, whose gene expression marks functional differentiation of the mammary gland.

DESIGN
histone modification patterns were studied using ChIP-seq in Lactating (day 8) mammary gland tissue, Mammary epithelial cells Isolated from 12 week virgin (diestrus) mammary gland tissue, and liver from 8 day lactating female.
