TITLE
Analysis of mRNA levels of GPCR and GPCR-related signaling proteins in 3 mouse cell lines: AtT20, BV2 and N18

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Measurements of mRNA levels for non-chemosensory GPCRs, G proteins and selected G protein targets.

DESIGN
Three mouse cell lines (AtT20, BV2 and N18), 4 replicates each. Overall data set includes mRNA levels for ~24,000 genes.
