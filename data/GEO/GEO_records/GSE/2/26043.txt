TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Bacillus cereus B3711 during silver ion stress condition

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus

SUMMARY
We have employed a whole genome microarray for gene expression profilling to understand the global view of the cellular mechanism and metabolic response of B. cereus B3711 exposed to 1 mM silver nitrate. RNA was extracted from B. cereus grown under silver treated and untreated set of conditions in duplicates at two different time points (30 & 60 min). Comparing the transcript profile of the control and treated cells, several differentially expressed genes were identified. These includes genes involved in various metabolic pathways, such as arginine and alanine metabolism, membrane transport system and alternate respiratory proteins such as arsenate reductase, stress related proteins, proteins of transcriptional regulators, hypothetical proteins and protein of two-component systems.
