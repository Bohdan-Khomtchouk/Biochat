TITLE
Subcutaneous and omental white adipose tissue biopsies analysed from three obese patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective was to characterize differences in the secretome of human omental compared with subcutaneous adipose tissue using global gene expression profiling. Gene expression was measured using Affymetrix microarrays in subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue (n=3 independent subjects; 6 arrays). Predictive bioinformatic algorithms were employed to identify those differentially expressed genes that code for secreted proteins and to identify common pathways between these proteins.  All patients provided informed written consent before inclusion in the study which was approved by the North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (NOSREC).
