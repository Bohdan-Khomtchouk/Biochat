TITLE
Baculovirus-encoded protein expression for epigenomic profiling in Drosophila cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Baculovirus-encoded proteins can be efficiently produced following infection of different Drosophila cell lines. Epitope-tagged proteins produced in baculovirus-infected cells provide genome-wide profiles of the histone variant H2Av that are comparable to those produced by stably transformed cell lines. Keywords: Chromatin affinity-purification on microarray
