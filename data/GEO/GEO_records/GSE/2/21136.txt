TITLE
Genome response to tissue plasminogen activator in experimental ischemic stroke

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To further delineate tPA functions in the blood, we examined the gene expression profiles induced by tPA in a rat model of ischemic stroke. Forty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to: 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO); a permanent-MCAO; or were used as controls.  tPA was administered to half of the rats in each group at 3hours. Whole blood was drawn at 24 hours, and isolated RNA levels measured on Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 GeneChip microarrays to examine the entire RNA transcriptome.

DESIGN
42 samples, 7 groups in total ( 2 treatmented disease, 2 untreated disease, and  3 control groups), each group had 6 replicates
