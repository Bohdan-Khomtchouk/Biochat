TITLE
Homo sapiens immortalized MSCs: 3A6

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of immortalized human mesenchymal stem cells with hTERT/E6/E7 transfected MSCs. hTERT may change gene expression in MSCs. Goal was to determine the gene expressions of immortalized MSCs.

DESIGN
One-condition experment, gene expression of 3A6
