TITLE
Cardiac gene expression profiling of Salvador mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we identified a number of genes whose expression are regulated by the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. To disrupt Hippo signaling in the mouse heart, we inactivated the single mammalian Salv ortholog using a Salv conditional null allele and the Nkx2.5 cre allele that directs cardiac cre activity. Total RNA from embryonic hearts were used for expression profiling of 17,455 unique genes.

DESIGN
Genes transcriptionally regulated by the Hippo pathway during cardiogenesis were identifed through expression profiling of 17,455 unique genes in Salvador mutant (Salv CKO) embryonic hearts. Total RNA from E9.5-stage hearts were pooled into biological replicate samples (2 control and 2 Salv CKO) and were used to generate expression profiles.
