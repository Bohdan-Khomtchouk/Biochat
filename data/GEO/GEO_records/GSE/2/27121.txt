TITLE
Two different 4-week energy-restricted diets.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The main aim of this experiment was to investigate gene expression on human adipose tissue after two different 4-week energy-restricted diets. Our questions consisted in understanding how gene expression was linked to clinical parameters of obese patients and whether the two diets were discriminated this data. The subjects were randomly allocated, in a cross-over design, to two periods of 4 weeks of an energy restricted isocaloric diet of 1200 kcal as either a conventional diet (LC-CONV) or a special energy restricted diet compensated by proteins (LC-P-LGI). The two nutritional periods were separated by a wash-out interval of 8 weeks.  The samples who contain a K in their name correspond to the LC-P-LGI diet while those who contain a C correspond to LC-CONV diet.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated human adipose tissue of 12 subjects at 6 different time points (0, 5, 30, 90, 95 and 120 days).
