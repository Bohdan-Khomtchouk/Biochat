TITLE
Homo sapiens immortalized MSCs: KP vs. 3A6

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene methylation profiling of immortalized human mesenchymal stem cells comparing HPV E6/E7-transfected MSCs cells with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)- and HPV E6/E7-transfected MSCs. hTERT may increase gene methylation in MSCs. Goal was to determine the effects of different transfected genes on global gene methylation in MSCs.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, KP MSCs vs. 3A6 MSCs.
