TITLE
Whole Blood Cell Gene Expression Profiling in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease from the PREDICT Trial

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of whole blood cells isolated from patients piror to undergoing cardiac catheterization. PREDICT is a prospective, multi-center coronary catheter-lab trial being run in the US for the purpose of identifying biomarkers associated with coronary disease.  A summary of the trial can be found at (identifier # NCT00500617).

DESIGN
2 condition, paired experiment: Cases (1) are patients with  â‰¥50% stenosis in > = 1 major vessel by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA), Controls (0) have luminal stenosis of < 50% by QCA.  Samples were paired based on case/control status, age, and gender.
