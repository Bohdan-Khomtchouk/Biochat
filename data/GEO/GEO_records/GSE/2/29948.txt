TITLE
Expression data from 35S::VvCBF4-overexpressing grapevines

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Overexpression of a grapevine C-repeat binding factor (CBF) gene, VvCBF4 in cv. “Freedom” was found to improve freezing survival in non-cold-acclimated vines. To understand the mechanistic basis of VvCBF4 transgene action, a transgenic line (‘9-12’) was genotyped using microarray-based mRNA expression profiling.

DESIGN
Young grapevines (cv. 'Freedom') were grown in soil for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to compare vines transformed with the VvCBF4 transcription factor, expressed under the 35S CaMV promoter (line '9-12') vs. an empty vector transformant (line '8-6'). We harvested the whole aerial tissues of four biological replicates, each.
