Analysis of the miRNA profile associated with c-Src-mediated transformation

SUMMARY
To address the molecular mechanisms underlying c-Src-mediated tumor progression, we previously developed a model system using Csk-deficient fibroblasts that can be transformed by wild-type c-Src. In this study, we applied this system for the analysis of the potential contribution of miRNA to c-Src-mediated transformation. Pair-wise significance analysis of the microarray indicated that seven miR genes were significantly upregulated and six miRNA genes were downregulated in c-Src-transformed cells with a P value below 0.01 and with a fold change over 2.0.
