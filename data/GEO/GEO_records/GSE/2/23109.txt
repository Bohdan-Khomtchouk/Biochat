TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of RNAs associated with Lin28

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used immunoprecipitation to pulldown Lin28 associated RNA targets and used genome-wide high throughput deep sequencing to identified those Lin28-associated RNAs. Keywords: Lin28 IP-RNAseq

DESIGN
Examination of Lin28 immunoprecipitated RNA transcripts
