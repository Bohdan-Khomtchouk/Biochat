TITLE
Brain transcriptomic response of the threespine stickleback  Gasteroteus aculeatus to predator cues

ORGANISM
Gasterosteus aculeatus

SUMMARY
In this study, we used whole genome comparative oligonucleotide microarrays to investigate the brain transcriptomic response to predator cues using the threespine stickleback, Gasteroteus aculeatus. We showed that exposure to olfactory, visual and tactile cues of a predator (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) for six days resulted in subtle but significant transcriptomic changes in the brain of sticklebacks. Gene functional analysis and gene ontology (GO) enrichment revealed that the majority of the transcripts differentially expressed between the fish exposed to predator cues and the control group are primarily related to antigen processing and presentation (involving primarily the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)), transmission of synaptic signals, brain metabolic processes, gene regulation, or visual perception. Pathway analysis identified synaptic long-term depression, RAN signaling, relaxin signaling and phototransduction as the top four pathways that were over-represented.

DESIGN
Adult fish were placed in six different 26L tanks with three fish per tank in a partially recirculating flow-through system. Half of the tanks were assigned to the control group and the other half to the experimental group.10 samples were selected for microarray analysis. The ten samples comprised five biological replicates in the experimental group (fish exposed to predator cues) and five biological replicates in the control group (fish not exposed to predator cues), and were evenly distributed across tanks. The cDNA labeling (single color), hybridization, washing and scanning steps were performed in the NimbleGen microarray gene expression service department.
