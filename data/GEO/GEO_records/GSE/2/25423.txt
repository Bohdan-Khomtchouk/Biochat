TITLE
LSD1 knockdown in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obesity is often associated with a low-grade systemic inflammation state that contributes to the development of insulin resistance and atherosclerotic complications. This is usually coupled with increased macrophage infiltration in the adipose tissue and a defect in adipocyte differentiation that results in accumulation of hypertrophic fat cells characterized by a deregulated pattern of adipokine expression. Here we show that knockdown of histone demethylase lsd1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes results in defective adipogenesis and derepression of an inflammatory program in these cells.
