TITLE
Expression data from cones in degenerated retinas from C3H/HeNCrl (Pde6brd1) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used FACS isolated RD cone photoreceptors from C3H mice (we refer this mouse model as f-RD) that were transfected by AAVs to express fluorescent reporters to genomic analyses. We tested three different ages. Many cone photoreceptor markers are highly enriched, identifying the isolated RD cones as cones.

DESIGN
Two different treatments: mCAR-EGFP or mCAR-eNpHR-EYFP, where mCAR-EGFP served as a control condition and mCAR-eNpHR-EYFP was the light sensor. Mouse cone arrestin-3 promoter (mCAR) was used to drive EGFP/eNpHR-EYFP in RD photoreceptors. Cones are brightly labeled by these constructs, indicating that the intrinsic promoter is active and intrinsic cone markers are expressed.
