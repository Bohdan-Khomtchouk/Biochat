TITLE
Expression data from SSEA1+ c-kit+  differentiated murine embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SSEA1+ c-kit+cells sorted from mouse embryonic stem cells differentiated for 4 days in 10uM Retinoic acid do not form teratomas when transplated into SCID mice while Pten-/- cells do. We used microarrays to identify genes and pathways besides Pten that could explain this difference in tumorigenicity.
