TITLE
Campylobacter jejuni Utilization of Fucose

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of C. jejuni NCTC11168 while growing in MEM medium containing L-fucose.  We hypothesize that certain C. jejuni strains, containing A certain genomic island, have acquired the ability to metabolize fucose.  This study demonstrates the transcriptional profile C. jejuni growth while utilizing fucose.

DESIGN
Microarray data was collected from three independent biological replicates and 6-9 technical replicates for each biological replicate.
