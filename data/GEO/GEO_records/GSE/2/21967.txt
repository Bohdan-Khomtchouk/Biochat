TITLE
Characterization of pathogen specific expression of host immune response genes in Mycobacterium and Anaplasma spp. infection in ruminants

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Anaplasma and Mycobacterium species are known to modify gene expression in ruminants. The objectives of this study were (a) to characterize global gene expression profiles in European red deer (Cervus elaphus) in response to Anaplasma ovis and A. ovis/Mycobacterium bovis/M. avium sub. paratuberculosis (MAP) infections, (b) to compare the expression of immune response genes between A. ovis- and A. ovis/M. bovis/MAP-infected deer, and (c) to characterize the differential expression of immune response genes identified in red deer in cattle infected with M. bovis and A. marginale. The results of this study showed that global gene differential expression in A. ovis- and A. ovis/M. bovis/MAP-infected deer results in the modification of common and pathogen-specific cellular biological processes. The differential expression of host immune response genes also showed pathogen-specific signatures and the effect of infection with multiple pathogens on red deer host immune response. These results suggested that intracellular bacteria from Anaplasma and Mycobacterium genera use similar mechanisms to infect and multiply within ruminant host cells while pathogen-specific mechanisms underline differences that could contribute to disease characterization and diagnosis in ruminants.
