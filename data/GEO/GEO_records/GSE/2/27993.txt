TITLE
Expression data from human periodontal ligament

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detect the differences in gene-expression of the periontal ligament  between patients with healthy periodontal ligament and patients with periodontitis

DESIGN
RNA was extracted directly from the middle third of the human periodontal ligament
