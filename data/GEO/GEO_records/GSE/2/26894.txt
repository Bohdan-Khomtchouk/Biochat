TITLE
Effect of Lead on Genome-Wide Expression in Developing Mouse Brain during Synaptogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lead exposure causes a variety of health effects, especially in children, that may include cognitive and behavioural problems. This study explores the mechanisms associated with this relationship by assessing alterations in gene expression of C57BL/6J pups treated with 50mg/kg lead compared to controls. In addition this study also analyzed brain gene expression differences in Metallothionein I and II (Mt-I and Mt-II) knockout mice treated with lead.

DESIGN
Pups of three genotypes (C57BL/6J, Mt-KO with a C57BL/6J background and Heterozygote Mt-KO) were injected with lead acetate during synaptogenesis and weight-matched controls were injected with saline at the same time points. Whole brains were harvested and RNA extracted and pooled from 5 pups and hybridized to Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays. In total 6 arrays were used, one for each genotype and treatment.
