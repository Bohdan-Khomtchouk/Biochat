TITLE
Gene expression analysis of embryonic photoreceptor precursor cells using BAC-Crx-EGFP transgenic mouse.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated a transgenic mouse line which express EGFP in the retina driven by the Crx promoter using BAC transgenesis. We sorted EGFP-positive photoreceptor precursors at E17.5 using FACS, and subsequently performed microarray analysis of the FACS-sorted cells.

DESIGN
In order to clarify a molecular role of Crx in developing cone photoreceptor precursors, we investigated the expression profile of the BAC-Crx-EGFP-positive cells compared with that of the BAC-Crx-EGFP-negative cells at E17.5.
