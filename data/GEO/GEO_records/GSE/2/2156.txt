TITLE
Sexually dimorphic gene expression in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and cortex by SAGE

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BL6 mice (12-15 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (St. Constant, Québec). They were housed in an air-conditioned room (19-25Åé) with controlled lighting from 07:15 to 19:15 h and were given free access to laboratory chow (Lab Rodent Diet No. 5002, Ren’s Feed and Suppliers, Ontario) and water. The hypothalamus, pituitary gland and parietal cortex of 51 male and 51 randomly estrous cycling female mice were pooled and used for expression profiling. After vertebral cervical dislocation under isoflurane anesthesia, the brain and pituitary gland were removed from the skull and the three organs were immediately dissected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80Åé until further analysis.
