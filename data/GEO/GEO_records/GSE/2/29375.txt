TITLE
Time-course effect of APRIL on gene expression in HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
APRIL (TNFSF13) is a ligand of the TNF superfamily which binds to two receptors, BCMA and TACI. We have found that APRIL and its receptor BCMA are specifically enhanced in hepatocellular carcinoma, as compared to non-cancerous liver tissue. We further identified that HepG2 cells present the same ligand/receptor pattern as human hepatocellular carcinomas. We investigated the role of APRIL in HepG2 gene expression in a time course study.

DESIGN
24 hour serum starved HepG2 cells were treated with 200ng/ml of APRIL and RNA was collected at 0, 2, 6, and 12h. The collected RNA was used for hybridization on commercially available Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays
