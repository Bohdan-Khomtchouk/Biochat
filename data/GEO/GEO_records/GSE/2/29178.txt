TITLE
Profiling of small RNA populations in tricellular pollen of rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
To investigate the potential function of miRNAs during male gametogenesis in rice, 13-40 nt RNA were extrected from tricellular pollen (TCP) for high-throughput sequencing. We identified 104 unique miRNAs from TCP library, 57 of which are novel derived from 39 pre-miRNAs.

DESIGN
This subseries contain one small RNA sequencing data in tricellular pollen (TCP) stage.
