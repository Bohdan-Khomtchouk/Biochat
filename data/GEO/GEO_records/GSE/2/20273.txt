TITLE
SSHscreen analysis of cowpea drought stress SSH libraries (F

ORGANISM
Vigna unguiculata

SUMMARY
Screening cDNA clones from SSH library by hybridization with cDNA used to construct the library. Treated samples were drought-stressed cowpea plants, and control samples were cowpea plants subjected to a standard watering regime. cDNA clones from forward and reverse libraries are spotted on the same array, but data from each library were analysed separately after normalization using SSHscreen software ( ) to calculate Enrichment Ratio 3 (ER3) and Enrichment Ratio 2 (ER2) values for each clone. ER3 is a measure of differential expression, and was determined using a set of hybridizations with unsubtracted treated (UT) and unsubtracted control (UC) cDNA. ER2 is a measure of the relative abundance of a clone's transcript in the original tester sample, relative to other transcripts in the sample prior to the SSH process. ER2 for the forward library was determined using a set of hybridizations with subtracted treated (ST) and unsubtracted treated (UT) cDNA. ER2 for the reverse library is determined using a set of hybridizations with subtracted control (SC) and unsubtracted control (UC) cDNA.

DESIGN
Direct comparison of UT and UC cDNAs to calculate ER3 values for F and R library, including dye swaps and replicate arrays. Direct comparison of ST and UT cDNAs to calculate ER2 values for F library, including dye swaps and replicate arrays. Direct comparison of SC and UC cDNAs to calculate ER2 values for R library, including dye swaps and replicate arrays.
