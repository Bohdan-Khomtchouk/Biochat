TITLE
Detection of aberrant DNA methylation in undifferentiated and differentiated mouse ES cells compared to normal tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem cells can be differentiated in vitro to produce a variety of somatic cell types. We have employed the mDIP method combined with hybridization to a CpG islend microarray .  We show that this differentiation is accompanied by an intrinsic process of extensive aberrant CpG island de novo methylation that includes developmental and cancer target genes.

DESIGN
CpG-methylated genomic DNA was enriched using a methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation (mDIP) assay. DNA from the input and bound (enriched) DNA for each sample were labeled and hybridized on the array to define the methylation state of each region.
