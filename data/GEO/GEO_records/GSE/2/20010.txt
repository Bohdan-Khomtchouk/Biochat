TITLE
Alternative splicing signatures in apoptosis related genes of human HeLa cells with RNAi targeting p68 RNA helicase-DDX5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alternative splicing profiling of apopotosis related genes in human HeLa cells (cervical cancer cell line) transfected with a plasmid expressing shRNAs targetting p68 helicase (DDX5, DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 5) cloned into the pSuper expression vector compared to empty vector. Keywords: treated vs. untreated comparison; alternative splicing

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, where the p68 DDX5 gene product levels was inhibited by siRNA transfection and compared to transfection with the negative control (scrambled siRNA). Biological replicates: 2, all independently grown and harvested. A dye swapping technical duplicate was performed for each biological replicate. Samples were hybridized onto a 44290 feature array designed by ExonHit to detect splicing events in apopotosis related genes  and manufactured by Agilent using in situ synthesis of oligonucleotides by SurePrint technology.
