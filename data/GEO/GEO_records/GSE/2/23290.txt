TITLE
Microarray expression analysis in idiopathic and LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LRRK2 mutations are the most common genetic cause of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). We performed a whole-genome RNA profiling of putamen tissue from idiopathic PD (IPD), LRRK2-associated PD (G2019S mutation), neurologically healthy controls and one asymptomatic LRRK2 mutation carrier, by using the Genechip Human Exon 1.0-ST Array. The differentially expressed genes found in IPD revealed an alteration of biological pathways related to long term potentiation (LTP), GABA receptor signalling, and calcium signalling pathways, among others. These pathways are mainly related with cell signalling cascades and synaptic plasticity processes. They were also altered in the asymptomatic LRRK2 mutation carrier but not in the LRRK2-associated PD group. The expression changes seen in IPD might be attributed to an adaptive consequence of a dysfunction in the dopamine transmission. The lack of these altered molecular pathways in LRRK2-associated PD patients suggests that these cases could show a different molecular response to dopamine transmission impairment.

DESIGN
Number of samples analyzed: 14 brain tissue (putamen). Control (C) samples, no pathological changes: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5. Samples from idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD) patients: IPD1, IPD2, IPD3, IPD4, IPD5. Samples from Parkinson's disease patients carriers of G2019S LRRK2 mutation (MPD): MPD1, MPD2, MPD3. Sample from an asymptomatic carrier of G2019S LRRK2 mutation (MC). No replicates.
