TITLE
Post-epidemic eosinophilia myalgia syndrome associated with L-Tryptophan

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome (EMS) is characterized by subacute onset of myalgias and peripheral eosinophilia, followed by chronic neuropathy and skin induration. The EMS epidemic in 1989 was linked to L-tryptophan consumption originating from a single source. Following the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ban on the sale of L-tryptophan, the incidence of EMS declined rapidly. Moreover, no new cases have been published since the FDA ban was lifted in 2005. We report the clinical, histopathological and immunogenetic features of a new case of L-tryptophan-associated EMS along with evidence of activated transforming growth factor-ß and interleukin-4 signaling in the lesional skin.

DESIGN
6 samples were analyzed to include EMS patient and two replicates along with three normal controls
