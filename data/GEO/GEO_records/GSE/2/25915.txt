TITLE
Gene expression data for two xenograft models representing luminal-like and basal-like breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Choline (reference 1) and glucose (reference 2) was studied using HR MAS MR spectroscopy data and 105 and 38 gene transcripts were selected respectively from the microarray data to study differences between two xenograft models.

DESIGN
The microarray data from the luminal-like and basal-like xenograft models were compared for selected genes, using Limma Bioconducotr package
