TITLE
Expression analysis of INA6 cells after IL-6 restimulation using MAT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome expression analysis of INA6 cells on Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0 array set. Cells were restimulated with IL-6 for 1 hour after IL-6 has been withdrawn for 13 hours. Expression data were processed with MAT (Johnson et al., " Model-based analysis of tiling-arrays for ChIP-chip. " Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103:12457-62, 2006.).

DESIGN
We analyzed one Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0R set
