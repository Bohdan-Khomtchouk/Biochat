ORGANISM
Methanococcus maripaludis

SUMMARY
Methanococcus maripaludis is a methanogenic archaeon. Within its genome, there are two operons for membrane associated hydrogenases, eha and ehb. To investigate the regulation of ehb on the cell, an S40 mutant was constructed in such a way that a portion of the ehb operon was replaced by pac cassette in the wild type parental strain S2 (done by Whitman's group at the University of Georgia). The S40 and S2 strains were grown in 14N and 15N media with acetate separately. A biological replicate was made by switching the media. Mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics were done on the mixtures to investigate the differences in expression patterns between S40 and S2. Keywords: isotope labeling mass spectrometry, quantitative proteomics
