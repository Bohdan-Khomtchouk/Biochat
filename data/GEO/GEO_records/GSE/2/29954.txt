TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Escherichia coli mutants involved in inorganic polyphosphate metabolism

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Inorganic polyphosphate (Poly P) is a polymer of various phosphate residues linked by phosphoanhydride bonds as in ATP. It is found in all cells in nature with roles in the origin and survival of species, particularly in bacteria. To study the role of the inorganic polyphosphate in bacteria, we obtained knockout mutants of polyP metabolism genes in Escherichia coli K12. We performed DNA microarray experiments of single mutants in polyphosphate kinase 1 (PPK1), exopolyphosphatase (PPX) and also with the double mutant (PPK1 and PPX). The mutant strains growth normally in LB medium but have different colony morphology phenotypes. All mutants have flagellation problems and a detail description of all gain and lost phenotypes o these strains will be published soon because we performed a complete phenotypic microarray study of all three mutant strains.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, the expression of all the genes of Escherichia coli K12 was measured in three mutant strains lacking the enzymes related to the inorganic polyphosphate metabolism. We used reverse dye labelling for all co-hybridizations. Supplementary files: There are two raw data file versions -- a 'full version' including Gene Symbols, ECK numbers, Platform GPL534 IDs, and the expression values -and- an 'abbreviated version'with only the Gene Symbol name and the expression values.
