TITLE
DNA methylation prevents CTCF-mediated silencing of the oncogene BCL6 in B cell lymphomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Elevated DNA methylation in the first intronic region of the BCL6 locus in B cell lymphomas enforces transcription of the BCL6 gene Promoter tiling arrays were used to investigate the distribution of DNA methylation near the promoter region of BCL6 locus

DESIGN
Comparison of DNA methylation at promoter regions of lymphoma (Raji) and myeloma (H929) cell lines by methylated CpG island recovery assay (MIRA-chip)
