TITLE
Female human iPS cells retain an inactive X-chromosome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of human iPSC lines, ESC and fibroblasts to determine their expression patterns.  All early passage female lines profiled expressed XIST RNA which is an indicator of an inactive X chromosome.  Genes on the X-chromosome were also analyzed for overall levels of gene expression compared to human fibroblasts.

DESIGN
hiPSC lines were generated and extracted for RNA with TriZOL and hybridization on Affymetrix arrays.
