SUMMARY
It is well known that many genes are expressed in the retina where they show a clear daily pattern of expression.  Although several studies have investigated gene expression in the retina, no study – so far - has investigated the daily and the circadian pattern of gene expression using microarray. In the present study we propose to investigate the daily and circadian pattern of expression in the retina. To determine gene expression in the retina in Light:Dark cycles and in constant condition (constant dim light) in the rat. We hypothesize that (a) different genes are expressed in different retinal layers and (b) the pattern of expression of the same genes can differ among the different layers. Wistar rats (3 for each time point) will be killed in the middle of the day (ZT6) and in the middle of the night (ZT18). Eyeballs will be collected and the retina will be removed and immediately frozen and then stored at -80 oC. The same experiment will be repeated on animals that have been maintained in constant dim light for 3. Retinas (3 for each time point) will be obtained from animal killed at CT6 (middle subjective day) and CT 18 (middle subjectice night) and stored at – 80 oC. The samples will be then shipped to NINDS-NIMH array facility for analysis. Keywords: time-course
