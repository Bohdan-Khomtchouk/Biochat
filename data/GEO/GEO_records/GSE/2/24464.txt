TITLE
Expression analysis of meristematic tissue (Me) and young leaves (Le) isolated by manual dissection of clv3-9 plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
For the expression analysis of undifferentiated and differentiated tissues a meristem enriched fraction and young leaves (up to 3 mm leaf blade length) were isolated from clavata3-9 plants. Clavata3-9 mutants harbour larger shoot apical meristems than wild type plants enabling the preparation of meristematic tissue by manual dissection. Samples from both tissues were used for expression and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) analysis. Tissues for expression and H3K27me3 ChIP-chip analyses were simultaneously harvested.
