TITLE
A human transcriptome array for high-throughput clinical studies (with a comparison to RNA-seq technology) [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A new high-density oligonucleotide array of the human transcriptome (GG-H array) has been developed for high-throughput and cost-effective analyses in clinical studies.  This array allows comprehensive examination of gene expression and genome-wide identification of alternative splicing, as well as detection of coding SNPs and non-coding transcripts.  The GG-H array was validated using samples from multiple independent preparations of human liver and muscle, and compared with results obtained from mRNA sequencing analysis.  The GG-H array is highly reproducible in estimating gene and exon abundance, and is sensitive in detecting expression changes and alternative splicing.  This array has been implemented in a multi-center clinical program and has generated high quality, reproducible data.  When current cost, as well as sample and time requirements for sequencing are considered in the context of a required throughput of hundreds of samples per week for a clinical trial, the array provides a high-throughput and cost effective platform for clinical genomic studies.

DESIGN
Examination exon/gene expression of liver and muscle in quadraplicates using both the array technology and RNA-Seq
