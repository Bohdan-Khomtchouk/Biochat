TITLE
Gene expression in endometrium and extra-embryonic membrane at the gravid and non-gravid horn in uterus

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Endometrial remodeling is required for implantation in all mammalian species. To identify the factors that promote cell proliferation at the implantation site were explored in bovine endometrium and extra-embryonic membrane during the peri-implantation period. Microarray analysis showed that the expression levels of various trophoblast specific genes were higher in the extra-embryonic membrane at gravid horn than in the extra-embryonic membrane at non-gravid horn namely, CSH1, PRPs, PAGs, AIF, Muc-1, etc. Furthermore, EGFR, INHBA and INHBB expression were higher in endometrium of gravid horn.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were analyzed in the gravid and non-gravid extra-embryonic membrane and endometrium at around Day 30 of gestation
