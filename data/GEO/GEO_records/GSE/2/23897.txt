TITLE
Affymetrix data from Populus nectaries versus leaves

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
To identify the genes encoding the defense proteins and gain a deeper insight into the Ptt nectary transcriptom, poplar DNA microarrays (Affymetrix) were hybridized with RNA of extrafloral nectaries and nectary-free leaf sections Many plant species grow extrafloral nectaries and produce nectar to attract carnivore arthropods as defenders against herbivores. We studied in Populus how insect feeding feeds back on nectary development and activity. Two nectary types evolved with Populus trichocarpa (Ptr) and P. tremula x P. tremuloides (Ptt) were studied from their ecology down to the genes and molecules.
