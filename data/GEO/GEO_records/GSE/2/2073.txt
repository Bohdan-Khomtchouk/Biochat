TITLE
dmyc overexpression 7h and 14h

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Fly strains: All transgenes are P[+] in w  strains. w+;+;Act 5c > CD2 > GAL4 UAS-GFP (Neufeld et al. 1998 ); y w hs-FLP122; +; UAS-dMyc (Zaffran et al. 1998 ). y w hs-FLP122; +; +. Adult flies and larvae were raised in regular fly food consisting of cornmeal and molasses at 25°C. Larvae overexpressing either UAS-regulated dMyc;GFP or GFP alone transgenes were generated using the Flp/Gal4 method (Struhl and Basler 1993 ; Pignoni and Zipursky 1997 ; Neufeld et al. 1998 ). Larvae were staged from hatching and raised at a density of 50 per vial at 25°C. Third instar larvae (110 h after egg deposition, AED) were heat shocked at 37°C for 2 h, and larvae were collected 7 h after heat shock (~120 h AED). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as described by manufacturer followed by RNeasy (Qiagen) clear up. cRNA targets were generated using a standard amino-allyl labeling protocol, where 30 µg each of " experimental " (dMyc;GFP: hs-FLP122; Act-GAL4, UAS-GFP; UAS-dMyc) and " reference " (GFP only :ywhs-FLP122; Act-GAL4, UAS-GFP; +) total RNAs were coupled to either Cy3 or Cy5 fluorophores. Paired labeled targets were processed on microarrays using protocols described elsewhere (Fazzio et al. 2001 ). Posthybridized arrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000 scanner (Axon Instruments). Data were generated from five independent replicates (two with one dye orientation and three with the reversed dye orientation) at 7h and 14h Keywords: repeat sample
