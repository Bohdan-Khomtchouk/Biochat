TITLE
Coordinated activation of cellulose and repression of lignin biosynthesis pathways in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Cellulose from plant biomass is the largest renewable energy resource of carbon fixed from the atmosphere, which can be converted into fermentable sugars for production into ethanol. However, the cellulose present as lignocellulosic biomass is embedded in a hemicellulose and lignin matrix from which it needs to be extracted for efficient processing. Here, we show that expression of an Arabidopsis transcription factor SHINE (SHN) in rice, a model for the grasses, causes a 34% increase in cellulose and a 45% reduction in lignin content.
