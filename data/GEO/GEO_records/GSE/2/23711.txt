TITLE
Expression profiling of nhp6 mutants and wildtype yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The basic unit of genome packaging is the nucleosome, and nucleosomes have long been proposed to restrict DNA accessibility both to damage and to transcription. However, nucleosome number in cells was considered fixed, and no condition was described where nucleosome number was reduced. We show here that mammalian cells lacking High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1) contain a reduced amount of core, linker and variant histones, and a correspondingly reduced number of nucleosomes. Yeast nhp6 mutants lacking NHP6A and â€“B proteins, which are related to HMGB1, also have a reduced amount of histones and fewer nucleosomes. Nucleosome limitation in both mammalian and yeast cells increases the sensitivity of DNA to damage, increases transcription globally, and the relative expression of about 10% of genes. In yeast nhp6 cells the loss of more than one nucleosome in four does not affect the location of nucleosomes and their spacing, but nucleosomal occupancy. The decrease in nucleosomal occupancy is non-uniform, and our results can be modelled assuming that different nucleosomal sites compete for the available histones: sites with high affinity are almost always packaged into nucleosomes both in wt and nucleosome-depleted cells, whereas sites with low affinity are less frequently packaged in nucleosome-depleted cells. We suggest that by modulating the occupancy of nucleosomes histone availability may constitute a novel layer of epigenetic regulation.
