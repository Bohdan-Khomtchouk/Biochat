SUMMARY
The contribution of altered posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus so far remains elusive. We have described that expression of microRNAs (miR)-143 and -145 is dysregulated in genetic and dietary mouse models of obesity. Induced transgenic overexpression of miR-143, but not miR-145, causes insulin resistance and impaired insulin-stimulated AKT activation. We used microarrays to analyze the underlying molecular mechanisms of miR-143-mediated development of insulin resistance.
