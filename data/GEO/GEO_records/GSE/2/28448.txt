TITLE
Antagonistic regulation of EMT by TIF1γ and Smad4 in mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGFβ is known to be a potent inducer of EMT, a process involved in tumor invasion. TIF1γ has been reported to participate to TGFβ signaling. In order to understand the role of TIF1γ in TGFβ signaling and its requirement for EMT, we analyzed the TGFβ1 response of human mammary epithelial cell lines. A strong EMT increase was observed in TIF1γ-silenced cells after TGFβ1 treatment, whereas Smad4 inactivation completely blocked this process. In support of these observations, microarray data show that the functions of several TIF1γ target genes can be linked to EMT. As a negative regulator of Smad4, TIF1γ could be critical for the regulation of TGFβ signaling. This work highlights the molecular relationship between TIF1γ and Smad4 in TGFβ1 signaling and EMT.
