TITLE
Nocturnal expression data of Synechococcus in WT and kaiABC-null strains

ORGANISM
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

SUMMARY
In the unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, most of genes are downregulated in the dark, while 10% of genes are upregulated. Here, we employed high-density oligonucleotide arrays to explore comprehensive profiles of genome-wide Synechococcus gene expression in wild type and kaiABC-null strains under continuous dark (DD) conditions. We found that expression profile of a subset of genes on the genome in DD was dramatically affected by kaiABC-nullification, and the magnitude of dark-induction was dependent on time when cells were transferred from light to DD Keywords: timecourse data (0-12 h) under continuous darkness after dark:light cycles from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 wild type and kaiABC-null strains
