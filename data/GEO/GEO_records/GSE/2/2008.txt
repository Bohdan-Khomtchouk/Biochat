TITLE
Expression profiling of liver tissue from C57BL6 x DBA strain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of liver tissue from 111 F2 female mice resulting from a cross between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J inbred mouse strains. Mice were feed a chow diet for 12 months followed by 4 months on an atherogenic high-fat, high-cholesterol diet. Parental and F2 mice were killed at 16 months of age.  The livers were removed immediately and flash frozen for expression profiling. See Schadt, et al., Nature , Vol 422(6929):297-302 for details.
