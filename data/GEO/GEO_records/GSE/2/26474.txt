TITLE
Expression analysis of Mycobacterium smegmatis delta-MSMEG_0166 mutant

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155 delta-MSMEG_0166 mutant, compared to the wild-type strain. MSMEG_0166 is a transcriptional regulator in the gntR family. Mutations in MSMEG_0166 result in hypersensitivity to the bactericidal ubiquitin peptide Ub2, as well as oxidative stress caused by either organic or inorganic agents
