TITLE
Protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2) on HEK293 activated by trypsin or 2f-LIGRLO-NH2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic kidney cell (HEK293) were treated with PAR2 peptide agonist 2f-LIGRLO-NH2 (1.5h, 3h, 6h and 12h) or trypsin (6h). Comparison of genes similarly regulated by both treatments allowed better characterization of PAR2 induced response as both agonists had been reported as non-specific for PAR2.

DESIGN
Six conditioned experiments with 3 replicates each. Individual grown and harvested.
