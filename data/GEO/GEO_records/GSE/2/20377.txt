TITLE
Activation or maintenance of a leukemia stem cell self-renewal pathway in downstream myeloid cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Activation or maintenance of a leukemia stem cell self-renewal pathway in downstream myeloid cells is an important component of AML development We generated either MLL-AF9 mediated murine leukemias that originate from committed progenitor (GMP) cells or Hoxa9/Meis1a mediated murine leukemias that originate from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). The leukemia stem cell fraction in these two type of leukemias shared a common self-renewal pathway with normal hematopoietic stem cells. Keywords: Cell type comparison

DESIGN
Total RNA from HSC (KLS), CMP, and GMP, and from leukemia stem cells (LGMP)  was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix expresison microarrays.
