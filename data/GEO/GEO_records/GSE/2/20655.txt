TITLE
Effect of loss of Gfi1b on hematopietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using Gfi1b conditional mice, deletion of gfi1b in the hematopietic system was induced by injecting MxCre tg Gfi1bfl/fl mice with pIpC. 30 days after injection, Cd150 pos, Cd 48 neg, Lin neg Sca and c-kit pos stem cells were sortrted from Gfi1bfl/fl and Mxcre tg Gfi1bfl/fl mice and analysed. We used the mouse Affymetrix Gene ST Array.

DESIGN
The study should determine whether loss of Gfi1 alters the gene expression pattern in the hematopietic stem cells.
