TITLE
Expression data of human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) treated with BMP-4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Smad1/5 are transcription factors that engage in BMP-induced transcription. We determined and analyzed Smad1/5 binding sites by ChIP-sequencing. We used expression microarrays to compare the Smad1/5 binding sites identified by ChIP-seq to BMP-induced gene expressions.

DESIGN
PASMCs were treated with 50 ng/ml BMP-4 for 0, 2, or 24 hrs. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
