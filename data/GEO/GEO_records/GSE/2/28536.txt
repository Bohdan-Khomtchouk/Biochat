TITLE
Expression data from the Finnish Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (NLPHL) family and ten controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression was studied from the blood derived RNAs of the Finnish family members as well as from 10 controls using GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus2 (Affymetrix). Eight out of 10 family members in the expression analysis are heterozygous for the NPAT c.2437-2438delAG, three of which are NLPHL cases.
