TITLE
Expression data from MRTFA-B double knockout brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global pattern of gene expression in the cortical regional of MRTF-A/-B double knockout mice at Postnatal day 0 (P0).

DESIGN
RNA samples were collected from the cortical regions of control and MRTF-A/-B double knockout mice at P0.  Three control MRTFA-/-;MRTF-BFlox/Flox and three MRTF-A-/-;MRTF-BF/F;GFAP-Cre RNA samples were collected and pooled for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
