TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of six cadmium-transformed UROtsa cell isolates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The immortalized human urothelial cell line, UROtsa, was transformed in six parallel cultures with continual passaging in1 ÂµM Cd+2 until the cells were able to attain the ability to form colonies in soft agar and subcutaneous tumors in nude mice.  The gene expression profiles between cadmium-transformed and control samples were compared and the differentially expressed genes were identified.

DESIGN
Six independent Cadmium-transformed UROtsa cell cultures, three control UROtsa cell cultures
