TITLE
Mammary gland development: cross-species analysis of the mammary gland transcriptome in pregnant or lactating wild type female Sprague Dawley rats.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cross-species hybridization analysis of mammary glands during pregnancy and lactation. Results provide insight into putative conserved molecular mechanisms regulating mammary gland development. This study was performed to identify orthologous transcripts that are differentially co-expressed in the mammary gland at 2 stages of development (pregnancy and lactation) in wild type Sprague-Dawley rats.
