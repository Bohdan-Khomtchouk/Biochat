TITLE
Gene and exon expression change in cardiac hypertrophy with pressure overload

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pathological cardiac hypertrophy was induced by pressure overload on the heart. We performed genome-wide exon array experiments with left ventricles of mice with 1 week and 4 week of transverse aortic constriction (TAC). The exon level analysis revealed widespread regulation of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation during hypertrophy.

DESIGN
Exon and gene expression changes were examined in 1 week and 4 week TAC-operated hearts compared to sham-operated hearts. We used C57/BL6 wildtype mice, and their left ventricles were subject to surgery (each n=2).
