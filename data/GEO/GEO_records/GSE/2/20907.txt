TITLE
Intrinsic response of thoracic propriospinal neurons to axotomy

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of expression changes in prelabeled laser-microdissected thoracic propriospinal neurons at different times after low-thoracic spinal cord transection in adult rats.

DESIGN
Propriospinal neurons projecting to the lumbar enlargement were captured at various time points following no lesion or low thoracic spinal cord transection.
