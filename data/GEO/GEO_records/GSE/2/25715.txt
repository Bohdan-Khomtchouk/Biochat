TITLE
miRNA profiling during adipogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
human Multipotent Adipose-Derived Stem (hMADS) cells were subjected to adipogenic differentiation in vitro and microRNA expression was analyzed during differentiation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted at day 0 (AD0), day 3 (AD3) and day 8 (AD8) of differentiation, two biological replicates (1) and (2),  and microRNA profiles were established with SOLiD sequencing.
