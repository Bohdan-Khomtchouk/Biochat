TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed genes in equine endometrium at day 16 of early pregnancy

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
In order to systematically analyze the maternal, i.e. the endometrial, changes in the equine endometrium underlying the complex embryo-maternal dialogue during early pregnancy, a transcriptome study of endometrium samples from mares at day 16 of pregnancy and  day 12 cyclic mares was performed. Results were compared to a previous study of samples from day 12 of pregnancy and day 12 cyclic controls.
