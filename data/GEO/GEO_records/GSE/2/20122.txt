TITLE
Vitamin D and microRNA Expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Vitamin D has been observed to affect the expression of a number of genes, however its mechanism of action has not been completely elucidated. MicroRNA molecules have recently been shown to be key mediators of gene regulation. We hypothesised therefore that vitamin D might modulate gene expression by influencing the expression of microRNAs.  Methodology/Principal findings: A microRNA array was used to investigate the expression of microRNAs in RNA extracted from cells exposed to calcitriol for 0, 8 or 36 hours.  A diverse panel of human cell lines were analysed including Hep-G2, HL60, K562, two fibroblast cell lines (AG09309 and AG09319), and four lymphoblastoid cell lines (GM15084, GM12878, GM07348 and GM07019).  When compared between 0, 8 and 36 hours of calcitriol treatment, there were several microRNAs that were differentially regulated but the significance of these was lost after correction for multiple hypothesis testing.  Conclusions/Significance: No microRNA showed significantly altered expression after exposure to vitamin D.  However, some nominally significant miRNA molecules may warrant further investigation for a potential vitamin D-related role in immune function.
