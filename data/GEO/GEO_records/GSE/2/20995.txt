TITLE
Genome wide FOXP3 binding sites in human cord blood derived CD4+CD25+ natural T regulatory cells (nTreg)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FOXP3 is essential for the stability and function of nTReg. We have characterised the FOXP3-dependent cis-regulatory network through a combination of whole genome ChIP-on-chip and transcriptional profiling of primary human nTreg cells . Human nTreg cells were isolated from cord blood and expanded ex vivo (day9). These analyses identified approximately 8,000 high quality FOXP3 binding sites the majority (85%) of which were located in proximity to annotated genes . Intersection of DNA binding data with gene expression profiles predicted 739 candidate target genes. The supplementary bed file contains all 8305 high quality binding FOXP3 binding regions reported in the paper.

DESIGN
Day9 expanded cord blood nTreg cells ChIPed with polyclonal rabbit anti-Foxp3 IgG (Novus Biochem) vs. Input chromatin
