TITLE
A conserved RRM domain of B. napus FCA improves cotton fiber quality and yield by regulating cell size

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Cotton fiber is actually unicellular trichome, therefor its length is really hard to be modified but very meaningful to fiber quality and yield. We have reported the function of the second RRM domain of Oryza sativa FCA in rice cell size regulation. Data shows it is highly conserved across dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants. Here we provide evidence showing that the second RRM domain of Brassica napus FCA worked in Gossypium hirsutum, leading to the enlargement of multiple types of cells, such as pollen, cotyledon petiole and cotton fiber. In the transgenic cotton, the length of unicellular cotton fiber increased by about 10% and fiber yield per plant also showed a dramatic increase, ranging from 35% to 66%, over the control. Thus, this RRM domain may be an ancient and common cell size regulator and has great economic value on cotton industry.
