TITLE
Expression Proflies of Human Normal tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed expression profiling of 36 types of normal human tissues and identified 2,503 tissue-specific genes. We then systematically studied the expression of these genes in cancers by re-analyzing a large collection of published DNA microarray datasets. Our study shows that integration of each gene's breadth of expression (BOE) in normal tissues is important for biological interpretation of the expression profiles of cancers in terms of tumor differentiation, cell lineage and metastasis. Twenty five total RNA specimens were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), Ambion (Austin, TX) and Strategene (La Jolla, CA). We tried to cover as many tissue types as possible by using pooled RNA samples. In order to define breadth-of-expression (BOE) accurately at a reasonable cost, we tried to cover as many tissue types as possible by using pooled RNA samples. Each specimen represents a human organ. We used RNA samples pooled from 2 to 84 donors to avoid differences at the individual level.
