TITLE
Identification of mRNAs modulated by overexpression of N-terminal G3BP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcripts upregulated or downregulated by overexpression of N-terminal G3BP were identified through expression profiling of a total of 12,135 genes in comparison with S2-013 clones in which N-terminal G3BP is overexpressed and control clones.

DESIGN
We endeavored to identify factors and pathways regulated by CD24 and to obtain leads regarding the mechanism underpinning the observed phenotypic changes by performing cDNA microarray analysis on two S2-013 CD24 RNAi clones and two control clones. Total RNAs from two clones of S2-013 CD24 RNAi or control cells were mixed and used for cDNA microarray analysis.
