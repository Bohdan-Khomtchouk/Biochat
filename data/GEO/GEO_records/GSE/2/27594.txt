TITLE
Influence of inflammation on the expression and activity of glycosyltransferases in human bronchial mucosa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bronchial inflammation is common in patients suffering from Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and is commonly responsible for mortality from CF. It is known that this inflammation has an influence over glycosylation events in bronchial mucins and abnormal glycosylation has been described in CF. These abnormalities can not be directly linked to CF, as the cells that secrete bronchial mucins do not express CFTR.
