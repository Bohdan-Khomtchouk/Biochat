TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of normal erythroid progenitors and erythroleukemia cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptomes of ES cell derived erythroid progentor cells (ES-EP) and murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells stably transfected with Gata-1 fused to ER.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from duplicate proliferating cultures of MEL and ES-EP using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST.
