TITLE
Measuring the effects of hypoxia on transcription in Caulobacter crescentus

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
To test the effects of hypoxia on transcription in Caulobacter crescentus, we cultured cells in a New Brunswick bioreactor under controlled conditions.  Prior to innoculation, the medium was bubbled with laboratory air at maximum flow and stirred at 300 rpm for 2 hours.  After this period, the medium was considered saturated with air and the oxygen probe was set to 100%.  Untreated cultures were grown in air-saturated complex medium at 30 degrees C to OD660=0.5 at pH=7 (continuous air-bubbling; 300 rpm stirring).  At cell harvest in aerated culture, the dissolved oxygen probe remained above 98%.  To subject cells to hypoxia, culture at OD660=0.5, pH=7 was sparged continuously with nitrogen gas; the dissolved oxygen level as measured by the gas probe dropped from 100% to 0% over the course of 5 minutes under this condition.  Hypoxic cultures were continually stirred and bubbled with nitrogen for another 20 minutes after the dissolved gas probe read 0%.  Hypoxic cells were then harvested for RNA isolation.

DESIGN
Four independent biological samples are included in this study.  Two batches of cells were subjected to 20 minutes of hypoxia in a bioreactor; two cell batches were highly aerated.
