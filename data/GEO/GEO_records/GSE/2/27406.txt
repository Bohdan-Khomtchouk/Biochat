TITLE
Comparison between GT and SigE overexpressed strains of cyanobacteria

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
SigE is a global regulator for sugar catabolism in a unicelluar cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. We constructed SigE-overexpressing strain, named GOX50, by introducing the sigE genes fusing psbAII promoter by homologous recombination. The transcript profiles of parental wild-type strain GT and GOX50 were compared by microarray CyanoChip (Takrara bio.). Experiments were performed by three times with biologically independent RNA. The results showed that genes for the oxidaditive pentose phosphate pathway and glycogen catabolism were induced by SigE overexpression.
