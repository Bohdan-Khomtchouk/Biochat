TITLE
Human Nephrosclerosis Triggers a Hypoxia-Related Glomerulopathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from microdissected glomeruli to examine the role of hypoxia in glomerulosclerosis of human Nephrosclerosis (NSC).

DESIGN
Human Kidney biopsies of patients with NSC (n=14) and TN (n=4) were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Gene expression data was then analysed using Genepattern and Genomatix software suites which revealed that CXCR4/CXCL12 plays a role in human NSC and therefore indicate that hypoxia contributes to glomerular damage in NSC.
