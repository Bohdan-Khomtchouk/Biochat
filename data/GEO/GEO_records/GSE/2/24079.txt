TITLE
Differential gene expression in circulating leukocytes from breast cancer patients treated with Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cell mRNA samples collected from 53 female breast cancer patients at 6- or 12-month follow-ups in a randomized controlled trial of Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management or an active control condition.  The primary research question is whether gene expression differs in patients treated with Cogntive Behavioral Stress Management vs control conditions.
