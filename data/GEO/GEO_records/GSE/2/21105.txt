TITLE
Expression profiling of p53 wildtype inducible DLD-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is an initial experiment which was performed in order to identify novel transcriptional targets of the tumor suppressor p53

DESIGN
One Microarray was run per RNA, respectively. We included control DLD-1 cells and cells which were induced for p53 expression for 9h.
