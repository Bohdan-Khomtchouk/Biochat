TITLE
Transcription factors expressed in olfactory bulb local progenitor cells revealed by genome-wide transcriptome profiling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used transcriptional profiling to monitor gene expression of whole olfactory bulbs at daily intervals from embryonic day 11 through birth, generating a compendium of gene expression encompassing the major developmental events of this tissue.
