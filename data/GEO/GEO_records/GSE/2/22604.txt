TITLE
Clinical Impact of Circulating miR-92a Levels in Non-Hodgkinâ€™s Lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the differentially expressed miRs in the plasmas of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients, we screened NHL samples using microarrays.

DESIGN
Experiments were performed with three pooled total RNA isolated from the plasmas of four patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), four patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), and eight control samples.
