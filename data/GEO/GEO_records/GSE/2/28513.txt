SUMMARY
In Drosophila, two chromosome-wide compensatory systems have been characterized; the dosage compensation system acting on the male X-chromosome and the chromosome specific regulation of genes located on the heterochromatic 4th chromosome. Dosage compensation in Drosophila is accomplished by hypertranscription of the single male X-chromosome mediated by the MSL-complex. The mechanism for this compensation is suggested to be an MSL-complex mediated enhanced transcriptional elongation while the mechanism for the compensation mediated by Painting of fourth (POF) on the 4th chromosome has remained elusive. Here we show that POF binds to nascent RNA and this binding is associated with an increase in amount of chromosome 4 transcripts. Furthermore, genes located on the 4th chromosome are enriched in binding of the nucleoplasmic nucleporin component NUP98 and this enrichment correlates to increased POF binding. We also show that genes located in heterochromatic regions have a shorter transition time from site of transcription and to the nuclear envelope. Our current work broadens the understanding about how genes in heterochromatic regions can overcome the repressive influence of their hostile environment.
