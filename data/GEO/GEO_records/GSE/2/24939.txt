TITLE
Differential Gene Expression Profiles in Broiler Chickens with Gangrenous Dermatitis (GD)

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
This study utilized comparative global gene expression microarray analysis of GD-affected and clinically healthy chickens from a recent GD outbreak to glean insights into the molecular and cellular changes associated with this disease process.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, GD-affected vs. Healthy chickens. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 GD-infected replicates with dye-switching.
