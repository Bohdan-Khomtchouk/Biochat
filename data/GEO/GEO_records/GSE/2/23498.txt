TITLE
A novel copper-responsive regulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
In this study, we report the identification of a five-locus copper-inducible regulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The identification of a copper responsive regulon unique to pathogenic Mycobacteria suggests copper homeostasis must be maintained during an infection.
