ORGANISM
Picea

SUMMARY
We performed a transcriptome analysis of interior spruce (Picea glauca x engelmannii) bark response to weevil (Pissodes strobi) feeding using 21.8K spruce microarray (that contains 21.8 thousand unique transcripts). This microarray study revealed a large rearrangement of the interior spruce bark transcriptome in response to weevil feeding involving differential expression of close to 20% of the studied transcriptome.
