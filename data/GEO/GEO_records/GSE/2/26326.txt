TITLE
Gene expression signatures differ with extent of atherosclerosis in monkey iliac artery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Goal of the experiment:  To examine differential gene expression in the iliac arteries of cynomolgous monkeys in the presence of small, medium, or large atherosclerotic plaque. Brief description of the experiment: Objective:  To examine global gene expression patterns in the iliac arteries of monkeys containing small, medium, or large atherosclerotic plaque. Design:  The left iliac artery of 12 ovariectomized cynomolgous monkeys on a high fat diet for 8 years was biopsied.  Gene expression was analyzed by DNA microarray and real time RT-PCR. Results:  Significant up- or down-regulation of 986 genes was observed in monkey iliac arteries in the presence of atherosclerotic plaque.  Changes in gene expression with atherosclerosis ranged from 0.1-151.9-fold.  Differentially expressed genes included many cytokines, chemokines, components of signal transduction pathways, and transcriptional activators and repressors, among others.  Real time RT-PCR confirmed down-regulation of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), claudin 11, BH protocadherin 7 (PCDH7), and the up-regulation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), SET domain, bifurcated 2 (SETDB2), phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2IIA), phospholipase A2 group VII (PLA2VII), and ring finger protein 149 (RNF149). Conclusions:  The gene expression environment in arteries containing atherosclerotic plaque is profoundly different from that of arteries without atherosclerosis.  The data suggest that the changes in gene expression contribute to the disease process in diseased arteries.
