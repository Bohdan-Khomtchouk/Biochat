TITLE
To analyze expression in the conjunctival epithelium of patients with severe dry eye disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In 2005, we determined the glyco-gene expression profile of three normal subjects ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE27593). This led to information on the biosynthesis of mucin O-glycans and glycoproteins that may be involved in the protection of the ocular surface. The interaction of the most highly expressed glycoprotein identified by the glyco-gene chip, galectin-3, with other ligands at the ocular surface (i.e., mucin O-glycans), is now under intense study in our laboratory, and has lead to a collaboration with another group in the glycobiology field.

DESIGN
Patients with dry eye disease have an alteration of mucin O-glycans at the ocular surface, but the molecular mechanism(s) leading to this alteration remain unknown. In this experiment we (i) pooled three pathological samples per chip to reduce variability, and (ii) used three additional chips to include pooled control samples (normal subjects). Currently, we have RNA from 9 patients with dry eye disease, which have been divided it in 3 groups (D1, D2, and D3)—each group containing RNA pooled from 3 patients. We request three additional chips to include control samples (normal subjects). At this moment, we have RNA from 9 normal subjects, which have been divided it in 3 groups (N1, N2, and N3)—each group containing RNA pooled from 3 normal subjects. RNA was extracted in Trizol, purified using RNeasy column, and dissolved in water were sent to Microarray Core (E).  The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.  Data Analysis was done by Microarray Core (E).
