TITLE
Effect of AICAr and SAICAr accumulation on global transcription in the ade3 mutant

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of AICAr and SAICAr accumulation on the global transcriptome of yeast, comparing the ade3 mutant to the WT strain.

DESIGN
The ade3 mutant strain (Y4143) was compared to the WT strain (Y2946). For each comparison, we made 2 technical replicates, swapping dyes.
