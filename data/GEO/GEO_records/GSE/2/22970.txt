TITLE
Systemic transcriptome alternation under mtDNA depletion in 143B TK- osteosarcoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mitochondrial protein repertoire varies depending on cellular states, tissue type, species, and disease state. However, little is known about how this repertoire changes under different cellular or disease states. To gain a better understanding of dynamic mitochondrial proteomic changes, we compared alterations of mitochondrial proteome with transcriptome under mitochondrial DNA depletion.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 143B TK- osteosarcoma ρ+ cells or 143B TK- osteosarcoma ρ° cells
