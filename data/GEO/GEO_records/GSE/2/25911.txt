TITLE
Expression changes after loss of Dot1l in murine MLL-AF9 leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MLL-fusions may induce leukemogenic gene expression programs by recruiting the histone H3K79 methyltransferase to MLL-target promoters. We evaluated gene expression changes after cre-mediated loss of Dot1l in leukemia cells obtained from mice injected with MLL-9 transformed lineage negative bone marrow cells.

DESIGN
MLL-AF9 murine leukemia cells carrying two conditional Dot1l alleles were retrovirally transduced with Cre or empty control vector, and gene expression changes were monitored on day 3, 5, and 7 after transduction.
