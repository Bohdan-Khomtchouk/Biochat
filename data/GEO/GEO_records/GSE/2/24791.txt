TITLE
Expression profile of human natural killer cells co-cultured with P. falciparum infected erythrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify an expression signature that might characterize the impact of Plasmodium parasites on NK cells, we have used Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays to examin the global gene expression profile of primary NK cells that have been co-incubated with P. falciparum infected red blood cells and have compared it to the expression pattern of NK genes induced by cytokine treatment.

DESIGN
PBMCs were isolated from 3 healthy donors and were incubated with iRBCs, uRBCs, IL12 plus IL18 and without any stimulus. After 24 hours at 37ÂºC and 5%CO2, Natural killer cells were isolated by negative selection, checked for purity by flow cytometry and processed for RNA extraction and analysis with the Human Gene 1.0 Affymetrix array. The experiment was repeated 3 times (1-2 weeks apart) for each one of the 3 donors.
