TITLE
Ebf1 or Pax5 Haploinsufficiency Synergizes with STAT5 Activation to Initiate Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
STAT5 is critical for differentiation, proliferation and survival of progenitor B cells suggesting a possible role in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Herein, we show increased expression of activated STAT5 in ALL patients, which correlates with treatment outcome.  Mutations in Ebf1 and Pax5, genes critical for B cell development have also been identified in human ALL.  To determine whether mutations in Ebf1 or Pax5 synergize with STAT5 activation to induce ALL we crossed mice expressing a constitutively active form of STAT5 (Stat5b-CA) with mice heterozygous for Ebf1 or Pax5. Haploinsufficiency of either Pax5 or Ebf1 synergized with Stat5b-CA to rapidly induce ALL in 100% of the mice. The leukemic cells displayed reduced expression of both Pax5 and Ebf1 but this had little affect on most EBF1 or PAX5 target genes.  However, a subset of these genes was deregulated and included a large percentage of potential tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes.  Further, most of these genes appear to be jointly regulated by both EBF1 and PAX5.  Our findings suggest a model whereby small perturbations in a self-reinforcing network of transcription factors critical for B cell development, specifically PAX5 and EBF1, cooperate with STAT5 activation to initiate ALL.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed on cells isolated from lymph nodes of Stat5b-CA x Ebf1+/- and Stat5b-CA x Rag2-/- leukemic mice and pre B cells sorted from bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice and Stat5b-CA transgenic mice. 17 Samples.
