TITLE
MicroRNA expression data in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an untreatable fibrotic lung disease characterized by fibroblast proliferation and epithelial mesenchymal transition. Using miRNA expression microarrays we identified 96 differentially expressed miRNA in IPF lungs which included let-7d, miR-30 family, miR-29 family and miR-154 family.
