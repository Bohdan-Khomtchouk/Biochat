TITLE
The neural crest-enriched microRNA miR-452 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal signaling in the first pharyngeal arch

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
S23 experiment: We sought to identify the microRNAs (miRNAs) enriched in the neural crest cell (NCC) population from E11.5 mouse embryos.  To accomplish this, we utilized a transgenic mouse line harboring Cre-recombinase under the control of the Wnt1 NCC-specific promoter and also carrying the R26R-YFP allele.  We sorted YFP+ (NCCs) and YFP- (non-NCCs) from E11.5 Wnt1Cre-R26R mouse embryos via FACS and compared the relative enrichment of miRNAs in the YFP+ population by miRNA microarray. 220 experiment: We sought to identify the microRNAs (miRNAs) enriched in the neural crest cell (NCC) population from E10.5 mouse embryos.  To accomplish this, we utilized a transgenic mouse line harboring Cre-recombinase under the control of the Wnt1 NCC-specific promoter and also carrying the R26R-YFP allele.  We sorted YFP+ (NCCs) and YFP- (non-NCCs) from E10.5 Wnt1Cre-R26R mouse embryos via FACS and compared the relative enrichment of miRNAs in the YFP+ population by miRNA microarray. 221 experiment: Our research has shown that heterozygous deletion of the miRNA processing enzyme Dicer leads to developmental delay of the thymus in mouse embryos.  We sought to identify the microRNAs (miRNAs) affected by the loss of a single copy of Dicer in the neural crest cell (NCC) population from E10.5 mouse embryos.  To accomplish this, we utilized a transgenic mouse line harboring a floxed allele of Dicer, Cre-recombinase under the control of the Wnt1 NCC-specific promoter, and also carrying the R26R-YFP allele.  We sorted YFP+ (NCCs) cells from E10.5 Dicerfl/+,Wnt1Cre,R26R and Dicer+/+,Wnt1Cre,R26R mouse embryos via FACS and compared the relative expression of miRNAs in the Dicer-heterozygotes compared to Dicer-wildtypes by miRNA microarray.
