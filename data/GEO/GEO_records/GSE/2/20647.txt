TITLE
Expression analysis of AOM-induced tumors and serrated tumors in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Abstract: Colonic cancers with a serrated morphology have been proposed to comprise a molecularly distinct tumor entity following an alternative pathway of genetic alterations independently of APC mutations. Here we demonstrate that intestinal cell specific expression of oncogenic K-rasG12D in mice induces serrated hyperplasia, which is characterized by p16ink4a overexpression and induction of senescence. Deletion of Ink4a/Arf in K-rasG12D expressing mice prevents senescence and leads to invasive, metastasizing carcinomas with morphological and molecular alterations comparable to human KRAS mutated serrated tumors. Thus, we suggest that oncogenic K-ras is sufficient to initiate an alternative, serrated pathway to colorectal cancer and hence propose RAS-RAF-MEK signaling apart from APC as an additional gatekeeper in colorectal tumor development.

DESIGN
2 to 3 tissue samples for each genotype were analyzed
