TITLE
Responses to ethanol in haploid and diploid strain

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Diploid and haploid strains often exhibit different tolerance to variety of stresses. Transcriptome  of acclimation to ethanol stress in diploid and haploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was analyzed. We analyzed transcriptome profiles of diploid and haploid strains in the presence of ethanol.
