SUMMARY
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been directly or indirectly implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).  We used exon-sentive microarrays to characterize the responses to different mitochondrial perturbations in cellular models. We examined human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with paraquat, a neurotoxic herbicide which both catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induces mitochondrial damage in animal models, and SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing the mutant SOD1(G93A) protein, one of the genetic causes of ALS. We identified a common set of genes that have a deregulated transcription and alternative splicing in both models. Noticeably, pathway analysis revealed that the expression of a subset of genes involved in neuritogenesis and axon guidance is perturbed, suggesting that alterations of axonal function may descend directly from mitochondrial damage and be responsible for neurodegenerative conditions.
