TITLE
Transcriptome of SATB1 transduced Hut78 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hut78 cell line was used as Sezary syndrome cell model. Comparative transcriptome profiles of SATB1 transduced Hut78 cells (Hut78-SATB1) relative to empty MIG vector transduced control Hut78 cells (Hut78-MIG) were analyzed. The primary goal is to establish a list of genes with differential expression between SATB1 transduced Hut78 cells and control Hut78 cells to identify the gene expression regulation effect of SATB1 expression in Sezary cells.

DESIGN
Two color experiment, 3 biological replicates (3 unique cell clones) with Hut78 cells, each compared with a distinct individual clone from cells transduced with empty MIG vector.
