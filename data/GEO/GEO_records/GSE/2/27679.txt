TITLE
modENCODE_Lieb and White Lab: unltra-deep sequencing data of genomic DNA, chromatin input, and ChIP of Su(Hw)  and H3K36me3 from S2 cells on Illumina Genome Analyzer.

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the modENCODE Project. It contains both the pair-end and single-end sequencing data of genomic DNA, chromatin input and the ChIP of the factors Su(Hw) and H3K36me3 from Drosophila S2 cells and it was generated on Illumina Genome Analyzer. The goal was to sequence ~120M tags of each sample and used this ultra-deep dataset to systematically evaluate both experimental and computational factors that influence the results of ChIP-seq experiments.
