TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between CD133+ and CD133- SW620 human colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD133 has been widely used for identification and isolation of cancer stem cells in tumors although its role as a marker for cancer stem cell is still controversial . We isolated the CD133+ and CD133- cells from SW620 human colon cancer cell line and compared their biological characteristics, such as tumorigenicity,drug sensitivity, etc. Our study revealed that CD133+ SW620 cells were more tumorigenic and resistant to anti-cancer drugs. Correspondingly, they displayed different gene expression profile. However, it was observed that CD133- cells and CD133+ cells could mutually convert, indicating that CD133 expression was under dynamic and reversible regulations which might impose significant infulence on cells behaviors. Thus, our data challenge the role of CD133 as a marker for cancer stem cell.

DESIGN
There are two populations with distinct expression of CD133 in SW620 human colon cancer cell line. Microarray assays were employed to investigate the differentially expressed genes between the two populations, which may possess different tumorigenetic potential and sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. CD133+ and CD133- cells were isolated from  human colon cancer SW620 cell line  by magnetic cell sorting system. The clones from sorted CD133+ or CD133- populations were established. Clone cells were expanded and were further purified by using CD133 cell isolation kit before microarray assays.
