TITLE
Merging candidate gene approach with high throughput systems biology technology for the development of xylose utilising S. cerevisiae strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Though highly efficient at fermenting hexose sugars, the ethanologenic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has limited ability to ferment five-carbon sugars. As a significant portion of sugars found in cellulosic biomasses is the five carbon sugar xylose, S. cerevisiae must be engineered to metabolize pentose sugars. Here we combined classical candidate gene approach with systems biology to develop xylose-utilising S. cerevisiae strains. The introduction of an exogenous xylose isomerase (XYLA) and an additional copy of the endogenous xylulokinase gene (XKS1) results in the significant improvement of xylose consumption. Microarray studies reveal that the introduction of XYLA and XKS1 results in the dramatic transcriptional remodelling of the cell under both glucose and xylose conditions. To further investigate the cellular processes impacted by the introduction of XYLA and XKS1, using genome-wide chemical and synthetic lethal screens we identified greater than 40 deletion mutants that impact xylose utilization. We identified four genes, ALP1, ISC1, RPL20B and BUD21, that when individually deleted allow S. cerevisiae to utilize xylose as the sole carbon source. When these mutants are combined with XYLA and XKS1, it results in strains with significant improvement in xylose consumption. We have demonstrated that systems biology techniques combined with candidate gene approaches can successfully lead to novel genetic strategies for the improvement of xylose utilization

DESIGN
For this experiment samples (2 reference and 2 test samples), consisting of at least 3 biological reps were hybridized. Cy3 one-color labelling was used for each sample.
