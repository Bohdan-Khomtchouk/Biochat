TITLE
TRANSCRIPTOMIC PROFILING OF ASTROCYTES TREATED WITH THE RHO KINASE INHIBITOR FASUDIL REVEALS CYTOSKELETAL AND PRO-SURVIVAL RESPONSESTRANSFORMATION INDUCED BY THE RHO KINASE INHIBITOR FASUDIL.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of genome wide gene expression changes over a time course of 24 hours induced by the Rho kinase inhibitor Fasudil in primary mouse astrocyte cultures.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from primary astrocyte cultures prepared from mouse forebrain from 1.5 day old mice and treated with Fasudil or vehicle control for 2, 6, 12 or 24 hours.
