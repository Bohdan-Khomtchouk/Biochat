TITLE
Human peripheral blood CD4+ T cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cells were isolated from healthy human donors (n=2). Unstimulated cells. Cells were stained with CD4, CD45RA, CCR7 and CXCR7. Using flow cytometry, 4 CD4+ T cell populations were sorted: (1) Na√Øve (CD45RA+CCR7+CXCR5-), (2) Central memory (CD45RA-CCR7+CXCR5-), (3) Effector memory (CD45RA-CCR7-CXCR5-) and (4) CXCR5+ cells (CD45RA-CCR7-CXCR5+)

DESIGN
RNA were extracted from sorted cells and hybridized on Affymetix HU133Plus2 chips. Each population were repeated on different donors such that n=2.
