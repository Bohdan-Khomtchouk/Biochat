TITLE
Comparative genome sequencing of wild type rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) with a recombinant RhCMV lacking ORF 178

ORGANISM
Macacine betaherpesvirus 3

SUMMARY
Recombinant RhCMV was created to study super-infection of Rhesus macaques.  These viruses (RhCMV Δ178;RhCMV Δ182-189;RhCMV Δ178Δ182-189) were co-hybridized with a wild-type BAC-derived RhCMV to a RhCMV tiling array to ensure that there were no additional mutations beyond the intended deleted regions.

DESIGN
Comparison of wild-type BAC-derived RhCMV Δ178, RhCMV Δ182-189, and RhCMV Δ178Δ182-189
