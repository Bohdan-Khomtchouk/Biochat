TITLE
Genome wide analysis of Saccharomyces nascent RNA

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To address co-transcriptional pre-mRNA processing events, Saccharomyces nascent RNA was isolated by chromatin fractionation and analyzed on a genome-wide high density tiling microarray. Co-transcriptional splicing efficiencies were derived by determination of intronic relative to exonic sequence concentrations.
