TITLE
Genome-wide empirical binding sites co-occupied by p53 and NF-kB in human cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p53 and NF-kB are important transcription factors involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and the progression to heart failure/dilatation. We report the genome-wide empirical binding sites co-occupied by the transcription factors in human dilated hearts. p53-NF-kB sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing were performed using tissues from control and diseased hearts. These data may facilitate the discovery of mechanisms by which transcription factors cooperate in close proximity or a multi-molecular complex at a cis-regulatory element to control gene expression. Raw data (qseq format) files are available on the following FTP site:

DESIGN
Examination of p53 and NF-kB transcription factor binding sites in 4 control and 4 diseased hearts (pooled) using ChIP-Seq.
