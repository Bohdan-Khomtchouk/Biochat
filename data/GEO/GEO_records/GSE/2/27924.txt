TITLE
Microarray data for rejuvenation experiments through reprogramming

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Proliferative and replicative senescent fibroblasts from aged human donors were reprogrammed towards pluripotency and re-differentiated in fibroblasts and then further analyzed for rejuvenation assessment.

DESIGN
Comparison of microarrays were performed by non hierarchical clustering visualized in with Treeview software
