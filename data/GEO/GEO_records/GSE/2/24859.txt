TITLE
Expression data from healthy postmenopausal women on 4 different types of hormone therapy, the RET study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) is associated with many diseases and conditions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of 4 types of HT on gene transcription. 24 women (6 women in 4 treatment groups) received 2 mg 17β-estradiol combined with 1 mg noresthisterone acetate (NETA), 1 mg 17β-estradiol combined with 0.5 mg NETA, tibolone, or raloxifene hydrochloride. RNA was isolated from whole blood before treatment (baseline) and after 6 weeks on treatment. The changes in mRNA from baseline to 6 weeks were assessed with a microarray chip.

DESIGN
4 treatment groups with 6 women in each group were blood sampled before treatment (baseline) and after 6 weeks on treatment, that is a total of 48 samples. The gene expression data at 6 weeks were compared to the expression data at baseline for each treatment.
