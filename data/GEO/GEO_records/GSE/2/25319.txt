TITLE
Gene transcription profiles showing early systemic response to E. coli (k2bh2) infection in bovine liver

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We studied the response to infection and associated perturbations to the bovine liverâ€™s normal function by examining gene transcription data from liver biopsies collected following an E. coli infection in the udder of primiparous dairy cows. This is the first study to examine gene transcription responses to systemic infection by the E. coli bacterium in dairy cows. First, we verified that the inoculation protocol resulted in systemic infection in the cows. This was done based on records on three clinical symptoms: body temperature and amount of E. coli bacteria and leukocytes in milk samples. Second, we examined gene transcription patterns underlying the clinical traits. Gene transcription levels at times of peak values for the clinical traits were estimated in the liver to study indications of an acute phase response to systemic E. coli infection in the cows. Finally, we compared gene transcription responses to E. coli infection and lipopolysaccaride (LPS) inoculation.

DESIGN
Sixteen healthy, primiparous Danish Holstein-Friesian cows were challenged intramammarily with E. coli 4 to 6 weeks following parturition. Gene transcription levels for fifteen of the cows were used to study infection responses. We compared gene transcription levels before and after E. coli infection for all fourteen cows.
