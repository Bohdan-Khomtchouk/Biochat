TITLE
Modulation of host gene expression by Hepatitis E virus ORF3 protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of human liver cell line (Huh7) infected with HEV ORF3 expressing (Ad-orf3-egfp) and control recombinant adenovirus (Ad-egfp). Hepatitis E virus ORF3 protein (pORF3) is known to modulate the host cell. Results provide insight into the role of this protein for HEV infection and pathogenesis.
