TITLE
Pooled genome-wide analysis to identify novel risk loci for pediatric allergic asthma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a pooled GWAS and individual genotyping in 269 children with allergic respiratory diseases comparing allergic children with and without asthma. We used a modular approach to identify the most significant loci associated with asthma by combining silhouette statistics and physical distance method with cluster-adapted thresholding. We found 97% concordance between pooled GWAS and individual genotyping, with 36 out of 37 top-scoring SNPs significant at individual genotyping level. The most significant SNP is located inside the coding sequence of C5, an already identified asthma susceptibility gene, while the other loci regulate functions that are relevant to bronchial physiopathology, as immune- or inflammation-mediated mechanisms and airway smooth muscle contraction. Integration with gene expression data (from mouse experimental asthma model taken from GSE6858 and GSE1301) showed that almost half of the putative susceptibility genes are differentially expressed in experimental asthma mouse models.
