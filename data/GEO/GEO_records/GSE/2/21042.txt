TITLE
Expression data from Jejunums of C57BL/6J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Many diseases in digestive system have been improved related to the uptake of high-carbohydrate diet. The underlying mechanism might be related the changes of genes expression in digestive system. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression  during this process.

DESIGN
Jejunums from mice fed with high-glucose diet or control were selected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain populations of genes related to lipid metabolism in order to increase the temporal resolution of expression profiles. To that end, we analyzed the expressions of genes related to lipid metabolism according to clustering analysis and references.
