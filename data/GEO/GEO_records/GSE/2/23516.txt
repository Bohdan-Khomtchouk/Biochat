TITLE
Identification and expression analysis of differentially expressed genes in a hepatocyte model of cold-induced glycerol production in rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax)

ORGANISM
Osmerus mordax

SUMMARY
The rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax, Mitchill, 1814) is an anadromous teleost that overwinters in the estuaries and inshore waters along the North American Atlantic coastline. In the winter months, smelt avoid freezing in subzero temperatures by the production of antifreeze proteins and high levels of glycerol. Glycerol production (glyceroneogenesis) occurs in the liver via a branch point in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and is directly activated by low temperature. In these studies, hepatocytes were isolated from the liver of individual warm fish and incubated at either a warm (8ºC; non-glycerol accumulating) or cold (0.4ºC; glycerol accumulating) temperature over a 72 h time course. Functional genomic techniques were used to identify and validate hepatic transcripts that were differentially expressed between the warm and cold cells. Reciprocal suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA libraries enriched for cold-responsive liver transcripts were constructed at the 72 h incubation time. Microarray analyses using the consortium for Genomic Research on All Salmonids Project (cGRASP) 16K (salmonid) cDNA array were performed at the 24, 48 and 72 h incubation times. For quantitative reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) studies, we focused specifically on the non-colligative [type II antifreeze protein (AFPII)] and colligative (glycerol accumulation) freeze prevention strategies. AFPII (SSH identified) and 21 transcripts (SSH and/or microarray identified or selected by the authors based on a conceptual link to glycerol production) involved in the metabolism of glycolytic (glycogen, glucose) and gluconeogenic (amino acids) sources of glycerol and of lipids with a glycerol backbone (triglyceride, phosphoplipid) were analyzed using QPCR.
