TITLE
Pol II and its associated epigenetic marks are present at pol III-transcribed non-coding RNA genes (I)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epigenetic control is an important aspect of gene regulation.  Despite detailed understanding of many examples, the transcription of non-coding RNA genes by RNA polymerase (pol) III is less well characterized.  Here we profile the epigenetic features of pol III target genes  throughout the human genome.  This reveals that the chromatin landscape of pol III-transcribed genes resembles that of pol II templates in many ways, although there are also clear differences.  Our analysis also discovered an entirely unexpected phenomenon, namely that pol II co-localizes with the majority of genomic loci that are bound by pol III.

DESIGN
Chip-Seq experiments for six samples: Pol III, TFIIIB, TFIIIC, H3K4me3 in HeLa cells and Pol III, S2 phos Pol II in CD4+ cells.
