TITLE
Mechanical Ventilation Augments LPS-induced Lung Injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment investigated the role of mechanical ventilation (MV) in modulating lung's transcriptional response to LPS.   Twenty four  C57/B6 male mice were randomized to four groups: 1. Control, 2. MV, 3. LPS and 4. MV+LPS.  Expression profiling of whole lungs revealed a significant augmentation of the transcriptional response in the combined MV+LPS group relative to the other 3 conditions. Keywords: repeat sample
