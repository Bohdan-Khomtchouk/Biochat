TITLE
mRNA-Seq of whole flies from Drosophila

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from whole flies of females and male of Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. pseudobscura, D. mojavensis, and D. virilis as part of the modENCODE project to validate novel gene models found in D. melanogaster, identify genes differentially expressed between the sexes and sex-specific alternative splicing events, and examine the evolution of gene expression.
