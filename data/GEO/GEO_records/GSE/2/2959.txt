TITLE
Genome-wide SNP Microarray Mapping in Basal Cell Carcinomas Unveils Uniparental Disomy as a Key Somatic Event.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix 10K SNP mapping arrays were used to profile 14 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) with matched blood DNA samples. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number abnormality (CNA) profiles were derived from each tumour-blood pair. Keywords: Genomic DNA on Affymetrix 10K SNP array
