TITLE
Expression profile of MEFs, iPS, and ES in different culture condition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MEFs can be reprograming to ES by defined reprogramming factors, the derived ES-like cells were termed iPSc. Completely reprogrammed iPSc have identifed gene expression profle  with ES. Culture condition may influent the pluripotency of iPSCs.iPS/ES cultured in differient ES medium may have different gene expression profile.

DESIGN
We preform an experiment to analyze the gene expression difference among MEFs cultured in FBS and iCD1,iPSc cultured in KSR medium and N2B27 supplementary with 2i medium , and ES cultured in  N2B27 supplementary with 2i medium.
