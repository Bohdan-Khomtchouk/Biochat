TITLE
microRNAs signatures of Xenopus laevis embryo epidermis at stage 11 (non ciliated) and 26 (ciliated) using high throughput sequencing

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Epidermis of Xenopus embryos forms a mucociliary epithelium constituted of basal, scattered, secreting and ciliated cells and is histologically similar to human airway mucociliary epithelium. We compared microRNAs signatures of epidermis of Xenopus embryos at stage 11.5 (gastrula, non ciliated epidermis) and at stage 26 (tailbud, ciliated epidermis).

DESIGN
2 technical replicates of a pool of 50 explants for each stage 11.5 (non ciliated)  and 26 (ciliated) of Xenopus laevis development
