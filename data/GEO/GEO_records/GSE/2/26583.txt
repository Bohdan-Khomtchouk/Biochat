TITLE
Expression data of overexpression of ABF-1 in SKW cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ABF-1, a bHLH trancriptional repressor expresses in human activated B cells. Overexpression of ABF-1 in a SKW lymphoblastoid cells suppressed IgM production. We used cDNA microarray to identify genes under ABF-1 regulation.

DESIGN
SKW cells ectopically expressed ABF-1-GFP or GFP were harvested  for RNA extraction and array hybridization.
