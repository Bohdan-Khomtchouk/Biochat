TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of 29 cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
29 cases of RCHOP treated DLBCL were profiled for gene expression. Different integrated annalysis were performed, including mirNA differential expression between cases classified according to the COO signature (see later) and correlation tests between gene and miRNA expression.

DESIGN
After transcriptional profiling the cases were classified according to the cell of origin based on the classifier proposed by Wright et al (Wright G, Tan B, Rosenwald A, Hurt EH, Wiestner A, Staudt LM. A gene expression-based method to diagnose clinically distinct subgroups of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2003;100:9991-6.).
