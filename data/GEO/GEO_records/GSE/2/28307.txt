TITLE
Microarrays analysis of RNA isolated from 7days-Sertoli cell culture of 14 day-old AMH-Cre/WT and WT/WT C57BL/6J mouse testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to understand whether sole Cre recombinase expression has an effect on stress signalling pathways and the peroxisomal or other subcellular compartments, we have analyzed total RNA isolated from Sertoli cell cultures of anti-MÃ¼llerian-hormone (AMH)-Cre/wild-type and wild-type/wild-type C57BL/6J mouse testes using microarrays.

DESIGN
The Sertoli cells were isolated from individual 14 day-old mice and were cultivated for 7 days. Total RNA was isolated from the Sertoli cell culture (for AMH-Cre/WT 5 mice and WT/WT 3 mice) and the same genotypes were pooled together. For the microarray analysis two technical replicates for each genotype were generated.
