TITLE
Identification of genes differentially expressed between control and SMILE siRNA transfected HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SMILE, a molecule for which no information is available in the literature, is overexpressed in the blood of patients tolerating a kidney graft without treatment. We performed microarray analysis to determine cellular functions affected by SMILE silencing.

DESIGN
Each condition of control and SMILE siRNA transfected cells was made in triplicates.
