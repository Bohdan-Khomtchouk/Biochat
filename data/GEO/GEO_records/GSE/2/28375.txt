TITLE
Histone H3 acetylation of miRNA genes in HMEC and HMF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal cell type specific histone H3 acetylation of miRNA genes. HMEC and HMF represent two distinct differentiated cell type present in mammary gland each with a distinct phenotype, a distinct epigenotype as well as distinct miRNA expression pattern. The aim of the study was to determine how epigenetic modifications including histone H3 acetylation affect miRNA expression.

DESIGN
Two cell types HMEC vs. HMF. Biological replicates: 3 pairs of HMEC-HMF of 3 distinct genotypes. Immunoprecipitation using anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody (06-599, Millipore).
