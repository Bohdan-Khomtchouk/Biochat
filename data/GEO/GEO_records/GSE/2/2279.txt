TITLE
Gene expression of lung macrophages in mice instilled with Silica, TiO2 or Saline

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were intranasally instilled at 6 weeks of age with silica, titanium dioxide, or saline control and macrophages were harvested by broncho-alveolar lavage at 14 weeks of age.  RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen).  Due to low yield of RNA, mRNA was amplifed by RiboAmp kits (Arcturus) and resulting aRNA was indirectly labeled with Alexa-Fluor 647 dye (Molecular Probes).  This was hybridized against Universal Mouse Reference RNA (Stratagene) which was indirectly labeled with Alexa-Fluor 555 dye (Molecular Probes).  Slides were printed in house using PCR product cDNA targets on GAPS slides (Corning).  Slides were scanned with an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner and data was analyzed using GenePix Pro 4.0 software and Iobion GeneTraffic Duo software.  Data was normalized to a total 1:1 ratio of read to green dye. Keywords: parallel sample
