TITLE
Comparison of splenic and small intestine lamina propria dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells play a vital role in initiating robust immunity against pathogens as well as maintaining immunological tolerance to self antigens, food antigens and intestinal commensals. However, the intracellular signaling networks that program DCs to become tolerogenic are largely unknown. To address this, we analyzed gene expression profiles using microarray analysis of purified intestinal lamina propria DCs (CD11c+ CD11b+ DCs and CD11c+ CD11b- DCs) and compared it to splenic DCs (CD11c+ DC), from mice. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
We sought to determine the unique genetic profile of small intestine lamina propria CD11c+ cells compared to splenic CD11c+ cells. We performed a meta-analysis using the expression profiles of Intestinal lamina propria CD11c+ CD11b+ DCs (GSM550122), Intestinal lamina propria CD11c+ CD11b- DCs (GSM550121) and Splenic CD11c+ DCs (GSM550126). This study combined and re-normalized the microarray data from GSE22127 and GSE22128 studies. Refer to individual Series for additional details
