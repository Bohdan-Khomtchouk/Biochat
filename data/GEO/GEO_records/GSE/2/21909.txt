TITLE
Brief Hydrocortisone Infusion Differentially Influences Blood Leukocyte and Monocyte Gene Expression Before and After Endotoxin Administration in Humans (supported by NIH grant GM34695)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fourteen human subjects (18-40 years of age) were studied. The control group (saline + LPS [n = 7]) received a 12 hour infusion of saline and the experimental group (cortisol + LPS [n = 7]) received a 12 hour infusion of cortisol (3 µg/kg/min). After 6 hours of saline or cortisol infusion, intravenous lipopolysaccharide (2 ng/kg) was administered to all subjects. Blood samples were collected at -24 hours, 0 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours relative to LPS administration at 0 hours. Leukocytes and monocytes were isolated from these blood samples, total RNA extracted, and microarray analyses performed using Affymetrix Focus GeneChips®.

DESIGN
Blood samples were collected at (-24)hr, 0hr, 6hr, and 24hr in relation to the LPS infusion. For both saline and cortisol treated subjects, infusion was started at (-6) hr and continued to (+6) hr.
