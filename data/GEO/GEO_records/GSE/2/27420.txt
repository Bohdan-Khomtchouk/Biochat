TITLE
Expression data of HepG2C3A treated by acetaminophen during 72 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Evaluation of acetaminophen treatment on Hepatic cell line cultivated in conventionnal method and in a new cell culture device (microfluidic biochip) The aim of this study is to understand the transcriptomic responses of cells cultivated in a microsystem by comparison to conventionnal culture method. As a pharmacological example, we choose to used a well known hepatotoxicant : acetaminophen to illustrate the potential of our microsystem.
