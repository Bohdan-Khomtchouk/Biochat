TITLE
Genes regulated by Sox2 in glioma cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knockdown of Sox2 in LN229 gliomal cancer cells decrease their growth rates in vitro. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in Sox2 Knockdown LN229 cells compared with mock knockdown LN229 cells

DESIGN
Sox2 knockdown LN229 cells and and mock knockdown LN229 cells were cultured in DMEM cell culture media for RNA extraction and hybridization on  Applied Biosystems Human Genome Survey Microarrays . We sought to obtain the genes regulated by Sox2 in glioma cell line.
