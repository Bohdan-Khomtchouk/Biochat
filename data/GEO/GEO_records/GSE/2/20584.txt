TITLE
Affymetrix SNP6.0 array for comparison of lung tumor and adjacent normal to high-throughput sequencing data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
One lung tumor and its adjacent normal were profiled for copy-number alterations with the high-resolution Affymetrix SNP6.0 Array. The SRA ID for the high throughput sequencing project will accompany our study is SRP002045.

DESIGN
One lung tumor sample and an adjacent normal sample were assayed on the Affymetrix SNP6.0 array.
