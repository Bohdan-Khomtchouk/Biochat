TITLE
Genome and transcriptome of the duck

ORGANISM
Anas platyrhynchos

SUMMARY
The reads of duck transcripome was mapped to the duck genome and help to identify the UTR regions of predicted genes. The expression level difference between the tissue spleen and liver will help us to detect the immune-related and fatty acid metabolism related genes.

DESIGN
Duck transcriptome was sequenced to improve the gene annotation quality, and to detect the differently expressed genes in liver and spleen tissues.
