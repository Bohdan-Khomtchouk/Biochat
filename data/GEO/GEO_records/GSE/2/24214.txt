TITLE
affy_l2bctv_ath-Expression viral protein L2 BCTV in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
affy_l2bctv_ath - affy_l2bctv_ath - Geminivirus diseases are among the most important economic impact on crops, including beans, cassava, cotton, cucurbits, corn, peppers and tomatoes. Geminiviruses have a genome composed of one or two molecules of single-stranded DNA, depending on mono or bipartite. The BCTV genome consists of a single strand of DNA that contains six reading frames for proteins CP, V2, Rep, C2, Ren, and C4. To determine the mechanism by which C2 of BCTV induce genes, we performed transgenic Arabidopsis expressing BCTV C2. We are interesting to study the difference between the wild type and two mutants. -10 days old plants were grown in MS at 24 degrees in long day. We used the different lines: wt, L2.4 mutants and L2.5 mutants. We performed three repetitions each. Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic)

DESIGN
9 arrays - ATH1
