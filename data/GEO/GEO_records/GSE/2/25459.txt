TITLE
Expression analysis, A. actinomycetemcomitans wild type (JP2) vs CRP deletion mutant both grown anaerobically.

ORGANISM
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans HK1651

SUMMARY
The goal of this analysis is to define the anaerobic regulon for the global transcription factor CRP (catabolite repressor protein) in the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The objectives were met by comparing the mRNA profile of a wild type strain, JP2, to that of an isogenic mutant deleted of the CRP gene.  Both strains were grown anaerobically.
