TITLE
Pilot project to determine optimal bioreactor protein glycosylation conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These research areas concentrate on stress induced proteases in recombinant Escherichia coli, glycosylation heterogeneity due to bioprocess conditions produced in mammalian cells, and metabolic engineering of E. coli. The hypothesis of this project is that recombinant protein glycosylation is inefficient under normal bioreactor conditions since the additional glycosylation reactions necessary for the recombinant protein exceed the metabolic capacity of the cells. Normal bioreactor conditions have been optimized for cell growth, and sometimes for protein productivity. Only recently has it been accepted that optimal glycosylation may not occur under optimal growth or protein productivity conditions. Specific Aim: Determine the relationship between bioreactor conditions and glycosylation gene expression in NS0 cells.

DESIGN
EXPERIMENT: Mouse NS0 myeloma cells were grown in culture, stressed with 5 mM NaCl, 10 mM proline plus 5 mM ammonia, or 5 mM ammonia, along with an unstressed control group. The growth of the cultures were followed until the late exponential phase (90 hours), at which time two 50 mLs of cells were harvested and RNA extracted. Samples were prepared in triplicate, for a total of 12 samples. The RNA was amplified and labeled by Microarray Core (E) and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.
