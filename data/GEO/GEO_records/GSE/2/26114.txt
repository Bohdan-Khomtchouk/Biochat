TITLE
Combination of ABT-869 with SAHA on AML with FLT3-ITD

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For the microarray experiments, MV4-11 and MOLM-14 cells were treated with DMSO control, ABT-869 3 nM, SAHA 6 uM and combination therapy for 24 hours. Cells were then washed in PBS and high-quality total RNA was extracted RNeasy Midi Kit, according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Qiagen, Valencia, USA). RNA quantity, quality, and purity were assessed with the use of the RNA 6000 Nano assay on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara CA, USA). Gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetric U133plus2.0 gene chip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

DESIGN
MV4-11 and MOLM-14 cells were treated with DMSO control, ABT-869, SAHA or combination therapy for 24 hours.
