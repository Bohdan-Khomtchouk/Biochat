TITLE
Yeast Genomic Expression Patterns in Response to Patulin and Ascorbic acid

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The assessment of toxicity about patulin using yeast gene expression comparison analysis. Yeast BY4743 derivative SOD1 mutant was used for this study. Ascorbic acid was used to evaluate the anti-toxic effect to patulin. Keywords: stress response
