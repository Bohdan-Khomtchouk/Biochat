TITLE
Characterization of Lactobacillus Sigma Factors using a Temperature Sensitive E. coli Sigma70 Mutant

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

SUMMARY
Housekeeping sigma factors in the Sigma70 family, as components of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, are responsible for regulating transcription of genes related to vegetative growth. While these factors are well understood in model organisms such as Escherchia coli and Bacillus subtilis, little experimental work has focused on the sigma factors in members of the Lactobacillus genus such as Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus plantarum. This study evaluates the ability of putative Sigma70 proteins from L. brevis (Sigma70-Lb) and L. plantarum  (Sigma70-Lp) to complement a temperature sensitive mutation in E. coli 285c Sigma70. After finding that the heterologous sigma factors were capable of restoring the viability of E. coli 285c at 42 C through growth kinetics studies, the transcriptional responses of 285c to an extended heat shock in the presence of Sigma70-Lb and Sigma70-Lp were found to be similar to previous studies. These results indicate the Sigma70-Lb and Sigma70-Lp are capable of initiating transcription in a complex with the E. coli 285c RNA polymerase to a sufficient degree to restore viability at elevated temperatures without triggering unusual modifications to the native transcriptional program. These heterologous sigma factors may therefore be useful to improve biochemical knowledge of the sigma factor family or for use in transcriptional engineering.
