TITLE
Inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain by antimycin A in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant mitochondria signal to the nucleus leading to altered transcription of nuclear genes by a process called mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR). MRR is implicated in metabolic homeostasis and responses to stress conditions. Transcriptional consequences on nuclear gene expression of mitochondrial perturbations were examined by a microarray analyses.  Expression of 1316 was altered by antimycin A (AA) inhibition of the cytochrome respiratory pathway in leaves of soil grown Arabidopsis plants in the dark for 6 hours. Functional gene category (MapMan) and cluster analyses showed that genes with expression levels affected by perturbation from AA or MFA inhibition were most similarly affected by biotic stresses such as pathogens, not oxidative stresses. Overall, the data provide further evidence for the presence of mtROS-independent MRR signaling, and support the proposed involvement of MRR and mitochondrial function in plant responses to biotic stress.

DESIGN
Three independent (bio-replicate) experiments were done using three independent plant samples and independent chemicals in the treatments. For each, approximately 30 plants were used for the treated sample and about 30 plants were used as the control treated sample. Plants were treated with 20 uM antimycin A in 0.01% Tween 20 and incubated in the dark at room temperature (25C) for 6 hours. RNA was isolated from the inhibitor treated and control treated plants and used for microarray experiments. For each independent (bio-replicate) experiment, two microarrays were utilized using Cy3 and Cy5 dye-labeled samples and dye swapping was incorporated- so, minimum of 2 microarrays for each of 3 independent experiments (6 microarrays). In addition, two of the microarrays were duplicated so that a total of 8 slides were used in the data analyses.
