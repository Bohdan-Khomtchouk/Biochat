TITLE
Investigate the anti-tumor mechanisms of But4ManNAc and butyrate in two breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
But4ManNAc - an analog of ManNAc, the committed precursor of sialic acid - decreases metastatic potential, inhibits growth, and triggers apoptosis in many cancer cells. The anti-tumor effects of But4ManNAc may result from a synergistic interaction between butyrate-induced changes in gene expression and ManNAc-induced altered sialylation.  This experiment provides insight into synergistic interactions by identifying changes in gene expression specific to But4ManNAc and not shared with butyrate.

DESIGN
Specifically, microarrays will compare gene expression of metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) treated with But4ManNAc to that of cells treated with sodium butyrate at concentrations which inhibit invasiveness but do not trigger apoptosis.  Differences in gene expression  demonstrate a synergistic interaction between butyrate and sialylation as well as suggest mechanisms to account for this synergy. RNA preparations of treated and control metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were sent to Microarray Core (E). Five conditions where sent: cells treated with 50uM But4ManNAc, 125uM But4ManNAc, 50uM But5Man, 125uM But5Man, and Ethanol (control). Three replicate samples from each condition were used in the study.  The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays. Data was analyzed to identify differences in gene expression that demonstrate a synergistic interaction between butyrate and sialylation, as well as suggest mechanisms to account for this synergy.
