TITLE
Streptococcus gallolyticus modulates phase I biotransformation enzymes in colorectal cancer cells through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus gallolyticus is one of the few intestinal bacteria that has been consistently linked to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to identify S. gallolyticus-induced  pathways that could on the long-term add to CRC progression. Transcription profiling of S. gallolyticus-exposed CRC-cells revealed the persistent induction of enzymes involved in biotransformation pathways. Specifically, a diffusible factor of S. gallolyticus (SGF-X) interacts with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor thereby inducing CYP1 enzymes that catalyze the bioactivation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into toxic intermediates. Importantly, priming CRC-cells with SGF-X containing medium increased the DNA damaging effect of the PAH 3-methylcholanthrene, which was not observed for other intestinal bacteria. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that bacteria can modulate the biotransformation capacity of CRC-cells that offers a novel theory for a contributing role of S. gallolyticus in the etiology of sporadic CRC.

DESIGN
Expression patterns of colorectal cancer cells co cultured with S. gallolyticus, E. faecalis and S. macedonicus were compared with colorectal cancer cells that were not exposed to these bacteria. We find that S. gallolyticus induced oxidoreductase gene pathways. This was validated with in vitro Q-PCR and functional analysis showing that these genes were also altered in other colorectal cancer cell lines and that his effect was translated to the functional level.
