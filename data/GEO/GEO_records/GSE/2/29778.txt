TITLE
HuR (ELAVL1) RIP-chip and knockdown exon array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Integrative regulatory mapping indicates that the RNA-binding protein HuR (ELAVL1) couples pre-mRNA processing and mRNA stability In this dataset, we employed two distinct experiments. 1) HuR RIP-chip to identify mRNA targets of HuR. 2) HuR knockdown to identify mRNAs whose expression are dependent on HuR.

DESIGN
All 12 samples were normalized with PLIER using Affymetrix power tools. To identify RNA targets of HuR, HuR RIP samples were compared to Mock RIP samples. To identify RNA regulated by HuR, HuR knockdown samples were compared to mock knockdown samples.
