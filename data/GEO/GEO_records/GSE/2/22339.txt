TITLE
Aedes aegypti whole-genome gene expression

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
Sequencing of the Aedes aegypti genome has enabled genome-wide studies of gene expression in this mosquito.  The large quantities of data produced from such studies require efficient cataloguing in order for new insight to be made into gene expression patterns and the underlying molecular mechanisms for producing these patterns.  Our study provides a comprehensive catalogue of genes whose transcription products increase or decrease in abundance in adult females following blood feeding. We developed a publicly-accessible database and data-mining tool, aeGEPUCI, that integrates 1) stage-specific microarray analyses of gene expression in Ae. aegypti, 2) functional gene annotation, 3) genomic sequence data, and 4) computational sequence analysis tools.  The database is accessible from the address

DESIGN
8 conditions, 3 replicates for each condition
