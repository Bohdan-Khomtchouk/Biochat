TITLE
MicroRNA expression in lymphoma lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs from lymphoma and leukemia cell lines with or without the 13q31 amplicon were quantitated using a custom microarray platform.  5ug total RNA from each line was labeled with cy3 and hybridized to a microarray that contains probes to 238 mouse and human mature microRNAs.  Four data sets per cell line are provided.  Data is presented as log (base 2) values median center normalized. Keywords: other
