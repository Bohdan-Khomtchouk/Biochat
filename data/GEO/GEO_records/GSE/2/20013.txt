TITLE
Transcriptional Characterization of Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into endothelial cells (hESC-ECs) has the potential to provide an unlimited source of cells for novel transplantation therapies of ischemic diseases by supporting angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. In this study, we developed an extracellular matrix culture system for increasing endothelial differentiation and free from contaminating animal cells. We investigated the transcriptional changes that occur during endothelial differentiation of hESCs using whole genome microarray, and compared to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). (Note: Please see our publication, PMID 20046878, which includes analysis of array data from GSM348001-GSM348004 in conjunction with this series).

DESIGN
Total RNA from Day 12 Embryoid Bodies that were differentiated from H9 human embryonic stem cells (EB, n = 4), endothelial cells differentiated from H9 human embryonic stem cells  (hESC-EC, n = 4), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, n = 4) was hybridized to four Agilent Whole Human Genome microarrays. A pooled reference sample was used that contained total RNA from H9 hESCs, H9 embryoid bodies, cardiac and endothelial cells derived from H9 hESCs, cardiac fetal tissue, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
