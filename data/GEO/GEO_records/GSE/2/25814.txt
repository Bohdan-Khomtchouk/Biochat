TITLE
Effects of redox modulation by inhibition of Thioredoxin reductase on radiosensitivity and gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The involvement the thioredoxin system in radiation resistance was investigated in human lung cancer cells by a combination of ionizing radiation and specific thioredoxin reductase-inhibition by a phosphine gold compound.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles (Human Gene 1.0 ST) of lung cancer cells subjected to ionizing radiation and/or inhibition of thioredoxin reductase were studied. Data analyses were performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) Version 1.4.
