TITLE
Respiratory chain protein analysis and gene expression profiles of fibroblast cell lines from 9 patients with SURF1 gene mutations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Upregulation of  CI, CIII and CV  at a protein but not mRNA level in LSCOX cell with COX deficiency due to SURF1 mutations compared to control â€“ evidence for posttranscriptional compensatory mechanism.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, patients vs. controls cells. Biological replicates: 3 controls and 9 patients, independently grown and harvested.
