TITLE
Retinal pigment epithelial cells suppress interleukin-17-producing T-helper 17 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
T cells that encounter cultured ocular pigment epithelial cells in vitro are inhibited from undergoing T cell receptor-triggered activation.  Because retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are able to suppress T-cell activation, we studied whether RPE cells could suppress cytokine production by activated T helper (Th) cells.  In this study we showed that primary cultured RPE cells greatly suppressed activation of bystander CD4+ T cells in vitro, especially the cytokine production by the target T helper cells (Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th17 cells, but not Th3 cells).  Cultured RPE cells and RPE-supernatants significantly suppressed IL-17 producing CD4+ T cells, and RPE cells fully suppressed polarized Th17 cell lines that induced by recombinant proteins, IL-6 and TGFb2.  Moreover, RPE cells failed to suppress IL-17 producing T cells in the presence of rIL-6.  In addition, Th17 cells exposed to RPE were suppressed via TGFb, which produce RPE cells.  These results indicate that retinal PE cells have immunosuppressive capacity in order to inhibit Th17-type effector T cells.  Thus, ocular resident cells play a role in establishing immune regulation in the eye.
