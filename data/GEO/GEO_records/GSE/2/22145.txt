TITLE
miRNAs high throughput sequencing profiling of basals cells and columnar cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The airway mucociliary epithelium is consituted of three main cell types : columnar ciliated  plus secretory cells and basal cells. Columnar cells are represented by a great majority of ciliated cells. We used Cell sorting by FACSaria to separate basal cells from ciliated and secreting columnar cells. Then, we performed microRNA high throughput sequencing to investigate the specific signature of microRNA of basal and columnar cells.

DESIGN
miRNAs high throughput sequencing profiling of human nasal mucosa: basals cells (B) and columnars (C) cells for 3 donors.
