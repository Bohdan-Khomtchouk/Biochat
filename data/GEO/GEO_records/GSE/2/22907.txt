TITLE
Differential expression in laccase mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra10-01_laccases; laccase mutations. We demonstrated that laccases are involved in lignin polymerisation. Mutants have already been tested on microarrays and there is few differences compared to wild-type. The laccase mutation seems surgical. We possess a new double mutant, called snips, with a semi-dwarf phenotype, and we want to determine its profile.

DESIGN
Each mutant was compared to wild type. All plants were harvested at the same developmental stage in the same growth chamber between 10h30 and 11h. 10 dye-swaps. CATMA arrays.
