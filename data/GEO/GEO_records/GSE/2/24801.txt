TITLE
Cultured OEC versus cultured SC and versus native OEC

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This microarray study aimed at identifying the differences in the global gene expression growth program of adult cultured olfactory ensheathing cells (cOEC) (from the olfactory bulb) versus adult cultured Schwann cells (SC) (from the sciatic nerve) and versus adult OEC directly dissected from the olfactory nerve layer (nOEC). The aim of the comparison between cOEC and SC is to define intrinsic molecular differences that distinguish cOEC from SC (both cell types support neuronal regeneration). The aim of the comparison between cOEC and nOEC is to determine the transcriptional responses that are induced in OEC during culturing.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: cOEC vs. SC, cOEC vs. nOEC, SC vs. nOEC. Biological replicates: 3 cOEC-SC replicates, 3 cOEC-nOEC replicates, 3 SC-nOEC replicates. A factorial design was used consisting of direct comparisons between the three cell types (Glonek and Solomon, 2004 (PMID 14744830).
