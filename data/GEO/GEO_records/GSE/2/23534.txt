TITLE
Effect of hIAPP aggregation on gene expression by mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages after 12 hours

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to determine changes in gene expression by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with synthetic human vs. rodent islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Synthetic human IAPP at 15 uM aggregates to form fibrils in vitro, whereas rodent IAPP is non-amyloidogenic. We hypothesized that interaction of macrophages with human IAPP aggregates can activate pro-inflammatory signalling pathways in macrophages, as described for other amyloidogenic peptides.
