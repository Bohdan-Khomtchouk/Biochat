TITLE
Effect of pressure overload on cardiac gene expression in wild-type and CHIP(-/-) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild-type mice or mice lacking the expression of CHIP (Stub1) were subjected to either sham surgery (Sham) or trans-aortic banding (TAB).  After one week, RNA was extracted from heart and run on the Agilent 4x44K gene expression array to look at differences in the cardiac transcriptional response to pressure overload-induced hypertrophy in the absence of CHIP.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment: WT vs. CHIP(-/-) with SHAM or TAB surgery. Biological replicates: 4 per condition.
