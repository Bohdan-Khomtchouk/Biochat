TITLE
Analysis of Germ Stem Cell loss in a murine model of ERM deficiency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ERM knockout mice were produced.  Testis develop a Sertoli cell only syndrome, which appears complete by 10 weeks of age in male ERM knockout mice. Three sets of Affymetrix comparisons were made. #1 and #2,  Wt or ERM knockout testis from 4 week old males, totaly RNA. This time preceeds any significant histologic difference between the wt or knockout.  The results was the finding that only a very specific set or markers for spermatogonial STEM CELLs were found to be greatly reduced in the ERM knockout. #3 and #4.  The sertoli cell line TM4 was transduced with a retroviral ERM.  The wild type TM4 cell line was compared to this TM$-ERM cell line, with the finding that only a few genes were increased in the TM4-ERM line. #5, #6 and #7.  Primary Sertoli cells were purified from 4 week old wild type or ERM knockout or from 10 week old ERM knockout mice and compared. Keywords: other
