TITLE
Comparative gene expression of mouse Pancreatic specific transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a/p48) in pancreatic progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ptf1a was identified as the essential transcription factor which controls pancreatic exocrine enzyme expression. With lineage tracing eperiments Ptf1a was recognized as an important pancreatic progenitor transcription factor and Ptf1a null mice do not develop a pancreas. We used gene expression arrays to determine the global differeences in expression levels when pancreatic progenitor cells are expanding in Ptf1a heterozygote versus null mutants at E10.5.

DESIGN
Ptf1a E10.5 dorsal pancreas total RNA from pools of 3 embryos was twice linear amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 in triplicate for the Ptf1a KO and in duplicate for the Ptf1a heterozygote
