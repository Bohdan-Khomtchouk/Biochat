TITLE
ChIP-Seq data in secondary fibroblast with dox-inducible cassettes for Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The conversion of fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) by forced expression of Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4 is among the earliest demonstrations of reprogramming to a pluripotent state by forced expression of transcription factors. To gain insights into the transcriptional state of genes required for reprogramming, we profiled RNA polymerase II, H3K27me3 and E2F4.
