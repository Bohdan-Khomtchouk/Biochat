TITLE
Expression data from PDK4 overexpressing (Ad-PDK4 infected) and control (Ad-control infected) mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified PDK4 as a gene with adaptive transcriptional response to chemical stress. Although PDK4 is an energy resource regulator induced by starvation, expression of other fasting-inducible genes was unaffected, indicating additional physiological role of PDK4 for liver adaptation to the chemical stress. We used microarrays to determine genes with altered transcriptional level by PDK4 overexpression.

DESIGN
Mice were infected with Ad-control (empty adenovirus vector) or Ad-PDK4 (PDK4 overexpressing adenovirus vector) at a dose of 10^9 PFU/mouse by tail vein injection. 3 days after the infection, mice were sacrificed for RNA preparation from the liver. Ad-control infected = 4, Ad-PDK4 infected = 3. Specimens from mice of each group were pooled, and 10 ug RNA from each pool was used for cRNA synthesis.
