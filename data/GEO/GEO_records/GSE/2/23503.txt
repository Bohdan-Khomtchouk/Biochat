TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) isolated from pigs exposed to a high-fat diet (H-F) or to a high-fat diet plus resveratrol (H-F+RES)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in PBMNCs isolated from female and male pigs to determine significant modulatory effects that may have been induced by the intake of resveratrol during 9 months in high-fat fed animals .
