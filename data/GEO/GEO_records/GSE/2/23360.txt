TITLE
Comparison of the RNA expression profile between P-cadherin over-expressing BLM melanoma cells and empty-vector control cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Van Marck et al. (Cancer Research, 2005) published that overexpression of P-cadherin in a melanoma cell line promoted homo- and heterotypic cell-cell adhesion, induced an epithelo√Ød morphology, and impaired cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we wanted to compare the RNA expression profile between the empty vector control cells and the P-cadherin overexpression variant. This experiment could provide us with effector molecules of P-cadherin that mediate its anti-invasive function.

DESIGN
2 samples were analyzed, each with 2 replicates
