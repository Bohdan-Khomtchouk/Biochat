TITLE
Characterization of Definitive Endoderm formation from HESC and iPSC lines by Microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HESC-H9 and iPSC lines 3.5, 3.6 and 3.12 were analyzed using Affymetrix microarray before and after Definitive Endoderm (DE) formation. DE was induced using the ActivinA differentiation protocol described by D'Amour et al., 2006 (PMID: 16258519)  Clustering analysis of transcripts that were differentially regulated during DE formation indicated that iPSC lines 3.5 and 3.12 differentiate in manner that is highly similar to HESC-H9 cells iPSC line 3.6 had a more divergent transcriptional profile.
