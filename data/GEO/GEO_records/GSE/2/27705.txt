TITLE
Signature of MicroRNAs with Impact on Angiogenesis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Angiogenesis is regarded as a hallmark in cancer development, and anti-angiogenic treatment is presently used in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding, endogenous, single stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression. As miRs are relatively stabile and measurable in both tissue and serum, they are potential prognostic and predictive markers. In this study we aimed to identify significant altered miRs related to angiogenesis in NSCLC
