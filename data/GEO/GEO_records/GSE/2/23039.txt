TITLE
Expression analysis of Meiotic drive system in Aedes aegypti during spermatogenesis

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes of testes in the meiotic drive system in aedes aegypti during spermatogenesis compared to non drive strain. The meiotic drive system in Aedes aegypti causes the female determining chromosome to fragment during spermatogenesis.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA from three separately extracted non driving strain testes of Aedes aegypti and three separately extracted meiotic drive strain testes of Aedes aegypti.
