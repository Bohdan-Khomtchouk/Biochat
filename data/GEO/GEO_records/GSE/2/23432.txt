TITLE
Indian Hedgehog Signaling in the Postnatal Growth Plate

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In order to characterize mRNA expression in the growth plate, we microdissected postnatal rat growth plates into their constituent zones and used microarray analysis to assess the abundences of individual transcripts. Expression patterns of PTHrP and Ihh-related genes were confirmed using real-time PCR. Using a gli1-lacZ mouse, Gli1 expression, presumably representing Ihh signaling, was visualized during pre- and postnatal development.
