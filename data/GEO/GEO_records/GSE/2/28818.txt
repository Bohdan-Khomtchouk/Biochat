TITLE
Comparison of gene expression pattern of THP-1 cell treated with ATRA and RAD001

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the mechanism related to the induction of monocytic differentiation in AML combination of ATRA and RAD001, gene expression patterns of THP-1 cells  were analyzed using  the Agilent Whole Human Genome Expression Array.

DESIGN
Gene expression patterns of THP-1 cell cultured under four different conditions were analyzed. The conditions were as follows; 1, untreated. 2,  treated with ATRA (1mM) and RAD001 (2.5nM). Total RNA was extracted at 5 days after starting treatment.
