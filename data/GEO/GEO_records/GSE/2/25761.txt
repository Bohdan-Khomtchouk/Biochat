TITLE
SAGE analysis of maize root segments

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Dark-grown maize seedlings with primary roots 12-20 mm in length were transplanted to high (-0.03 MPa) water potential vermiculite. About 1,000 roots were collected.  Each root was divided into 4 segments (distances are from the junction of the root apex and root cap): segment 1, 0-3 mm plus the root cap; segment 2, 3-7 mm; segment 3, 7-12 mm; segment 4, 12-20 mm.  Details of the conditions and nutrient modifications have been described before (Sharp et al., 1988; Spollen et al, 2000). From each segment, 250 mg of material was used and RNA was isolated form the combined sample containing all four segments. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Maxi Kit (Qiagen). RNA integrity was verified by denaturing agarose gel electorphoresis and spectrophotometry.

DESIGN
This GEO Series was created by the GEO staff as part of a cleanup effort to ensure that all GEO Samples are included within a Series entry.
