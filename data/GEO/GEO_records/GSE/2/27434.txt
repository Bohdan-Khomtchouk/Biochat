TITLE
Critical Requirement of the DNA Methyltransferase, Dnmt1, for the Development and Function of Foxp3+ Regulatory T Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the role of DNMT1 in immune homeostasis by generating mice lacking DNMT1 in Foxp3+ T-regulatory (Treg) cells. These mice showed decreased peripheral Foxp3+ Tregs, complete loss of Foxp3+ Treg suppressive functions in vitro and in vivo, and died from autoimmunity by 3-4 weeks unless they received perinatal transfer of wild-type Tregs that prolonged their survival. Methylation of CpG-sites in the TSDR region of Foxp3 was unaffected by DNMT1 deletion, but microarray revealed more > 500 proinflammatory and other genes were upregulated in DNMT1-/- Tregs. CD4-Cre-mediated DNMT1 deletion showed inability of conventional T cells to convert to Foxp3+ Treg under appropriate polarizing conditions. Hence, DNMT1 is absolutely necessary for maintenance of the gene program required for normal Treg development and function.
