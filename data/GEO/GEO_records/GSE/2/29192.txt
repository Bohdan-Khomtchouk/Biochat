TITLE
Implication of Nos2 inactivation on the transcriptome of developing cerebellum and Ptch1+/- medulloblastomas  (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Ptch1+/-  strain constitues an established mouse model for the Shh-driven type of medulloblastoma. Combined Ptch1+/- Nos2-/- mice show a two-fold increased incidence for this tumor. Here, the impact of Nos2 inactivation on medulloblastoma development was investigated by gene expression profiling of tumor samples as well as healthy cerebellum at different ages and genotypes.

DESIGN
Medulloblastoma samples from three Ptch1+/- and six combined Ptch1+/- Nos2-/- mice were analyzed. Healthy cerebellum taken from mice at postnatal day nine, six weeks after birth, and about 1 year of age were analyzed for wildtype animals and the genotypes Ptch1+/-, Ptch1+/- Nos2-/-, and Nos2-/-. The cerebellar developmental stages at six weeks and one year were measured in three biological replicates, while samples taken at postnatal day six consisted of pooled individual specimen. These were measured in three replicates being amplified and labelled in separate reactions. All samples were subjected to two-color hybridizations against Universal Reference RNA (Stratagene) with color-switch experiments yielding two technical replicates, respectively.
