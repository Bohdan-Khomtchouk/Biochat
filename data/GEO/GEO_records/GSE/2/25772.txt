TITLE
Genome-wide microarray analysis of normal human fibroblasts in response to γ-radiation and the radiation induced bystander effect

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The bystander effect from ionizing radiation consists of cellular responses generated from non-irradiated cells to the irradiation of their neighbors. The bystander effect can lead to DNA damage and genomic instability in the affected cells. This non-targeted effect of radiation has received attention due to its potential implications for cancer therapy and radiation protection. Although studied extensively, a complete understanding of its molecular mechanism is the subject of ongoing research. While many studies have targeted specific factors which are suggested to be involved in the bystander effect, few have looked at whole genome gene expression in bystander cells. Furthermore, even fewer studies have looked at the expression in normal human cell lines. In this study, we have monitored transcriptional responses to γ-radiation in irradiated and bystander normal fibroblasts simultaneously using a genome-wide microarray approach. In this study we have investigated the transcriptional response in F11hTERT fibroblasts irradiated with 2 Gy, 2 hours after irradiation.

DESIGN
GSM634191-226: Total RNA was isolated from normal human fibroblasts irradiated with 2.0 Gy and fibroblasts incubated with medium from sham irradiated and irradiated cells 2 h after irradiation. RNA was isolated 4, 8 and 26 h after irradiation and there are 4 replicates for each sample for a total of 36 samples. GSM795448-455: Total RNA was isolated from immortalized human fibroblasts F11hTERT irradiated with 0 and 2 Gy g-radiation, 2 h following irradiation. There are 4 replicates for each sample for a total of 8 samples.
