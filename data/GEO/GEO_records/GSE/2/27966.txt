TITLE
Loss of ZEB2 in basal breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Study of loss of ZEB2 in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo: gene expression and phenotypic switch to more benign behavior of the cancer cells. Morphological, functional and gene microarray analysis following ZEB2 knockdown in MDAMB231 cells reveals gain of epithelial differentiation, reduction of migration, invasion and metastatic capability. The measurement of ZEB2 transcriptional activity in tumor cells efficiently predicts the probability of breast cancer patient survival.

DESIGN
Global gene expression profiles were measured using Affymetrix U133 plus2 microarrays in MDAMB231 cells (control and ZEB2 shRNA and siRNA knockdown cells on plastic)
