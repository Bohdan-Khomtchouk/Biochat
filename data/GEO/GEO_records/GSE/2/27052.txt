TITLE
Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis of Brassica rapa under varying soil phosphorus (P) supplies

ORGANISM
Brassica

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify eQTL in Brassica rapa grown under altered soil phosphorus (P) supply, to understand better the genetic architecture of P-use efficiency (PUE) in plants. Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of the BraIRRI mapping population were grown at adequate and growth-limiting soil P. Variation in leaf gene expression was quantified using an Agilent Brassica 95k oligonucleotide array. Informative gene expression markers (GEMs) were used to map eQTL and PUE-related QTL. Gene expression was highly dependent on soil P supply. However, the altered expression of many genes, including known P-responsive genes, was highly heritable. Interval mapping using P supply as a covariate revealed 18,876 eQTL, representing 15,912 unique probes. Notable trans-eQTL hotspots occurred on chromosomes A06 and A01; these were enriched with protein modification and phosphorus metabolism-related (A06), as well as chloroplast and photosynthesis-related (A01) transcripts. Regulatory loci and genes associated with P-use efficiency identified through eQTL analysis are potential targets for further characterisation and may have potential for crop improvement. Availability of the annotated B. rapa genome sequence will facilitate their study, including the separation of cis- and trans- effects.
