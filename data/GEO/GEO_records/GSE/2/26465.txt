Beta-microseminoprotein (MSMB) downregulation is associated with increased drug resistance in ovarian cancer

SUMMARY
Resistance to current chemotherapeutic agents is major cause of therapy failure in ovarian cancer patients. To better understand mechanisms of drug resistance, and possibly identify novel targets for therapy, we generated a series of ovarian cancer cell lines that are resistant to various chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel), and identified key resistance genes and pathways using whole-genome expression analysis. Our data identify a number of genes altered in the drug resistant lines compared to drug-sensitive cells, and further validation finds an interesting candidate MSMB to be consistently decreased at both the mRNA and protein levels in all the drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Through knockdown and overexpression experiments in cell culture models, we show that MSMB has a functional role in drug resistance. Using a mouse xenograft model, we show that re-expression of MSMB in drug-resistant cells can partially reverse the drug resistant phenotype. MSMB-expressing cells have increased caspase-3 activity and known downstream targets, including the PAK2-MLCK-actin pathway, are found activated, providing a possible molecular mechanism for the roles of MSMB in drug resistance. Thus, our study identifies a novel gene in ovarian cancer drug resistance and elucidates a portion of the signaling pathway that may be crucial in its function. Our data suggest a new mechanism for the development of drug resistance in ovarian cancer and identify possible new targets for therapy.
