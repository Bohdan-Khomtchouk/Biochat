TITLE
Gene expression differences between the brachial and femoral artery of the Rapacz HC swine

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The age groups were used to investigate how gene expression differences between the brachial and the femoral artery effect the heterogeneous atherosclerotic disease initiation and progression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from brachial and femoral arteries of four one week, six one year, and five two year old Rapacz HC swine.
