SUMMARY
Laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma was histopathologically confirmed on 35 samples obtained by incisional biopsy. Total RNAs from frozen specimens were isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer protocol. RNA quality was verified by electrophoresis through agarose gel upon visualization with ethidium bromide and only RNA samples with a ratio > 1 for 28S/18S ribosomal RNA were further processed.  A two-round RNA amplification procedure was carried out. Normal larynx and hypopharynx samples was used as reference for hybridizations, these samples were processed in the same manner as tumor samples. Amplified RNA were then used in a transcriptase reverse reaction into cDNA in the presence of Cy3- or Cy5-labeled dCTP Keywords: other
