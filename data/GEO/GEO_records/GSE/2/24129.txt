TITLE
Gene expression profiling for placentas from pre-eclamptic, unexplained FGR and normal pregnancies.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It has been well documented that pre-eclampsia and unexplained fetal growth restriction (FGR) has a common etiological background, but little is known about the linkage al the molecular level. we have performed global gene expression profiling by oligonucleotide microarrays for placentas from pre-eclamptic, unexplained FGR and normal pregnancies to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of these two disorders.

DESIGN
The total number of samples used was 8 from pre-eclampsia, 8 from normotensive pregnancies with FGR and 8 from those without FGR.
