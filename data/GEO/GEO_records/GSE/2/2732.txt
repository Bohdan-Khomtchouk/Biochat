TITLE
Global gene expression pattern of human brain neuronal (SH-SY5Y) cell lines exposed to sarin (GB).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from sarin (GB) treated (n = 6 flasks) untreated (control n = 6) neuronal (SH-SY5Y) cell lines using RNeasy® mini kit. The preparation and processing of labeled, fragmented cRNA for hybridization has been performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). (Biological Replicates for each time points). Keywords: Time-course
