TITLE
PU.1 and C/EBPalpha synergistically program distinct response to NF-kappaB activation through establishing monocyte-specific enhancers (ChIP-chip data)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Unraveling the complexity of transcriptional programs coded by different cell types has been one of the central goals of cell biology. Using genome-wide location analysis, we examined how two different cell types generate different responses to the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. We showed that, after tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) treatment, NF-kappaB p65 subunit binds to distinct genome locations and subsequently induces different subsets of genes in human monocytic THP-1 cells versus HeLa cells . Interestingly, the differential p65 binding in two cell types correlates with pre-existing cell-type specific enhancers prior to TNF-alpha stimulation, marked by histone modifications. We also found that two transcription factors, PU.1 and C/EBPalpha, appear to synergistically mediate enhancer creation and affect NF-kappaB target selection in THP-1 cells. In HeLa cells, co-expression of PU.1 and C/EBPalpha conferred TNF-alpha responsiveness to a subset of THP-1 specific NF-kappaB target genes. These results suggest that the diversity of transcriptional programs in mammalian cells arises, at least in part, from pre-existing enhancers that are established by cell-specific transcription factors.

DESIGN
We performed ChIP-chip for p65, p300, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 using NimbleGen human whole genome tiling arrays in these cells with or without TNF-alpha treatment. In addition, we also mapped PU.1 and C/EBPalpha in untreated THP-1 cells with specific antibodies against these transcription factors.
