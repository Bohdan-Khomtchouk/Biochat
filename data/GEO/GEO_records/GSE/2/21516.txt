Direct Reprogramming of Fibroblasts into Epiblast Stem Cells

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which are derived from the primitive ectoderm of pre-implantation blastocysts, are pluripotent cells and can thus contribute to the formation of all somatic cell lineages in chimeric animals.  Similarly, epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), which are derived from epiblast tissue of post-implantation embryos,  are also pluripotent and can give rise to derivatives of all three germ layers in teratoma assays.  Introduction of the four transcription factors Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/c-Myc into somatic cells has been shown  to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).  iPSCs exhibit ESC-like properties and are virtually identical to ESCs with respect to a number of charactertistics.  However, generation of EpiSC-like cells by direct reprogramming of somatic cells using these  transcription factors has not been shown to date.  Here we show that Yamanakaâ€™s four transcription factors can be used to directly generate EpiSC-like iPS cells (ePSCs) under EpiSC culture conditions.  These ePSCs are identical to EpiSCs with respect to morphology, gene expression pattern, epigenetic status, and chimera formation.  This is the first study to demonstrate that the culture environment in transcription factor-mediated reprogramming  determines the cell fate of the reprogrammed cell.  We could therefore envision that we eventually are able to shape the identity of a directly reprogrammed cell at will simply by modulating the culture conditions.
