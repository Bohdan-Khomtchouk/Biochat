TITLE
Heat stress expression data from developing barley caryopses

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
High temperature stress, like any abiotic stress, impairs the physiology and development of plants, including the stages of seed setting and ripening. In this study we used the 22K Barley1 GeneChip microarray to investigate the response of developing barley (Hordeum vulgare) caryopses at 12 days post anthesis to 0.5h, 3h and 6h of heat stress exposure.

DESIGN
Developing barley caryopses were harvested at different time-points of a day during heat stress (42Â°C) (2:00 PM, 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM). Heat stress started at 1:30PM. Pooled caryopses (form 3 plants) from the respective time points were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (Barley1 GeneChip; GEO accsession GPL1340). Biological replicates were performed.
