Gene expression profiling of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in response to compound CDRI-5g

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in response to compound CDRI-5g (Saquib, M. et al. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 46 (2011) 2217-2223) was studied by administration of compound at 10 Âµg/ml in broth culture. RNA was extracted at two time points 12 h and 24 h of growth from replicating phase and compound added culture. Replicating phase culture was incubated for the same time and used as a control. Experiment was repeated three times and for each time points triplicate culture was pelleted to isolate total RNA using Qiagen RNA isolation kit.
