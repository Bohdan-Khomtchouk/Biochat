TITLE
Gene expression profiling after stimulation of THP-1 cells with a2NTD

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background:  Identifying the immune components that are regulated by a2NTD, a peptide cleaved from the N-terminus of the a2 vacuolar ATPase. Methods:  In this study, we used pathway-focused PCR arrays to determine the genes that are regulated in human monocytic cell line, THP-1 after a2NTD stimulation over time. Results:  a2NTD up-regulated several cytokines including IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-10.  Several chemokines were also upregulated including the MCP and MIP families. Conclusion:  We believe a2NTD to be an immune modulator made by tumor cells that aid in preventing immune surveillance by up-regulating proteins in monocytes that are both pro-and anti-inflammatory in nature.
