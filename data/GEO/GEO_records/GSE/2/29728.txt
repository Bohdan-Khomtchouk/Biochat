TITLE
Overexpression of each of the 6 interfering TFs and 5 non-interfering TFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To clarify that the interfering effect in iPS induction was not because of extraordinary gene expression which was caused by overexpression of infected genes, transcriptional profile of the cells infected six genes were analysed using microarray analysis. As result, overexpression of each of the 6 interfering TFs in NSEB5-2C did not compromise transcriptional profile compared with the five non-interfering TFs.

DESIGN
The cells were infected by retroviruses (carrying each ORF in pMXs-IRESNeo) at the titre in which around 95% of cells express the transgene. After 24hr of the infection, G418 was added to eliminate non-expressing cells. Each cells were harvested at 72hr after the infection.
