TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from human prostate cancer

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules of about 21-25 nucleotides that regulate gene expression via posttranscriptional inhibition of protein synthesis. They play a vital role in the process of tumorigenesis. To identify and characterize the diagnostic potential of miRNAs in prostate cancer, a leading cause of tumor mortality, we performed microarray based screening of miRNA expression profiles.
