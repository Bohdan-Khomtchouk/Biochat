TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression of ovarian cancer cells treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To profile the changes in the pattern of gene expression in human OCa cells induced by 1,25(OH)2D3, OVCAR3 cells were treated with 0.1 pM 1,25(OH)2D3 for 0, 8, 24 and 72 h.  The cells were harvested, RNA was extracted, and Affmetrix microarrays were hybridized.

DESIGN
OVCAR3 cells were treated with 0.1 pM 1,25(OH)2D3 for 0, 8, 24 and 72 hours. 1,25(OH)2D3 was added at different times to allow the treated cells to be harvested at the same time. Ethanol was included as vehicle controls and all cells were exposed to the same amount of ethanol for the same length of time. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using Qiagen Rneasy kit as recommended by Affymetrix. In the initial set of array analysis with U95 chips, GADD45 was identified to be a VD-induced gene in OVCAR3 cells, which was confirmed by a follow-up study to be a primary target gene. For the array analyses with U133A chips, the response to 1,25(OH)2D3 of the cells used for RNA isolation was ensured by Northern blotting analysis of GADD45. Three independent experiments were performed.
