TITLE
Expression comparison between SMC4 and conventional cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The undifferentiated state of pluripotent stem cells depends heavily on the culture conditions.  We show that a unique combination of small molecules, SMC4, added to culture conditions converts primed pluripotent stem cells to a more naïve state.  By conducting Affymetix analysis we show of majority of lineage markers are repressed in SMC4 culture.

DESIGN
Human embryonic stem cells were compared to human induced pluripotent stem cells cultured in either primed or naïve conditions.
