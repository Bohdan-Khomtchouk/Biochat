TITLE
Global Transcriptional Analysis of Stress-Response Strategies in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 Exposed to Organic Extractant - Lix984n

ORGANISM
Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270

SUMMARY
Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (A. ferrooxidans) ATCC 23270 is a model bacteria for bioleaching research. Because of the use of extractant in metal extraction industry, A. ferrooxidans needs to cope with the water-organic two-phase system. To get insight into the molecular response of A. ferrooxidans to organic solvent, global gene expression pattern was examined in A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 cells subjected to Lix984n (an organic extractant) using the method of whole-genome DNA microarray. The data suggested that the global response of A. ferrooxidans to Lix984n stress was characterized by the up-regulation of genes involved in pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid and glutamate biosynthesis contrary to the significant down-regulation of the majority motility-related genes. In further study, compared to heterotrophic bacteria in dealing with short-time stress, A. ferrooxidans has a special strategy of continuously enhancing the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in electron transport, such as petI, petII, cyo and cyd. Besides, acrAB-tolC operon encoding organic solvent efflux pump and its positive regulator gene ostR were addressed.
