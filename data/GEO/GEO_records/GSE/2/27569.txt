TITLE
Expression data from zebrafish depleted of Esco2

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Our study in zebrafish is the first to use an animal model to understand the biology of the developmental disorder Roberts Syndrome (RBS). RBS is caused by mutations in the ESCO2 gene. We have used morpholinos (MO) to knock down esco2 in zebrafish to better understand the pathology of this rare human syndrome. Our zebrafish model nicely phenocopies the developmental defects observed in RBS.
