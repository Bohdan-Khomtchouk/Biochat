TITLE
New targets of TEAD1 revealed by ChIP-on-chip

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TEAD1 acts as a key molecule of muscle development, and trans-activates multiple target genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation pathways. However, its target genes in skeletal muscles, regulatory mechanisms and networks are unknown. Here, we use ChIP-on-chip to identify direct target genes of TEAD1.

DESIGN
All animal procedures were performed according to protocols approved by Hubei Province, P. R. China for Biological Studies Animal Care and Use Committee. Skeletal muscle tissues were collected from three adult Kunming mice.
