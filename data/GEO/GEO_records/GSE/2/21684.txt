TITLE
Arabidopsis seedlings collected during hypocotyl elongation and hypocotyl stasis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The hypocotyl of Arabidopsis seedlings shows rhythmic periods of elongation.  The patterns of elongation are controlled by a combination of internal factors, such as the circadian clock, and external factors such as light.  In a previous study we had found that two transcription factors, PIF4 and PIF5 are important integrators of clock and light signals for the control of elongation.  Here we use microarrays to find genes that are correlated with elongation and that are controlled by PIF4 and/or PIF5.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seedlings grown under short day conditions for three days were transferred to SD/3 conditions (160 min light: 320 min dark cycles) from the dawn of the fourth day.  Seedlings were then collected during periods of hypocotyl elongation and stasis for three days.  There are two types of replication: temporal and independent experiments. For temporal replication, samples collected at the same time of day on subsequent days were used as replicates.  In addition, replicate samples were collected in two independent time courses for most time points. Col and CCA1OX samples from the first time course for time points 280, 1240, 1720, 2680, 3160, and 4120 were originally deposited under GEO Series GSE6906; they have been re-analyzed for this study.  Each sample consists of multiple pooled seedlings.
