TITLE
bzip9-Energetic Homeostasis and Sugar Signaling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
bra-inra09-01_bioen - bzip9 - Diversification of the Molecular Mechanisms Involved in the Control of the Energetic Balance in Angiosperms - To elucidate the role of selected bZIP transcription factors (AtbZIP3, AtbZIP9, AtbZIP63; the expression of these genes is repressed by glucose and are poorly characterized) involved in glucose-triggered transcriptional cascade, the target genes of these bZIP TF will be identified. The glucose-mediated regulations of these bZIP genes will be investigated by identifying the cis-regulatory sequences and the upstream regulatory factors. The functional conservation of the corresponding bZIP orthologues in sugar cane and rice will be evaluated.

DESIGN
12 dye-swap - genotype comparison
