TITLE
Human Macrophage Response to Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis Infection: Evidence for an Early Inflammatory Response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of human monocyte-derived macrophages infected with L.(V.)panamensis was compared to the profile of uninfected cells to delineate transcriptional activation triggered by the infection.

DESIGN
two condition experiment: human monocyte-derived macrophages infected with L.(V.)panamensis. 6-5 donors per time point. 3 times point. 1-3 replicates per donor-time point.
