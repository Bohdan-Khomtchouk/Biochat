TITLE
Isolation of single human hematopoietic stem cells capable of long-term multilineage engraftment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was used to investigate the relationship between human cord blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and multipotent progenitors described in the study. Genes more highly expressed in HSC may be associated with stem cell function and self-renewal.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from flow-sorted populations based on the cell surface expression of CD34, CD38, CD45RA, Thy1, and CD49f.
