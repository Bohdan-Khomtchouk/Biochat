TITLE
PI3K/mTOR specific phospho-antibody microarray to study the effect of rapamycin to the innate immune respsonse

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To comprehensively analyze the effects of mTORC1 inhibition on GSK3, we employed the use of a PI3K/mTOR-specific phospho-antibody microarray that analyzed the site-specific phosphorylation of over 130 kinases within the PI3K/mTOR pathway.  The phosphorylation levels of different kinases in monocytes were measured when stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of a kind of mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin
