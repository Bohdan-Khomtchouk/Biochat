TITLE
Genome-wide analysis revealed a crosstalk between p53 and the pluripotent gene networks in mouse embryonic stem cells (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Study of the function of p53 in regulating gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells. It is critical for embryonic stem cells to maintain their genomic stability. The guardian of the genome, p53, plays important roles in maintaining the genomic integrity of ES cells through regulating the differentiation of ES cells. However, the underlying mechanism of this differentiation is still unclear. We plan to use the integrative genome-wide approach, combining ChIP-seq and gene expression microarray, to explore the mechanisms.

DESIGN
Total six samples: two inputs (untreated and treated with adriamycin) and four ChIP samples (p53_untreated, p53_adr8h, p53S18P_untreated, p53S18P_adr8h). The two inputs will serve as controls for identifying the binding sites.
