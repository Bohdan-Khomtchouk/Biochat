ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Experimental design:  1 genotype: PI- (resistant USDA Plant Introduction (PI462312) line containing SBR Rpp3 resistance gene)  3 treatments: Virulent soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi Tw80-2) challenge, avirulent soybean rust challenge (Hw94-1) & mock infection  3 replications  6 time points: 12, 24, 72, 144, 216 and 288 hours after inoculation  TOTAL: 54 Affymetrix GeneChip(R) Soybean Genome Arrays    Mock treatment: 0.01% Tween 20  Hawaii 94 treatment: 500,000 spores per ml in 0.01% Tween 20  Taiwan 80-2 treatment: 500,000 spores per ml in 0.01% Tween 20   ****[PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Martijn van de Mortel (for Steve Whitham).
