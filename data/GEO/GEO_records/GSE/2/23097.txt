TITLE
Melampsora larici-populina gene expression in different tissues and development stages

ORGANISM
Melampsora larici-populina

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of Melampsora-larici-populina was analysed in urediniospores, germlings and infected Poplar leaves. The array probes were designed from gene models taken from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI, Department of Energy) Melampsora larici-populina genome sequence version 1. One aim of this study was to verify the expression of the automatically annotated gene models in various tissues and development stages. Another goal was to monitor gene expression at different developmental stages and to highlight tissue-specific transcripts, e.g. in planta up-regulated transcripts for further analyses.

DESIGN
We performed 9 hybridizations (Nimblegen) with samples derived from urediniospores, germlings and infected Poplar leaves (three replicates each). Samples from infected leaves were harvested 96 hours post infection. All samples were labeled with Cy3.
