TITLE
Human umbilical cord blood-derived endothelial colony forming cells under serum-free conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Derivation and expansion of human umbilical cord blood-derived endothelial colony forming cells under serum-free conditions - a transcriptome analysis. Endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) were isolated from term umbilical cord blood units. ECFCs were expanded under standard, fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing endothelial medium, or transferred to chemically defined endothelial media without FBS. Microarray expression profiling was applied to compare the transcriptome profiles in FBS-containing versus FBS-free culture.

DESIGN
Comparison of the expression patterns of ECFCs that were either cultured in FBS-containing medium or in serum-free medium (five replicates each).
