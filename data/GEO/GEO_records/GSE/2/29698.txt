TITLE
Differential expression of genes after treatment with DAMTC in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to identify the genes which get altered after the treatment with DAMTC in A549 cells. The A549 cells plated in T25 flask were treated with DAMTC at a concentration of 160 microgram/ml for 24 h.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates of 2 samples were used viz. control A549 cells (Control), A549 cells treated with DAMTC (160 micrograms/ml) for 24 h (Treated)
