Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genetic loci displaying environmentally responsive epigenetic marks, termed metastable epialleles, offer a solution to the paradox presented by genetically identical yet phenotypically distinct individuals.  The murine viable yellow agouti (Avy) locus is a well-described metastable epiallele that serves as a visual epigenetic biosensor. The Avy locus exhibits a high R-value or ratio of inter-individual (Vi) to inter-tissue (Vt) variance in gene expression, characteristic of what we term the ‘Agouti Expression Fingerprint.’ We propose a novel method for identification of candidate metastable epialleles based on the Agouti Expression Fingerprint, defining candidates as loci with R-values greater than 1.5 on expression microarray. Using Expression data from tissues of the three germ layers (liver, kidney, brain), high variance in agouti RNA levels among isogenic animals coupled with low variance among tissue types in individual animals is demonstrated. Here, we provide proof of concept for the ‘Agouti Expression Fingerprint’; the characterization of epigenetically labile loci in humans will be crucial to the development of novel screening and therapeutic targets for human disease prevention.
