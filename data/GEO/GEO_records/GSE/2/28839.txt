TITLE
Genome-wide nucleosome position data for 3 yeast species

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Genome-wide nucleosome position data for wildtype and mutant strains in S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, and S. pombe

DESIGN
Illumina sequencing of mononucleosomal DNA isolated from mid-log cultures grown in rich medium (abbreviated CM, in house recipe). S. pombe samples were grown in YES medium at permissive temperature (30C) and restrictive temperature (35C)
