TITLE
Effects of Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010 on gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells stimulated with Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010. We used microarrays to investigate gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells in response to Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010, in particular genes involved in mucin pathways.

DESIGN
Caco-2 cells were grown in transwell plates to 4 days post-confluence. Cells were then incubated for 2h and 4h with Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010. The experiment was performed in duplicate. Caco-2 RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix NuGO_Hs1a52018 arrays.
