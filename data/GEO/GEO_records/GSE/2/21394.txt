MicroRNA expression profiles of interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients

SUMMARY
The mechanisms and molecular pathways underlying interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are poorly understood. Systems biology approaches were used to identify perturbed networks in these disease states to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disease. Through profiling genes and miRNAs, we found subsets of genes and miRNAs that distinguish different disease stages, ILDs from controls, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) from non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP). Traditional pathway analysis revealed several disease-associated modules involving genes from the TGF-beta, Wnt, focal adhesion and smooth muscle actin pathways that may be involved in advancing fibrosis. A comprehensively integrative approach was used to construct a global gene regulatory network based on the perturbation of key regulatory elements, transcriptional factors and miRNAs. The data also demonstrated that several subnetworks were significantly associated with key molecules involved in the diseases. We present a broad overview of the disease at a molecular level and discuss several possibly key regulatory molecular circuits that could play central roles in facilitating the progression of ILDs.

DESIGN
Lung tissue samples from thirty patients with IPF or related disorders were obtained from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (www.ltrcpublic.org). Ten samples came from patients who had been diagnosed with usual interstitial pneumonia/ idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (UIP/IPF), nine samples came from patients with non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), four from patients with uncharacterized fibrosis, and the remaining samples came from patients with other ILD variants. Biopsies from uninvolved lung tissue from lung cancer patients (5 samples) and from one lung transplant patient were used as controls for comparison with the ILD samples.
