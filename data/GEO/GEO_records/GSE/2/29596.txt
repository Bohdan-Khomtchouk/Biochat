TITLE
Identification of avian RIG-I responsive genes during influenza infection

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of chicken embryonic fibroblasts (DF-1 cells) comparing the effects of chicken cells transfected with duck RIG-I compared to empty-vector transfected cells following with low or highly pathogenic avian influenza. Goal was to determine the effects of duck RIG-I on influenza-induced immune gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment. Biological replicates for low pathogenic avian influenza infection: 3 empty-vector transfected replicates, 3 RIG-I transfected replicates. Biological replicates for highly pathogenic influenza infection: 2 empty-vector transfected replicates, 2 RIG-I transfected replicates.
