TITLE
Assessing the importance of target type for oligonucleotide microarray experiments

ORGANISM
Methylosinus trichosporium

SUMMARY
In order to assess the effect on signal variability of the type of target used for oligonucleotide microarray experiments, we hybridized double and single stranded DNA of three genes on a Nimblegen High Density microarray. This slide carries specific probes (two lengths: 30 and 50 nucleotides, for a total of 7456 probes) targeting every region of selected genes.
