TITLE
Transcriptomic comparison of chemosensitive and chemoresistant cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
First, in a model of xenografts induced with HT-29 human colon cancer cells, we demonstrated that the transcription factor NF-kB was involved in the resistance to CPT-11. Then, from one tumor treated with CPT-11 plus a NF-kB inhibitor, we established a resistant cell line to CPT-11. The aim of this study was to compare the expression of genes involved in the signaling pathway of NF-kB between the sensitive and the resistant cell lines and to identify other genes (target or not of NF-kB) which the expression was modified when the resistant phenotype was acquired.
