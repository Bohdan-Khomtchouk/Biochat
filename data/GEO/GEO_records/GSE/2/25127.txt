TITLE
Ewing Sarcoma cell lines treated with mithramycin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study aims to define gene expression changes associated with mithramycin treatment of Ewing Sarcoma cell lines.

DESIGN
The data consist of 12 arrays. Two cell lines, TC71 and TC32, were treated with solvent control or with mithramycin, and RNA was extracted at 6 hours. Three biological replicates per cell line/treatment.
