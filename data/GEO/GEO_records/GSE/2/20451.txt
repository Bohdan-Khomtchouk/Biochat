TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata degradomes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of the 5' ends of uncapped, polyA-enriched mRNA from two biological replicate samples from Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescences, as well as two biological replicates of Arabidopsis lyrata inflorescences.  These data were used to experimentally identify sliced microRNA targets from the two species.

DESIGN
Two biological replicate samples of the 5' ends of uncapped, polyA+ RNAs from both A. thaliana and A. lyrata
