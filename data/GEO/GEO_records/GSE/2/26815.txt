TITLE
Sustainable syntrophic growth of Dehalococcoides ethenogenes strain 195 with Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough and Methanobacterium congolense: global transcriptomic and proteomic analysis

ORGANISM
Dehalococcoides mccartyi 195

SUMMARY
The syntrophic growth of strain 195 with Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DVH) and/or Methanobacterium congolense (MC) enhanced TCE dechlorination process by faster dechlorination rate and more robust growth.  Transcriptomes of strain 195 grown in isolation, co- and tri-cultures were obtained by microarray experiments to find out the differential expressed genes corresponding to the syntrophic growth.  Thus we can better understand the role of DVH and MC within this syntrophy.
