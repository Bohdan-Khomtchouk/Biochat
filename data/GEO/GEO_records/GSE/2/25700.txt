TITLE
Comparative analysis of mouse cardiac gene expression:  diet, sex, and disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The perception that soy food products and dietary supplements will have beneficial effects on heart health has led to a massive consumer market. However, we have previously noted that diet has a profound effect on disease progression in a genetic model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In this model, a soy-based diet negatively impacts cardiac function in male mice. Given the frequent correlation between functional changes and transcriptional changes, we investigated the effect of diet (soy- vs. milk-based) on cardiac gene expression and how it relates to the additional factors of sex and disease. We found that gene expression in the heart is altered more by diet than by sex or an inherited disease. We also found that the healthy male heart may be sensitized to dietary perturbations of gene expression in that it displays a gene expression profile more similar to diseased hearts than to healthy female hearts. These observations may in part account for divergence in HCM phenotypes between males and females and between diets.

DESIGN
Hearts from male and female wild-type or HCM C57BL/6 mice fed either a soy or casein-based diet were excised at 2 months of age. Total RNA was extracted from left ventricles. Biotin-labeled amplified RNA was hybridized to MG_U74Av2 Affymetrix microarrays.
