response of ein3eil1 mutants to fe deficiency-Role of ethylene in Fe deficieny response signalling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au10-14_fer - response of ein3eil1 mutants to fe deficiency - Response of ein3eil1 mutants to Fe deficiency - Wild type seedlings and ethylene insensitive ein3eil1 seedlings were germinated and grown in the presence of 50 µM Fe or absence of Fe (0 µM) on Hoagland medium agar plates until the age of 6 days. Under these growth conditions symptoms of Fe deficiency develop in the 0 Fe plants. Ethylene is known to promote Fe acquisition responses. Whole seedlings were harvested for transcriptome analysis, in a total of three biological replicates.
