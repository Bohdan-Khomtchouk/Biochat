TITLE
Genome-wide binding of Sd and Yki in imaginal discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The transcription cofactor Yki drives growth and proliferation in part by controlling mitochondrial network formation. To determine if Yki and Sd are directly bound to DNA corresponding to mitochondrial genes, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation and whole genome tiling arrays (ChIP-chip) to identify regions bound by these factors in eye-antenna and wing imaginal discs. The supplementary .bed files contain all Yki or Sd binding sites (called at 5% FDR) in wing or eye-antenna imaginal discs, as well as shared Sd+Yki sites and associated target genes.

DESIGN
Wing or eye-antenna imaginal discs ChIPped for Yki or Sd-GFP vs. input DNA from corresponding imaginal discs.
