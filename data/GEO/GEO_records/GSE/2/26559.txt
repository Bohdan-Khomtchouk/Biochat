SUMMARY
Tcf1 is necessary for optimal T lineage development. Tcf1 deficient progenitors fail to initiate the T lineage program in vitro and development is severely defective in vivo. We used microarrays to assess the overal global gene expression differences from Tcf1 wildtype and deficient lymphoid biased progenitors cultures on Notch-ligand expressing stroma to determine if Tcf1 deficient progenitors are able to intiate the T lineage specification program. Abstract of manuscript: The thymus imposes the T cell fate on incoming multipotent progenitors, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We show that transcription factor Tcf1 initiates T-lineage-specific gene expression. Tcf1 is downstream of Notch1 signaling and expressed in early T-cell progenitors. Progenitors deficient for Tcf1 are unable to initiate normal T-lineage specification. Conversely, ectopic expression of Tcf1 in hematopoietic progenitors is sufficient to induce expression of T-lineage specific genes in vitro.  Thus, our study identifies Tcf1 as critically involved in the establishment T cell identity.
