TITLE
Deep Transcriptional Profiling of Rice Using Illumina's Sequencing By Synthesis Technology

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Identification of all expressed transcripts in a sequenced genome is essential both for genome analysis and for realization of the goals of systems biology. We used the transcriptional profiling technologies like ‘massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS)’ and ‘Sequencing by Synthesis’ (SBS) to develop a comprehensive expression atlas of rice (Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare). Illumina’s SBS technology can generate large amounts of sequence data in a short time at low cost compared to traditional Sanger sequencing based methods. Using the MPSS technology, we previously analyzed the transcriptomes of 72 rice tissues. To validate the sequencing results from MPSS technology, we employed SBS technology and constructed SBS libraries from 32 rice tissues (47 libraries including replications). For SBS library construction, we used the same mRNA samples and same restriction enzyme (DpnII) that were used for the construction of the MPSS libraries. These libraries include six abiotic-stress libraries, eight pathogen-infected libraries, five insect-damaged libraries, three developing seed libraries, and 10 untreated rice tissue libraries. This study was carried out with the following objectives; a) Identification and quantification of expressed genes in rice at all developmental stages of plant growth, response to biotic and abiotic stresses, and developing seeds; b) Compare SBS signatures with rice genomic sequence to identify novel transcripts; c) To validate the transcriptional data obtained through MPSS technology; and To create query and analysis tools to facilitate public use of and access to rice MPSS and SBS data and to display abundance and chromosomal locations of rice MPSS and SBS signatures. The SBS data will be available at
