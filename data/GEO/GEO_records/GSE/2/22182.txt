TITLE
Global Deterministic and Stochastic Allelic Specific Gene Expression in Single Blastomeres of Mouse Early Embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we modified a single cell whole transcriptome amplification method to make it capable of amplifying cDNAs as long as 3kb efficiently and unbiasedly. We combined this modified single cell cDNA amplification method with Applied Biosystems next generation sequencing SOLiDâ„¢ System to set up a single cell whole transcriptome assay.  The modified amplification strategy allows us to amplify full-length cDNAs for most of the expressed genes. We show that it is feasible to get digital gene expression profiles at single cell resolution. This allows us to ask fundamental biological questions that could not be addressed previously and to understand transcriptome complexity at the resolution of a single cell. Oocyte, Two-cell, Four-cell, and 8-cell stage embryos were recovered from MF1 females mated with MF1 male mice (Nagy et al. 2003). The zona pellucida was removed by treatment with acidic tyrode solution. The individual blastomeres were separated by gentle pipeting using a glass capillary.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq from 24 single mouse blastomeres from oocytes, 2-cell, 4-cell and 8-cell stages.
