TITLE
Whole-genome gene expression profiles of non-tumorous human lung tissues: Laval set

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled genome-wide gene expression in non-tumorous human lung tissues. The overall goal of this project is to improve our molecular understanding of various lung diseases including lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

DESIGN
Lung specimens were obtained from patients undergoing lung cancer surgery at the Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec. All lung specimens were derived from a homogeneous piece of peripheral tissue free of tumour obtained at surgery performed between April 2004 and December 2008. These lung tissues were stored in the biobank of the Respiratory Health Network of the FRSQ, site Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec. The time from surgical removal to freezing was between 15 to 30 minutes. RNAs were extracted and then hybridized to a single custom-made whole-genome human Affymetrix array.
