TITLE
Comparative transcriptome analysis of 16M and its vjbR mutant under a condition simulating environments of macrophage

ORGANISM
Brucella melitensis bv. 1 str. 16M

SUMMARY
Quorum sensing system (QS) is a global regulator that regulates gene expression in response to cell density and other environmental factors. Two QS genes have been identified in Brucella, one of which (vjbR) is involved in Brucella intracellular survival and virulence. But the regulation mechanism of Brucella intracellular survival by the vjbR remains unknown.To characterize the regulation roles of vjbR, the in vitro vjbR induction conditions simulating intracellular environments were firstly defined, and then, transcriptome of the vjbR mutant is compared to that of the wild type strain. The vjbR gene was highly activated under acidified nutrition limitation condition. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that a total of 126 genes were greatly differentially expressed in the vjbR mutant.

DESIGN
2 wild type samples and 2 vjbR mutant samples were analyzed.
