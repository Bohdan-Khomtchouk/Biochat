TITLE
Developmental underpinnings of differences in rodent novelty-seeking and emotional reactivity

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Innate differences in human temperament strongly influence how individuals cope with stress and predispose for specific types of psychopathology. The present study examines the developing brain in an animal model of temperamental differences to understand how altered neurodevelopment may engender differences in emotional reactivity that are stable throughout the animalâ€™s life. We utilize selectively-bred High Responder (bHR) and Low Responder (bLR) rats that exhibit dramatic emotional behavior differences, with bHRs exhibiting exaggerated novelty-exploration, aggression, impulsivity and drug self-administration, and bLRs showing marked behavioral inhibition, exaggerated anxiety- and depressive-like behavior. Using Affymetrix microarrays, we assessed bLR/bHR gene expression in the developing brain on postnatal days (P)7, 14, and 21, focusing on the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, two regions related to emotionality and known to differ in adult bLR/bHR rats. We found dramatic bLR/bHR gene expression differences in the P7 and P14 hippocampus, with minimal differences in the nucleus accumbens. Some of the most profound differences involved genes critical for neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis. Stereological studies evaluated hippocampal structure in developing bHR/bLR pups, revealing enhanced hippocampal volume and cell proliferation in bLR animals. Finally, behavioral studies showed that the bHR/bLR behavioral phenotypes emerge very early in life, with exploratory differences apparent at P16 and anxiety differences present by P25. Together these data point to specific brain regions and critical periods when the bHR/bLR phenotypes begin to diverge, which may eventually allow us to test possible therapeutic interventions to normalize extreme phenotypes (e.g. the anxiety-prone nature of bLRs or drug addiction proclivity of bHRs).
