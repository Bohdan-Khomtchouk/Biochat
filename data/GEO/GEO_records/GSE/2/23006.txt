TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of a  wound healing process in skin and oral mucosa

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
When compared to skin, oral mucosal wounds heal rapidly and with reduced scar formation. This study used an Affymetrix microarray platform to compare the transcriptomes of oral mucosa and skin wounds in order to identify critical differences in the healing response at these two sites.

DESIGN
Using microarrays, we explored the differences in gene expression in skin and oral mucosal wound healing in a murine model of paired equivalent-sized wounds. Samples were examined from day 0 to day 10 and spanned all stages of the wound healing process. Unwounded matched tissue was used as a control. Tissue samples collected at each post-wounding time point, as well as control samples, were represented by 3 biological replicates.
