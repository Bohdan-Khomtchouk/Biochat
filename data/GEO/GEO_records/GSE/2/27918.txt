TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in mouse erythroid cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated genome-wide chromatin state and RNA Polymerase II binding maps in mouse erythroid cells by ChIP-Seq.

DESIGN
Examination of 4 different histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27me3, H3K27ac) and RNA Polymerase II (RNAP2) binding in mouse erythroid cells  (Ter119+).
