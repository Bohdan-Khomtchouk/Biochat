TITLE
Control of oligodendroglial cell number by the miR-17~92 family of miRNA cluster (miRNA Agilent Part)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The generation of myelinating cells in the central nervous system (CNS) requires the initiation of specific gene-expression programs in oligodendrocytes. We reasoned that miRNAs could play an important role in this process by regulating critical developmental genes. Microarray profiling of cultured oligodendrocytes identifies the miR-17~92 family of miRNA cluster as highly enriched miRNAs in oligodendrocytes. We specifically deleted the miR-17~92 cluster in oligodendrocytes using the 2´3´-cyclic nucleotide 3´-phosphodiesterase (CNP)-Cre mice. Absence of miR-17~92 leads to a reduction of oligodendrocyte number in vivo and we find that the expression of these miRNAs in primary cultures of oligodendrocytes promotes cell proliferation by influencing Akt signalling. Together, these results suggest that the miRNA pathway is essential in determining oligodendroglial cell number and that the miR-17~92 cluster is crucial in this process.

DESIGN
MicroRNA microarray profiling was used for the identification of miRNAs enriched in the oligodendroglial lineage. Total RNA lysates from immature (one and two days in oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) culture -d0 and d1) and mature oligodendrocytes (six days in culture - d6) were analysed regarding their miRNA levels. Three independent samples for each time point were used (two samples for day 1).
