TITLE
au08-06_mpk6_heat_stressed-Transcriptomic analysis of mpk6 KO mutant after heat stress treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au08-06_mpk6_heat_stressed - au08-06_mpk6_heat_stressed - Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are key regulators of cell proliferation, differentiation and stress effectors. The core of the MAP kinase signal transduction cascade is composed of a three-kinase module consisting of a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), and a MAP kinase (MAPK). The signaling pathway is activated upon stimulation by a phosphorylation cascade. In previous studies, it was shown that the mpk6 KO mutant plants are significantly more tolerant to heat stress in comparison to wt and that after 3h treatment at 37°C, an activation of heat-shock proteins occures in the mpk6 mutant. To better understand the changes occuring in the mpk6 mutant upon heat stress at the gene expression level, we would like to perform a microarray transcriptomic analysis. - Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are key regulators of cell proliferation, differentiation and stress effectors.
