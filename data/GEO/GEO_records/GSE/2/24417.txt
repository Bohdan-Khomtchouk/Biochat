TITLE
MAQC-II Project: Iconix data set

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The Iconix data set (endpoint B) was provided by Iconix Biosciences, Inc. (Mountain View, CA, USA). The study objective was to assess, upon short term exposure, hepatic tumor induction bynon-genotoxic chemicals, since there are currently no accurate and well-validated short-term tests to identify non-genotoxic hepatic tumorigens, thus necessitating an expensive 2-year rodent bioassay before a risk assessment can begin. The reanalysis has been carried out with log2 transformed gene expression levels of the raw signal values. The data in this Series were initially submitted in GEO Series GSE8251.
