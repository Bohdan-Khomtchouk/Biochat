TITLE
Promoter proximal pausing and its regulation by c-Myc in embryonic stem cells: ChIP-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recruitment of the RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcription initiation apparatus to promoters by specific DNA binding transcription factors is well recognized as a key regulatory step in gene expression.  We describe here evidence that promoter-proximal pausing is a general feature of transcription by Pol II in embryonic stem (ES) cells, and thus an additional step where regulation of gene expression may occur.  We report here that c-Myc, which occupies a third of actively transcribed genes in ES cells and is a key regulator of cellular proliferation, binds P-TEFb and contributes to release of promoter-proximal paused Pol II at these genes.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq data for Pol II and additional factors controlling pause release in mouse ES cells.
