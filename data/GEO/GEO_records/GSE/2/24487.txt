SUMMARY
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare and fatal human premature aging disease1-5, characterized by premature atherosclerosis and degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs)6-8. HGPS is caused by a single-point mutation in the LMNA gene, resulting in the generation of progerin, a truncated mutant of lamin A. Accumulation of progerin leads to various aging-associated nuclear defects including disorganization of nuclear lamina and loss of heterochromatin9-12. Here, we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts obtained from patients with HGPS. HGPS-iPSCs show absence of progerin, and more importantly, lack the nuclear envelope and epigenetic alterations normally associated with premature aging. Upon differentiation of HGPS-iPSCs, progerin and its associated aging consequences are restored. In particular, directed differentiation of HGPS-iPSCs to SMCs leads to the appearance of premature senescent SMC phenotypes associated with vascular aging. Additionally, our studies identify DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNAPKcs) as a component of the progerin-containing protein complex. The absence of nuclear DNAPKcs correlates with premature as well as physiological aging. Since progerin also accumulates during physiological aging6,12,13, our results provide an in vitro iPSC-based model with an acceleration progerin accumulation to study the pathogenesis of human premature and physiological vascular aging.
