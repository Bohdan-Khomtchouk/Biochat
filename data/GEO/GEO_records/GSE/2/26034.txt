TITLE
Affymetrix SNP6.0 array data for different clinical outcomes of HBV infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious global public health problem. To identify susceptibility loci for disease progression of HBV infection, we performed this genome-wide association study using DNA pools of case and control constructed by progressed HBV carriers (acute liver failure, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma) and asymptomatic HBV carriers separately. Performing GWAS on pools of DNA samples is an effective strategy to reduce the costs of studies and pooling DNA has been shown to be an efficient method to select candidate susceptibility loci for follow-up by individual genotyping.

DESIGN
Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human Mapping SNP6.0 Arrays were performed for DNA pools, which were constructed by pooling 120 ng DNA from each participant. Four independent pools were created: case A was acute liver failure group (n = 86), case B was liver cirrhosis group (n = 88), case C was hepatocellular carcinoma group (n = 90) and case D was asymptomatic HBV carriers (n = 66) that was considered as control. Twelve chips (each pool was replicated in triplicate) were finished according to the manufacturer's instruction.
