TITLE
Expression data from cid14 delta and air1 delta strains

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of cid14 delta and air1 delta cells shows that efficient silencing of a few heterochromatic genes depends on Cid14 and/or Air1.

DESIGN
Gene expression in the mutants was compared to the parent wild-type strain. 2 biological replicates were performed for each strain.
