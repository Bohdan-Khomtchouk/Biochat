TITLE
Identification of Primary Gene Targets of TFAP2C in Hormone Responsive Breast Carcinoma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To develop a more complete characterization of TFAP2C target genes, ChIP-seq with anti-TFAP2C antibody and expression arrays with TFAP2C knock down were analyzed in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells.

DESIGN
To find TFAP2C binding sites
