TITLE
Expression data of pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids from young and aged Brown Norway rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Male fertility and testis function changes with age and so it was sought to determine if these changes are accompanied by changes in gene expression. A full genome microarray was used to determine if distinct pathways of genes were altered in expression in germ cells (pachytene spermatocytes or round spermatids) with age.

DESIGN
PACH: Testes from young (4 months) and aged (18 months) Brown Norway rats were subjected to a density gradient cell separation to isolate pachytene spermatocytes. RNA was isolated from these cells for hybridization on affymetrix miroarrays. ROU: Testes from young (4 months) and aged (18 months) Brown Norway rats were subjected to a density gradient cell separation to isolate round spermatids. RNA was isolated from these cells for hybridization on affymetrix miroarrays.
