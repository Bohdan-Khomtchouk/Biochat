TITLE
Expression data from PSARK::IPT and wildtype rice plants

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Transgenic rice plants expressing isopentenyltransferase (IPT), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in CK synthesis under the control of SARK, a maturation- and stress-inducible promoter. Increased CK production resulted in sink source alteration and enhanced drought tolerance of the transgenic plants.

DESIGN
Flag leaf samples from well-watered (control) and water-stressed (3 days of withholding water) plants were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix rice microarrays chip.
