TITLE
Gene upregulation by the ATCE1 transcription factor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ATCE1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the CREB3 subtype of the ATF/CREB transcription factor family.  In order to get an indication of the potential promoters ATCE1 targets, a nuclear form was expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts via transfection and upregulated genes were sought after. Keywords: Potential promoter targeting
