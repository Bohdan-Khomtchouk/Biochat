TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of vtc2, abi4-102 and the corresponding double mutant abi4 vtc2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The role of abscisic acid (ABA) signalling in the ascorbic acid (AA)-dependent control of plant growth and defence was determined using the vtc1 and vtc2 mutants, which have impaired ascorbic acid synthesis, and in the abi4 mutant that is impaired in ABA-signalling. ABA levels were increase in the mutants relative to the wild type (Col0). Like vtc1 the vtc2 mutants have a slow growth relative to Col0. However, the wild type phenotype is restored in the abi4vtc2 double mutant. Similarly, the sugar sensing phenotype of in the abi4 is reversed in the abi4vtc2 double mutant. The vtc1 and vtc2 leaf transcriptomes show up to 70 % homology with abi4. Of the transcripts that are altered in the mutants a relative to Col0, only a small number are reversed in the abi4vtc2 double mutants relative to either abi4 or vtc2. We conclude that AA controls growth via an ABA and abi4-dependent signalling pathway. The vtc and abi4 mutants have enhanced glutathione levels and common redox signalling pathways leading to similar gene expression patterns.

DESIGN
Rosettes of 42 days old plants were harvested and used to exctract RNA
