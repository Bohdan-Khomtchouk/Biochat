TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mechanosensitive genes using in vivo model of mouse carotid artery endothelium exposed to disturbed flow

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recently, we have shown that disturbed flow caused by partial ligation of mouse carotid artery rapidly induces endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis within two weeks.  To understand the molecular mechanisms by which disturbed flow induces atherosclerosis, we carried out genome-wide microarray study using endothelial RNAs isolated from the flow-disturbed left and the contralateral right common carotid artery (LCA and RCA) in C57BL/6 mice.

DESIGN
Total intimal RNAs were obtained from LCA and RCA at 12hr  and at 48hr post-ligation. Intimal RNAs from three LCAs or RCAs were pooled to obtain ~30ng total RNA.
