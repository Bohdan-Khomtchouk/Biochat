TITLE
Preoperative Administration of Donor-derived Human M regs to Kidney Transplant Recipients (Agilent RISET 2.0)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experiments in preclinical transplant models have indicated that preoperative administration of donor-derived M regs to transplant recipients may promote beneficial regulatory responses to a subsequent allograft. This contention is supported by results from the TAIC-I and â€“II clinical studies, which demonstrated that infusion of a crude cell preparation containing regulatory macrophages was both safe and could promote a state of donor-specific hyporesponsiveness. In an extension of this work, two patients were treated with donor-derived M regs prior to receiving a living-donor kidney transplant. Keywords: Classification of clinical samples

DESIGN
Whole blood samples of two patients collected at various time points before and after kidney transplantation before and after the administration of M regs were analyzed on a custom Agilent 8x15K 60mer oligonucleotide microarray encomprising 5069 probes in triplicates (GPL8136). The microarray is dedicated to transplantation research and was designed based on current literature and published and unpublished data provided by the RISET consortium. For the probe selection procedure we specially focused on the detection of multiple transcript variants of a gene, on optimized hybridization properties of the probes, and on the avoidance of crosshybridization.
