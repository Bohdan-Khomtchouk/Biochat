TITLE
Exon array analysis reveals neuroblastoma tumors have distinct alternative splicing patterns according to stage and MYCN amplification status

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset contains Human Exon 1.0 ST Array data from 47 neuroblastoma samples

DESIGN
In this study, we used exon array profiling to investigate global alternative splicing pattern of 47 neuroblastoma samples in stage 1 and stage 4 with normal or amplified MYCN copy number (stage 1-, 4- and 4+).
