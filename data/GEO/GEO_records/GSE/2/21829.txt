TITLE
Differential gene expression in adrenal medulla after cardiac pressure overload

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptom analysis of microdissect adrenal medulla after 8 weeks of cardiac pressure overload caused by transverse aortic constriction.

DESIGN
Comparative transcriptome analysis was determined using the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Six microarrays from microdissected adrenal medulla of mice were performed 8 weeks after transverse aortic constriction or sham operation.
