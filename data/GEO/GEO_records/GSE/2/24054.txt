TITLE
Expression data from wild-type FY4 and the PHO2-deletion strain

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The impact on mRNA expression of the transcription factors Bas1, Pho2, Gcn4 and Gcr2p  was investigated in the corresponding deletion strains during exponential growth in glucose minimal media batch cultures.
