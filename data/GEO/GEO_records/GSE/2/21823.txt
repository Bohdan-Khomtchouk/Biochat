TITLE
Nucleosome map of the IMR90 fibroblast cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We produced a map of nucleosome positions in IMR90 by sequencing the ends of MNase-digested chromatin fragments.

DESIGN
IMR90 cells were grown in culture, about 1E6 cells were isolated and digested using micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Mononucleosomes were gel-selected and fragment ends were sequenced using the Illumina GAIIx sequencing platform.
