TITLE
Expression data from stem samples taken from the base and the first internode of Arabidopsis wildtype and wox4-1 plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Stem samples of wildtype Columbia plants and the wox4-1 mutant (Gabi_462G01) were analyzed in order to draw a connection between general transcriptomic changes during interfascicular formation in the wildtype and WOX4-dependent gene regulation during this process. We used microarrays to identify factors downstream of WOX4 in the formation of the interfascicular cambium.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling, comparing wildtype Columbia and wox4-1 plants. RNA was extracted from 3 biological replicates per plant line and sample type (stem base, first internode), each consisting of a pool of 13-17 stem samples.
