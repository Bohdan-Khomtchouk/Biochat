TITLE
Glycosylation change in mouse CD8 T cells during development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Jameson's research focus is on development and regulation of lymphocytes, especially T cells. Recent work has suggested that differential glycosylation effects the sensitivity of the T cell receptors and its coreceptors, suggesting that regulation of glycosylation may be a critical element in controlling T cell development, survival and functional activity.
