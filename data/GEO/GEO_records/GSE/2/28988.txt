TITLE
Global transcriptional assessment of consecutive samples from patients with dengue infection with association to dengue virus IgG serostatus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole blood from patients with acute dengue infection (as determined with PCR) were assessed for global transcriptional changes during different stages of the disease with reference to dengue virus IgG status at study inclusion

DESIGN
Whole blood collected in PAX-gene tubes and extracted for total RNA
