TITLE
Effect of PITX2 knockdown on transcriptome of primary human trabecular meshwork cell cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes whose expressions in primary human trabecular meshwork (TM) cell cultures are affected by the transcription factor PITX2 and to identify genes that may have roles in glaucoma.  Expression profiles derived using microarrays were compared between TM control cells and cells treated with PITX2 siRNAs

DESIGN
TM1 and TM2 cells were cultured in 6 well plates were transfected with either of two PITX2 specific siRNAs or scrambled siRNA (as control). The scrambled siRNA treatment was performed in duplicate for each TM.  Forty eight hours after exposure to siRNAs, cells were harvested and RNA was extracted. Considering the two siRNAs for PITX2 transcription factor, the two scrambled siRNA treatments, and the two TM primary cultures, we performed 8 array hybridizations.
