TITLE
Optimized CD8 effector TL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analyses of naive, effector and memory CD8 TCRP1A lymphocytes expressing or not an active form of the transcription factor Stat5.

DESIGN
TCRP1A CD8 T lymphocytes were activated by their cognate Ag for 72h to induce their differentiation in effector T cells (TCRP1A eTL 72h: 4 replicates S1, S2, S3, S4). In some samples, an active form of Stat5 was introduced (TCRP1A Stat5ca eTL 72h: 2 replicates S9, S10).  These 72h activated T cells were either purified and analyzed directly (samples mentioned above) or injected in congeneic hosts and recovered more than 20 days later from the host spleen and lymph nodes: TCRP1A eTL > d20: 2 replicatesâ€“ S30, S32; TCRP1A Stat5ca eTL > d20: 4 replicates S11, S12, S13, S14). Naive TCRP1A CD8 T lymphocytes (TCRP1A-naive: 4 replicates S33, S34, S35, S36) are included as controls. TCRP1A CD8 T lymphocytes were activated by anti-CD3/CD28. After 24h, an active form of Stat5 was introduced in activated cells. Culture was continued for another 48h to induce their differentiation in effector T cells. These 72h activated T cells were either directly  injected in congeneic hosts and recovered more than 14 days later from the host spleen and lymph nodes: T-BetKO Stat5ca > d14: 3 replicates S39, S40, S41.
