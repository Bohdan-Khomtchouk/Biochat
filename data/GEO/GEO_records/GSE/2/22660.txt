TITLE
Expression data from Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to ivermectin

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We have investigated the transcriptomic response of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to ivermectin (IVM); an important anthelmintic for human and animal parasite control. The transcriptomic response of the mutant strain DA1316 avr-14(ad1302); avr-15(ad1250); glc-1(pk54), which is highly resistant to ivermectin due to null mutations in three glutamate-gated chloride channel subunits, was examined. Despite the resistant nature of this strain, pharyngeal pumping rate was decreased following 4 hrs exposure to 100ng/ml and 1μg/ml ivermectin resulting in significant change in the expression level of genes associated with a fasting response.

DESIGN
Matched cultures of synchronised C. elegans were grown to L4 stage on standard NGM plates with an OP50 bacterial lawn. The nematodes were then transferred to NGM plates containing 100ng/ml ivermectin, 1μg/ml ivermectin, or DMSO excipient only (control) for 4 hours. RNA was extracted from five biological replicates including controls for both the 100ng/ml ivermectin and 1μg/ml ivermectin experiments and hybridised to Affymetrix arrays.
