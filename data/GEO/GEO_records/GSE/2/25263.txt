TITLE
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination at birth induces robust recall responses at 9 months of age.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to compare recall responses to vaccine antigens at 3 months and 9 months of age in infants who were vaccinated at birth or at 1 month.

DESIGN
PBMC were obtained at 9 months of age from infants who were vaccinated at birth (n=25) or 1 month (n=25). The PBMC were cultured in the presence or absence of CRM197 antigen for 72 hours. At the termination of the cultures, total RNA was extracted from the PBMC. The RNA was pooled into groups of n=5 subjects per group, following by labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.
