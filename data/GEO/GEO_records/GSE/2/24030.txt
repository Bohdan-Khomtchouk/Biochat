TITLE
The Cohesin Complex Cooperates with Pluripotency Transcription Factors in the Maintenance of Embryonic Stem Cell Identity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cells run a self-renewal gene expression program, requiring the expression of certain transcription factors accompanied by a particular chromosome organization to maintain a balance between pluripotency and the capacity for rapid differentiation. However, how transcriptional regulation is linked to chromosome organization in ESCs remains enigmatic. Here we show that Cohesin exhibits a functional role in maintaining ESC identity through association with the pluripotency transcriptional network. ChIP-seq analyses of the cohesin subunit Rad21 reveal an ESC specific cohesin binding pattern that is characterized by a CTCF independent colocalization of cohesin with pluripotency related transcription factors. Upon ESC differentiation, these binding sites disappear and instead new CTCF independent Rad21 binding sites emerge, which are enriched for binding sites of transcription factors implicated in early differentiation. Furthermore, knock-down of cohesin subunits causes expression changes that are reminiscent of the depletion of key pluripotency transcription factors, demonstrating the functional relevance of the cohesin - pluripotency transcriptional network association. Finally, we show that Nanog physically interacts with the cohesin interacting proteins Stag1 and Wapl, further substantiating this association. Based on these findings we propose that a dynamic placement of cohesin by pluripotency transcription factors contributes to a chromosome organization supporting the ESC expression program.
