TITLE
Microarray analysis of chimeric CD4+CD28null and CD4+CD28+ T-cells in humanized mice.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The major goal of this experiment was to identify the overall changes in gene expression of human CD4+CD28 null T-cells that develop after repetitive [xeno] antigen stimulation, in comparison to normal CD4+CD28+ T-cells.  These cells were derived by adoptive transfer of human CD4 T-cells from a normal donor (all CD28+) into immunodeficient mice.
