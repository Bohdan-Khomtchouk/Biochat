TITLE
Identification of genetic targets of Hh signaling in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Paracrine Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulates growth and patterning in many Drosophila organs.  We mapped chromatin binding sites for Cubitus interruptus (Ci), the transcription factor that mediates outputs of Hh signal transduction, and we analyzed transcription profiles of control and mutant embryos to identify genes that are regulated by Hh.  Putative targets we identified include several Hh pathway components, most previously identified targets, and many targets that are novel.  Analysis of expression patterns of pathway components and target genes gave evidence of autocrine Hh signaling in the optic primordium of the embryo.  And, every Hh target we analyzed that is not a pathway component appeared to be regulated by Hh in a tissue-specific manner.  We present evidence that Hh-dependent tissue specificity is dependent upon transcription factors that are Hh-independent, suggesting that “pre-patterns” of transcription factors partner with Ci to make Hh-dependent gene expression position-specific.

DESIGN
Analysis of the expression profiles of loss of function mutantations in core components of the Hh signaling pathway. A total of 14 samples were analysed consisting of comparisons of hh-, ci-, smo-, ptc-, and Cim1-m4 (Activator) mis-expression embryos compared to wt sibling embryos.
