TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Staphylococcus aureus strain 1422 vs. Staphyloccus aureus strain 2798 to find a novel mechanism of methicillin resistance

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
The study aims to characterize a new isolate that lacks mecA but is nevertheless resistant to methicillin in order to find a novel mechanism of methicillin resistance.

DESIGN
Samples were hybridized on aminosilane coated slides with 70-mer oligos.
