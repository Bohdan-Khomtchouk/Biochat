TITLE
Periostin, a cell adhesion molecule, facilitates invasion in the tumor microenvironment and annotates a novel tumor invasive signature in esophageal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human squamous cell cancers are the most common epithelially derived malignancies. One example is esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which is associated with a high mortality rate that is related to a propensity for invasion and metastasis. We report that periostin, a highly expressed cell adhesion molecule, is a key component of a novel tumor invasive signature obtained from an organotypic culture model of engineered ESCC. This tumor invasive signature classifies with human ESCC microarrays, underscoring its utility in human cancer. Genetic modulation of periostin promotes tumor cell migration and invasion as revealed in gain of and loss of function experiments. Inhibition of EGFR signaling and restoration of wild-type p53 function were each found to attenuate periostin, suggesting interdependence of two common genetic alterations with periostin function. Our studies reveal periostin as an important mediator of ESCC tumor invasion and they indicate that organotypic (3D) culture can offer an important tool to discover novel biologic effectors in cancer.

DESIGN
Invading and non-invading genetically engineered human esophageal cells with hTERT and EGFR overexpression and p53 mutations were grown in organotypic culture. These invading and non-invading cells were excised using laser-capture microdissection. RNA was isolated and amplified for Affymetrix U133 microarrays. Subsequent microarray analysis & comparison with 2 independent cohorts of primary ESCC tumors revealed upregulation of periostin as gene with highest upregulation found in novel tumor invasive signature in esophageal cancer.
