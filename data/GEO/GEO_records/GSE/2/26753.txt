TITLE
Solexa sequencing of small RNAs in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat [proximal sciatic nerve]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We applied Solexa sequencing technology to identify rat microRNA genes in proximal sciatic nerve following sciatic nerve resection. Using Solexa sequencing, computational analysis and Q-PCR verification, 93 novel miRNAs in rats were discovered and identified, of which 42 novel miRNAs were first reported in proximal sciatic nerve of rat and 51 novel miRNAs were produced at days 1, 4, 7 and 14 after sciatic nerve resection. These data provide an important resource relating to the role and regulation of miRNAs for future studies relating to peripheral nerve injury and regeneration. Keywords: Small RNA sequencing

DESIGN
18-30 nt small RNAs from proximal sciatic nerve of 30 Thirty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were sequenced at one Solexa lane
