TITLE
Expression Data from Uveal Melanoma primary tumors.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A high percentage of uveal melanoma patients develop metastatic tumors that predominately occur in the liver. To identify genes associated with metastasis in this pathology, we studied 63 molecular profiles derived from gene expression microarrays performed from enuceated primary tumors. Metastasis free survival analysis was performed to obtain clinical and genomic variables associated to metastasis occurrence. We also compared within the 57 tumors with at least 36 months follow-up, 28 uveal melanoma from patients who developed liver metastases (meta1 group) with 29 tumors arising from patients without metastases (or later metastases, i.e. after 36 months) (meta0 group).

DESIGN
The transcriptome of 63 uveal melanoma from enucleation of untreated patients were analyzed using Affymetrix U133plus2 Arrays.
