TITLE
cRNA hybridizations of 10 Spring annual accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana under well-watered and mild soil drying

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
These data provide a basis for exploration of gene expression differences between physiologically diverse Spring annual accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. Recent studies have documented remarkable genetic variation among Arabidopsis thaliana accessions collected from diverse habitats and across its geographical range.  Of particular interest are accessions with putatively locally adapted phenotypes â€“ i.e., accessions with attributes that are likely adaptive under the climatic or habitat conditions of their sites of origin.  These genotypes are especially valuable as they may provide insight into the genetic basis of adaptive evolution as well as allow the discovery of genes of ecological importance.  Therefore we studied the physiology, genome content and gene expression of 18 physiologically diverse accessions. The gene expression studies were conducted under two levels of soil moisture and accompanied by physiological measurements to characterize early responses to soil moisture deficit.
