TITLE
Topoisomerase II binds nucleosome-free DNA and acts redundantly with Topoisomerase I to enhance recruitment of RNA Pol II in budding yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
DNA topoisomerases are known to promote transcription in prokaryotes by removing excessive DNA supercoils produced during elongation. However, it is unclear how topoisomerases in eukaryotes are recruited and function in the transcription pathway in the context of nucleosomes. To address this problem we present high-resolution genome wide maps of one of the major eukaryotic topoisomerases, Topoisomerase II (Top2) and nucleosomes in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our data indicate that at promoters Top2 binds primarily to DNA that is nucleosome free. However, while nucleosome loss enables Top2 occupancy the opposite is not the case and the loss of Top2 has little effect on nucleosome density. We also find that Top2 is involved in transcription. Not only is Top2 enriched at highly transcribed genes but Top2 is required redundantly with Top1 for optimal recruitment of RNA polymerase II at their promoters. These findings and the examination of candidate activated genes suggest that nucleosome loss induced by nucleosome remodeling factors during gene activation enable Top2 binding which in turn acts redundantly with Top1 to enhance recruitment of RNA polymerase II.

DESIGN
For Agilent Data: Top2, Pol2 and H3 were ChIP'd from yeast strains and normalized to input or to each other. For Affymetrix Data: Top2 and H3 were ChIP'd from yeast strains and normalized to input.
