TITLE
Ovarian Tumor Tissue Expression Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ovarian tumor tissues were obtained from patients with informed consent, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Swedish Hospital in Seattle.  Tissue acquisition, processing and storage were conducted by the Pacific Ovarian Cancer Research Consortium (POCRC) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The quality of tumor tissues, the percentage of cancer cells and the histological analysis of the tumors were determined via a centralized pathology review at the POCRC repository. All samples were distributed in a de-identified manner and cannot be traced back to patients.    The tumor tissues were disrupted in a Biospec Tissue-Tearor Model 985370-395 in the presence of TRIzol (Invitrogen) with a ratio of 10ml TRIzol per 50mg of tissue. Following an extraction step of 0.2 ml of Chloroform per 1ml of TRIzol, the upper aqueous phase was removed for RNA isolation.  The remaining inter-phase and the phenol phase was briefly stored in 4??C for DNA isolation. The upper aqueous phase was processed for total RNA according to Invitrogen protocol and further purified using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was isolated by back-extraction from the TRIzol inter-phase and the phenol phase as described on Ambion website (page 4). Detailed amplification and labeling protocols are available at the Brown lab website
