TITLE
Effect of Nrf2 deletion in postnatal lung development and BPD phenotype in newborn mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: Nrf2 is an essential cytoprotective transcription factor. However, association of Nrf2 in organ development and neonatal disease is rarely examined. Hyperoxia exposure to newborn rodents generates pulmonary phenotypes which resemble bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) of prematurity. Methods: To investigate the role of Nrf2 in lung maturation and BPD pathogenesis, Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2-/-) and wild-type (Nrf2+/+) neonates were exposed to air or hyperoxia (O2). Transcriptome analysis determined Nrf2-directed mechanisms in premature lung. Lung injury was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage analysis and histopathology. Results: In Nrf2-/- neonates, basal expression of cell cycle machinery, redox balance, and lipid/carbohydrate metabolism genes were suppressed while immunity genes were overexpressed compared to Nrf2+/+ pups. O2-induced mortality and pulmonary inflammation/injury were significantly higher in Nrf2-/- than in Nrf2+/+. Lung DNA lesion and oxidation were greater in Nrf2-/- than in Nrf2+/+, constitutively and after O2. Nrf2-dependent genes modulated cellular growth/proliferation, defense, immunity, and lipid metabolism against hyperoxia. Bioinformatic elucidation of Nrf2 binding motifs and augmented O2-induced inflammation in genetically deficient neonates validated Gpx2 and Marco as Nrf2 effectors. Conclusion: Overall, Nrf2 in underdeveloped lungs orchestrated cell cycle, morphogenesis, and immunity as well as cellular defense constitutively and under oxidant stress. Results provide putative molecular mechanisms of Nrf2-directed lung alveolarization and BPD of prematurity.

DESIGN
PARALLEL study design with 42 samples comparing 14 groups  of age (P1 to P4 corresponding to day 0 to day 3 animals),  gene, and exposure: (4 groups Nrf+/+ wild type P1-P4 air exposure)  (4 groups Nrf -/- knockout P1-P4 air exposure),  (3 groups  Nrf+/+ wild type P2-P4 with 100 percent O2 (hyperoxia exposure) and 3 groupsNrf -/- knockout P2-P4 with 100 percent O2 (hyperoxia exposure)) Biological replicates: 3 per group
