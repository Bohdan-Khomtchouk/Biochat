TITLE
Analysis of mRNA levels of GPCR and GPCR-related signaling proteins in the HEK293 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Measurements of mRNA levels for non-chemosensory GPCRs, G proteins and selected G protein targets.

DESIGN
HEK293 cell line, 4 replicates. Overall data set includes mRNA levels for ~24,000 genes.
