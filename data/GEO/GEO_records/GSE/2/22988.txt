TITLE
HapX positively and negatively regulates the transcriptional response to iron deprivation in Cryptococcus neoformans

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptional response of C. neoformans WT, cir1 mutant, hap3 mutant and hapX mutant to different iron sources.

DESIGN
The following experimental design was adopted for the study. Within each strain, each treatment pair (low-iron, +FeCl3, +Transferrin and +Hemin; 6 pairs) were hybridized to an array; and within each treatment, each strain (WT, hap3, hapX and cir1, 6 pairs) were hybridized to an array for a total of 48 microarrays. Each strain/treatment combination was labeled an equal number of times with Cy3 and Cy5 to ensure dye balance
