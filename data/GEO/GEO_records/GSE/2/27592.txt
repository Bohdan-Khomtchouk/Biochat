TITLE
Gene expression in F9 teratocarcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Esko's laboratory focuses on the structure, function, and biosynthesis of glycoproteins and proteoglycans. This laboratory also works on the design and synthesis of small molecule inhibitors of glycosylation. Gene expression in F9 teratocarcinoma cells: Study of the differential expression of glycosyltransferases, sulfotransferases and proteoglycan core proteins in F9 teratocarcinoma cells before and after differentiation with retinoic acid/theophylline/cAMP. Published data indicated that differentiation of the cells induces the synthesis of anticoagulant heparin-like compounds and a large increase in overall glycosaminoglycan synthesis.
