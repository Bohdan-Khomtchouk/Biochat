TITLE
Agricultural sterol biosynthesis inhibitor fungicides

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Resistance to agricultural fungicides in the field has created a need for discovering fungicides with new modes of action. DNA microarrays, because they provide information on expression of many genes simultaneously, could help to identify the modes of action. To begin an expression pattern database for agricultural fungicides, transcriptional patterns of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain S288C genes were analysed following 2-h treatments with I50 concentrations of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors commonly used against plant pathogenic fungi. Eight fungicides, representing three classes of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors, were tested. To compare gene expression in response to a fungicide with a completely different mode of action, a putative methionine biosynthesis inhibitor (MBI) was also tested. Expression patterns of ergosterol biosynthetic genes supported the roles of Class I and Class II inhibitors in affecting ergosterol biosynthesis, confirmed that the putative MBI did not affect ergosterol biosynthesis, and strongly suggested that in yeast, the Class III inhibitor did not affect ergosterol biosynthesis. The MBI affected transcription of three genes involved in methionine metabolism, whereas there were essentially no effects of ergosterol synthesis inhibitors on methionine metabolism genes. There were no consistent patterns in other up- or downregulated genes between fungicides. These results suggest that inspection of gene response patterns within a given pathway may serve as a useful first step in identifying possible modes of action of fungicides. agricultural sterol biosynthesis inhibitor fungicides.
