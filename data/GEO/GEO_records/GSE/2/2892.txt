TITLE
Global transcriptome analysis of mouse uterus during embryo implantation by SAGE

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to examine differential gene expression profile in mouse uterus on day 5 of pregnancy between implantation sites and inter-implantation sites. There are 104,520 tags sequenced and acquired, 51,306 for non-implantation site, and 53,214 for implantation site. Keywords: Implantation, Uterus, Differential gene expression,
