TITLE
Generation of Autologous Pluripotent Stem Cells from Adult Testis Biopsy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In regenerative medicine, histocompatibility of pluripotent stem cells is required to solve the problem of immunorejection after therapeutic transplantation. In this study, we show that autologous germline stem cells (GSCs), often called spermatogonial stem cells, could be derived by testis biopsy from individual mice and that GSCs subsequently could be dedifferentiated into autologous germline-derived pluripotent stem (gPS) cells. The establishment of GSCs by testicular biopsy in the mouse model can prove the principle of human clinical application to derive autologous GSCs to generate patient-specific pluripotent cells for regenerative medicine.

DESIGN
For transcriptome profiling, 400 ng of total DNA-free RNA was used as input for labelled cRNA synthesis (Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit - Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions (IVT: 12h). Quality-checked cRNA samples were hybridized as biological or technical duplicates for 18 h onto mouse-8 v2 expression BeadChips (Illumina), washed, stained, and scanned following guidelines and using materials / instrumentation supplied / suggested by the manufacturer 13 samples were analyzed, GSC1: Mouse Germ Stem Cells OG2, line 1 (1 replicate); GSC2: Mouse Germ Stem Cells OG2, line 2 (1 replicate); GSC3: Mouse Germ Stem Cells OG2, line 3 (1 replicate); GSCr1: Mouse Germ Stem Cells OG2-ROSA, line 1 (1 replicate); GSCr2: Mouse Germ Stem Cells OG2-ROSA, line 2 (2 replicate); GSCr3: Mouse Germ Stem Cells OG2-ROSA, line 3 (1 replicate); ESC:  Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (duplicate) gPS1: Mouse clonal germ Pluripotent Stem cells from OG2, line 1, (1 replicate); gPS2: Mouse clonal germ Pluripotent Stem cells from OG2, line 2, (1 replicate); gPS3: Mouse clonal germ Pluripotent Stem cells from OG2, line 3, (1 replicate); gPSr1: Mouse clonal germ Pluripotent Stem cells from OG2-ROSA, line 1, (1 replicate); gPSr2: Mouse clonal germ Pluripotent Stem cells from OG2-ROSA, line 2, (1 replicate); gPSr3: Mouse clonal germ Pluripotent Stem cells from OG2-ROSA, line 3, (1 replicate).
