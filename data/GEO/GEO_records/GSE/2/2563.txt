TITLE
Midlog Yeast Nucleosome Positioning

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To measure nucleosome positions on a genomic scale, we developed a high-throughput DNA microarray method to identify nucleosomal and linker DNA sequences based on susceptibility of linker DNA to micrococcal nuclease. Nucleosomal DNA was isolated and labeled with Cy3 fluorescent dye (green), and mixed with Cy5-labeled total genomic DNA (red). This mixture was hybridized to microarrays printed with overlapping 50mer oligonucleotide probes tiled across chromosomal regions of interest. Keywords = nucleosome Keywords = yeast Keywords = tiling microrray Keywords: repeat sample
