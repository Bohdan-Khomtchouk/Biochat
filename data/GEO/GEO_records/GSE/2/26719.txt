TITLE
Gene expression analysis of dendritic cells from normal or tumor bearing prostates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumors cause the induction or repression of many genes associated with inflammation. To investigate the up and down regulation of genes associated with immune stimulation or immune tolerance RNA was isolated from dendritic cells from normal or tumor bearing prostate for microarray analysis. Using the TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model and a fold change comparison system we identified genes that are associated with immune tolerance to be up-regulated and genes associated with immunity to be down regulated in tumor associated dendritic cells. Keywords: Comparative gene expression, prostate cancer, dendritic cells

DESIGN
Prostatic dendritic cells were isolated from 4 normal and 6 tumor bearing mice for comparison of gene expression.
