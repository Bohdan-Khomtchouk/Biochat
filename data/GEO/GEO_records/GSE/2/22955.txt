TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of time-dependent gene expression in SUM-225 cells treated with the HER-2-specific inhibitor CP724,714 for 45 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Results of blocking the HER-2 oncogene kinase function in SUM-225 cells by treatment with CP724,714 and measuring gene expression as a function of time provides information as to what genes are regulated by HER-2 in this breast cancer cell line.

DESIGN
SUM-225 cells were treated with the HER-2-specific small molecule kinase inhibitor CP724,714 for 45 hours.  Total RNA was collected every 3 hours from parallel cultures throughout the 45 hour duration of treatment and genome-wide analysis of expression was performed on RNA from each time point (total 16 time points, starting at 0 hours treatment).
