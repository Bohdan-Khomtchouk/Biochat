TITLE
Ath_Agilent_v1_Riechmann array expression profile apetala1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Comparion of gene expression profiles of wild-type and apetala1 inflorescences The gene expression profile of inflorescences of the floral homeotic mutant apetala1 was compared to wild-type inflorescences (Ler) using a whole-genome oligonucleotide array (Agilent, custom-commercial). Experiment was performed in triplicate.

DESIGN
This series contains the data for three replicate experiments performed with three sets of independent samples.  The combined ratio data results are available as a supplementary file on the Series record.
