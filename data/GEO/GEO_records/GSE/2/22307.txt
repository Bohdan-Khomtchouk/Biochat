TITLE
Expression data from mouse colon tissue response to DSS induction at day 0, 2, 4 and 6

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Temporal genome profiling of DSS colitis The DSS induced mouse colitis model is often used to emulate Ulcerative Colitis (UC) in order understand pathophysiological mechanism of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Given the progressive nature of IBD, colon tissue gene expression changes during the evolution of disease, and knowing the changes in gene expression profiles could indentify potential diagnostic markers or additional therapeutic targets for colitis. Therefore, we performed temporal genome expression profiling analysis using the Affymetrix genome wide microarray system to identify broad scale changes in gene expression associated with the development of colitis. Keywords: Expression time course of mouse colon tissue induced by 3% DSS.

DESIGN
C57BL/6J mice were given 3% DSS in the drinking water and tissues from individual cohorts were collected at days 0, 2, 4 and 6. Total RNA were extracted from the colon tissue and detected by Affymerix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
