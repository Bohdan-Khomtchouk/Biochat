TITLE
Expression data from MMTV-PDK1 transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of PDK1 on mammary tumorigenesis and its interaction with PPARdelta, was assessed. Transgenic mice were generated in which PDK1 was expressed in the mammary epithelium. We used microarrays to analyse global gene expression changes in MMTV-PDK1 transgenic mice versus wild-type mice and determine any differential responses to GW501516 treatment.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) from mammary gland tissue from nulliparious transgenic and wild-type mice maintained on normal rodent chow or a diet supplemented with GW501516 for 1 week.
