TITLE
To determine the global gene expression response in murine LPS-induced macrophages treated with a bromodomain inhibitor.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow-derived macrophages, Unstimulated DMSO Bone marrow-derived macrophages, Unstimulated + I-BET (GSK525762A) Bone marrow-derived macrophages, LPS 1h DMSO Bone marrow-derived macrophages, LPS 1h + I-BET (GSK525762A) Bone marrow-derived macrophages, LPS 2h DMSO Bone marrow-derived macrophages, LPS 2h + I-BET (GSK525762A) Bone marrow-derived macrophages, LPS 4h DMSO Bone marrow-derived macrophages, LPS 4h + I-BET (GSK525762A) LPS (100 ng/mL) was purchased from Sigma. Bone Marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were differentiated from C57BL/6 bone marrow using 5 ng/mL each of recombinant M-CSF and IL-3 (Peprotech) for 7 days as described (Jeffrey et al, Nature Immunology, 2006). 2 x10^6 BMDMs were treated with DMSO or 1  Î¼M of I-BET for 30 minutes before the addition of LPS (100 ng/mL) for 1, 2 or 4h. Unstimulated control samples were incubated with I-BET only for 1 hour. 500 ng of total RNA from 3 independent samples per group was used to prepare biotin-labeled RNA using Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems) and hybridized to Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression BeadChip kits. The chips were scanned using Illumina BeadArray Reader.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates and 4 timepoints
