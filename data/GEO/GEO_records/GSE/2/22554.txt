TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Sin3A and Sin3B binding in C2C12 myoblasts and differentiated myotubes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sin3A and Sin3B bind to distinct and overlapping target sites. Sin3 proteins bind to distinct sites in cycling myoblasts whereas there is a converge of Sin3A and Sin3B proteins to sites in differentiated myotubes. We identified a subset of Sin3 target genes involved in muscle differentiation and physiology and showed that conditional  ablation of Sin3 proteins in vivo in mouse results in sarcomere defects

DESIGN
Examination of Sin3A and Sin3B binding during myogenesis
