TITLE
Expression data from non-malignant fallopian tube epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to examine gene expression changes that may be present in the fallopian tube epithelium of morphologically normal BRCA1 mutation positive and negative subjects. Fallopian tube epithelia has been implicated as an early point of origin for serous carcninoma. By examining the early events present in the microenvironment of this tissue between BRCA1 mutation carriers and non-carriers, we hoped to elucidate mechanisms that may lead to the development of epithelial ovarian cancer.

DESIGN
Laser microcapture of samples from 12 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 12 non-mutation subjects was performed. Samples were further grouped according to menstrual cycle.
