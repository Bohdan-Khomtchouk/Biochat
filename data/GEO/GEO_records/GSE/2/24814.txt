TITLE
Role and function of STAT5 in BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the function of STAT5 in ALL, we isolated bone marrow cells from STAT5 fl/fl mice and transformed them with BCR-ABL1. In a second transduction the BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B cells were transformed either with CRE-GFP or empty vector control (GFP) and subjected to gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
Three days post transduction, total RNA of GFP positive sorted cells was extracted and subjected to gene expression analysis.
