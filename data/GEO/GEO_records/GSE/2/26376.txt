TITLE
Microarray profiling of monocytic differentiaion reveals miRNA-mRNA intrinsic correlation (miRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Since the expression profile of miRNAs is specific in different tissues or under different physiological conditions, the correlations between miRNAs and mRNAs could vary under different biological circumstances. This is a study also used expression profiles of miRNA and mRNA during monocytic differentiation to explore the correlations between the expression levels of miRNAs and mRNA, either negative or positive.
