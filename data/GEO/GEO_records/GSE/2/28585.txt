TITLE
Dynamic Chromatin Localization of Sirt6 Shapes Stress- and Aging- Related Transcriptional Networks (Illumina)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sirtuins (Sirt) are a family of enzymes that modify chromatin and other proteins to affect gene activity. Loss of Sirt6 leads to a progeria-like phenotype in mice, but the target of SIRT6 action has been elusive. Here we show that Sirt6 binds to thousands of gene promoters in a stress-inducible fashion, guided by the stress-responsive transcription factor NF-ÎºB. Chromatin profiling by ChIP-chip analysis of Sirt6 and NF-KB component RelA combined with expression array data of wildtype, Sirt6 knockout and Sirt6 RelA double knockout cells demonstrates that RelA recruits Sirt6 to NF-KB targets in response to TNF-a induction and that many of these targets are important for senescence and aging.

DESIGN
comparison of wild type,  Sirt6-/- and Sirt6-/- RelA-/- MEF cells
