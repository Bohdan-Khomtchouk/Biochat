TITLE
Identification of genes differentially expressed between control and EHF siRNA transfected HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we found that EHF allowed colon tumor cells to escape p53-mediated apoptosis.We performed microarray analysis to find the target genes of EHF.

DESIGN
A colorecal cancer cell line HCT116 was transfected with an siRNA targeting EHF or negative control.
