TITLE
Affymetrix SNP6.0 on Ollier disease-related tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mutations in the PTH1R gene were reported but these mutations are limited to a small subgroup of patients. The etiology of Ollier disease is unknown. We therefore undertook genome-wide copy number and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays on 37 tumors of 28 Ollier patients in combination with expression array using Illumina Beadarray v3.0 for 7 tumors of 6 patients. We used Affymetrix SNP 6.0 to find out LOH and copy number alterations in Ollier tumors.

DESIGN
To understand the genetic mechanism behind the development of enchondroma, we mainly focus on enchondromas and found alterations were validated. We used 14 enchondromas and 23 chondrosarcomas of 28 Ollier patients. We also used 30 controls (blood, saliva or frozen tissue). As controls, normal DNA derived from fresh frozen muscle tissue (n=3), peripheral blood lymphocytes (n=4) or saliva (n=4) was available for 11 Ollier patients and 3 patients with unrelated bone diseases. We used blood lymphocyte DNA from 12 healthy controls and 1 HapMap sample. We also isolated DNA from saliva for 3 of these controls to validate the use of saliva DNA in this study.
