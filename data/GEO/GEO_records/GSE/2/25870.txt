TITLE
Human Beta-Defensin 3 attenuates the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS at 1 hour

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examine the global effect of hBD3 on transcription in TLR4-stimulated macrophages and for the first time show that hBD3 inhibits the transcription of critical pro-inflammatory genes. Among the repressed genes we detect significant enrichment of groups involved in the positive regulation of NFkappaB including components of Toll-like receptor signaling pathways.

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived macrophages from 3 separate mice were used for each treatment condition. ie macrophages from 3 mice were left untreated, macrophages from 3 mice were treated with LPS, macrophages from 3 mice were treated with LPS and hBD3, macrophages from 3 mice were treated with hBD3. We examined the differences in gene expression between each treatment group.
