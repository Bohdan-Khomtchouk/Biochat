TITLE
Expression data from genetically modified HMLE human mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to determine relative global gene expression changes upon introduction of EMT-inducing or control vectors.

DESIGN
Experimentally immortalized HMLE breast epithelial cells were retrovirally transduced in culture with  vectors encoding EMT-inducing genes or control vectors. There were three biologic replicates for each genetic perturbation condition. After treatment, the cells  were selected and expanded, after which total RNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis.
