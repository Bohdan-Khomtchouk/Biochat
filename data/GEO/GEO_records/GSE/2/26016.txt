TITLE
Expression profiling of the Staphylococcus aureus GraSR regulon

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus NCTC 8325

SUMMARY
The GraS/GraR two-component system has been shown to control cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance in the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. We identified a highly conserved ten base pair palindromic sequence (5’ ACAAATTTGT 3’) located upstream from GraR-regulated genes (mprF and the dltA and vraFG operons), which we show to be essential for transcriptional regulation by GraR and induction in response to colistin, a bacterial CAMP, suggesting it is the likely GraR binding site. Genome-based predictions and transcriptome analysis revealed several novel GraR target genes.
