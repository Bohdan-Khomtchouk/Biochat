TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis in kyp and cmt3 mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Investigation of genome-wide expression in the mutant of histone H3K9 methyltransferase KRYPTONITE (KYP) or DNA methyltransferase CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) in Arabidopsis. These mutants showed decrease in H3K9 methylation and DNA methylation levels, and transcriptional activation at transposons and repeats. Using NimbleGen DNA microarray, global pattern of expression of genes and transposons were examined in these mutants.

DESIGN
Total RNA from leaves was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) and was treated with DNase I (TAKARA). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript Double Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and oligo (dT)20 primer. cDNA was labeled by Cy3, hybridized to 4 x 72k array, and scanned according to manufacture's instructions (www.nimblegen.com).
