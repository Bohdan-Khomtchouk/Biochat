TITLE
Differential gene expression in CadA strain vs D398A control strain upon 1 μM cadmium treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression in W303-1A strain expressing CadA relative to the W303-1A strain expressing an inactive form of CadA (D398A). The two strains grown to exponential were treated for 1h with 1uM cadmium.

DESIGN
W303-1A cells expressing CadA or D398A were grown to exponential phase (OD600 = 0.4) in SD minimal medium + all amino acids plus adenine at 30°C. Cells were treated with 1 µM cadmium and harvested after 1h incubation. Total RNA extraction and microarray hybridization were performed as previously described (Laferte et al., 2006).
