TITLE
High-resolution analysis of parent-of-origin-allelic expression in Arabidopsis seeds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report the identification of parent-of-origin specific gene expression in Arabidopsis seeds. F1 hybrid seeds were generated by reciprocally crossing  Arabidopsis accessions Col-0 and Bur-0. Seeds were harvested at 4 DAP and total RNA was isolated and analyzed by deep sequencing.

DESIGN
Overall identification of parent-of-origin-allelic expression by analysis of SNP distribution
