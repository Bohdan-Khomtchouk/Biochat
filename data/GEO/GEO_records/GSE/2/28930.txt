TITLE
Glycogene expression in control and tumor-bearing mouse muscles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have observed aberrant glycosylation in membrane proteins in mouse skeletal muscles undergoing cachexia ( muscle wasting) in a tumor bearing condition. Since multiple proteins were glycosylated in this tumor state, we are interested in looking at the glycochip array that includes glycosyltransferases to observe any possible induction of these transferases.

DESIGN
RNA from control (PBS treated) and tumor bearing mouse muscles, at 12 and 22 days, was isolated and prepared in triplicate. RNA was labeled and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 array.  Gene expression patterns were analyzed with special interest on possible induction of these transferases.
