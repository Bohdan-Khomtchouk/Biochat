TITLE
Metastasis and Survival of Breast Cancer Stem Cells Mediated by Cytoskeleton Remodeling and PI3K/mTOR Signaling transcription factors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cancer metastasis is a fetal problem that claims life of over 90% of cancer patients. It is hypothesized that cancer stem cells (CSCs) mediate cancer metastasis and such cells are often resistant to chemotherapy. Studying BRCA1 associated cancers, we found that CSCs form fillopodia and protrusions enriching for active forms of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins and they have a much higher potential to metastasize than non-CSCs. Microarray analysis indicated that many pathways related to cell adhesion, extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton were differentially regulated in CSCs. Although inhibition of cytoskeleton remodeling by cisplatin treatment retarded CSC motility and cancer metastasis, drug resistant cancers eventually emerge containing markedly increased number of CSCs. This event is at least partially attributed to the activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling, and can be significantly inhibited by the treatment of rapamycin. These results provide strong evidence that cytoskeletal rearrangement and PI3K/mTOR signaling play a distinct role in mediating CSC mobility and viability, and blocking of both pathways in CSCs synergistically inhibits primary and metastatic cancer growth in BRCA1 associated tumors.

DESIGN
The sorted subpopulations based upon CD24, CD29 expression were used in the microarray analysis that was performed with 3 independent biologic sample sets.
