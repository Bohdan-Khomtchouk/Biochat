TITLE
Pitx1 Haploinsufficiency Causes Clubfoot in Humans and Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes regulated by Pitx1 during early hindlimb development, we compared gene expression differences between hindlimb buds from E12.5 Pitx1+/+ and Pitx1-/- mice on the Illumina MouseRef-8 expression Bead Chip.  Genes involved in muscle development GeneGO processes were highly enriched in our dataset, specifically in down-regulated genes. This data is consistent with the reduced muscle volumes that were observed in the clubfoot limbs of our adult mice.

DESIGN
Hindlimb buds were collected from Pitx1+/- mated mice at embryonic day E12.5 and genotypes were determined by PCR of DNA isolated from tails.
