TITLE
Susceptibility of neoplastic transformation of human dental pulp stem cells DPSC in hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neoplastic transformation of DPSC cultured under Hypoxia  versus normoxia. Molecular characterization of cell markers associated with tumorigenicity.

DESIGN
DPSC array CGH profiles of experimental (HX48h and HX72h) and reference (NX48 and NX72h) genomic DNA samples
