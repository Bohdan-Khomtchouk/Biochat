TITLE
Expression data from wild-type and AtERF73/HRE1 knock-down line under hypoxia in Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To mimic natural flooding conditions, we have adopted an “open system” treatment, in which only roots are subjected to hypoxia treatment.  Using microarray analysis, we identified a number of AP2/ERF genes in Arabidopsis that are induced at different stages of hypoxia treatment. we performed microarray analysis to compare gene expression profiles of wild-type and AtERF73/HRE1-RNAi20 upon normaxic or hypoxic condition, in which AtERF73/HRE1 expression was severely knocked down.
