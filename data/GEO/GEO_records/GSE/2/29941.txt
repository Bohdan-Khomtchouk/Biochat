TITLE
Microarray data from pre-germinated seeds and hypoxia-treated seedlings of Arabidopsis prt6-1 and ate1 ate2 mutants of the N-end rule pathway of targeted proteolysis pathway

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study analyzes transcriptome profiles in pre-germinated seeds and hypoxia-treated seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (Col-0) and homozygous mutants (prt6-1 and ate1 ate2). This dataset includes CEL files, RMA signal values and MAS5 P/M/A calls. For pre-germinated seeds, seeds imbibed for 24 h were used for total RNA extraction. For hypoxia treatment, 7-d-old seedlings were incubated in a hypoxia chamber for 2 h and the entire seedling was subjected to RNA extraction. Quantitative profiling of cellular mRNAs was accomplished with the Affymetrix ATH1 platform. Changes in the transcriptome during early seed germination stage and in response to hypoxia in seedlings were evaluated. The data led to identification of mRNAs with abundance regulated by PRT6 and ATE1 / ATE2, which are essential components for the N-end rule pathway of targeted proteolysis (NERP). A combination of genetic, biochemical and molecular analyses reveal that NERP coordinates the stability of key ethylene responsive factor (ERF) family transcription factors, which regulate expression of core hypoxia response genes and tolerance to low oxygen stress. This indicates that the NERP functions as a homeostatic sensor of low oxygen in plants.

DESIGN
Pre-germinated seeds; 2 genotypes (Col-0 and prt6-1) x 3 independent biological replicate experiments: Hypoxia treated seedlings; 3 genotypes (Col-0, prt6-1, and ate1 ate2) x 2 treatments (2h aerobic and 2h hypoxia) x 2 independent biological replicate experiments.
