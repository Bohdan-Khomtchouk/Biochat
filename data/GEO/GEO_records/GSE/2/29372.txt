TITLE
gene profiling of turnip crinkle virus (tcv) sirna-Gene profiling of Turnip Crinkle Virus (TCV) siRNA in A.thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs10-05_tcv - gene profiling of turnip crinkle virus (tcv) sirna - 1. What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of viral siRNA in A.thaliana? 2. There are also differentially regulated during an evolution and a fitness process? - This is a plant evolution project on TCV in which, the biological questions are: 1. What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in Col0 and dcl234 mutant in wt conditions? 2. What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of viral siRNA in Col0 and dcl234 mutant? 3. There are also differentially regulated between the plant generations 1 (G1) and 11 (G11)? 4. What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of viral siRNA after fitness experiment?

DESIGN
24 dye-swap - gene knock out,treated vs untreated comparison
