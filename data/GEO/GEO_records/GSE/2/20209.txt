TITLE
Interleukin-16-knock-out bone-marrow derived macrophages response to the Whipple's disease agent, Tropheryma whipplei

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify differently expressed genes following infection of interleukin-16-knock-out bone-marrow derived macrophages with T. whipplei. Macrophages were infected with T. whipplei (MOI 50:1) for 6 hours and a signature was identified that distinguished between infected and control samples. Expression of several genes from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming the predicted macrophage response pattern.

DESIGN
Gene expression in macrophages was measured at 6 hours after stimulation  Three independent experiments were performed.
