TITLE
Gene expression profiles of caseous human pulmonary TB granulomas derived from TB patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Most individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis can control the infection by forming and maintaining TB granulomas at the local infection foci.  However, when the chronic infection (also known as latency) becomes active, the caseous center of TB granuloma enlarges, and it liquefies and cavitates, ultimately releasing bacilli into airway.  Deciphering how genes are regulated within TB granulomas will help to understand the granuloma biology.  Therefore, we performed genome-wide microarray on caseous human pulmonary TB granulomas and compared with normal lung tissues.

DESIGN
Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was used to dissect out caseous granulomas from TB patients' lung tissues, excluding uninvolved areas.  Total RNA were isolated from LCM-derived materials and used for microarray.  As a control, parenchyma from normal lung tissues was prepared in the same manner as caseous granulomas. Sample GSM501252, Caseum 2-C, is missing a CEL file.
