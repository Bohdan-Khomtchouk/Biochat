TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Sarcophaga crassipalpis pupal diapause

ORGANISM
Sarcophaga crassipalpis

SUMMARY
Gene expression microarray exprement comparing differential expression between: 1) Early Diapause (ED), 2) Late Diapause (LD), 3) Non-Diapause (ND), 4) Hexane-induced diapause break (HEX).

DESIGN
Four phenotypes (ED,ND,LD,HEX), four replicate pools of four individuals (four individuals in each replicate) in each phenotype, four competitve hybs comparing each phenotype to every other phenotype.
