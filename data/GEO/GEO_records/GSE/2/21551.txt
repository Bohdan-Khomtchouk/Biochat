SUMMARY
B-methylthiolation of the Escherichia coli Ribosomal Protein S12 Regulates Anaerobic Gene Expression. B-methylthiolation is a unique post-translational modification (PTM) that maps to a conserved Asp 88 of the bacterial ribosomal protein S12.  This modification is phylogenetically conserved in several bacteria yet has not been identified on other proteins.
