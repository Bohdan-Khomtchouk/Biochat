TITLE
Radiation responses in peripheral white blood cells of smokers and non-smokers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding the possible impact of potential confounding factors is necessary for any approach to radiation biodosimetry.  Potential confounding factors have not been fully addressed for gene expression-based biodosimetry approaches, such as we are developing.  To begin addressing this need, we have used an ex vivo irradiated peripheral blood cell model to investigate the potential effect of smoking on the global radiation gene expression response, and looked for genes that respond to radiation differently in smokers and non-smokers, and also in males and females. The results indicate that only a small number of genes may be significantly confounded by either factor, supporting the idea of developing peripheral blood gene expression strategies for radiation biodosimetry.
