TITLE
Chip-chip from C. glutamicum wild type expressing GlxR tagged with Strep Tag II and cyaB deletion strain expressing GlxR tagged with Strep Tag II.

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum

SUMMARY
Corynebacterium glutamicum GlxR is a homolog of the cAMP receptor protein. Although over 200 GlxR binding sites in the C. glutamicum genome are predicted in silico, studies on the GlxR physiological function have been hindered by the severe growth defects of a glxR mutant. This study comprehensively identified the GlxR regulon by chromatin immunoprecipitation in conjunction with microarray (ChIP-chip) analyses. In total, 209 regions were detected as in vivo GlxR binding sites. Moreover, ChIP-chip analyses showed that GlxR was still able to interact with its target sites in a deletion mutant of cyaB, the sole adenylate cyclase gene in the genome, even though binding affinity was markedly decreased.

DESIGN
To identify the direct GlxR targets, we immunoprecipitated DNA from a strain expressing a Strep-tag II-tagged GlxR-protein using an anti-Strep-tag II antibody. To investigate effect of depletion of cAMP by deletion of the cyaB gene, which encodes the sole adenylate cyclase in C. glutamicum, on GlxR binding in vivo, we immunoprecipitated DNA from a cyaB deletion strain expressing a Strep-tag II-tagged GlxR-protein using an anti-Strep-tag II antibody. Three or more independent biological replicates were generated in both cases.
