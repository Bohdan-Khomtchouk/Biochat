TITLE
Sequencing-based approaches reveal low ambient temperature-responsive and tissue-specific microRNAs in Phalaenopsis orchid

ORGANISM
Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana

SUMMARY
We performed four small RNA sequencing for identification and characterization of microRNAs in Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana. By comparing the low temperature-treated group with treated group, we concluded four miRNAs - miR156, miR162, miR528 and miR535 -  as low temperature-induced miRNAs. In addition, tissue-specific expression of these miRNAs was investigated. The files contain the miRNAs analysis results in each group.

DESIGN
Examination of low temperature-treated leaves and two other organs of Phalaenopsis orchid
