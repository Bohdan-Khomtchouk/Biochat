TITLE
Mock or latently infected KSHV cells (BCBL, SLK and HFF)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
[original title] Mock or latently infected KSHV cells (BCBL, SLK and HFF) vs common reference (mixture of RNA from both infected and uninfected cells). Expression profiling of latently infected cells using a custom tiling microarray. SLK and HFF cells were infected and selected for rKSHV.219.  Mock infected SLK and HFF cells served as controls for each of these two stably infected cells, respectively.  BJAB cells served as uninfected controls for the BCBL-1 cells.  Biological replicates were harvested and analyzed.
