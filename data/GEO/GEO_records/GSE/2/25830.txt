TITLE
TTF-1-induced ROR1 is required to sustain EGFR survival signaling in lung adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer death. We and others previously identified TTF-1, a lineage-specific transcription factor required for branching morphogenesis and physiological lung functions, as a lineage-survival oncogene in lung adenocarcinoma. However, how TTF-1 mediates survival signals remains elusive. Here we show that TTF-1 induces receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1), which in turn mediates TTF-1 survival signaling in lung adenocarcinoma. Inhibition of ROR1 impaired prosurvival signaling through the PI3K-AKT pathway and induced nuclear accumulation of FOXO1. These were found to be imposed, at least in part, through PTEN inactivation via c-Src, while ROR1 was shown to physically interact with and phosphorylate c-Src. ROR1 inhibition also elicited marked p38 activation, provoking ill-balance between prosurvival and proapoptotic signaling, and consequential “oncogenic shock.” In addition, we found that ROR1 is crucially involved in EGFR- and MET-mediated prosurvival signaling. ROR1 knockdown effectively induced apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with acquired EGFR TKI resistance conferred by a secondary T790M EGFR mutation, or HGF-elicited MET signaling and resultant switching of the addicted receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Taken together, our findings indicate that ROR1 RTK is a very promising molecular target for development of a novel therapeutic means to treat this hard-to-cure cancer.
