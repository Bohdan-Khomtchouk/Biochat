TITLE
microRNA profiles of immune cells and their exosomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of exosomal miRNAs vs the miRNAs of their respective donor cells.

DESIGN
To determine the miRNA repertoires of exosomes secreted by immune cells, we isolated exosomes from cell supernatants of the Raji B cell line, the Jurkat-derived J77 T cell line, and primary dendritic cells (DCs) derived from human monocytes. Exosomes were isolated by a series of microfiltration and ultracentrifugation steps
