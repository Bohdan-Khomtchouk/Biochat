TITLE
Mx-Cre mediated deletion of SRF in murine hematopoietic LSK (Lin-Sca1+c-Kit+) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hematopoietic LSK(Lin-Sca1+c-Kit+) cells lacking the Serum response factor (SRF) gene. Results provide insight into the role of SRF in regulating genetic programs important for hematopoietic stem cell development
