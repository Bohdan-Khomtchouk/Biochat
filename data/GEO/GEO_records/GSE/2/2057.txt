TITLE
Gene expression profiling and localization of Hoechst-effluxing CD45- and CD45+ cells in the Embryonic Mouse Lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Side population (SP) cells are highly enriched in stem and progenitor cells. CD45+and CD45- SP cells were found at all developmental lung stages with the highest frequency of cells present at embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5), In order to clarify the role of these cells in lung development, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to evaluate their gene expression profiles. To do this, oligonucleotide gene arrays were performed in triplicate on RNA derived from CD45+ and CD45-SP cells,  and CD45+ and CD45- non-SP populations (main population; MP)  isolated from the E17.5 lung. Keywords: parallel sample
