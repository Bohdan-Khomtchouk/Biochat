TITLE
Effects of low and high doses of bisphenol A on mouse liver transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in the plastic industry as the monomer of polycarbonates and epoxy resins. Heat and changes in pH conditions lead to its leakage from the plastics in which it is incorporated. This largely contributes to the widespread exposure of the general population to this environmental contaminant. The exposure levels in humans are likely below the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI: 50 µg/kg/day) and well below the No Observable Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL: 5000 µg/kg/day) defined from reprotoxicity studies. However, several studies suggest that BPA could induce deleterious effects specifically at low, environmentally relevant, doses. BPA has been described as an endocrine disruptor with estrogenic activity. Recently, it has been shown that BPA exposure has an impact on metabolic functions including stimulation of adipogenesis and of insulin production by the pancreas. Here, we investigated the effects of oral exposure to low (TDI) and high (NOAEL) doses of BPA on mouse liver transcriptome.

DESIGN
Liver gene expression was measured from CD-1 mice (6 mice/group) exposed for 28 days to bisphenol A at doses 0 (controls), 50 (TDI or low dose) or 5000 µg/kg/day (NOAEL or high dose) via food contamination.
