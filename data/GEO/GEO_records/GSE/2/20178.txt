TITLE
Gene expression profile of oxidative stress-inducible genes of murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify a candidate gene that potentially participates in oxidative stress-induced tissue repair,  we have employed whole-genome microarray expression profiling.

DESIGN
Oxidative stress-induced gene expression in MEFs was measured at 2 and 4 hours after exposure to doses of 1 mM of H2O2 compared to untreated MEFs.  Two independent experiments were performed at each time point (0, 2, or 4 hours).
