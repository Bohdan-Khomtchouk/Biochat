TITLE
Expression data comparing Huh7 cells transduced with shRNA CD24 (knockdown) or non-target control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify CD24 signaling pathway Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus GeneChip 2.0

DESIGN
shRNA CD24 (knockdown) or non-target control (NTC) was stably transduced into Huh7 HCC cells by lentiviral approach
