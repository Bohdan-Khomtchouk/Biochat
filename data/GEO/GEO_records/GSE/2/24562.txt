TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by XOct-25 overexpression in Xenopus ectoderm

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
The Xenopus POU class V transcription factor XOct-25 has been shown to inhibit BMP-dependent epidermal differentiation and promote neural induction in the ectoderm during early embryogenesis.  In order to identify genes that act downstream of XOct-25, transcriptional profile of Xenopus ectodermal cells overexpressing XOct-25 was compared with control cells by using a DNA microarray method.
