TITLE
Human Breast Cells: Control vs. TRIM29 cDNA- or TRIM29 shRNA-transfected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human normal-like breast cells MCF10A comparing control MCF10A cells transfected with a pLenti6/BLOCK-iT™-DEST vector with MCF10A cells transfected with a pLenti6/BLOCK-iT™-DEST vector containing TRIM29 shRNA targeting nucleotides 1265–1285 of the TRIM29 open reading frame (ORF, NM_012101). Transcriptional profiling of human breast cancer cells MCF7 comparing control MCF7 cells transfected with a pLenti6.2/N-LumioTM/V5-DEST vector with MCF7 cells transfected with a pLenti6.2/N-LumioTM/V5-DEST vector containing TRIM29 full-length cDNA (ORF, NM_012101).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MCF10A-vector control vs. MCF10A-TRIM29 shRNA cells; MCF7-vector control vs. MCF7-TRIM29 cells.
