TITLE
Laser-capture microdissected invasive micropapillary carcinomas of the breast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes in laser-capture microdissected (LCM) invasive mammary carcinomas (IMCs).

DESIGN
Invasive mammary carcinoma of the breast surgical resection specimens were laser capture microdissected for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.
