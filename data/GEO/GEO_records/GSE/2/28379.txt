TITLE
Gene expression profiles of familial Alzheimer's disease with presenilin 2 mutation patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established two clones of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with the presenilin 2 mutation, N141 (PS2-1 iPSC and PS2-2 iPSC) by retroviral transduction of primary human fibroblasts. To show the similarity among  201B7 iPSC, PD01-25 iPSC(Sporadic Parkinson's disease patient derived iPSC), PS2-1 iPSC, PS2-2 iPSC, this experiment was designed.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated  201B7 iPSC, PD01-25 iPSC, PS2-1 iPSC and PS2-2 iPSC were collected. Then, they were applied in this experiment.
