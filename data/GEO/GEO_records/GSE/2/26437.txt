TITLE
A combined genetic and genomic approach uncovers molecular basis of wine yeast fermentation traits

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Industrial wine yeast strains possess specific abilities to ferment under stressing conditions and give a suitable aromatic outcome. Although the fermentations properties of Saccharomyces cervisiae wine yeasts are well documented little is known on the genetic basis underlying the fermentation traits. Besides, although strain differences in gene expression has been reported, their relationships with gene expression variations and fermentation phenotypic variations is unknown. To both identify the genetic basis of fermentation traits and get insight on their relationships with gene expression variations, we combined fermentation traits QTL mapping and expression profiling in a segregating population from a cross between a wine yeast derivative and a laboratory strain.
