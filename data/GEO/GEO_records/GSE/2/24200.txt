TITLE
Effect of Supplementing Linseed in the Transition Period on Mammary Gland Tissue of dairy Cows

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine the effects of linseed dietary supplementation on gene expression in the mammary gland of grazing dairy cows. Milk composition and gene expression in the mammary gland tissue were evaluated in dairy cows supplemented with linseed. The linseed supplementation improves the health and nutrition quality aspects of dairy milk, but also affects the gene networks expression signature associated with cellular growth and proliferation, cell-death, signalling, nutrient metabolism, and immune response, and in turn, the mammary gland integrity and health.

DESIGN
The experiment was carried out in a complete randomized blocked designed structure comprising 14 Holstein-Friesian cows (6 second parity, 2 third parity and 6 older cows), selected from a 550-cow herd. Cows were paired in 7 blocks on the basis of similarity in parity (second parity, third parity and older cows), expected date of calving, and milk performance in the previous lactation (in order of priority). Cows within each block were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups, “Omega” or “Control”. The dietary Omega treatment consisted of a basal diet supplemented with a concentrate-mixture including linseed on a dry matter (DM) basis, whereas cows in treatment group Control were supplemented with a concentrate mixture without linseed. Linseed was chosen because it is rich in c9,c12,c15-18:3 (ALA). Concentrate mixtures were fed with a concentrate dispenser. Experimental treatments started 3 weeks before the expected calving date (wk -3) and lasted until 6 weeks after calving (wk 6).
