TITLE
Transcriptome Signatures of Sezary Cells from Patients and Cultured Hut 78, Hut 102 and Jurkat Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparative transcriptome profiles of patient-derived Sezary cells and cultured Sezary cell line (Hut78) mycosis fungoides cell line (Hut 102) and non-Sezary T cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat) relative to benign CD4+ T cells from individuals with no T cell malignancy. There are three goals. The first and primary goal is to establish a list of genes with differential expression between Sezary cells and the benign CD4+ T cell counter part from individuals without Sezary syndrome.  A secondary goal is to examine if these differentially expresses genes in clinical samples of Sezary cells are preserved in Hut78 and Hut102 cells, which are the two most frequently used experimental cell models of Sezary cells in the research community. The third goal is to examine if these Sezary cell specific genes are also present in a non-Sezary T cell malignancy, such as Jurkat cells, which is derived from a non-Sezary cell T cell leukemia patient.

DESIGN
Two color experiment, 6 biological replicates (6 unique patients) with Sezary syndrome, 1 Hut78 cell,1 Hut102 cell and 1 Jurkat cell lines as the experimental samples, each compared with a distinct individual with no T cell malignancy of the skin or the blood.
