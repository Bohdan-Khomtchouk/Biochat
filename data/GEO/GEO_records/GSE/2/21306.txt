TITLE
Expression data from RECK-overexpressing HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RECK, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein, inhibits the enzymatic activities of some matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), thereby suppressing tumor cell metastasis; however, the detailed mechanism is still obscure. In this study, we compared the gene expression profiles between mock- and RECK-transfected HT1080 cells.

DESIGN
Three established cell lines were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays: (1) mock-transfected HT1080 cells, designated as HT1080-Zeo, (2) RECK-overexpressing HT1080 cells, designated as HT1080-RECK, and (3) RECK/4NQ-overexpressing HT1080 cells (in which four N-glycosylation asparagine residues of RECK (Asn86, Asn200, Asn297, and Asn352) were replaced with glutamine residues), designated as HT1080-RECK/4NQ.
