TITLE
Prognostic Significance and Gene Expression Profiles of p53 Mutations in Microsatellite Stable Stage III Colorectal Adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clinical Significance: Understanding the differences in colorectal cancer (CRC) aggressiveness and clinical outcomes in relation to tumor stage and different molecular subsets is at most important for designing treatment regimens. However, molecular signatures for specific phenotypic subsets that predict the aggressiveness and clinical outcomes of CRC, specifically in advanced disease stage are lacking. Therefore, for the first time, the current study has identified a set of molecular markers that are associated with aggressive Stage III CRCs that exhibited microsatellite stable and mutant p53 phenotypic features. These findings might aid in designing aggressive treatment regimens and help to provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic targets. Results: Increased incidence of p53 mutations in MSS CRCs (58%) was associated with higher CRC-specific mortality than MSS-p53 wild-type phenotypes (log-rank, P=0.025; and hazard ratio, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-5.08). Of 49 down-regulated genes, LPAR6, PDLIM3 and PLAT and of 35 up-regulated genes, TRIM29, FUT3, IQGAP3, and SLC6A8, were confirmed by qNPA, qRT-PCR, and IHC platforms.  Conclusions: p53 mutations are associated with poor prognosis of Stage III microsatellite stable CRCs.
