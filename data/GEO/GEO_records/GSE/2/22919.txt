TITLE
Transcriptional changes in IL-2, IL-12 and IL-18 stimulated human natural killer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix expression arrays to determine changes in gene expression associated with activation of human NK cells mediated through treatment with cytokines IL-2, IL-12 and IL-18 over a 24 hour period.

DESIGN
Human natural killer cells were isolated via negative selection from PBMCs of healthy donors.  Cells were found to be > 95% CD3-CD56+.  RNA was harvested at time of isolation or after 24 hour stimulation from 8 x 10^6 cells per condition.  For stimulations, cells were incubated at 37C (5% CO2) in RPMI, suuplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum at 1.5 x 10^6 cells/ml.  Cytokine stimualtions were conducted with IL-2 (100U/mL), IL-12 (10ng/mL) and IL-18 (100ng/mL) from 2 male donors (N = 4).  Expression analysis was carried out to determine transcriptional changes associated with 24 hr stimulation relative to freshly isolated cells.
