TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Phytophthora sojae Gene Expression During  Early Infection

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
P.sojae isolate P6954 - that is nearly identical with strain P6947 with the only exception that P6954 expresses Avr1b during infection is used in this study. 2 days post culture, P.sojae mycelia are inoculated onto 9 day old soybean hypocotyls of highly susceptible cultivar Sloan that were grown under natural sunlight inside a green house. Infected samples were harvested after 0, 3, 6 and 12 hours.
