TITLE
Wild-type vs. PU.1 Q202L mutant mouse ST_HSC (lin- Sca-1+ c-kit+ CD150- CD48+) and GMP (lin- Sca-1+ c-kit- FcgRII/IIIhi CD34+)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of differentially regulated genes in the PU.1 Q202L point mutant that disrupts association with c-Jun. The goal was to identify PU.1 target genes that depend on the co-activation of PU.1 by c-Jun. Mice have normal ST-HSC but lack normal GMP, so a population of GMP-like cells (lin- Sca-1+ c-kit- FcgRII/IIIhi CD34intermediate) was used in the mutant.

DESIGN
sorted cell populations from homozygous PU.1 Q202L
