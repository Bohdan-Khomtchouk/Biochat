TITLE
mRNA decay analysis in the mouse myoblast cell line, C2C12 cells treated with conrtol-, Cugbp1- or Mbnl1-siRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CUGBP1 and MBNL1 are developmentally regulated RNA-binding proteins that are causally associated with myotonic dystrophy type 1. Using HITS-CLIP anlysis, we found CUGBP1 and MBNL1 preferentially bind to alternatively spliced introns and exons, as well as to the 3' UTRs. To analyze more directly the role of CUGBP1/MBNL1 binding to the 3â€™ UTR, we performed global analysis of mRNA stability in C2C12 cells using expression arrays, and found that CUGBP1 and MBNL1 regulate decay of endogenous mRNAs.

DESIGN
We analyzed total RNA of C2C12 cells treated with control-, Cugbp1- or Mbnl1-siRNA. We analyzed 3 time points after addition of actionmycin D (0, 2.5, 5 hours).
