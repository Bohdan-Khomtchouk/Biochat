TITLE
Adult Caenorhabditis elegans: wild-type (N2) and mir-243 mutant worms

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of N2 vs. mir-243 worms, aiming to identify direct and indirect targets of the microRNA.

DESIGN
N2 and mir-243 young-adult worms grown at 20C were analyzed. Three biological replicates with dye-swaps were performed.
