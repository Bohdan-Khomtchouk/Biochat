TITLE
In vitro models of glioblastoma (GBM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterization of gene expression for a panel of 50 in vitro and in vivo models of glioblastoma (GBM).  Models include subcutaneously established xenograft lines, orthotopically grown subcutaneously established xenograft lines, serum derived cell lines and stem cell media derived cell lines.  Multiple replicates of each line were run on different dates to determine the effect of batch and processing date on reproducibility of gene expression profiles

DESIGN
117 samples analyzed from 50 distinct GBM xenografts or cell lines.  Biological replicates from the same passage number were included for many, but not all, of the lines.
