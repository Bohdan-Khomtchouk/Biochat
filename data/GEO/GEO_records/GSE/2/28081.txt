TITLE
Expression pattern of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm-residing bacteria exposed to gentamicin or surface acoustic waves or gentamicin and surface acoustic waves combined

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Bacteria are known to respond to various environmental stimuli including nutrient deprivation, osmotic stress, and exposure to antibiotics. Our experimental data showed that P. aeruginosa biofilm formed in urinary catheters is very suseptible to gentamicin treatment when combined with exposure to surface acoustic waves Our goal was to establish whether P. aeruginosa is capable of specifically sensing the surface acoustic waves as well as to try and decipher the molecular mechanism underlying the increased biofilm suseptibility to antibiotics treatment
