TITLE
Whole Blood Transcriptional Response to Early Acute HIV

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study is to: 1) Characterize the transcriptional signature of early acute HIV infection.  2)  Eucidate the evolution of the signature in both anti-retroviral treated and untreated populations over a 24 week time course. 3) Correlate clinical and disease related parameters to heterogenaity in the transcriptional signature to identify pathways explaining clinical heterogeneity 4) Compare the acute signature of HIV infection to other acute viral signatures.
