TITLE
Farnesyl Diphosphate (FPP) Toxicity in E. coli, LB medium

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
This experiment studied the effect of FPP accumulation on E. coli.  E. coli cells transformed with pMBIS (the S. cerevisiae mevalonate pathway enzymes converting mevalonate to FPP) and fed mevalonate produce large amounts of FPP, which causes toxicity when it accumulates.  When coupled with an active amorphadiene synthase (pADS) the cells produce amorphadiene, a non-toxic isoprenoid.  To accumulate FPP, but maintain similar protein burden, an amorphadiene synthase with 3 mutations to render it inactive was used (pADSmut) to accumulate FPP.  E. coli was transformed with pMBIS and pADS or pMBIS and pADSMut and grown in LB and fed 10 mM mevalonate and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG, then sampled at subsequent time points.
