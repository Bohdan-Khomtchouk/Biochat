TITLE
Molecular analysis of the TGF-beta controlled gene expression program in chicken embryo dermal myofibroblasts

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Myofibroblast is a specific type of mesenchymal cell characterized by synthesis of extracellular matrix and contractile activity. While it serves a beneficial function during tissue wound healing under physiological conditions, it can cause devastating damage to organs afflicted with fibrosis. Myofibroblasts are also present in tumor stroma and contribute actively to tumor growth and spreading. Chicken embryo dermal myofibroblasts (CEDM) represent a novel ex vivo model suitable for the analysis of myofibroblastic phenotype as they show strongly pronounced, uniform and self-sustained myofibroblastic phenotype that is stable in time. As myofibroblastic differentiation is controlled chiefly by TGF-beta signaling, the understanding of the differentiation program entails the determination of TGF-beta-regulated genes. To achieve such a goal, we performed oligonucleotide microarray analysis of CEDM cells treated with a selective TGFBR1 kinase inhibitor. Genes reported previously to be under the control of TGF-beta signaling in mammalian cells appeared among the affected genes also in CEDM cells and many so far unknown TGF-beta targets were revealed.

DESIGN
Comparison of the expression profiles of chicken embryo dermal myofibroblasts in culture treated with TGFBR1 Kinase Inhibitor II or DMSO only. Three biological replicates were analyzed for each group.
