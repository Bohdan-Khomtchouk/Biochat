TITLE
How different diets alter skeletal muscle in pig

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we want to test how different diets (high energy diet HED and low energy diet LED) alter muscle methabolism in pigs. we perform different array experiments using an human platform (GPL2011) and RNA extracted from pig skelethal muscle. thank's this we also test cross-species hybridisation. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridisation
