TITLE
Endoderm- vs ectoderm-specific expression of symbiosis genes in the snakelocks sea anemone

ORGANISM
Anemonia viridis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional comparison between endodermal and ectodermal compartment in symbiotic sea anemones Anemonia viridis were analysed in several specimens. We generated an oligonucleotide microarray (2000 selected features), which is to date the only available oligonucleotide array for symbiotic cnidarians. We were able to identify a subset of genes clearly involved in symbiosis.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from ectodermal or endodermal samples were prepared from 4 symbiotic specimens. Hybridizations were performed against a single reference (VBl) in a dye-swap experiment.
