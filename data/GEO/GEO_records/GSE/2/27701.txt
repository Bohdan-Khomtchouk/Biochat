TITLE
Genes Express in Catalase Overexpression MAECs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Study the global genes expression in mouse aorta endothelial cells (MAECs) overexpressing human catalase (hcatTg).

DESIGN
The wild type and overexpressing human catalase (hcatTg) MAECs grown to 80% confluence in six-well plates were made quiescent in serum-free DMEM for 12 h and then cultured in 10% FBS DMEM for 12 h.  Total RNA was extracted with Trizol® reagent and purified by Rneasy Mini kit. Two independent wild type and two hcatTg total RNA samples were performed microarray with GeneChip® Mouse gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix, USA).
