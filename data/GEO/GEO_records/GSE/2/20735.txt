TITLE
Expression data from effector CD4 T cells isolated from MRL/Faslpr mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MRL/Faslpr mice is a lupus prone strain that exhibits lupus disease features at 12-16 weeks of age, including high-titer circulating anti-DNA antibodies, splenomegaly, lymphadnopathy, skin lesions, and IgG deposits in the kidney. At 16-24 weeks of age, CD4+ B220- CD44+ T cells were sorted into three populations based on the expression of two cell surface molecules, CD62L and PSGL1. CD62Lhi PSGL1hi, CD62Llo PSGL1hi, and CD62Llo PSGL1lo CD4+ T cells were isolated directly ex vivo. There was no treatment given to the animals. Naive (CD62Lhi CD44lo) CD4+ B220- T cells were isolated from young 6-8 week old female mice for comparison. We used a microarray to identify unique features of the CD62Llo PSGL1lo population in comparison to na√Øve CD4+ T cells and other activated CD4+ T cells.

DESIGN
Cells were isolated from the spleens of aged (16-24 weeks) female MRL/Faslpr mice directy ex vivo, and immediatley sorted into 3 populations; CD62Lhi PSGL1hi, CD62Llo PSGL1hi, and CD62Llo PSGL1lo. All 3 populations of cells were previously gated on TCRb+, CD4+, B220-, CD44+. Naive CD4 T cells were isolated  directly ex vivo from the spleens of young (6-8 weeks) female MRL/Faslpr mice, and immediately sorted by gating on TCRb+, CD4+, B220-, CD62Lhi, CD44lo. Three indepedent sorts were performed. RNA was isolated using Qiagen's RNAeasy kit and total RNA was submitted to the W.M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale for amplification and hybridization to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChips.
