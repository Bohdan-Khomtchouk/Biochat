TITLE
Pilot Experiment for Cell-specific Translatome: AP1 Domain vs. Whole Flower

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A pilot experiment for an RNA-seq dataset (SRP003234).  This experiment compares AP1 domain-specific translating RNA with total flower translating mRNA.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, AP1 flower domains vs. whole flower at flower stage 4.
