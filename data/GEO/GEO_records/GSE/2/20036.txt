TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Deer Antler

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of the changes in gene expression between the antler velvet and mesenchyme, pedicle skin and frontal skin tissues from adult male deers (Cervus elaphus). Hybridization data were analysed using MAS5, RMA, GCRMA and Dchip algorithms to maximize the chances of identifying gene expression changes.
