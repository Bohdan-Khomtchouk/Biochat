TITLE
Expression profiles of EDTA-dissociated colon epithelial cells of wild-type mice and vil-Cre-Bcl9-/-/Bcl9l-/- mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assess potential changes in Wnt signaling more comprehensively, EDTA-dissociated colon epithelial cells from three pools of wild-type and Bcl9/Bcl9l-mutant mice were subjected to an exploratory comparative gene expression profiling.
