TITLE
Acyclic retinoid targets platelet-derived growth factor signaling in the prevention of hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling in non tumor lesion in the liver of patients prior to administering peretinoin was unrelated to the clinical outcome, however, gene expression profiling 8 weeks after starting peretinoin therapy significantly predicted the recurrence of HCC

DESIGN
Peretinoin, a member of the acyclic retinoid family, is expected to be an effective chemo preventive drug for HCC.The patients had undergone curative surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). They received 300 mg/day or 600 mg/day of peretinoin for 8 weeks and were followed up for 88 weeks with 600 mg/day of peretinoin. Hepatic gene expression profiling obtained from non tumor lesion of these patients prior to administering peretinoin and 8 weeks after starting peretinoin treatment
