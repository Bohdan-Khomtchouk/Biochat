TITLE
Dll1 mice cloned by nuclear transfer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Production of viable and fertile mice have been reported by nuclear replacement, however, the reasons behind the frequent deformations among foetuses and progeny are not well understood. Activation and in vitro culture methods are also important. Origin of the nuclear donor cells affects success rates, and their survival in culture varies. It has been reported that offspring of nuclear replacement parental mice were normal and fertile. All epigenetic problems in the parents seem to be erased when cell nuclei go through the germ line. cDNA microarray analysis compared expression patterns of Dll1 ko versus Dll1 ko NT (NT = nuclear transfer) and wt versus wt NT of liver and spleen. The aim of this study was analysis of possible epigenetic effects by cloning in the offspring of the 3rd generation. If the 3rd generation cloned animals are indeed phenotypically equivalent to conventional transgenic mouse models then this would open the possibility to develop novel techniques of genetic engineering based on somatic gene targeting and nuclear replacement.

DESIGN
four male animals of each cohort (Dll1 conventional transgenic mouse, Dll1 nuclear transfer mouse, wildtype, wildtye nuclear transfer mouse). Two technical replicates including a colour flip experiment. For each analysed organ (liver, spleen) eight experiments including four biological replicates. As reference RNA pools were used
