TITLE
AMPK and calcineurin induced longevity is mediated by CRTC-1 and CREB

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
AMPK (AAK-2) and calcineurin (TAX-6) mediate longevity exclusively through post-translational modification of CRTC-1, the sole C. elegans CRTC (CREB regulated transcriptional coactivator). We performed microarrays to examine the transcriptional responses elicited by the pro-longevity: activation of AMPK, deactivation of calcineurin, and decrease of CREB (CRH-1) activity.
