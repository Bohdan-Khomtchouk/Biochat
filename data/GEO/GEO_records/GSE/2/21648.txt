TITLE
Gene expression in human oral mucosal fibroblasts and patient-matched skin fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wound healing within the oral mucosa results in minimal scar formation compared to wounds within the skin. We have recently demonstrated distinct differences in the ageing profiles of cells (oral mucosal and patient-matched skin fibroblasts) isolated from these tissues. We hypothesize that the increased replicative potential of oral mucosal fibroblasts may confer upon them preferential wound healing capacities. Passage-matched early cultures of oral mucosal fibroblasts and skin fibroblasts demonstrated distinct gene expression profiles with a number of genes linked to wound healing/tissue repair. We analyzed the gene expression profiles of oral mucosal and patient-matched skin fibroblasts for multiple patients both prior to (0h) and (6h) following a wounding stimulus.

DESIGN
Differences in the gene expression profiles of oral mucosal and patient-matched skin fibroblasts were anlazyed for multiple patients both prior to (0h) and (6h) following a wounding stimulus. Serum starvation and subsequent stimulation provides a model for wounding and RNA extracted at 0h and 6h following this stimulus was hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays for analysis. We sought to compare the expression profiles both between oral and normal fibroblasts, in both serum depleted and stimulated conditions and also compare differences between patients.
