TITLE
Transcript expression data from Populus euphratica leaves subjected to infection by Marssonina pathogen

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of Populus deltoides induced by fungal pathogenic Marssonina brunneain iduring time-course infection. We used Affymetrix poplar genome genechip microarrays to analyze the full transcript expression underlying time-course infection and identified significantly differently expressed genes during the infection process.
