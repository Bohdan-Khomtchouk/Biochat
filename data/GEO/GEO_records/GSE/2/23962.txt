TITLE
Transgenic SCLC induced by E6/E7 oncoproteins vs normal controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The human papillomavirus virus (HPV) is a proven cause of most human cervical cancers, and might have a role in other malignancies including vulva, skin, oesophagus, head and neck cancer. HPV has also been speculated to have a role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. To validate the hypothesis of HPV involvement in small cell lung cancer pathogenesis we performed gene expression profile of transgenic mouse model of SCLC induced by HPV-16 E6/E7 oncoproteins.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile of SCLC has been performed using Agilent whole mouse genome (4x44k) representing ~ 41000 genes and mouse transcripts. Samples were obtained from two HPV16-E6/E7 transgenic mouse model and from littermateâ€™s normal lung.
