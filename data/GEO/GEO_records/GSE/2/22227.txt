TITLE
Expression data of Soybean (Glycine max) roots from different iron treatments.

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Two Near Isogenic soybean (Glycine max) lines were grown in hydroponic conditions with either 50uM ferric nitrate or 100uM ferric nitrate.  After 10 days, half the plants were harvested (total root tissue).  At 12 days after planting, iron was added to plants grown in low iron conditions bringing them up to sufficient iron growth conditions.  Root tissue was harvested for the remaining plants at 14 days after planting. Gene expression analysis from root tissue of two Near Isogenic Lines (NILs), Clark (PI548553) and IsoClark (PI547430), grown in iron stress or iron stress recovered conditions.

DESIGN
A total of 24 samples from four growth conditions, three biological replicates per treatment
