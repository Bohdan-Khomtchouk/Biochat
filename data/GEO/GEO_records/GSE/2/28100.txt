TITLE
Differential expression of microRNAs between oral squamous cell carcinoma and healthy control tongues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify aberrantly expressed microRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs), we have employed microRNA microarray profile using healthy tongue samples as control. All seventeen human OSCCs and three normal tongue tissues were collected from the Tissue Bank at the Moffitt Cancer Center and approved by the University of Florida institutional review board. Majority (15 out of 17) of the OSCCs were derived from tongue cancers. The tumor samples contained greater than 80% of cancerous cells, confirmed by microscopic examination by a head and neck pathologist. The normal tongues were taken from a non-cancerous region. Tissues were snap-frozen and stored at -80°C until further use. Total RNAs were isolated from human tissues using mirVana miRNA Isolation kit (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. NanoDrop® ND-100 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE) was used to quantify the isolated RNA. The Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer from the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida was used to detect the size distribution of total RNA and to determine the quality as well. Expression of microRNAs from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming the expression pattern.

DESIGN
Human tissues of oral squamous cell carcinoma and healthy normal tongues were used for microRNA microarray profile to identify aberrantly expressed microRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinomas.
