TITLE
SAGE analysis of cardiac fibroblasts isolated from adult mouse heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from 3-month old C57BL/6 mice. RNA was prepared from quiescent, serum-starved cardiac fibroblasts in passage 15. A total number of 118654 tags was sequenced. After removal of duplicate ditags and linker-derived sequences 110169 tags remained.

DESIGN
This GEO Series was created by the GEO staff as part of a cleanup effort to ensure that all GEO Samples are included within a Series entry.
