TITLE
miRNA profiling during cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells based on two different miRNA array platforms

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA plays a critical role in a wide variety of biological processes Profiling miRNA expression during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells will help us to understand the regulation pathway of differentiation, therefore to explain disease mechanisms and to find possible therapeutical targets. In this study miRNA expressions were profiled during cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells with high-throughput microarray platforms.
