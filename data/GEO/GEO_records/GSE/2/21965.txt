TITLE
Expression data from WT SIRT6 and SIRT6 albumin CRE conditional mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of liver tissue from WT SIRT6 and conditional knockout of SIRT6 using albumin-Cre (SIRT6Co/Co ;Alb-Cre) at 2 and 8 months of age

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from mouse liver tissue at 2 and 8 months of age.  RNA from three pairs of WT SIRT6 and SIRT6Co/Co ;Alb-Cre mice was combined and hybridized to Affymetrix mouse gene 1.0 ST arrays.
