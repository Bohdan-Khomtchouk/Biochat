TITLE
Gene expression profiles in AEC II during hyperoxia exposure and recovery

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study, type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC II) were isolated from normal, hyperoxia exposed (day 0) and recovery (day 1,3,5 and 7) rats with high purity (~95%). Total RNA from isolated cells were used for dual color DNA microarray hybridization with 3DNA 50 kit version 2. Keywords: time-course
