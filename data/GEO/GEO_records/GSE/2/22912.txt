TITLE
Expression of 50-500nt ncRNAs in silkworm Bombyx mori during two developmental transitions

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
We have performed the first systematic identification and analysis of intermediate size ncRNAs (50-500 nt) in the silkworm genome. We identified 194 novel ncRNAs, the expression profiles of them during the transitions from the egg to the first instar larva and from the fifth instar larva to the pupa were anlyzed by dual-channel microarray. Results showed that 12 ncRNAs had significantly differential expression during the two developmental transitions.

DESIGN
The first instar larva sample was used for comparison to the sample of embryo, the fifth instar larva sample was used for comparison to the sample of pupa, respectively.
