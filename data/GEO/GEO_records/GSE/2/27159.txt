TITLE
Expression profiling of the murine neural crest precursor cell line, JoMa1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
JoMa1 cells are pluripotent precursor cells, derived from the neural crest of mice transgenic for tamoxifen-inducible c-Myc. Following transfection with a cDNA encoding for MYCN, cells become immortlized even in the absence of tamoxifen.

DESIGN
The expression profile of JoMa1 cells was compared to cell lines derived from tumors induced by JoMa1 transfected with MYCN.
