TITLE
Transcription profiling of Density-dependent of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A and PXO99âˆ†ax21

ORGANISM
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae KACC 10331

SUMMARY
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99A, so called Xoo, is disable to infect in rice cultivar carrying Xa21 gene. A set of experiments indicated that Ax21 is quorum sensing factor in PXO99 strain. To observe fine-tuned details how Ax21 controls expression of PXO99 in response to change of cell population density, transcriptional profiling analysis was perform by using published two channel oligo Xo microarray platform (Seo et al.,2008 BMC microbiology). Keywords: Comparative transcription profiling between low cell density and high cell density with same genetic background
