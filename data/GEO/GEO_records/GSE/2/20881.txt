TITLE
Colon biopsies from Crohns patients and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate differential intestinal gene expression in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and controls.  172 biopsies from CD and control subjects were studied.  Endoscopic biopsies were taken at ileocolonoscopy from five specific anatomical locations including the terminal ileum for RNA extraction.

DESIGN
Biopsies from one of four anatomic locations, from healthy controls and treated (with non-biologic standard of care) or untreated CD patients.
