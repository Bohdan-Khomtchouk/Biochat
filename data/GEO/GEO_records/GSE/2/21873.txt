TITLE
Salmonella Typhimurium LT2: Control versus naringenin

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica

SUMMARY
Salmonellosis is one of the leading health problems worldwide. With the rise of drug resistance strains it has become imperative to identify alternative strategies. Naringenin, a flavonone, is present predominantly in grapefruit. Previously we have demonstrated that naringenin is potent inhibitor of cell-cell signaling. In the present study, we provide evidence that naringenin specifically represses 24 genes in the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1, and down-regulates 17 genes involved in flagellar and motility; thereby, attenuating virulence and cell motility, respectively. This is the first molecular evidence to demonstrate effect of naringenin on bacterial virulence and cell motility.
