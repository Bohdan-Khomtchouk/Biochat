TITLE
Human SV80 Cells: Control vs. Caspase-8 knock down

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Excessive responses to pattern-recognition receptors are prevented by regulatory mechanisms that affect the amounts, conformation, and associative properties of their signaling proteins. We report that signaling by the ribonucleic acid sensor RIG-I is restricted, in addition, by caspase-mediated cleavage that results in conversion of a signaling enhancer to a signaling inhibitor. RIP1 and caspase-8, two proteins known to mediate effects of receptors of the TNF/NGF family, are recruited to the RIG-I complex following viral infection, and serve in a coordinated manner antagonistic regulatory roles: conjugation of a ubiquitin chain to Lys-377 in RIP1 facilitates assembly of the RIG-I complex, but it also renders RIP1 susceptible to caspase-8-mediated cleavage, yielding an inhibitory RIP1 fragment. The dependence of RIP1 cleavage on the same molecular change as the one that facilitates RIG-I signaling allows for RIG-I signaling to be restricted in its duration without compromising its initial activation.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of human SV80 cells comparing cells infected with control lenti virus to cells infected with caspase-8 siRNA expressing lenti virus. Goal was to determine the effects of caspase-8 knock down on global gene expression. Two-condition experiment, Control lenti Vs caspase-8 siRNA expressing lenti. Biological replicates: 4 control, 4 caspase-8 siRNA infected
