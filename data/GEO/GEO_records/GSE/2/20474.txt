TITLE
aCGH study of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The identification of lobular caricnoma in situ (LCIS) in a patient's specimen confers and appreciable increased risk of development of future invasive mammary carcinoma. However the study of LCIS presents a challenge as it is usually only recognized in fixed specimens and no good in vivo or in vitro models currently exist. Recent advances in high throughput genomics have made possible comprehensive copy number analysis of lesions such as this. We have characterized LCIS on microdissected cases of archival patient samples using aCGH. We used 4 cases of LCIS with adjacent ILC.

DESIGN
Histological sections from 4 cases of LCIS and 4 cases of ILC microdissected, DNA extracted and subjected to whole genome amplification, and aCGH.
