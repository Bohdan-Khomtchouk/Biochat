TITLE
The gene profile analysis of the function of HMGA2 in immortalized human ovarian surface epithelial cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify HMGA2-regulated downstream target genes, we compared the difference of gene profiles between ovarian surface epithelial cells without HMGA2 (T29-1, T29-2, T80) and cells with HMGA2 (T29A2-8, T29A2-15, T80A2-11).

DESIGN
Immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells (named T29-1, T29-2, T80) were transfected with HMGA2 retrovirus vector pBabe-HMGA2 (named T29A2-8, T29A2-15, T80A2-11). Then cells were harvested for RNA isolation for gene expression analysis. Control group: T29-1, T29-2, T80. Testing group: T29A2-8, T29A2-15, T80A2-11.
