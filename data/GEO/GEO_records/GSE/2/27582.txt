TITLE
Mouse adult testes: Total RNA vs. IP RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAs that are enriched in AGO2 Immunoprecipitated (IP) products or PIWIL1 IP products were identified from mouse(BALB/C) adult testes by examine the ratio of total RNA signal intensity to AGO2 IP RNA or PIWIL1 IP RNA signal intensity.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment,Total RNA extracted from mouse adult testes vs. AGO2 IP RNA extracted from mouse adult testes and total RNA extracted from mouse adult testes vs. PIWIL1 IP RNA extracted from mouse adult testes.
