TITLE
The black truffle of Perigord responds to a temperature shift with an extensive reprogramming of its transcriptional activity

ORGANISM
Tuber melanosporum

SUMMARY
Taking advantage of the availability of the Tuber melanosporum genome sequence and a whole-genome microarray, we wanted to test the hypothesis that the transition from a growth temperature of 24-25°C to a cold one (4°C) is perceived by the filamentous fungus at the transcriptomic level and we wanted to identify and characterize the genes involved in this stress response.

DESIGN
The T. melanosporum custom-exon expression array (4 x 72K) manufactured by Roche NimbleGen Systems Limited (Madison, WI) contained five independent, nonidentical, 60-mer probes per gene model coding sequence. Included in the oligoarray were 12,232 annotated gene models, 3,913 random 60-mer control probes and labelling controls. Sequences used for the oligonucleotide design were from an early draft of the gene catalog containing several TE families. For 1,876 gene models, technical duplicates were included on the array. We performed 6 hybridizations (3 control and 3 treated) with samples derived from liquid cultures of T. melanosporum Mel28. After a month, some flasks were moved to 4°C for 1 week. After this period, the mycelium was collected from the treated (from 25°C to 4°C) and the untreated (25°C) control cultures. All samples were labeled with Cy3.
