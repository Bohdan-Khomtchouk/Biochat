TITLE
tTA/TDP Mice Expression Array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic (Tg) mice expressing nuclear or cytoplasmic human TDP-43 were generated. Tg mice had motor spasticity and forebrain neurodegeneration. Human TDP-43 reduced mouse TDP-43 in nuclei of affected neurons. Tg mice showed alterations in transcripts related to chromatin assembly.

DESIGN
Cerebral cortex from 21 transgenic mice and controls were assayed after two weeks off doxycyline diet as described in Igaz et al.
