TITLE
Gene expression in human umbilical cord endothelial cells following premiR-100 overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To search for genes regulated by microRNA-100 in endothelial cells, we transfected human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) with miR-100 precursor oligonucelotides. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from donated umbilical cords, pooled from two donors and cultivated up to passage 5. For transfection with pre-miR microRNA precursor molecules cells were cultured to 70% confluence and transfected with 8nM pre-miR-100 or an irrelevant control oligonucleotide (both from Ambion) using Lipofectamin RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. Total RNA was isolated 48h after transfection.

DESIGN
Two individual samples per condition were analyzed.
