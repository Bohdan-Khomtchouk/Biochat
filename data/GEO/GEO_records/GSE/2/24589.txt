TITLE
Transcriptional response of ovarian cancer cell lines to HGF and CDDP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HGF sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapeutics, e.g. cisplatin (CDDP), through a signaling cascade activated by its MET oncogene encoded receptor and transduced by the p38MAPK. This cascade results in the regulation of a common set of transcripts in three ovarian cancer cell lines, with different genetic profiles and susceptibility to drugs.

DESIGN
In order to elucidate the mechanism of HGF dependent cell sensitization to drugs, the transcriptional response of the three ovarian cancer cell lines to HGF and CDDP were studied by microarray based transcription profiling
