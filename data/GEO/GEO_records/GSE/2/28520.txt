TITLE
Expression data from BMDCs treated with BI2536 or vehicle control and stimulated with LPS or poly(I:C)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying Polo-like kinase inhibition with BI 2536 compound in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) stimulated with Toll-like receptor agonists LPS and poly(I:C).
