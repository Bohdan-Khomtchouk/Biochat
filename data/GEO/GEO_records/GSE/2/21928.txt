TITLE
Mapping replication-initiation proteins ORC1 and CDC6 in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Genomic integrity requires faithful chromosome duplication. Origins of replication are the genomic sites where DNA replication initiates in every cell cycle. There are multiple origins scattered throughout the eukaryotic genome whose genome-wide identification has been a hard challenge, especially in multicellular organisms. Thus, very little is known on the distinctive features of origins in terms of DNA sequence and chromatin context at a genomic scale. As part of a project for profiling replication origins in Arabidopsis thaliana, we have performed ChIP-chip analysis of the binding of ORC1 and CDC6, two proteins involved in initiation of DNA replication. Here, we provide the data of the ORC1-bound and CDC6-bound genomic sites using as control genomic DNA.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of ORC1-binding sites-enriched DNA samples were compared against 3 biological replicates of fragmented genomic DNA (INPUT). 2 biological replicates of CDC6-binding-sites-enriched DNA samples were compared against 3 biological samples of fragmented genomic DNA (INPUT). Results files linked below: Enrichment ratio calculated from normalized intensities and averaged over all replicates. Positive values indicate enrichment of the ChIP fraction versus the INPUT sample.
