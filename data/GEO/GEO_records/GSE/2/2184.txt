TITLE
Gene expression profiling of native mussels from Venice lagoon area

ORGANISM
Mytilus galloprovincialis

SUMMARY
We examined gene expression profiling of native mussels that were sampled in early summer 2003 from sites of the Venice lagoon area known to be differently affected by chemical pollution: Sites 1 and 2 close to the industrial district of Marghera and Site 3 close to the Lido lagoon outlet. Site 4, a current mussel farm located offshore, has been chosen as source of reference targets for microarray hybridizations. We have limited the preliminary assessment to the digestive gland. Digestive gland total RNA of each Site was hybridized in competition with the offshore mussels (Site 4 - Reference) and the relative abundance of each gene was measured by directly comparing fluorescent signals for each probe. We carried out two separate hybridizations for each site of the Venice lagoon area..
