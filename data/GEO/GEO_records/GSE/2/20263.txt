TITLE
Small RNAs in different tissues and phloem of oilseed rape under nutrient stress conditions

ORGANISM
Physcomitrella patens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify nutrient-responsive small RNAs in different tissues and in phloem sap of rape plants. miRNA microarrays containing all currently known plant miRNAs (Sanger miRBase versions 10.0, 10.1 and 11.0), and a set of unknown small RNAs cloned earlier from Brassica phloem sap (Bn_PsRNA) were used. The phloem, leaf and root response to nutrient deficiency were analyzed by removing either sulfate, copper or iron from the growth medium. The small RNA profile from phloem and inflorescence stems of plants grown under full nutrition conditions was also analyzed and compared. The study demonstrates that the phloem sap sRNA profile is distinct from that of the inflorescence stems, leaves and roots. Furthermore, we could identify phloem-enriched small RNAs and showed that some of them specifically accumulate in the phloem in response to nutrient deprivation.
