TITLE
Numb variant specific transcriptome analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Numb has 4 known variants and we are reporting two novel Numb variants, Numb5 and Numb6 in this study. The metastaticability variations between the numb variants were evaulated through the transcriptome.

DESIGN
breast cancer cells were transfected with GFP-Numb4, GFP-Numb5, GFP-Numb6 or GFP-only vectors and their transcriptome were assessed on Affymetrix platform
