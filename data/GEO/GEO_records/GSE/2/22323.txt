TITLE
Fungal allergen extracts-induced gene expression in airway epithelial cells (NCI-H292)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the gene expression stimulated with fungal extracts from Aspergillus (A.) fumigatus, Alternaria (A.) alternata, or Penicillium (P.) notatum in NCI-H292 (a human bronchial epithelial cell line) to search Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM)-related genes. We identified a mucin-related MUC5AC gene, the expression of which was selectively induced by A. fumigatus.

DESIGN
Total RNA from NCI-H292 cells stimulated for 24 h with the A. fumigatus, A. alternata, or P. notatum fungi extracts was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis. Each experiments were perfomed once for each stimulus.
