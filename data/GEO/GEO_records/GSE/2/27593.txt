TITLE
Identification of glycosyltransferases and glycosydases responsible for the synthesis/degradation of mucin O-glycans at the human ocular surface epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The major focus of Dr. Argueso's research is to characterize the carbohydrate portion of the different mucins expressed by the ocular surface epithelia as well as the enzymes involved with their synthesis, and to determine whether the alteration of mucin glycosylation is associated with ocular surface disease.
