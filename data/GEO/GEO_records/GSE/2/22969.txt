TITLE
MYST4 (QKF/KAT6B/MORF) transcriptional targets in the adult dorsal cortex and E12.5 embryonic dorsal telencephalon

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MYST4 (QKF/KAT6B/MORF) is an important regulator of brain development and function through its regulation of gene expression. Genetic targets of MYST4 are currently unknown. We have therefore carried out microarrays comparing gene expression in wild type and Qkf mouse tissues, namely the dorsal cortex and E12.5 dorsal telencephalon, to elucidate genetic targets of MYST4.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted for hybridization to arrays from 3 pairs of wild type and Qkf gt/gt mutant adult dorsal corticies and 3 pairs of wild type and Qkf gt/gt mutant E12.5 dorsal telencephalons
