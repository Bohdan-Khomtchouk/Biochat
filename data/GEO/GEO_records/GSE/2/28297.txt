TITLE
Expression data from WT (Columbia) and pifq (pif1pif3pif4pif5) mutant Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plants respond to changes in the red:far red ratio (R:FR) of incident light. A reduction in this ratio (increase in FR) results in the Shade Avoidance Response (SAR) with associated changes in gene expression. The Phyotchrome-Interacting Factors (PIFs) are bHLH transcription factors known to be involved in the SAR. An analysis of changes in gene expression in WT and quadruple pif1pif3pif4pif5 (pifq; Leivar et al., 2008 (PMID 19920208)) mutant seedlings in response to  an increase in FR should identify primary targets of PIF signaling.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to examine the SAR in WT (Columbia) and pifq mutant Arabidopsis seedlings. Arabidopsis WT and pifq mutant seeds were plated on GM medium without sucrose at room temperature. During this procedure, the seeds were routinely exposed to white light (WL) for a total of 1.5 hours after imbibition. Seeds were then stratified for 5 days at 4ºC in darkness, and then grown in WL (19 umol/m2/s, R/FR ratio of 6.48) for 2 days at 21°C (WL0 samples). Two-day-old WL-grown seedlings were then maintained in the same fluence rate of WL supplemented with far-red light (WL-FR, R/FR ratio of 0.006) for 1 (FR1), 3 (FR3) or 24 (FR24) hours before harvesting. Control seedlings were also maintained in parallel in the same fluence rate of WL for 24h (WL24) before harvesting. Three different biological replicates of each treatment were grown separately and extracted, processed, and analyzed independently.
