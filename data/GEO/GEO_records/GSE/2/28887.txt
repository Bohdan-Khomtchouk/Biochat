TITLE
Gene expression profile of  Age associated B cells, Follicular B cells, and B1 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profile of different B cell populations found in old (18 months old) C57BL/6 female mouse (B1 cells were recovered from both young and old C57BL/6 mice). Mice were na√Øve and healthy (no autoimmunity was detected at the time of the experiment).

DESIGN
Different B cell populations were sorted using flow cytometry and RNA was isolated.
