TITLE
Analysis of micorRNA expression during  the HBV acute and chronic infections

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent implication of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the intricate cross-talk between the host and the pathogen in viral infections reveals a new layer of mechanism for host-virus interactions. In the present study, we investigated human miRNAs which may be involved in the acute and chronic HBV infections via microarray profiling. We determined the global miRNA expression profiles elicited in the uninfected control model (HepG2), the acute infection model (HepG2 transfected with a 1.3 full-length HBV genome) and the chronic infection model (HepG2.2.15) using CapitalBio corporationâ€™s mammalian miRNA arrays.
