TITLE
Feedback amplification of fibrosis through matrix stiffening and COX-2 suppression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We tested the hypothesis that increasing matrix stiffness on which normal human lung fibroblasts are grown promotes the expression of a fibrogenic cellular transcriptomic program. Keywords: Human lung fibroblast, matrix stiffness, PTGS2, COX-2, Prostaglandin E2

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from normal human lung fibroblasts from 3 human subjects and separately grown on 5 discrete matrix stiffness conditions: 100, 400, 1600, 6400, 25600 Pascals.
