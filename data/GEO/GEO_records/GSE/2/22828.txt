TITLE
Atlas of Gene Expression at Microanatomical Resolution of the Submandibular Salivary Gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to generate a spatiotemporal atlas of gene expression in the developing salivary gland.  This will allow us to identify changes in gene expression that may result in the formation of the different domains of the salivary gland.

DESIGN
At least 4 microarrays per location per time point were collected.  The originating samples are rather small, so many clefts, ducts and buds had to be pooled to generate enough aRNA for hybridization. Supplementary file: cluster heat map from anova 0.05 passing entities, E12.5 main bud vs E15 main bud (averaged readings)
