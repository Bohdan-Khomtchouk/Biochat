TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of HepG2 cell with QD655 and QD705 treatments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Discovery time-course genome-wide expression profiles in HepG2 cell with QD655 and QD705 treatments to reveal genotoxicity and chronological regulatory pathway

DESIGN
Time-course gene expression profiles of HepG2 cell cline with QD655 and QD705 treatments were analyzed. Total RNA were harvested from 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hr QD-treated and untreated cells. Human universal reference RNA was used as the reference for all the array experiments. The customized microarrays used were consisted of 49152 probes. Experiments were conducted as two replicates (different cluture).
