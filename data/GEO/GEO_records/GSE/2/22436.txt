TITLE
Group A Streptococcus Gene Expression in Humans with Pharyngitis Using a Microarray

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes M1 GAS

SUMMARY
This study represents the first in vivo genome wide analysis of gene epxression of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in humans with pharyngitis. The micorarray used is a custom microarray that relies on an electrochemical reaction as the measured signal rather than flourescence. Distinct clusters of gene expression were discovered and analyzed.  A functional analysis examining differences and similarities between the clusters was performed.
