TITLE
Regulation of miRNAs in macrophages in response to Candida albacans

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we have analysed the regulation of miRNA in bone marrow derived macrophages in response to the fungal pathogen heat killed Candida albicans and bacterial cell wall component, LPS. The aim of the study was to identify and validate miRNAs involved in the innate immune system in response to fungal and bacterial stimuli and investigate potential mechanisms for their transcription.

DESIGN
Three mice were used as 3 biological replicates. The bone marow derived macrophages from each mouse were divided into two and either left untreated or were stimulatred for 16 h with heat killed Candida albicans.
