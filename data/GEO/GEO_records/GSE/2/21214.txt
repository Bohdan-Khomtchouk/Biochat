TITLE
Genome expression between homozygous and heterozygous yeast wine strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Genome expression analysis between the yeast wine strain L-846 (diploid heterozygous) and spore derived from it (diploid homozygous).

DESIGN
Slides contained cDNA clones spotted in duplicate. A repeated dye-swap design was used.
