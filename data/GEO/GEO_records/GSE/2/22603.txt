TITLE
Paralogous MarR/DUF24-family repressors YodB and CatR control expression of the catechol dioxygenase CatE in Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
The redox-sensing MarR/DUF24-type repressor YodB controls expression of the azoreductase AzoR1 and the nitroreductase YodC that are involved in detoxification of quinones and diamide in Bacillus subtilis. In the present paper, we identified YodB and its paralog YvaP (CatR) as repressors of the yfiDE (catDE) operon encoding a catechol-2,3-dioxygenase that also contributes to quinone resistance. Inactivation of both paralogs, CatR and YodB, results in full derepression of catDE transcription. DNA-binding assays and promoter mutagenesis studies showed that CatR protects two inverted repeats with the consensus sequence TTAC-N5-GTAA overlapping the -35 promoter region (BS1) and the transcriptional start site (BS2). The BS1 operator was required for binding of YodB in vitro. CatR and YodB share the conserved N-terminal Cys residue that is essential for redox-sensing of CatR in vivo as shown by Cys-to-Ser mutagenesis. Our data suggest that CatR is modified by intermolecular disulfide formation in response to diamide and quinones in vitro and in vivo. Redox-regulation of CatR occurs independently of YodB and no protein interaction was detected between CatR and YodB in vivo using protein-crosslinking and mass spectrometry.

DESIGN
Bacillus subtilis 168 wild type (Ko_WT) control vs. DyvaP mutant  (Ko_DyvaP). The experiment was conducted in duplicates using two independent total RNA preparations. For all datasets used for final analysis, wild-type samples were labeled with Cy3 and DyvaP mutant samples were labeled with Cy5.
