TITLE
Sex-different hepatic glycogen content, glucose and amino acid output in rats.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In the present study we tested the hypothesis that male and female rat livers respond differently to a change in nutrient availability or to insulin treatment. We compared hepatic gene expression, hepatic glycogen and glucose output, insulin sensitivity and amino acids, using healthy rats. Keywords: Hepatic gene expression, sex-differences

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment. Biological replicates: 4 male rat livers from rats on a standard diet and 4 female rat livers from rats on a standard diet.  One replicate per array.
