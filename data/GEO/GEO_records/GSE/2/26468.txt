TITLE
Identification of genes whose expressions are affected by hedgehog RNAi in spider embryos

ORGANISM
Parasteatoda tepidariorum

SUMMARY
In the spider Achaearanea tepidariorum, Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a key role in the formation of the two major embryonic axes. Analyses of expression patterns of the spider hh homolog, At-hh, suggested that Hh signaling might be involved in the subsequent segmentation process also. In this microarray experiment, we attempted to identify candidate genes whose expressions are regulated by Hh signaling during early phases of spider segmentation.
