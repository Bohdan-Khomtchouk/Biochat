TITLE
Wide-genome analysis of hepatocytes isolated from male and female rats treated with glucocorticoid.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Glucocorticoids are widely used therapeutically to suppress inflammatory/immune responses and most of their effects are produced either by altering transcription of specific genes directly, or by altering the expression of transcription factors that subsequently alter the expression of downstream genes. Relevant data from previous studies indicate that the number of genes regulated by glucocorticoid receptor exceeds 4000 in cells  and that 358 different genes are regulated in the liver of adrenalectomized males rats treated with a chronic infusion of methylprednisolone for up to 1 week  . However, differences in gene expression between males and females in response to glucocorticoid treatment in isolated hepatocytes are not known.

DESIGN
Livers were isolated from adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats and digested with the collagenase perfusion method developed by Berry and Friend (J Cell Biol 43, 506-520;1969). After collagenase treatment, the liver was excised, minced in balanced salt solution, and centrifuged at 50 g for 3 min. Immediately after isolation, hepatocytes were resuspended in Williams E Medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 2 mM glutamine pH 7.4, and 10% fetal bovine serum and plated on collagen-coated 94 x 16 mm cell culture dishes and maintained for 24 hours in a 95% air–5% CO2, 37°C incubator. The medium was then changed to free serum Williams E Medium and maintained in culture for an additional 24 hours. Hepatocytes isolated from male and rats were treated with vehicle (0.01% ethanol) or dexamethasone (100 nm) for 6 hours. Total RNA from cells were extracted by using the RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were treated with the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) and were kept at -80°C until labeling and hybridization.
