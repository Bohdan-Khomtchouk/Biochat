TITLE
Characterization of differential gene expression in adrenocortical tumors harbouring β-catenin  (CTNNB1) mutations.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mutations of β-catenin gene (CTNNB1) are frequent in adrenocortical adenomas (AA) and carcinomas (ACC). However, the target genes of CTNNB1 have not yet been identified in adrenocortical tumors. Our objective was to identify genes de-regulated in adrenocortical tumors harbouring CTNNB1 genetic alterations.
