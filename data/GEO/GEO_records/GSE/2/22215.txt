TITLE
Early and Late gene expression responses to Salmonella infection in the mouse intestine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression of  the mouse colon responses to Salmonella (SL1344 and SB1117) infection at the early phase (8 hours) and the late phase (4 days). We specifically examined the the differentillay gene expression profiles in mouse colon when it responded to pathogenic Salmonella stain SL1344 (with AvrA expression) or SB1117 (without AvrA expression).

DESIGN
Mice were infected with 1x107 CFU of samonella stains, SL1344 and SB1117 respectively (100Âµl suspension in HBSS) or treated with sterile HBSS (control) by oral gavage as previously described.  At 8 hours and 4 days after infection, mice were sacrificed and RNA tissue samples from the intestinal tracts were removed for analysis.
