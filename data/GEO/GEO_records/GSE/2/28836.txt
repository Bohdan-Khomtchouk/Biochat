TITLE
FlhC mediated gene regulation In E. coliO157:H7 on meat

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7

SUMMARY
The study aimed at investigating FlhC mediated gene regulation in E. coli O157:H7 on surface of meat. It also aimed at investigating the phenotypic effect of such a regulation.

DESIGN
Two strains WT and FlhC mutant used. FlhC mutant had a 12 base pair deletion. 3 biological replicates . Wt labeled with Alexa 555, FlhC mutant with Alexa 647
