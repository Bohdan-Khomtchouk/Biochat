TITLE
Expression data from xenograft tumors derived from LoVo colon cancer lines +/- constitutive LIN28B expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to elucidate functions of LIN28B and potential mechanisms whereby it may promote metastasis by comparing the gene expression profile of LIN28B metastases to primary tumors. Accordingly, we performed microarray analysis on total RNA isolated from empty vector tumors, LIN28B-LoVo tumors, and LIN28B-LoVo metastases

DESIGN
Constitutive LIN28B expression was achieved in the LoVo (ATCC #CCL-229) colon cancer cell line via retroviral transduction of MSCV-PIG-LIN28B. xenografts were produced via injection of 1x106 cells subcutaneously into the rear flanks of nude mice. Microarrays were conducted on primary tumors from empty vector and LIN28B-expressing cells, as well as metastases derived from primary tumors constitutively expressing LIN28B. (Note: metastases did not occur with empty vector tumors)
