TITLE
GIF-5 mouse gastric epithelial cells: CD-133-positive vs CD-133-negative

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of GIF-5 mouse gastric epithelial cells comparing CD133-positive and CD133-negative cells. The former formed CD133-positive and CD133-negative cells while the latter only CD133-negative cells, suggesting that CD133-positive cells are mother cells. The former produced differentiated type tumors while the latter undifferentiated types in vivo, indicating a relationship between CD133-expression and glandular structure formation.
