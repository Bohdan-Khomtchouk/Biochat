TITLE
Expression profiling of murine neonatal lung tissue from Carm1 knockouts and wild type controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Coactivator associated arginine methyltransferase I (CARM1, also known as Protein aRginine MethylTransferase 4, or PRMT4) regulates gene expression by multiple mechanisms including methylation of histones and coactivation of steroid receptor transcription. Mice lacking CARM1 are smaller than their littermates, fail to breath, and die shortly after birth, demonstrating the critical role of CARM1 in development.We performed gene expression analysis to identify genes that are responsible for hyperproliferaion in CARM1 knockout lung.

DESIGN
RNA extracted from murine lung at E18.5 with carm1 knockouts and wild type controls was hybridised to Affymetrix mouse430.2 GeneChips to identify differentially expressed genes in the disease state.
