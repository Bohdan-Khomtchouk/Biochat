TITLE
Genomic profiling of Imatinib resistance in CD34+ cell populations from chronic myeloid leukaemia patients using Agilent-014698 Whole Human Genome 105K microarrays.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To ascertain genomic alterations associated with Imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukaemia, we performed high resolution genomic analysis of CD34+ cells from 25 Imatinib (IM) resistant and 11 responders CML patients. Using patients' T-cells as reference, we found significant association between number of acquired cryptic copy number alterations (CNA) and disease phase (p=0.036) or loss of IM response for patients diagnosed in chronic phase (CP) (p=0.04). Recurrent cryptic losses were identified on chromosomes 7, 12 and 13. On chromosome 7, recurrent deletions of the IKZF1 locus were detected, for the first time, in four patients in CP.

DESIGN
Patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukaemia were compared using CD34+ cells and T cells as reference and hybridized on Agilent-014698 Whole Human Genome 105K microarrays.
