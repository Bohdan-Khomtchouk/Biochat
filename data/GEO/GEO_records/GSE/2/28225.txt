TITLE
Detection of S. cerevisiae fragments in the genome of S. bayanus strains with aCGH on Yeast_2 Affymetrix array.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The aim of this project was to detect S. cerevisiae fragments in the genome of S. bayanus Type strain CBS380 and pure line NBRC1948 (=IFO1948). The hybridization signal is compared to S. uvarum BBS7001 whose genome has been sequenced and in which no S. cerevisiae sequence has been detected.
