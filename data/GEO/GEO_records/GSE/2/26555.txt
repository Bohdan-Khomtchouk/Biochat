TITLE
Changes in miR expression profile carotid plaques induced by acutely induced flow disturbances in apoe-/- mice on a high fat diet.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Atherosclerosis is causally related to disturbed flow through low and oscillatory shear stress. In order to study the miR expression profile in atherosclerotic plaques induced by disturbed flow, partial ligation of the carotid artery was performed. This procedure results acutely in severly reduced blood flow and in stenotic lesion formation within 6 weeks in apoe-/- mice on a high fat diet. We compared the miR expression profile  in partially ligated left carotid arteries with the untreated right carotid artery to identify miRs which are involved in plaque formation through flow disturbances.
