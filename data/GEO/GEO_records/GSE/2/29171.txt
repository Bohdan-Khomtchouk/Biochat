TITLE
Comparative study of transcriptomes from four Trichoderma strains gene expression in early interaction with tomato plants

ORGANISM
Trichoderma virens

SUMMARY
A self-designed Trichoderma high density oligonuclotide (HDO) microarray  (Roche-NimbleGen, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) was constructed in a similar way  than a previous Trichoderma HDO microarray (Samolski et al., 2009). The microarray was composed of 392,779 60-mer probes designed against 14,081 EST-derived transcripts (Trichochip-1) and the genomes of T. reesei (9,129 genes) and T.  virens (11,643 genes). The Trichochip-1 ESTs were obtained from 28 cDNA libraries from eight different species (representing the biodiversity of this genus: T. harzianum, T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. viride, T. longibrachiatum, T. virens, T. stromaticum and T. aggresivum), under a wide range of growth conditions, including biocontrol-related conditions and different nutritional situations (Vizca√≠no et al., 2006). This HDO microarray was used to analyze Trichoderma spp. transcriptomes after 20 h incubation in the presence of tomato plants. The Trichochip1 EST database was generated in the TrichoEST project funded by the EU (QLK3-CT-2002-02032).
