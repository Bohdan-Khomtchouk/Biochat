TITLE
Tiling array hybridizations of genomic DNA from Bacillus subtilis 168.

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Genomic DNA prepared from B. subtilis 168 cells grown to stationary phase was hybridized to tiling arrays. The data are used in transcriptome studies to compute expression intensities from raw intensity data using a model of shift and drift and correcting for probe affinity variations as described in (Nicolas et al., 2009, Bioinformatics 25, 2341-2347).
