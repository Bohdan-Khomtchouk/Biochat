TITLE
Expression data from DC-induced Hopx-deficient and sufficient regulatory T cells after immunization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that Hopx is required for the function of DC-induced regulatory T cells in vivo. We used microarrays to identify relevant Hopx-targets in such cells after antigenic re-challenge in vivo.

DESIGN
CD25/Foxp3 double positive DC-induced Hopx-deficient and sufficient regulatory T cells were FACS sorted to high purity
