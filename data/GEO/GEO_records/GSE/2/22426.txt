TITLE
Global gene expression patterns in Clostridium thermocellum from microarray analysis of chemostat culture on cellulose or cellobiose

ORGANISM
Ruminiclostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405

SUMMARY
Earlier studies pointed to the ability of C. thermocellum to exquisitely control gene expression in response to growth rate and the presence of insoluble cellulose or soluble compounds such as cellobiose.  This microarray study was carried out in order to examine expression responses of the entire genome. The use of the chemostat technique allowed the effects of different growth rates to be analyzed separately from the effects of different substrates.

DESIGN
An 11-chip study of 11 separate C. thermocellum chemostat cultures grown on cellulose or cellobiose at different dilution rates.
