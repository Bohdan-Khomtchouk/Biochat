TITLE
lin-35(n745) mutants vs. lin-35(n745), mes-4(RNAi) (below referred to as reference sample and test sample respectively)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of C. elegans first larval stage whole animals comparing lin-35(n745) mutants and lin-35(n745) treated with mes-4(RNAi) at 26 degrees.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, mutant (lin-35) vs. mutant plus RNAi (lin-35, mes-4RNAi).  Biological replicates 4 mutant, 4 mutant plus RNAi harvested indepedently.  One lin-35 replicate and one lin-35, mes-4(RNAi) replicate per array.
