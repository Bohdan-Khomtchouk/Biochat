TITLE
Gene expression profiles of control GC424 tumor cell lines and after downregulation of the SV40 large T-antigen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of global gene expression in a tumor cell line established from a CEA424-Tag mouse and comparison with the expressed gene profile after downregulating the expression of the large T antigen

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from cultured control  cell lines and after siRNA mediated downregulation of the SV40 large T antigen
