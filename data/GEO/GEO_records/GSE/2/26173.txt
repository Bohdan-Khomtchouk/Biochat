TITLE
Affymetrix SNP6.0 data for human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), human Fibroblasts, and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, copy number variations of  hiPSCs were compared to their parental fibroblast lines and hESCs to assess the level of DNA damage incurred due to the process of reprogramming of somatic cells. Higher levels of copy number changes were observed in hiPSCs (especially in early passage hiPSCs) compared to the other cell types.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from in vitro cultured cells. Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed for 35 hiPSC samples, 2 hESC samples, and 5 fibroblast samples. Other hESC and the reference Hapmap sample CEL files were obtained from Narva et al. 2010, Nat. Biotech., GEO accession code GSE15097 (see readme file below for details).
