TITLE
Large intergenic non-coding RNAs as novel modulators of reprogramming: ESCs, fibroblast, and fibroblast-derived iPSC (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of human embryonic stem cells, fibroblasts, and fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from human ESCs, fibroblast, and fibroblast-derived iPSC lines, then hybridized to Affymetrix arrays Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array [Affy_HG-U133_Plus_2]
