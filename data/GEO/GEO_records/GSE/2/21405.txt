TITLE
MicroRNA Profiling in Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury of the Gracilis Muscle in Rats (miRNA data)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Profile the microRNA expression in the Gracilis muscle of rat after 4h ischemia and 24 h reperfusion Following 4 h of ischemia and subsequent reperfusion for 4 h of the gracilis muscles, the specimens were analyzed with an Agilent rat miRNA array to detect the expressed miRNAs in the experimental muscles compared to those from the sham-operated controls.
