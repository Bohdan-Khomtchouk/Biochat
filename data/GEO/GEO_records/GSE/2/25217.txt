TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of rice infected with RGSV

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice grassy stunt disease is mainly observed in South, Southeast and East Asia, and caused by Rice grassy stunt virus (RGSV). Specific symptom appeared on RGSV infected rice plant is excess tillering. To guess how to induce excess tillering in RGSV infected plant, we analyzed the global gene expression changes in RGSV infected plants. Keywords: virus infection, disease response
