TITLE
MMTV tumor and host cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MMTV Wnt-1 and MMTV-Her2 tumors are transplanted onto GFP transgenic mice. Separate GFP+ cells and GFP- cells by FACS sorting to see the oncogene dependent gene expression changes in both tumor cell compartment (GFP- cells). Wnt Fzd 6hrs group: Wnt inhibitor (Fzd8-CRD) treated tumor RNA which will give some clue for direct Wnt target genes only in tumor cells.
