TITLE
Comparison of CD133 high and CD133 negative cell populations isolated from colorectal carcinoma and liver metastases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based gene expression analysis identified genes differentially expressed between CD133 high and CD133 negative cell populations isolated from colorectal carcinoma and liver metastases

DESIGN
In this study, a set of 5 colorectal cancers was used to acquire expression profiles, leading to the identification of differentially expressed genes between CD133 high and CD133 negative cell populations by Significance Analysis of Microarray dada.
