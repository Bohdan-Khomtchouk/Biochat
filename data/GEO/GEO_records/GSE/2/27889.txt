TITLE
Natural genetic variation caused by small insertions and deletions in the human genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified 1.96 million small insertions and deletions (INDELs) in the genomes of 79 diverse humans.  10,003 of these INDELs were probed on a custom INDEL genotyping array.

DESIGN
A custom Affymetrix array was developed to genotype 10,003 small human INDEL polymorphisms ranging from 1 bp to 100 bp in length.  These arrays were used to genotype the 10,003 INDELs in 158 diverse humans.  These humans included: 1) the 24 humans from the polymorphism discovery panel (PDR; Coriell), 2) Yoruban trios from the HapMap project (YRI), 3) Han Chinese from the HapMap project (CHB), and 4) the HuRef genome (Venter).  Technical replicates were included for some samples.
