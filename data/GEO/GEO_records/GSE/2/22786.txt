TITLE
Embryos of wheat seeds: Temperature effect

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of wheat embryos of developing seed comparing seeds grown at low temperature:13˚C with seeds grown at high temperature:25˚C during seed development using wheat 2 cultivars: Norin61 (N61) and Shiroganekomugi (SK). Goal was to determine the effects of temperature on global gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Low(13˚C) vs. high (25˚C) temperatures during seed development. Time course experiments along with  days after anthesis (DAA).
