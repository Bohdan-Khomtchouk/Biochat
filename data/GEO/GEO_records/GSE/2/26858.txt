TITLE
SMAD3 targets in A549 lung epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGFβ activates a signal transduction cascade that results in the transcription of genes, primarily through the DNA-binding transcription factor SMAD3. The objective of this study is to identify SMAD3 binding targets and the molecular pathways affected by the TGFβ1/SMAD3 signal transduction on a genome-wide scale.

DESIGN
Cultured A549 cells at 30-50% confluence were treated with 10 uM SIS3 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or DMSO (vehicle-only) 30 min prior to TGFβ1 treatment. Cells were treated with 2 ng/mL recombinant TGFβ1 for 0, 2, 12, and 24 h.
