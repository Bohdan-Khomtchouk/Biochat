TITLE
Array CGH of breast cancer cells with distinct metastatic properties

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Xenograft metastases from MDA-MB-231 cells and CN34 cells at different organs were collected and yielded sub-populations that exhibited increased metastagenicity to the lung or brain. Genomic aberrations of these subpopulations were profiled and compared to the parental populations.

DESIGN
Array CGH of breast cancer cells with distinct metastatic properties
