TITLE
miRNA profiles of tonsillar B cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to assess the miRNA signature of B cells undergoing the germinal center reaction, we isolated three subsets of B cells from tonsils--naive (N), germinal center (GC), and memory (M) and looked at their miRNA profile.
