TITLE
Expression profile of proliferating and differentiating primary human keratinocytes in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human epidermal keratinocytes undergo tightly controlled program of cell differentiation, leading to the formation of cornified envelope. Primary keratinocytes in vitro, under calcium stimulation mimic the differentiation program observed in vivo. Analysis of the transcription profile of two cell population, such as proliferating cells and differentiating cells helps to discover new genes implicated in that process and to understand the mechanisms of regulation of the keratinocyte differentiation.
