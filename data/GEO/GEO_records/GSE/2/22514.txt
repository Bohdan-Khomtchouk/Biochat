TITLE
Abf1 and Rap1 effect on nucleosome occupancy in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We grew wild type and corresponding mutant abf1 and rap1 temperature sensitive yeast at 25 C, then for one hour after shifting to 37 C.  We then prepared nucleosomal (mostly mononucleosomal) DNA and hybridized to tiling arrays.

DESIGN
Three abf1 ts mutant and corresponding wild type, and three rap1 ts mutant and corresponding wild type (note not the same wild type; BY4741 for Rap1, but TMY86 for Abf1)
