TITLE
Gene expression profiles of tumor and paired normal lung tissues from primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in Taiwan.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression profiling of NSCLC patients were done using Phalanx Human OneArray chip. The surgically resected tumor tissue and corresponding normal tissue were collected from 21 patients diagnosed with primary NSCLC admitted to Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan.

DESIGN
In this study, we used cDNA microarray to detect gene expression profiling in tumor and corresponding normal samples from 21 NSCLC patients. There were 11 AD patients and 10 SQ patients. The patients consisted of 10 early stage patients (stages I and II) and 11 late stage patients (stages III and IV). Hybridization targets were prepared from total RNA and hybridized according to standard protocol using Phalanx Human OneArray chip (32,050 total features: 30968 human genome probes and 1082 experimental control probes).
