TITLE
Expression data at 24 hours after the blocking of Shh signaling in tooth germs at embryonic day 14

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The genetic mechanism governing the spatial patterning of teeth still remains to be elucidated. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is one of key signaling molecules involved in the spatial patterning of teeth. By utilizing maternal transfer of 5E1 (an IgG1 monoclonal antibody against Shh protein) through the placenta to block Shh signaling, we investigated the changes in tooth patterning and in gene expression. We used microarrays to detect specific genes related with Shh signaling in tooth germs and identified some specific genes up- or down-regulated after blocking of Shh signaling activity.
