TITLE
Nell-1 primary response gene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that Nell-1, as a growth factor, is supposed to stimulate some molecular mediators, which transmit signals to downstream and finally affect chondrogenic differentiation. The molecular mediators which respond to Nell-1 in short time are our research objects, we called them primary response genes referred to pervious report . To find out Nell-1 primary response gene candidates, we first used microarray assays to analyze the differences of gene expression profile between rhNell-1 protein (100 ng/ml) and control (PBS) treatment.
