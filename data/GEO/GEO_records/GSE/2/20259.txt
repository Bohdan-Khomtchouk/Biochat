TITLE
Phylogenetic

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
A phylogenetic analysis of seven different species (human, mouse, rat, worm, fly, yeast, and plant) utilizing all (541) basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes identified, including expressed sequence tags (EST), was performed. A super-tree involving six clades and a structural categorization involving the entire coding sequence was established. A nomenclature was developed based on clade distribution to discuss the functional and ancestral relationships of all the genes. The position/location of specific genes on the phylogenetic tree in relation to known bHLH factors allows for predictions of the potential functions of uncharacterized bHLH factors, including EST's. A genomic analysis using microarrays for four different mouse cell types (i.e. Sertoli, Schwann, thymic, and muscle) was performed and considered all known bHLH family members on the microarray for comparison. Cell-specific groups of bHLH genes helped clarify those bHLH genes potentially involved in cell specific differentiation. This phylogenetic and genomic analysis of the bHLH gene family has revealed unique aspects of the evolution and functional relationships of the different genes in the bHLH gene family. PMID: 18557763 We used microarrays to determine bHLH expression in 20d rat Sertoli cells.

DESIGN
RNA samples from two control groups (Sertoli cells cultured for 72 h) are compared to two treated groups (Sertoli cells cultured for 72 h with cAMP).
