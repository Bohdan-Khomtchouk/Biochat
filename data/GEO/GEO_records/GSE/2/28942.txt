TITLE
Analysis of the gene expression pattern of the human corneal epithelial cells to prove the changing medium induces (suppresses) expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dr. Fukuda's laboratory is interested in determining how changing medium induces or suppresses expression of genes involved in keratan sulfte production in the corneal cells.  Human corneal epithelial cells can be induced for keratan sulfate production by replacing culture medium to a serum free medium. We speculate that changing medium induces (or suppress) expression of gene involved in keratan sulfate production in the corneal cells.  A microarray experiment is ideal for analyzing gene expression pattern of the cells.

DESIGN
RNA preparations from human corneal epithelial cells under normal culture condition (control) and under induced condition for keratan sulfate production (target) were sent to the Microarray Core (E). The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays. Data was analyzed by Core E and also provided to Dr. Fukuda's laboratory for analysis.
