TITLE
RL-SAGE analysis of Zea mays leaf transcriptome

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Using the RL-SAGE method (Gowda et al. 2004), a maize leaf longSAGE library (cv. inbred line B73) was constructed. Leaf tissues were harvested from 4-week old B73 plants for RNA isolation. The conditions in the growth chamber were 12 h light (500 Âµmol photons m-2 sec-1), 20oC at night, 26oC in the day and 85% relative humidity. A total of 44,870 unique tags (17 bases +CATG) were identified from 232,948 individual tags in the maize leaf library.

DESIGN
This GEO Series was created by the GEO staff as part of a cleanup effort to ensure that all GEO Samples are included within a Series entry.
