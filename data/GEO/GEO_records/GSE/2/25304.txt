TITLE
Isolation of poplar genes involved in xylem vessel differentiation

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
Downstream genes of PtVNS genes were explored with inducible expression system using glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Transgenic poplar plants expressing 35S:AtVND7-VP16-GR were treated with dexamethazone (DEX). A number of genes related to the formation of xylem vessels were induced by DEX.
