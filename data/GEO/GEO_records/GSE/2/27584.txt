SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Florencia Pauli ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track is produced as part of the ENCODE project. The track reports the percentage of DNA molecules that exhibit cytosine methylation at specific CpG dinucleotides. In general, DNA methylation within a gene's promoter is associated with gene silencing, and DNA methylation within the exons and introns of a gene is associated with gene expression. Proper regulation of DNA methylation is essential during development and aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer. DNA methylation status is assayed at more than 500,000 CpG dinucleotides in the genome using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS). Genomic DNA is digested with the methyl-insensitive restriction enzyme MspI, small genomic DNA fragments are purified by gel electrophoresis, and then used to construct an Illumina sequencing library. The library fragments are treated with sodium bisulfite and amplified by PCR to convert every unmethylated cytosine to a thymidine while leaving methylated cytosines intact. The sequenced fragments are aligned to a customized reference genome sequence and for each assayed CpG we report the number of sequencing reads covering that CpG and the percentage of those reads that are methylated.
