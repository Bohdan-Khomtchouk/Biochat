TITLE
Murine postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem cells (NSCs): Wild-type (WT) vs. Dnmt3a-null (KO)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse postnatal SVZ NSCs comparing WT NSCs with KO NSCs under proliferating/undifferentiated states as well as differentiating conditions. Goal was to determine Dnmt3a-dependent gene expression changes in postnatal SVZ NSCs

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment with a dye-swap design, WT NSCs vs. KO NSCs. Biological replicates: 4 replicates under proliferating/undifferentiation conditions, 2 replicates under differentiating conditions.
