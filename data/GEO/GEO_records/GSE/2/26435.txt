TITLE
Activation of STAT6 by STING Is Critical for Antiviral Innate Immunity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptional response of HEK293 or HEK293-STAT6 stable cell lines to poly(I:C) transfection. The hypothesis tested was that poly(I:C) transfection is capable of inducing the expression of STAT6-dependent antiviral genes.
