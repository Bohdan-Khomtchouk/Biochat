TITLE
Expression data from BIO-treated human epidermal keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human keratinocytes isolated from foreskin were cultured and treated with a GSK-3beta inhibitor, BIO. The effect of BIO was evaluated by the cell growth, clony formation and differentiating markers. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.
