TITLE
Clinical relevance of SKP2 alterations in metastatic melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Melanoma cell lines were genotyped to evaluate copy number differences between nodular melanoma (NM) and superficial spreading melanoma (SSM). Cell lines were also evaluated for copy number alterations in the SKP2/p27 axis. Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to manufacturer's instructions using DNA extracted from 18 melanoma cell lines and 4 melanocyte controls.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP6.0 Array data for melanoma cell lines Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed on 18 melanoma cell lines including 2 primary superficial spreading melanoma, 2 primary nodular melanoma, 2 metastatic nodular melanoma, and 12 metastatic cell lines. Four melanocyte control lines were also evaluated including 2 immortalized melanocyte cell lines (Hermes 1 and 2B) and 2 normal melanocyte lines cultured from neonatal foreskin (HEM-N and HEM-LP) that were used to construct the baseline for copy number analysis.
