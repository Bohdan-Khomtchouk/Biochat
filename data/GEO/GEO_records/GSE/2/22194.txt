TITLE
Absolute expression level of Candida glabrata genes

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
Total RNA versus genomic DNA hybridization on custom arrays designed for all Candida glabrata genes

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected in mid-log phase from Candida glabrata cells grown in rich medium (abbreviated CM, in house recipe). RNA was then converted to cDNA, Cy3-labeled and hybridized competitively against Cy5 labeled genomic DNA from Candida glabrata
