TITLE
Gene expression profile of mouse developmentally competent and incompetent (NSN) 2-cell embryos.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of gene expression in 2-cell embryos obtained from developmentally competent MII oocytes or developmentally incompetent MII (NSN) oocytes.

DESIGN
In this study we have compared the expression profile of 2-cell embryos obtained after  following in vitro fertilisation of  developmentally competent (control) or incompetent (NSN) MII oocytes with the aim of identifying the gene expression networks that operate at this specific stage of development.
