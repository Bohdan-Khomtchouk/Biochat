TITLE
Synthesis vs. Abundance, Bradyzoite Development

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
Parasites grown as either tachyzoites or bradyzoites for 40 hours were pulsed with 2,4-dithiouracil (DTU) for 1 hour.  Following the pulse, mRNA was extracted and either used directly in microarray experiments (Abundance Arrays) or biotinylated and purified to select DTU labeled RNAs that were then used in microarray experiments (Synthesis Arrays).  Two independent tachyzoite and bradyzoite preparations were made and duplicate microarrays were performed for each sample. A development or differentiation experiment design type assays events associated with development or differentiation or moving through a life cycle. Development applies to organism(s) acquiring a mature state, and differentiation applies to cells acquiring specialized functions. Keywords: development_or_differentiation_design
