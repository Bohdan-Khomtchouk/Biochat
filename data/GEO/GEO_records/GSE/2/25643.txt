Antagonism of B cell enhancer networks by STAT5 drives leukemia and poor patient survival

SUMMARY
The transcription factor STAT5 plays a critical role in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).  How STAT5 mediates this effect is unclear.  Here we demonstrate that STAT5 activation cooperates with defects in the pre-BCR signaling components encoded by Blnk, Btk, Prkcb, Nfkb1, and Ikzf1 to initiate B-ALL.  STAT5 antagonizes NF-κB and IKAROS by opposing regulation of shared target genes.  STAT5 binding was enriched at super-enhancers, which were associated with an opposing network of transcription factors, including PAX5, EBF1, PU.1, IRF4, and IKAROS.  Patients with high ratios of active STAT5 to NF-κB or IKAROS have more aggressive disease.  Our studies illustrate that an imbalance of two opposing transcriptional programs drive B-ALL, and suggest that restoring the balance of these pathways may inhibit B-ALL.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed on cells isolated from lymph nodes of Stat5b-CA, Stat5b-CA x Blnk+/-, Stat5b-CA x Xid-/-, Stat5b-CA x Pkrcb-/-, Stat5b-CA x Ebf1+/- and Stat5b-CA x Rag2-/- leukemic mice and pre B cells sorted from bone marrow of C57BL/6 wild type mice, Xid Mice, and Stat5b-CA non-leukemic mice. 40 Samples.
