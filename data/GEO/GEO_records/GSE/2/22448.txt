TITLE
Gene expression data from wild-type and Nlrc5 knockout GM-CSF induced bone marrow dendritic cells infected with Newcastle Disease virus.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nlrc5 is encoding a Nod-like receptor protein NLRC5/NOD27. To check the involvement of Nlrc5 in antiviral response, we examined gene expression profile in wild-type and Nlrc5 knockout GM-CSF bone marrow macrophage with using microarrays.

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells were cultured with GM-CSF and harvested on day 6. The induced dendritic cells were then stimulated with NDV at moi 1, collected at 0, 2, and 4 hours after infection. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to microarray experiment according to manufactures' instructions.
