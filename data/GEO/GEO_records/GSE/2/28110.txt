TITLE
Hai1 Mediates Inflammation Through MMP9

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Adults heterozygous for the hi2217 retroviral insertion within the HAI locus (Mathias et al 2007 JCS) were in-crossed for RNA from hi2217 mutants and corresponding WT siblings. Adults heterozygous for the hi1520 retroviral insertion within the Clint1 locus (Dodd et al, 2009) were in-crossed for RNA from hi1520 mutants and corresponding WT siblings.  Both hi2217 and hi1520 are mutants with epidermal defects and showing symptoms of chronic inflammation. In this study we aimed to compare the RNA expression changes between Wild-type siblings (a non-inflammatory status) and homozygous mutants (a chronic inflammatory status) for each mutant background (hi2217 and hi1520).

DESIGN
Pools of 30-50 zebrafish embryos of WT siblings and hi2217 or hi1520 mutants were collected for RNA isolation. RNA from the hi2217 mutant embryos or hi1520 mutant embryos (test samples)was labelled with Cy5 and hybridized against Cy3-labelled RNA from the corresponding WT sibling embryos (reference samples) . These experiments were performed in biological triplicate.
