TITLE
The 'PUCE CAFÉ' project: A genome-wide  15K coffee microarray, a new tool to discover candidate genes correlated to quality traits

ORGANISM
Coffea arabica

SUMMARY
Background: Understanding the genetic elements that contribute to key aspects of coffee biology will impact future agronomical improvements for this economically important tree. The past years, EST collections were generated in Coffee, opening the possibility to create new tools for functional genomics. Results: The project PUCE CAFE, set up by the scientific consortium NESTLE/IRD/CIRAD has developed of long oligonucleotide coffee array using public coffee EST sequences mainly obtained from different stages during fruit development and leaves in Coffea canephora (Robusta). We have performed a validation experiment in order to check the array usability and the reproducibility of hybridizations. Conclusion: We have generated the first 15K Coffee array during this three years project PUCE CAFE, granted by The French National Research Agency (ANR, Programme Génoplante) . This new tool was dedicated to large scale transcriptomic analysis during grain development of Coffea canephora grown in different countries . Furthermore, other analysis have been also initiated by the different partners like analysis of polyploidy or drought resistance. In any case, at the end of the project, the generated arrays will be available to the international scientific community.

DESIGN
three biological replicates were made for each tissue analyzed (i.e. leaves, flowers and mature beans). The following comparisons were made:  Bean-Flower, Leaf-Flower and Leaf-Bean. In all, we performed microarray analyses on 18 slides [3 (replicates) x 2 (dyes) x 3 (organs)]
