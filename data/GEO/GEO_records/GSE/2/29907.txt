TITLE
Regulation of Pkm2 by miR-122.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study identified Pkm2 to be highly expressed in human embryonic stem cells and hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and targeted by a microRNA that is highly expressed in human primary hepatocytes.

DESIGN
Gene expression patterns were compared from total RNA obtained from human embryonic stem cells, human primary hepatocytes, and hepG2 and hep3B.
