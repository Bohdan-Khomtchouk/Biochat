TITLE
Expression profiling of the Otx2 CKO retina

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the vertebrate retina, the Otx2 transcription factor plays a crucial role in the cell fate determination of both rod and cone photoreceptors.  Otx2 conditional knockout (CKO) mice exhibited a total absence of rods and cones in the retina due to their cell fate conversion to amacrine-like cells.  In order to investigate the entire transcriptome regulated by Otx2 in the developing retina, we performed microarray analysis on the Otx2 CKO retina.

DESIGN
In order to clarify the molecular role of Otx2 in transcriptional regulation during development, we investigated the expression profile of the Otx2 CKO retina compared with that of the control retina with the genotype Otx2flox/flox;Crx-cre- using microarrays at two time points, P1 and P12.
