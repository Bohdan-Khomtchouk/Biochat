TITLE
EQUIVALENCE OF CONVENTIONALLY-DERIVED AND PARTHENOTE-DERIVED HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Parthenote lines proliferated more slowly than conventional hESC lines, and yielded lower quantities of less mature differentiated cells in a neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation protocol. However, the cell lines performed  similarly in a RPE differentiation protocol. The DNA methylation analysis showed similar general profiles, but the two cell types differed in methylation of imprinted genes. There were no major differences in gene expression between the lines before differentiation, but when differentiated into NPCs, the two cell types differed in expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes. Conclusions/Significance: These data show that hESC and phESC are similar in the undifferentiated state, and both cell types are capable of differentiation along neural lineages. The differences between the cell types, in proliferation and extent of differentiation, may be linked, in part, to the observed differences in ECM synthesis and methylation of imprinted genes.
