TITLE
The transcriptome of nonpolypoid and polypoid preinvasive lesions of the human large intestine

ORGANISM

The aim was to analyze the transcriptome of different types of preneoplastic colorectal lesions in comparison with that of the corresponding normal mucosa.

DESIGN
Ninety-two samples were analyzed. Forty-two precancerous colorectal lesions (25 nonpolypoid, 17 polypoid) and 4 colorectal cancers, and the corresponding normal mucosa from the same colonic segment where the lesion was taken.
