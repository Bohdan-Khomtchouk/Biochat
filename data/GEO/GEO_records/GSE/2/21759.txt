TITLE
Genome Sequences of Lactococcus lactis MG1363 (Revised) and NZ9000 and Comparative Physiological Studies

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363

SUMMARY
Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 and its parent MG1363 are the most commonly used lactic acid bacteria for expression and physiological studies. We noted unexpected but significant differences in the growth behaviors of both strains. We sequenced the entire genomes of the original NZ9000 and MG1363 strains using an ultradeep sequencing strategy. The analysis of the L. lactis NZ9000 genome yielded 79 differences, mostly point mutations, with the annotated genome sequence of L. lactis MG1363. Resequencing of the MG1363 strain revealed that 73 out of the 79 differences were due to errors in the published sequence. Comparative transcriptomic studies revealed several differences in the regulation of genes involved in sugar fermentation, which can be explained by two specific mutations in a region of the ptcC promoter with a key role in the regulation of cellobiose and glucose uptake.
