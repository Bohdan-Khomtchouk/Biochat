TITLE
Expression data from Tamoxifen resistant Breast Cancer Cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tamoxifen Resistant (TR) gene profile from Breast cancer cell lines T47D and ZR75-1 with their oestrogen-deprieved conterparts were analysed for gene associated with TR. We used Microarray Affymetrix HU133plus 2.0 chips for gene expression of TR cell lines, normalised them against GEO data available for normal T47D (GSM70667) and ZR75-1 (GSM70668).

DESIGN
We grew parental breast cancer cell lines in tamoxifen containing media (0.1 microM) for 6 months and labelled them tamoxifen resistant (TR). Oestrogen-Deprieved cells were grown in charcoal-stripped media for 6 months then tamoxifen (0.1 microM) was added to the media and cells maintained a further 6 months and termed Oestrogen deprieved-tamoxifen resistant (ODTR) .
