TITLE
TGF-beta Sma/Mab signaling regulates a set of genes in oocytes associated with reproductive aging and another set in L4 associated with body size growth

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Reproductive cessation is perhaps the earliest aging phenotypes humans experience. Similarly, C. elegans' reproduction ceases in mid-adulthood. Although somatic aging has been studied in both worms and humans, mechanisms regulating reproductive aging are not yet understood. Here we show that TGF-beta Sma/Mab activity regulates reproductive aging transcriptionally separable from its regulation of body size growth. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
