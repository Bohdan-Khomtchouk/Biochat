TITLE
Effects of hTERT overexpression on gene expression profiles in CD4+ T lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression by Affymetrix microarray in a CD4+ T lymphocyte clone transduced with hTERT-GFP vector after after 44 and 80 population doublings (PDs). The untransduced (32 PDs) and GFP-control vector transduced (47 PDs) T cell clone populations served as controls. Keywords: ordered
