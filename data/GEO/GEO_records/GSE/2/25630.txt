TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in surgical specimens of primary glioblastoma multiform

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used a genome-wide coding gene expression profiling to identify a gene signature for the molecular classification or prognostic prediction of primary GBMs.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 21 surgical specimens of primary glioblastoma multiform.
