TITLE
Micromass Time Course

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary micromass cultures derived from 11.5 day old mouse embryo limb buds were cultured for 15 days in differentiating conditions (beta-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid). Total RNA from differentiating chondrocytes was isolated every three days i.e. days 3,6,9,12 and 15 and hybridized to MOE430A chips. Objective: Gain a view of the temporal gene expression changes occuring during chondrocyte differentiation. Keywords = micromass culture Keywords = temporal gene expression Keywords = mouse Keywords = chondrocyte differentiation Keywords: time-course
