TITLE
SCGB3A2 suppresses bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis through activation of STAT1 and up-regulation of SMAD7ã€€

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report for the first time that secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2, a novel cytokine-like molecule, predominantly expressed in pulmonary airways epithelium, drastically reduced the severity of lung fibrosis using bleomycin-induced mouse model.
