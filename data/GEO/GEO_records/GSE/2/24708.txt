TITLE
Histone 4 Lys-20 Mono-Methylation by SET8 Mediates Wnt Target Gene Activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone methylation has an important role in transcriptional regulation. However, unlike H3K4 and H3K9 methylation, the role of H4K20 mono-methylation (H4K20me-1) in transcriptional regulation remains unclear. Here we show that Wnt3a specifically stimulates H4K20 mono-methylation at TBE (TCF-binding element) via the histone methylase SET8. Additionally, SET8 is crucial for activation of the Wnt reporter gene and target genes in both mammalian cells and zebrafish. Furthermore, SET8 interacts with TCF4/LEF1 directly, and this interaction is regulated by Wnt3a. Therefore, we conclude that SET8 is a Wnt signaling mediator and is recruited by LEF1/TCF4 to regulate the transcription of Wnt-activated genes, possibly via H4K20 mono-methylation at the target gene promoters. Our findings also indicate that H4K20me-1 is a marker for gene transcription activation, at least in canonical Wnt signaling. This chip experiment was carried out to find out how many genes would be regulated by SET8 after Wnt3a CM stimulated HEK293 cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from HEK293 cells after siRNA transfection (control or SET8 shRNA) for about 40 hours and then induced with Control or Wnt3a CM for 7 hours using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Three pairs of samples: si-control + control CM / si-control + Wnt3a CM 7 h / si-SET8 + Wnt3a CM. Samples were amplified and labeled using a NimbleGen One-Color DNA Labeling Kit.
