TITLE
A Novel Copper Responsive Regulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains mpA and pafA

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
In this study, we report the identification of a five-locus copper-inducible regulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The identification of a copper responsive regulon unique to pathogenic Mycobacteria suggests copper homeostasis must be maintained during an infection.

DESIGN
WT and mutant Mtb cells were grown in Sautonâ€™s minimal media to early stationary phase (OD580 = 1.5) and treated with 500 mM copper sulfate (CuSO4) for four hours or the absence.
