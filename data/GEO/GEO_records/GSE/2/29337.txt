TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the WalKR regulon in Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus NCTC 8325

SUMMARY
The WalKR regulon was studied by comparing genes expression in a strain producing a constitutively active WalR regulator (WalRc) versus the wild type strain carrying the empty expression vector. Hybridizations were performed with three independent biological replicates. Our data allowed to identify 165 genes differentially expressed in the walRc expressing strain with a P-value â‰¤ 0.05 using Z-test and a threshold value of two-fold change in transcriptional levels. Among them, 108 genes are activated, and 57 genes are repressed. About 10% of these results were confirmed by quantitative real time PCR, revealing the high reliability of this overall study. Beyond the major effect of the WalKR system on genes expressing cell wall hydrolases, we have shown that it activates a large number of genes involved in virulence, and probably through its positive impact on the SaeRS two-component system, is a major activator of S. aureus virulence.
