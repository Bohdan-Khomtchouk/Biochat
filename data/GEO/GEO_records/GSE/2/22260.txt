TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic analysis of prostate cancer and matched normal tissue using RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to interrogate prostate cancer specific gene fusions, alternative splicings, somatic mutations and novel transcripts.

DESIGN
We sequenced the transcriptome (polyA+) of 20 prostate cancer tumors and 10 matched normal tissues using Illumina GAII platform. Then we used bioinformatic approaches to identify prostate cancer specific aberrations which include gene fusion, alternative splicing, somatic mutation, etc.
