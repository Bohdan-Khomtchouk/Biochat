TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (Affymetrix data)

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida KT2440

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to monitore the gene expression of P. putida after a cold shock from 30째C to 10째C

DESIGN
Culture was grown in minimal medium supplemented with succinate at 30째C. In mid-exp. phase cells were harvested for subsequent RNA extraction (standard condition) and medium was cooled down to 10째C. Two hrs after reaching the temperature, cells were again harvested for RNA extraction.
