TITLE
Gene expression profiles of NIH3T3 influenced by MARVELD1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate biological function of MARVELD1, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a platform to analyze gene expression alternation influenced by MARVELD1. MARVELD1 stably transfected NIH3T3 and control vector cells were used to compare their gene expression profiling.
