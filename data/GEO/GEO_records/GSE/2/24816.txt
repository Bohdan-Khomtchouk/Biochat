TITLE
Transcriptional changes in Sohlh1 knockout and Sohlh2 knockout mouse newborn ovaries

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sohlh1 and Sohlh2 are germ cell-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors critical in early folliculogenesis. We discovered that Sohlh1 and Sohlh2 knockout females lose oocytes after birth and few remains by postnatal day 14. Here, we show that many genes preferentially expressed in the oocytes are misregulated by Sohlh1 and/or Sohlh2 deficiency.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples isolated from wildtype, Sohlh1 KO and Sohlh2 KO mouse newborn ovaries were arrayed on the Illumina BeadChip MouseWG-6 2.0 arrays. We have 4 replicates for wildtype and Sohlh1 KO and 3 replicates for Sohlh2 KO.
