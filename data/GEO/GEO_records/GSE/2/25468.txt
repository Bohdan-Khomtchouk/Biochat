TITLE
Expression data from Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) infected with Toxoplasma gondii.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Toxoplasma strains have been shown to modulate host cell transcription.  We have found a type II Toxoplasma gene, GRA15, which activates the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB p65 transcription factor. We used microarrays to determine how GRA15II modulates host cell transcription.
