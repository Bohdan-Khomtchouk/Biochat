TITLE
RNA profiles of total RNA and Ago2-immunoprecipitated RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Compared gene enrichment in Ago2-RNA immunopreciptant between wildtype and Mir140-null chondrocytes Identified Mir140 targets that are most exclusively regulated by Mir140

DESIGN
Biological duplicate.  Total RNA and Ago2-immunoprecipitated RNA were prepared from the same primary chondrocyte culture.  Chondrocytes were isolated from newborn mouse rib and cultured overnight in 10%FCS-containing medium.  Total RNA and Ago2-immunoprecipitated RNA were amplified using Ovation pico, and subjected to microarray analysis (HT-mouse 430 PM).  Two sets of experiments (two samples from wildtype mice for total RNA and Ago2 immunoprecipitated RNA, and two samples from Mir140-null mice for total RNA and Ago2 immunoprecipitated RNA) were performed (a total of 8 chips)
