TITLE
Expression analysis of dissected GPi in Parkinson's disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of expression changes in Globus Pallidus interna (GPi) from Parkinson's disease brain tissue versus control brain tissue.

DESIGN
Post-mortem brain expression analysis performed in 10 PD brain samples and 10 control brain samples.
