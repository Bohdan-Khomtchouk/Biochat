TITLE
Single tip transcriptomics of neighboring hyphae of Aspergillus niger

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger CBS 513.88

SUMMARY
Mycelia of filamentous fungi explore new substrates by means of hyphae that extend from the periphery of the colony. Previously, it has been shown by immuno-labelling, reporter studies and in situ hybridization that these exploring hyphae are heterogenic with respect to protein secretion and transcription. We performed single hyphal tip RNA profiling using microarrays to assess the differences in RNA accumulation in neighboring exploring hyphae
