TITLE
Expression analysis of Pichia stipitis CBS 6054 grown in glucose or xylose

ORGANISM
Scheffersomyces stipitis CBS 6054

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Pichia stipitis CBS 6054 grown aerobically in xylose, compared to the same strain grown aerobically in glucose.

DESIGN
A six array study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of Pichia stipitis CBS 6054 grown in glucose and three separate cultures of Pichia stipitis CBS 6054 grown in xylose.  Each array measures the expression level of 374,100 probes (average probe length 53.6 +/- 4.1 nt) tiled across the Pichia stipitis CBS 6054 genome with a median spacing distance of 33 nt.  During data processing, probes are filtered to include only those probes corresponding to annotated protein-coding genes.
