TITLE
The impact of BRCA2A and SSN2 on plant defense genes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
BRCA2A: We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes. We focused on those genes that were dramatically salicylic acid-induced ( > 2-fold) and BRCA2A-dependent in npr1 sni1 double mutants SSN2: We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes. We focused on those genes that were dramatically salicylic acid-induced (P < 0.05) and SSN2-dependent in npr1 sni1 double mutants

DESIGN
BRCA2A: 3-week old npr1 sni1 and npr1 sni1 brca2a mutants were treated with salicylic acid for 16 hours. Replicates are derived from three independent biological experiments. SSN2: 3-week old npr1 sni1 ssn2 mutants were treated with salicylic acid for 16 hours. Replicates are derived from two (SA treated) or three (water treated) independent biological experiments.
