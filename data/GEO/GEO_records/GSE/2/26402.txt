TITLE
Identification and analysis of microRNAs associated with drought tolerance in cowpea

ORGANISM
Vigna unguiculata

SUMMARY
To identify novel microRNAs that are associated with drought tolerance in two different cowpea genotypes, we generated small RNA sequences from adult cowpea plants under control and dought stress treatments. Over 79 million raw reads were generated and numerous novel microRNAs are identified, including some associated with drought tolerance.
