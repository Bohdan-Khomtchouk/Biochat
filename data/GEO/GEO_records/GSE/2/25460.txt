TITLE
COMPARISON OF THE GIARDIA LAMBLIA TROPHOZOITE AND CYST TRANSCRIPTOME

ORGANISM
Giardia intestinalis

SUMMARY
To investigate the magnitude of the transcriptional changes occurring  during the life cycle of Giardia  lamblia we compared the transcriptome of trophozoites and cysts.  Cysts were found to possess a much smaller transcriptome, both in terms of mRNA diversity and abundance. Genes encoding proteins related to ribosomal functions are highly over-represented.  In cysts which have lost infectivity the transcriptome is further depleted. In contrast, exposure of cysts to conditions which promote excystation induced transcription.
