TITLE
Expression profiling of vascular endothelial cells using minimal input material

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling using minimal endothelial cell numbers isolated from 2 phenotypic groups (condition A and B). In total 64 GeneChips were processed, 12 Genechips for condition A and 52 GeneChips for condition B.

DESIGN
Vascular endothelial cell scraping biopsies were collected and endothelial cells postively enriched (CD-146) from 2 different phenotypic groups. RNA extraction and probe generation were carried out using workflows optimised for use with minimal input material.
