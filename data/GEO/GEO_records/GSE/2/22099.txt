TITLE
ERalpha ChIP-chip from HeLA-ER cells treated with E2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are studying the mechanisms by which the estrogen receptor, ERalpha, is recruited to and regulates genes with a non-direct DNA binding.  We performed ChIP-chip for ERalpha in E2 treated HeLa-ER cells, and looked at 19000 RefSeq genes to determine binding patterns of the receptor at promoters.  The experiment was performed in duplicate.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip biological replicates for Eralpha in E2 treated HeLa-ER cells are included.
