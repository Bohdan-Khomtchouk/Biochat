TITLE
Analysis of active and inactive X chromosome architecture reveals the independent organization of 30-nm and large scale chromatin structures

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using a genetic model, we present a high resolution chromatin fibre analysis of transcriptionally active (Xa) and inactive (Xi) X chromosomes packaged into euchromatin and facultative heterochromatin. Our results show that gene promoters have an open chromatin structure that is enhanced upon transcriptional activation but the Xa and the Xi have similar overall 30-nm chromatin fibre structures. Therefore, the formation of facultative heterochromatin is dependent on factors that act at a level above the 30-nm fibre and transcription does not alter bulk chromatin fibre structures. However, large scale chromatin structures on Xa are decondensed compared to the Xi and transcription inhibition is sufficient to promote large scale chromatin compaction. We show a link between transcription and large scale chromatin packaging independent of the bulk 30-nm chromatin fibre and propose that transcription, not the global compaction of 30-nm chromatin fibres, determines the cytological appearance of large scale chromatin structures. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
