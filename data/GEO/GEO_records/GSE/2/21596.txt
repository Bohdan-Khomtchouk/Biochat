SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is initially dependent on androgens for survival and growth, making hormonal therapy the cornerstone treatment for invasive tumors. However, despite initial remission, the cancer will inevitably recur. The present study was set to investigate how androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells eventually survive and resume growth under androgen-deprived and antiandrogen supplemented conditions Microarray technology was used to analyze differences in gene expression between androgen-responsive and hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell lines. As model system, we used the androgen-responsive PC346C cells and its castration-resistant sublines: PC346DCC, PC346Flu1 and PC346Flu2. These sublines were derived from the parental PC346C by long-term androgen ablation (PC346DCC), supplemented with the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide (PC346Flu1 and PC346Flu2). Previous studies revealed distinct AR modifications in all three castration-resistant sublines: AR overexpression (PC346Flu1), AR down-regulation (PC346DCC) and  T877A AR mutation (PC346Flu2).

DESIGN
Each of the hormone-refractory sublines were cultured in their respective selection medium (steroid-stripped medium for PC346DCC, supplemented with 1 mM OH-Flutamide for PC346Flu1 and Flu2) and hybridized on the microarrays, together with the parental androgen-responsive PC346C (cultured in complete medium supplemented with 0.1 nM R1881). To account for the biological variability and dye-preferential binding to oligonucleotides on the microarray, four replicate arrays were performed per cell line, using two independent cell passages in dye-swap.
