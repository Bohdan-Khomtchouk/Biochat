TITLE
Expression data from Columbia Lung Adenocarcinoma Human Tumor Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The World Health Organization has subclassified adenocarcinoma based upon predominant cell morphology and growth pattern such as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC), adenocarcinoma with mixed subtypes (AC-mixed), and homogenously invasive tumors with a variety of histological patterns Pure invasive adenocarcinomas are often devoid of bronchioloalveolar morphology. The clinical importance of lung adenocarcinoma invasion is supported by several recent studies  indicating that the risk of death in non-mucinous BAC  is significantly lower than that of pure invasive tumors and in tumors with greater than 0.6 cm of fibrosis or linear invasion (J Thorac Oncol 6:244-285) To identify human tumor cell signatures associated with lung adenocarcinoma subtype and invasion, we performed microarray gene expression profiling of microdissected tumor cells noninvasive AC  and AC-Mixed invasive tumors.

DESIGN
17 cases of noninvasive AC tumors and 23 cases of AC-mixed subtype invasive lung adenocarcinomas resected from 2002 to 2006 were examined (Columbia Lung Adenocarcinoma dataset)
