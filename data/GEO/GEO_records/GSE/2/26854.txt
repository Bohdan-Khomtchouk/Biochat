TITLE
differential gene expression in Sensitive and Resistant Pig to Escherichia coli F18

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
An M307 G/A point mutation of FUT1 gene has been considered as a usful marker to select the piglets that are sensitive(GG/AG genotype) or resistant(AA) to Escherichia coli F18 in foreign pig breeds.However,it is not suitable to Chinese native breeds. Duodenal tissues were collected from 8 full-sib pairs of Sutai pigs (a new hybrid between the Duroc and Taihu breeds) at the age of 28-day differing in adhesion phenotype to find the differential genes that can be used as the candidate genes fit for Chinese native breeds.

DESIGN
piglets at the age of 28-day sensitive (GG/AG genotype) to Escherichia coli F18 vs resistant(AA) ones.Biological replicates:8 full-sib pairs of Sutai pigs (4 pairs for GG/AA genotype of FUT1 gene, 4 pairs for AG/AA genotype)
