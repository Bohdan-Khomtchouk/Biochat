TITLE
The role of yeast IME2 in early meiotic gene expression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We examined global RNA expression in S. cerevisiae wild type cells and ime2D cells (lacking the IME2 gene) that were induced to enter meiosis. These data have provided evidence that the Ime2 protein kinase is required for normal transcription of many genes that contain cell cycle box promoter elements.

DESIGN
Cells populations were induced to enter meiosis synchronously and gene expression was analyzed at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours. Two independent experiments were performed.
