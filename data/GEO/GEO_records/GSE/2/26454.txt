TITLE
Gene expression profiles of CARM1 overexpression in MCF7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify ERalpha-target genes affected by overexpression of the histone arginine methyltransferase CARM1 in breast cancer cells. The roles of CARM1 in ERalpha+ breast cancer was not well characterized. Therefore, we created a Dox inducible CARM1 overexpressing MCF7 cell line where CARM1 is overexpressed by 2 fold to determine the created a Dox-inducible CARM1 overexpressing MCF7 cells for evaluation of the global effects of CARM1 on Eralpha-target gene expression.
