TITLE
How do consumers deal with stoichiometric constraints?

ORGANISM
Daphnia pulex

SUMMARY
Determine gene expression in daphnia exposed to biotic and abiotic stressors. Identify in Daphnia pulex unique gene regulatory patterns involved in the regulation of limited phosphorous.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment: Exposed Daphnia pulex for 5 days to phosphorous-limited algae. Biological replicates: 4 exposures, 4 nonexposed controls, grown and harvested in groups of 20 daphnia. One replicate per array.
