TITLE
miRNA Profiles of Long-Lived Individuals (

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This project analyzes peripheral blood profiles of patients of age 90 or above and aims to detect profiles that distinguish them from younger controls.

DESIGN
n = 55 normal controls and n = 15 long lived individuals have been screened for the complete miRNA repertoire. Please note that each miRNA has been measured in seven replicates and the median of the replica has been computed.
