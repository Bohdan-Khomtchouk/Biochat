TITLE
DeepCAGE and DeepSAGE with proliferating and differentiated C2C12 mouse myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We use tag-based next generation sequencing analysis to quantify gene expression levels during myogenic differentiation and focused on the identifcation of novel 3' ends with DeepSAGE and novel 5' ends with DeepCAGE.
