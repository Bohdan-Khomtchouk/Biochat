TITLE
Analysis of small RNA population in Arabidopsis drb2 and drb4 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We have compared populations of small (21 to 24-nt) RNAs from Arabidopsis immature flowers of WT, drb2 and drb4 mutants and found that DRB2 and DRB4 are needed for the proper biogenesis of polymerase IV-dependent siRNAs
