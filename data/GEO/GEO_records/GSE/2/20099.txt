TITLE
microRNA/UCR expression profiling of human Barrett's carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test the hypothesis that there are specific miRNA/UCR expression signature which characterizes Barrett's esophagus development and progression, we performed miRNA/UCR microarray analysis comparing normal esophageal squamous epithelium with all the phenotypic lesions seen in the Barrett's carcinogenic process
