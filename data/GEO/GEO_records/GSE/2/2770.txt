TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of Th cells induced to polarize to Th1 or Th2 direction in the presence or absence of TGFbeta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Th1 and Th2 cells arise from a common precursor cell in response to triggering through the TCR and cytokine receptors for IL-12 or IL-4. This leads to activation of complex signaling pathways, which are not known in detail. Disturbances in the balance between type 1 and type 2 responses can lead to certain immune-mediated diseases. Thus, it is important to understand how Th1 and Th2 cells are generated. To clarify the mechanisms as to how IL-12 and IL-4 induce Th1 and Th2 differentiation and how TGF-beta can inhibit this process, we have used oligonucleotide arrays to examine the early polarization of Th1 and Th2 cells in the presence and absence of TGF-beta after 0, 2, 6 and 48 hours of polarization. Keywords: time course, differentiation
