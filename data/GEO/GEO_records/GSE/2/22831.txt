TITLE
DNA methylation analysis by MeDIP-on-chip in mouse E3.5 blastocysts, E6.5 epiblasts and E9.5 whole embryos.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is extensively reprogrammed during early phases of mammalian development yet individual genomic targets of this process are largely unknown. We optimized MeDIP (Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation) for low numbers of cells and profiled DNA methylation genome-wide during early development of the mouse embryonic lineage in vivo.

DESIGN
We mapped DNA methylation at 3 consecutive stages of early development: E3.5 blastocysts, E6.5 epiblasts and E9.5 whole embryos. MeDIP and Input samples were hybridized to Nimblegen HD2 MM8 promoter deluxe arrays covering 12 kb of all gene promoters. Experiments were performed in duplicates for E3.5 blastocysts and triplicates for E6.5 epibalsts and E9.5 embryos. As a control we also hybridized pooled unamplified MeDIPs from E9.5 to Nimblegen 385K MM8 RefSeq promoter arrays.
