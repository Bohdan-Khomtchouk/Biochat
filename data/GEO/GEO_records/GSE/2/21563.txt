TITLE
RgfC/A regulated genes in Streptococcus agalactiae strain A909

ORGANISM
Streptococcus agalactiae A909

SUMMARY
Genes that showed altered expression between wild type A909 and isogenic rgfC/A mutant were identified. A strain with a deletion in RgfC/A (SAK_1917/SAK_1918) was derived and microarray analysis was performed to identify genes regulated by the RgfC/A two component system. strain comparison, global regulation, two component system
