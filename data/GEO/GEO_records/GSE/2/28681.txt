TITLE
Gene expression profiling of epithelial and mesenchymal subpopulations within immortalized human mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For gene expression profiling, we used immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMLE) to isolate a pure epithelial fraction of cells by positive selection for CD24 expression using Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting (=24hi). We independently isolated 3 mesenchymal subpopulations (msp1-3) from HMLE cells by collecting floating cells from cultured monolayer HMLE cells.
