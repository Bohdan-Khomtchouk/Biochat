SUMMARY
Subtle variations in Pten dose determine cancer susceptibility: Gene expression profiling for MEF cells from a Ptenhy/+ mouse model. We have analyzed the survival and tumor spectrum in a population of Pten ‘hypermorphic’ mice (Ptenhy/+), which express approximately 80% of total Pten protein. Notably, the Ptenhy/+ developed a spectrum of tumors of variable latencies, with breast tumors occurring at the highest penetrance. Surprisingly, all breast tumors analyzed retain two intact copies of Pten, and maintain Pten protein levels above that observed in heterozygosity. Importantly, subtle down-regulation of Pten was found to alter the expression profile of genes involved in cell proliferation. Taken together, our findings support the notion that initiation of tumorigenesis can occur in the absence of genetic hits, thereby questioning the uniqueness of a saltatory model for cancer susceptibility. In order to understand whether subtle variations in Pten level may affect pathways involved in tumorigenesis, we analyzed the genome-wide expression profile of Ptenhy/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

DESIGN
In the Ptenhy/+ mouse model, mice are born with approximately 80% of total Pten protein and are viable and normally fertile. To decrease the expression level of Pten below homozygosity, we targeted intron 3 of Pten with a neomycin (Neo) cassette, under the control of the strong CMV promoter, thereby taking advantage of transcriptional interference. Next, we intercrossed Pten hy/+ mice with Pten+/- mice to generate cohorts of hypomorphic littermate mice with decreasing levels of Pten expression as follows: Ptenwt > Ptenhy/+ > Pten+/- > Ptenhy/- mice littermates. To preserve a constant 129/C57BL/6 mixed genetic background, we have crossed Pten hy/+ mice with Pten +/- for more than seven generations prior to analysis.  As expected, Ptenhy/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) display a level of Pten protein below Ptenwt and above Pten+/- .
