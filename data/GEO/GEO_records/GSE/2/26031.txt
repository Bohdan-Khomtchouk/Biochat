TITLE
LIM domain binding protein 1 regulates a transcriptional program essential for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used ChIP-Seq to map Ldb1, Scl and Gata2 binding sites in mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Together with functional studies using conventional and conditional Ldb1 deficient mouse models and bioinformatics analysis, we systematically determined a transcriptional program controlled by Ldb1 complexes in HSC maintenance.

DESIGN
To evaluate the role of Ldb1 in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance.
