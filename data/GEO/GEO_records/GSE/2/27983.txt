TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression perturbed by RORa in MEFs subjected to control and 12 hour DNA damaged condition.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the role of RORa on the expression of damage responsive genes across the whole genome, we performed a microarray analysis from RNAs isolated from wild type MEFs or staggerer MEFs in control and damaged conditions.

DESIGN
Wild type MEFs and staggerer MEFs were treated doxorubicin for 12 hours. Cells were then lysed and RNA isolated.
