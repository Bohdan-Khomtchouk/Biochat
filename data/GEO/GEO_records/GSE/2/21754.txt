TITLE
Expression data from white adipose tissue of Perilipin A transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Perilipin A (PeriA) exclusively locates on adipocyte lipid droplets and is essential for lipid storage and lipolysis. Adipocyte specific overexpression of PeriA caused resistance to diet-induced obesity and resulted in improved insulin sensitivity. In order to better understand the biological basis for this observed phenotype we performed DNA microarray analysis on white adipose tissue (WAT) from PeriA transgenic (Tg) and control wildtype (WT) mice.

DESIGN
We generated transgenic mice that overexpressed human PeriA using the adipocyte specific aP2 promoter/enhancer (Miyoshi, et al. J Lipid Res 2010). All PeriA Tg mice used for the study were female, and heterozygous for the transgene. Littermates that lacked the transgene were used as controls (WT). All mice were housed at room temperature, maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle, given free access to water, and fed a high-fat diet (HFD) until the age of 30 weeks. On the day prior to tissue harvest at 30 weeks, WAT from perigonadal were rapidly dissected out, extracted total RNA, and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
