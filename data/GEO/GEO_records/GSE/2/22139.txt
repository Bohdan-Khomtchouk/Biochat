Bone morphogenetic protein-7 is a MYC target with pro-survival functions in childhood medulloblastoma

SUMMARY
Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, among whom overexpression or amplification of MYC oncogenes has been associated with poor clinical outcome. Although the MYC functions during normal development and oncogenesis in various systems have been extensively investigated, the transcriptional targets mediating MYC effects in MB are still elusive. Their identification and roles during MB onset and progression are important and will ultimately suggest novel potential therapeutic targets. cDNA microarray analysis was used to compare the effects of overexpressing and silencing MYC on the transcriptome of a MB-derived cell line. We identified 209 genes with potential relevance to MYC-dependent cellular responses in MB. Among the MYC-responsive genes, we found members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role during the development of the cerebellum. In particular, the cytokine gene BMP7 was identified as a direct target of MYC in MB cells. Similar to the effect induced by BMP7 silencing by siRNA, the use of a small-molecule inhibitor of the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway reduced cell viability in a panel of MB cells. Altogether, our findings indicate that high MYC levels drive BMP7 expression in MB to induce pro-survival and pro-proliferative cellular pathways. This observation suggests that targeting the BMP/SMAD pathway may be a new therapeutic concept for the treatment of childhood MB.

DESIGN
6 samples (3 replicates for each sample): wild-type MB cell line, empty vector-transfected control cell line, 2 c-MYC-overexpressing clones, 1 clone upon c-MYC silencing, 1 silencing control cell line.
