TITLE
Transcritptome of a revR deletion mutant during Clostridium perfringens exponential phase growth.

ORGANISM
Clostridium perfringens str. 13

SUMMARY
RevR is a putative orphan response regulator with a high degree of similarity to YycF from Bacilus subtilis and PhoB from Clostridium kluyveri.  A revR deletion mutant of C. perfringens strain 13 was generated and the transcriptome analysed using microarrays.
