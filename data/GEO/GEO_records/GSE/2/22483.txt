TITLE
Hormone-Independence of Prostate Cancer Cells is Supported by the Androgen Receptor without Binding to Classical Response Elements

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Treatment of late passage (LP50) LNCaP cells with R1881 (androgen) and AR shRNA identified a gene program controlled by androgen receptor in the absence of androgen.

DESIGN
Gene expression in late passage (LP50) LNCaP cells that had enhanced androgen-independent growth was determined in androgen-depleted medium in response to R1881 or AR knock down via AR shRNA
