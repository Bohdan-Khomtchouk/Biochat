TITLE
Yeast response to acid stress

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Intracellular pH affects many cellular systems but its mechanisms of regulation and perception are mostly unknown. Weak organic acids such as acetate are potent fungistatic agents used in food preservation, but their intracellular targets are poorly understood. We thus searched for transcriptional response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to intracellular acidification caused by two hours 30mM acetic acid treatment.

DESIGN
Two independent experiments were performed for both acid-treated/non-treated cells. The experimental design for both cases was a Balanced Block Design with four biological replicates, two of them dye swaps.
