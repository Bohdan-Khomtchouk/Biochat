TITLE
Uniform Topographic Responses of the Small Airway Epithelium to Cigarette Smoking

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although smoking-induced lung disease tends to be more common in the upper lobe, it is not known if this results from the skewed distribution of inhaled cigarette smoke or increased susceptibility of the upper lobes to these disorders. The distribution of inhaled cigarette smoke within the lung is complex, depending on lung pressure-volume relationships, gravity, individual smoking habits and the properties of the individual components of cigarette smoke. With the knowledge that the small airway epithelium is the earliest site of smoking-induced lung disease, and that the small airway epithelium is acutely sensitive to inhaled cigarette smoke with significant changes in the up- and down-regulation of hundreds of genes, we compared upper vs lower lobe gene expression in the small airway epithelium of the same cigarette smokers to determine if the gene expression patterns were similar or different. Active smokers (n=11) with early evidence of smoking-induced lung disease (normal spirometry but low diffusing capacity) underwent bronchoscopy and brushing of the small airway epithelium to compare upper vs lower lobe genome-wide gene expression assessed by microarray. Interestingly, cluster and principal component analysis demonstrated that, for each individual, the expression of the known small airway epithelium smoking-responsive genes were remarkably similar as upper vs lower lobe pairs, although, as expected, there were differences in the smoking-induced changes in gene expression from individual to individual. Thus, while there may be topographic differences in the distribution of cigarette smoke, sufficient smoke reaches the upper vs lower lobe small airway epithelium so that, within each smoker, the upper vs lower lobe gene expression are similar. These observations support the concept that the topographic differences in the occurrence of the smoking-induced lung diseases are likely secondary to topographic differences in the susceptibility of the upper vs lower lobes to cigarette smoke, not the topographic differences in distribution of inhaled cigarette smoke.

DESIGN
Gene expression of the small airway epithelium was assessed in the upper and lower lobe of 11 individuals with normal spirometry, but a low diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO).
