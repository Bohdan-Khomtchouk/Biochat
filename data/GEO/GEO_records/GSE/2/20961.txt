TITLE
Functional Variomics Library testing for drug resistance in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Variants of the essential genes in budding yeast S. cerevisae were cloned into a variomics library, and tested for their ability to confer resistance to three different drugs. Genes were tagged with molecular barcodes, and the relative change in abundance of the molecular barcodes are detected using a spotted Agilent synthesized microarray.

DESIGN
Three condition experiment (3 drugs, rapamycin, tunicamycin and cycloheximide).
