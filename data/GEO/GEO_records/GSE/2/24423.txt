TITLE
Transcriptomic characterization of the diabetic retinal response to chronic insulin treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify alterations associated with diabetes-induced functional dysregulation of the retina and the effects of chronic insulin therapy.  Transcriptional profiling through microarray analysis was analyzed to find mRNA targets of interest in diabetic samples, as well as in the insulin treated group.   Verification of targets shown to be unrecovered in the insulin group was validated.
