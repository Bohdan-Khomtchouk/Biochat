TITLE
Elucidation of cell type specific Ecdysone Receptor Binding

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Cell lines from two tissue types (embryonic and imaginal discs) were utilzed in a DAM-ID  study in order to identify tissue specific receptor binding sites. We have found novel binding sites, unique to each cell type, with about 20% overall overlap and about 50% overlap between cells from common tissues.
