TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of mouse cerebral cortical neural progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of neural progenitor/stem cells is limited by the lack of a reliable method for cell isolation. We have designed a genetic dual reporter strategy that can allow prospective isolation of cortical neural progenitor cells and their neuronal progeny form the same animals. These cells should be a good cell source for comparative global analysis.

DESIGN
Cortical neural progenitor cells and their neuronal progeny were purified using a dual reporter strategy. The purified cells were used for comparative expression profiling.
