TITLE
Genome-wide effect of islet isolation and in vitro culture on gene expression profile of pancreatic beta-cells enriched tissue.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It is known that the stresses encountered during islet isolation have deleterious effects on beta-cell physiology. The nature of these effects, however, is incompletely known, partly due to the heterogeneity of islet preparations. The objective was to assess the genome-wide effect of islet isolation and in-vitro culture on beta-cell transcriptome. Beta cells identified by their intrinsic autofluorescence, were captured from donor pancreas and isolated islets using Laser Capture Microdissection. Beta cells from donor pancreas serve as the control. Our results indicated induction of a strong inflammatory response induced by islet isolation which continues during in vitro culture manifested by upregulation of several cytokines, chemokines and their receptors. IL-8 was induced by 3.6-fold and 56-fold in fresh and 3-days cultured islets respectively. Concordantly, several pancreatic progenitor cell-specific transcription factors like were upregulated in cultured islets, suggesting progressive transformation of mature beta-cell phenotype toward an immature endocrine cell phenotype.

DESIGN
There are three sample types in our experiment; 1) beta-cells captured from the frozen sections of donor pancreas n=8, 2) beta cells extracted from islets frozen immediately after isolation (d0 islets) n=8 and, 3) beta cells extracted from isolated islets frozen after culturing for 3 days (d3 islets) n=5. For the analysis, beta cells from pancreas were considered as the reference point.
