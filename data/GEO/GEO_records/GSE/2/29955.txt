TITLE
Expression data from cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown of OPG and from HVSMCs incubated with RANKL or TRAIL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to assess gene expression changes in cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown of OPG compared to normal cells. Furthermore, we used microarrays to assess gene expression in cells treated with either RANKL or TRAIL compared to vehicle-treated cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from cells and amplified to biotin-labeled aRNA and hybridized to microarray chips.
