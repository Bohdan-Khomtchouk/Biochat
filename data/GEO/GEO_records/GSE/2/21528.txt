TITLE
Induction of a peptide with activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens in the Aedes aegypti salivary gland, following infection with dengue virus

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
Dengue viruses (DENV) are generally maintained in a cycle which requires horizontal transmission via their arthropod vector, Ae. Aegypti, to the vertebrate host. One important consequence of this process is the interference of these arboviruses with both invertebrate and vertebrate immune systems. While infection of vertebrates causes disease, the presence of DENV gives rise to life-long, persistent infection in mosquitoes. The results of a comparative transcriptome analysis between DENV-infected and uninfected salivary glands revealed activation of both the immune deficiency (IMD) and the Toll pathways, as well as involvement of the putative antibacterial cecropin-like peptide (AAEL000598), in controlling DENV infection in Ae. aegypti. The mature form of this peptide was found to be active against DENV and Chikungunya viruses, whereas its precursor also had a strong anti-Leishmania effect. This study is the first to establish a comparative transcriptome analysis of DENV-infected and uninfected salivary glands and demonstrates that certain DENV-induced peptides, that are part of the IMD pathway, possess broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic activity and may have therapeutic potential in human.
