TITLE
Transcriptional profile analysis of Candida dubliniensis chlamydospores compared to yeast cells

ORGANISM
Candida dubliniensis

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the biology of chlamydospores, we compared global gene expression in C. dubliniensis yeast cells and chlamydospores.  This revealed that 11% of the genes greater than 2-fold upregulated in chlamydospores were genes regulated by the transcriptional repressor Nrg1. These mainly included genes involved in glucose metabolism and glucose transport. Other upregulated genes included genes involved in stress response, cell cycle control, chromatin regulation, chromosome rearrangements, DNA repair-recombination and pheromone response. Genes related to mitochondrial respiratory functions and biogenesis were found to be downregulated in chlamydospores. Our data confirm that chlamydospores represent a specialised growth form of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis.

DESIGN
2 experimental parameters were analysed (chlamydospores, yeast cells). Three biological replicates each, one technical replicate.
