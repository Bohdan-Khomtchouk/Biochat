TITLE
The knockdown of maternal glucocorticoid receptor mRNA alters embryo development in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In zebrafish, ovulated oocytes contain both cortisol deposited from the maternal circulation and maternal mRNA for the glucocorticoid receptor (gr mRNA), which is spread as granular structures throughout the central ooplasm. At the 1-cell stage (0.2 hpf), this transcript is relocated by streamers in the blastodisc area and equally partitioned among blastomeres. At 15 hpf, it is replaced by the zygotic transcript. Morpholino knockdown was applied to block translation (grATG1MO or MO2-nr3c1 and grATG2MO or MO3-nr3c1) of both maternal and zygotic gr transcripts, while a missplicing morpholino (grmismMO or MO4-nr3c1) was used to block post-transcriptionally the zygotic transcript alone. MO2-nr3c1 and MO3-nr3c1 (but not MO4-nr3c1) treatment produced craniofacial and caudal malformations in 1-dpf embryos and 5-dpf larvae, which were also affected by pericardial oedema, persistent yolk sac, reduced subintestinal veins, altered neurogenesis and uninflated swim bladder. Such effects were rescued with trout gr2 mRNA. Pangenomic microarray analysis revealed that 114 and 37 highly expressed transcripts were up- and down-regulated, respectively, by maternal GR protein deficiency in 5-hpf embryos. Similar alterations were found at 10 hpf. These effects were confirmed by real-time PCR of 2 up- (casp8, grp1 and igf2a) and 1 down-regulated transcripts (mcm6) evaluated at 4, 8 and 12 hpf. As the contents of transcripts were modified already at 4 hpf, it seems that the lack of GR affects both ways the molecular machinery for the degradation of maternal mRNAs. These results indicate that the maternal gr transcript participates in the maternal programming of zebrafish development.
