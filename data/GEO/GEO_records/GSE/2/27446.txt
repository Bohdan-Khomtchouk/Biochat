TITLE
human Growth Hormone (GH) responsive genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Biomarkers of responsiveness to treatment with recombinant human GH (rhGH) have only poorly been described. We aimed at identifying biomarkes of rhGH treatment in children.  Our aim was to identify the genes in response to rhGH in human PBMC, that can be used as Biomarkes of growth prediction.
