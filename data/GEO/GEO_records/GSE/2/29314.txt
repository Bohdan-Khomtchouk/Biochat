TITLE
Identification of serum microRNAs associated with prostate cancer in a mouse model of disease

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
There is an urgent need for new biomarkers to enhance the clinical management of prostate cancer. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as useful non-invasive markers of disease. The objective of this study was to test the utility of a mouse model of prostate cancer as a tool to discover serum miRNAs that could be applied in a clinical setting. Global miRNA profiling using microarrays identified 46 miRNAs at differential levels in the serum of TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) mice compared to their wild-type littermates.
