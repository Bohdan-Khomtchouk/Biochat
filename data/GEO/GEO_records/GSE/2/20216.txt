TITLE
Not gene expression based, methylation detection using cDNA array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
genomic DNA hybridized to gene spots on the cDNA array was used for methylation detection using antibodies against 5methyl cytosine

DESIGN
DNA from control and irradiated C57BL/6 mouse were used for the study
