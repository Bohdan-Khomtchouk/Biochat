TITLE
Coordinated Chromatin Remodeling induced by Demethylation requires SRCAP mediated H2A.Z exchange [Methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of RKO cells with combination treatments of non-target siRNA or SRCAP siRNA and PBS or 1uM 5-Aza-CdR treatment. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across 27,578 CpGs in treated RKO cells. Samples included cells under 4 different treatments. The sample treated with non target siRNA and PBS serves as control sample.
