TITLE
Ath_Agilent_v2_Riechmann array expression profile AP1-GR ap1cal inflorescences - chx experiment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This experiment describes gene expression after the activation of APETALA1-GR, to study and identify AP1 target genes. We used a 35S:AP1-GR ap1 cal line to induce a synchronized response activating the AP1-GR fusion protein in ap1 cal inflorescence-like meristems through dexamethasone or dexamethasone+cycloheximide treatment. Tissue samples were collected at 3hrs after the treatment. The expression profiles of the individual samples were then analyzed by gene expression profiling using whole-genome oligonucleotide arrays (Agilent, custom-commercial).

DESIGN
We treated inflorescences of 35S:AP1-GR ap1-1 cal-1 plants with a dexamethasone-containing or a mock solution, or with identical solutions that contained in addition 10 Î¼M cycloheximide. Tissue was collected 3 hours after the treatment. Samples from each of the four biological replicates resulted in a set of four hybridization pairs: Mock vs. Dex, Mock vs. Chx, Mock vs. Dex+Chx, and Chx vs. Dex+Chx. Dye polarities were switched between biological replicates.
