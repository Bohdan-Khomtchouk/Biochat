TITLE
Overexpression of PtaHB1, Homeodomaine-leucine-Zipper class III, in hybrid poplar

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of primary xylem tranformed cells comparing control empty vector to PtaHB-1 overexpressed Over-expression constructs were obtained by inserting the complete coding sequences of PtaHB1 and PtaHB7 from P. tremula x P. alba between the maize ubiquitin promoter (Christensen et al., 1992) and a 35S terminator into the pCambia1305.2 vector (www.cambia.org). The resulting plasmids were then transferred into A. tumefaciens strain C58 pGV2260 (Hellens et al., 2000).
