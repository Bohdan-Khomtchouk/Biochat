TITLE
Expression data from mesothelial (LP9) and mesothelioma cells (HMESO) inhibited for extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1, 2, or 5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Extracellular-regulated kinases (ERK1/2 and 5) are known to play important roles in growth and drug resistance of various cancers. Here we show roles of inhibition of ERK1, ERK2, or ERK5 on gene expression profiles of epithelioid malignant mesothelioma (MM) cells (HMESO).

DESIGN
Untransfected human mesothelial cells (LP9), MM cells (HMESO) or HMESO cells stably transfected with shControl, shERK1, shERK2 , or shERK5 plasmids were used. Microarrays were performed on samples from 3 independent experiments. Each sample was analyzed on a separate array (3 independent biological replicates).
