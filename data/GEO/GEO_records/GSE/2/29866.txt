TITLE
The transcriptome of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices

ORGANISM
Rhizophagus intraradices

SUMMARY
The virtual transcriptome of G. intraradices (based on > 430,000 reads) served as the basis for the design of an EST expresson array and for a number of analyses of gene expression in germinating spores, extraradical mycelium (ERM) and symbiotic root tissues.
