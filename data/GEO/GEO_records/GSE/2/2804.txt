TITLE
Early dexamethasone-inducible genes in M-1 Cortical Collecting Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Precise control of blood pressure and salt balance is ultimately dependent on the regulation of epithelial sodium channels, ENaC, in the distal nephron. Ligand activation of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors induces a transcriptional response that leads to an augmentation of ENaC cell surface density and activity, but a complete inventory of the network of genes involved in the response is incomplete. In the present study, we used high-density cDNA microarrays to examine changes in the transcriptional profile of a mouse cortical collecting duct cell line, M-1, in response to a potent glucocorticoid agonist, dexamethasone. Here we identify 64 gene transcripts that are consistently co-regulated with ENaC, increasing within 3 hours of dexamethasone treatment. Within the same early response period, the abundance of 58 diiferent gene transcripts significantly decreased. A subset of up-regulated genes (12) was selected for further validation and the majority (10) of these were confirmed as dexamethone-regulated transcripts by real time RT-PCR. The products of these genes are known to function in intracellular trafficking operations (Numb, tetraspanin CD63, and Vps41), signal transduction, or to operate as modifiers of the cytoskeleton (gelsolin, tektin 2 and transgelin). These studies have identified new group of candidate genes that potentially regulate sodium transport in the collecting duct. Keywords: Gene identification in a cultured kidney cell model
