TITLE
Murine bone marrow immature B cells: autoreactive versus non-autoreactive

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse bone marrow B220+CD23–CD43–IgD– autoreactive immature B cells from 3-83Igi,Rag1-/-,H-2b mice relative to non-autoreactive immature B cells from 3-83Igi,H-2d mice. Goal was to determine genes that potentially mediate negative and positive selection of immature B cells.

DESIGN
Biological replicates: 2 autoreactive replicate against, 2 non-autoreactive replicates
