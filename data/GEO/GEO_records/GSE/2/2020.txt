TITLE
Differential Gene Up-regulation by HIF-1a and HIF-2a in HEK293T.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell lines. HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Heat inactivated, Hyclone, Logan, Utah) and 1X antibiotics/glutamine (100 units/ml penicillin, 100ug/ml streptomycin, 292ug/ml L-Glutamine sulfate, all from Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, CA.), under either hypoxic (1% O2) or normoxic (21% O2) conditions at 37C in a tissue culture incubator. Treatment. Cells treated in hypoxia for 16 hours or transfected with HIF-1a (HIF-1amut or HIF2a) plasmid. At the end of treatment, cells were collected and washed. Microarray studies.  Total RNA samples were extracted from HEK293T cells grown in 1% or 21% O2 overnight and from transfected cells. Total RNA (20 Âµg) from each sample was synthesized into double-stranded cDNA with reverse transcriptase (Fairplay labeling kit, Stratagen, La Jolla, CA) using an oligo d(T) primer. The double stranded cDNA from untreated cells was labeled with Cy3 monofunctional reactive dye and that from hypoxia-treated or transfected cells was labeled with Cy5 monofunctinal reactive dye. The probe was hybridized to a long oligo array (Hs-Operon V2-vB1.1px.gal) containing 20K human transcripts (NCI Microarray Facility, Advanced Technology Center, Gaithersburg, MD) overnight at 42C . The slides were washed and spin-dried. Microarray slides were scanned with a GenePix 4000 microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA.).  The microarray images were analyzed with GenePix 3.0 software and data analysis was performed with the MicroArray Database (mAdb) system hosted by the Center for Information Technology and Center for Cancer Research at the NCI.
