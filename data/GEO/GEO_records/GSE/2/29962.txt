TITLE
Nutrient-dependent growth of NIH3T3 and NIH3T3 K-ras cell lines.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of normal NIH3T3 and transformed NIH3T3 K-ras cell lines grown for 72 hours in optimal glucose availability (25 mM glucose) or low glucose availability (1 mM). Low glucose induces apoptosis in transformed cells as compared to normal ones.

DESIGN
We performed genome-wide analysis by using Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide microarrays to identify those genes whose expression levels are modulated by glucose availability in NIH3T3 and NIH3T3 K-ras cell lines. The cells, to be used for the transcription analysis, were collected at 18h from the initial seeding, time corresponding to the change of medium (25 or 1 mM glucose, indicated as T0) and then at 24, 48 and 72h upon medium change.
