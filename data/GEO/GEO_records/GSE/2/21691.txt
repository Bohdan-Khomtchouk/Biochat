TITLE
Expression data from Adam17 knock out mice and wild type

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adam17, a shedding protease, is strongly upregtulated during inflammation and cancer. Here we investigate the genome wide effects of Adam17 knock out on the transcriptome.

DESIGN
Mouse tissue samples from n=3 wildtype colon, n=3 Adam17 knockout colon, n=3 wildtype skin and n=3 Adam17 knockout skin were used in the study.
