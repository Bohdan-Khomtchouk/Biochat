TITLE
Intact ureteric buds gene expression with AngII treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Compare the gene expression in intact Ubs after treated with AngII vs. Media, determine the key genes related to the ub branching gene expression change pattern.

DESIGN
Two condition experiments, media and AngII. Biological replicate. Two for media samples, two for AngII treatment samples.
