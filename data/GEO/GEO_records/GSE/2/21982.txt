TITLE
Impact of G protein versus beta-arrestin-dependent signal transduction at the FSH receptor (affy_fsh_human)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
affy_fsh_human - affy_fsh_human - - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are centrally involved in most physiological processes and are a major drug targets. They transduce extracellular signals inside the cells through at least two different mechanisms: i) the classical coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and ii) a newly discovered beta-arrestin-dependent pathway. The fundamental issue of the respective impacts that these two transduction mechanisms exert on gene regulation has not been clearly addressed to date. To tackle this question, we have developed two mutants of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors which do not couple to G proteins upon FSH activation but continue to recruit beta-arrestins and signal through them.-In the present study, we compare the wild-type FSH receptor to either the R466A or the T469F mutants. These two mutations are localized in the second intra cellular loop of the FSH receptor and prevent G protein coupling to the active FSH receptor. Each receptor was permanently expressed in HEK-293 cells at comparable levels. Cells were treated or not for 6 hours with 3 nM FSH. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison,wt vs mutant comparison
