TITLE
Integrative analysis reveals selective 9p24.1 amplification, increased PD-1 ligand expression, and further induction via JAK2 in nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We integrate high-resolution copy number data with transcriptional profiles and identify the immunoregulatory genes, PD-L1 and PD-L2, as key targets at the 9p24.1 amplification peak in HL and MLBCL cell lines.

DESIGN
DNA copy number alterations were defined in DLBCL and HL cell lines, normalized to healthy donors, by GISTIC analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 single nucleotide polymorphism microarray data. Using this analysis, we identified 9p24 amplification to be over-represented in HL cell lines compared to DLBCL cell lines.
