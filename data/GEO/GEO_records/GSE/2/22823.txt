TITLE
mRNA Expression Profiling of pooled medulloblastoma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA expression analysis of 4 different pools of medulloblastoma samples with characteristic cytogenetic aberrations Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Comparison of tumor RNA 1 (equally represented, pooled mRNA of tumors with cytogenetic aberration 1)  versus tumor RNA (equally represented, pooled mRNA of tumors without cytogenetic aberration 1). Whole-genome screening for differential gene expression.
