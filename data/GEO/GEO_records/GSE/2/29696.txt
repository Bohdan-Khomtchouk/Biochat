TITLE
Diurnal Variation of Melatonin Receptors in Danio rerio (Zebrafish)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To gain a better understanding of the diurnal variation in gene expression, we analyzed the changes in gene expression in the eye of zebrafish. Dual color oligonucleotide microarrays were used to compare total RNA harvested from eyes of adult zebrafish at midday and midnight. Statistical analyses identified 44 genes which showed significant, 2-fold or more change; 26 genes showed decreased expression at midnight (D/L ≤ 0.5) and 18 genes showed increased expression at midnight (D/L ≥ 2). Seven genes were further analyzed using qPCR. The results of qPCR identified AANAT, Mel1a1, Mel1a3, Mel1b1, Mel1b2 and Melc as genes that showed significant change in expression at dawn, dusk, midday and midnight. These results suggest that expression of melatonin receptors is subject to diurnal regulation.

DESIGN
Wild-type ZDR zebrafish (Danio rerio) were obtained from Animal Wonders, San Marcos, TX, and Aquatica Tropicals, Plant City, FL. Fish were conditioned on a 12 hour light/dark cycle for a minimum of 14 days before use. The design of this analysis compared the experimental to the control: midnight samples were used as experimental and midday as control. Samples were collected in triplicate per time point with each replicate representing total RNA pooled from 9 fish. Dual-color microarray was used to compare the midnight and midday samples. A statistically significant (p-value ≤ 0.05) and 2-fold or more change in an experimental sample as compared to a control indicated an up- or down-regulation in gene expression. Supplementary files: In Complete processed data file, " x " marked spots show intensities of less than 1000. In Intensity trimmed data file, all genes with signal intensities of less than 1000 in all triplicate time points were removed from the analysis.
