TITLE
Drosophila LID RNAi gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
H3K4me3 is a histone modification related to gene activation. LID is a demethylase acting on this residue and therefore, it could be important for proper expression of genes in Drosophila developing tissues, such as wing imaginal discs We used microarrays to analyse the changes in gene expression after lid depletion by RNAi, both in a wild type background and in a mutant background

DESIGN
Two replicates were obtained on Nov 2010 for wild type white drosophila, GFP RNAi control and LID RNAi (on a LID mutant background).
