TITLE
Whole Blood Cell Gene Expression Profiling in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease from the Cathgen Registry

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of whole blood cells isolated from patients piror to undergoing cardiac catheterization. The Cathgen Registry is a single-center coronary catheter-lab cohort being run at Duke University for the purpose of identifying biomarkers associated with coronary disease.

DESIGN
3 condition experiment: Cases (2) are patients with  ≥70% stenosis in > 1 major vessel or ≥50% stenosis in > 2 arteries; intermediates (1) are patients with luminal stenosis > 25% but less than 50%;  controls (0) have luminal stenosis of < =25%
