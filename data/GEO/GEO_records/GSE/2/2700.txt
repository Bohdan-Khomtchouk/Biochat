TITLE
HEK293 cells overexpressing wild type HNF4a2 or mutant forms HNF4a2 C106R or HNF4a2 R154X

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in human embryonic kidney cells HEK293 overexpressing the transcription factors HNF4a2 or mutant forms HNF4a2 C106R and HNF4a2 R154X, which were introduced by FRT/FLP recombination. The analysis was performed 24 hours following 1Âµg/ml tetracycline treatment to induce the expression of the genes. Results identify HNF4a regulated genes in kidney cells being several of these genes deregulated in renal cell carcinoma.
