TITLE
Genes regulated by has-mir-31 in glioma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overexpression of miR-31 inhibits the migration and invasion ability of glioma cell. We sought to obtain the genes regulated by mir-31 in glioma cell line.

DESIGN
The gene expression of U251-mir-31 (U251 over expressing mir-31) and U251-control. U251-Control and U251-mir-31 cells were cultured in DMEM cell culture media for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix.GeneChip.HG-U133_Plus_2.
