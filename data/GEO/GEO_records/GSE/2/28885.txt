TITLE
Insights into Transcriptional Regulatory Pathways on Systemic Communication under Flooding in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We analyzed global transcriptional changes in both shoots and roots of root-flooded Arabidopsis seedlings by microarrays.  We also interpreted the significance of the systemic communication between roots and shoots by functional classification of affected genes.  We performed genetic analysis with an ethylene signaling mutant, ein2-5, to correlate systemic flooding responses with ethylene signaling. We identified a class of genes that were up- or downregulated in shoots, but not affected in roots, under hypoxic conditions.  A comprehensive managing program of carbohydrate metabolism was observed, providing an example of how systemic communications might facilitate the survival of plants under flooding.  A proportion of long-distance hypoxic regulation was altered in ein2-5.

DESIGN
Time course experiments (0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 12h for Columbia; 0.5, 3, and 6h for ein2-5).  Tissues from root-flooded seedlings vs. Tissues from un-flooded seedlings.  Biological replicates: 4 replicates for each time point, independently grown, treated, and harvested. One replicate per array.  2 of 4 replicates are dye-swapped.
