TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Salmonella enterica serovars Kentucky and Enteritidis in response to acidic conditions

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
S. enterica sv Kentucky 3795 and S. enterica sv Enteritidis NalR were grown to mid-log phase in TSB, then subjected to three different acidic conditions generated by two different acids: HCl to pH4.5, HCl to pH5.5 and CH3COOH to pH5.5. After 10min, total RNA was harvested und compared to total RNA harvested from identical control cultures grown in TSB without the pH alteration.
