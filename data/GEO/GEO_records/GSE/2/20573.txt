TITLE
Specification of functional floor plate tissue from human embryonic stem cells occurs at the expense of anterior neurectoderm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we report the derivation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC-) derived FP tissue capable of secreting Netrin-1 and SHH and patterning primary and hESC derived tissues.

DESIGN
Three replicate plates of human embryonic stem cells (A-C) were differentiated to various days (D#) using Noggin+SB431542 with or without SHH (C25II)
