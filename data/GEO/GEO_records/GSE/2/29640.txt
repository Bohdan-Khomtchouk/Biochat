TITLE
Light effect on the hormonal and transcriptional status of winter and spring wheat plants during cold hardening

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
The effect of light during the development of freezing tolerance was studied in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. var. Mv Emese) and spring wheat variety Nadro. Ten-day-old plants were cold hardened at 5°C for 12 days either under normal (250 mmol m-2 s-1) or low light (20 mmol m-2 s-1) conditions.

DESIGN
Samples of Emese (E) and Nadro (N) plants grown at 18°C under normal (NL) and low (LL) light fluences were compared to each other in a simple loop design and E-NL vs. E-LL; N-NL vs. N-LL; E-NL vs. NLL and E-LL vs. N-LL comparisons were made.
