TITLE
H2O2 Treatment of Human PBMC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To mimic the effect of ROS in contributing to ageing process in immune cells of PBMC. The PBMC cells were harvested from old human subjects ( > 50) and induced with H2O2 during 3 hour and 6 hour. The CEL file were normalized using RMA methods. We used microarray to explore the gene expression profiling before and after ROS. Gene related to cell cycle, apoptosis, metabolism and signal transduction were differentially expressed after inducing with H2O2 in compared to baseline.

DESIGN
Human PBMC cell were harvested before induce with H2O2 (T0), 3 hours (T3) and 6 hours (T6) from the older PBMC. Eight individual samples were collected and hybridized for each time point.
