TITLE
Expression data from electrically-altered larval Drosophila LNvs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
While intensely studied in the context of synaptic plasticity, the interplay between electrical activity and transcription is also relevant to circadian pacemaker neurons where ~24hr rhythms in gene expression and neural activity define the functional state of clock neurons. Here we demonstrate broad transcriptional changes in Drosophila circadian pacemaker neurons (LNvs) in response to altered electrical activity, including a large set of circadian genes. We used microarrays to identify the global program of gene expression in purified Drosophila pacemaker neurons in response to targeted electrical manipulations
