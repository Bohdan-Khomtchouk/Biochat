TITLE
SNP data from blood DNAs of patients with gastric cancer

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The identification of surrogate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that can predict responses to chemotherapy could enable the efficient selection of patients for various regimens. Genome-wide association studies in clinical populations are theoretically capable of identifying markers that are capable of influencing drug responses. We used Affymetrix’s SNP Array 6.0 to detail genetic polymorphism of patient’s group showing differential responsiveness to various regimens and profiled SNP biomarkers for various regimens.

DESIGN
The chemosensitivity of tumor tissue from the initial cohort of 93 patients was assessed using the histoculture drug response assay (HDRA) and the following six established drugs. Then the inhibition rate (IR) cut-off value for a positive response was previously determined as 30%. Blood DNAs were prepared from each patients and hybridized to Affymetrix’s SNP Array 6.0. Genotypes were determined using the Affymetrix Genotyping Console software (version 2.1) based on the BRLMM-P algorithm. We used an ANOVA test to identify SNPs associated with quantitative HDRA drug sensitivity. Nine different drug regimens were used. For each of the nine regimens, we provided raw drug sensitivity (HDRA) data and binary data (i.e. > = 30 or < 30) at 30% cutoff. Publication focuses on six drug regimens: CDP, DTAX, FU, OXA, TAX, and TSI. Publication discusses 93 of the 95 samples contained in this Series.
