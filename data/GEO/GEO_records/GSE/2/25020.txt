TITLE
Gene expression analysis of four conditions for Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici

ORGANISM
Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici

SUMMARY
Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici is the cause of wheat stem rust.  A microarray was designed from genes predicted from the P. graminis f. sp. tritici genome assembly, and gene expression measured for four conditions which include wheat or barley infecting growth stages initiated by urediniospores. mRNA was prepared from fresh urediniospores, uredinospores germinated for 24 hr, wheat seedlings infected with urediniospores for 8 days, and barley seedlings infected with urediniospores for 8 days. The asexual uredinial infection cycle on wheat produces additional urediniospores, which can start new cycles of wheat infection and are readily spread by aerial transport. This expression data is further described in Duplessis et al, Obligate Biotrophy Features Unraveled by the Genomic Analysis of the Rust Fungi, Melampsora larici-populina and Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici

DESIGN
A total of 12 samples were analyzed, including three biological replicates of the four conditions.
