TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of OCT4, NANOG and CTCF in human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription factors and their specific interactions with targets are crucial in specifying gene expression programs. To gain insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks in embryonic stem cells, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to ultra-high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) to map the locations of OCT4, NANOG and CTCF.

DESIGN
ChIP-enriched DNA from pooled ChIP samples were analyzed by Solexa sequencing.
