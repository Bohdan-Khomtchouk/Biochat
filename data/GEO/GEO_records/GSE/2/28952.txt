TITLE
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphomas. A validation study of array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Tumor Specimens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Only a limited number of genetic studies have been performed in primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL), partly due to the rarity of the tumors and the very limited amount of available tissue.  In this report, we present the first molecular characterization of copy-number abnormalities (CNA) of newly diagnosed PCNSL by array-based comparative genomic hybridization in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens and compare the results with matched frozen tumor specimens.  Experimental design: We performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in FFPE tissues from PCNSL.  Results were compared with matched paired frozen tumors.  Results: Our analysis confirmed the good to fair quality and reliability of the data generated from limited amounts of tumoral FFPE tissue.  Overall, all PCNSL cases were characterized by highly complex karyotypes with a median of 23 copy-number abnormalities (CNA) per patient (range 17-47).  Overall, 20 chromosomal regions were recurrently found in more than 40% of cases.  Deletions of 6p21, 6q, 9p21.3 and gain of 12q12-q24.33 were the commonest CNA.  Other minimal affected regions were defined, and novel recurrent CNAs affecting single genes were identified in 3q26.32 (TBL1XR1) and 8q12.1 (TOX).    Conclusions: The results obtained are encouraging.  Larger archival tissue collections can now be analyzed in order to complement the still fragmented knowledge we have of the genetic basis of the PCNSL.

DESIGN
We included samples from 7 PCNSL patients. In 6 out of these 7 PCNSL patients (cases B â€“ G), aCGH experiments were performed in DNA samples obtained from both snap-frozen and FFPE tissues for assay quality comparative purposes.  In the remaining sample (case A), only frozen sample was analyzed.
