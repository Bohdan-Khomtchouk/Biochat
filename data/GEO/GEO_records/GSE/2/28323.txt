TITLE
Genome-wide maps of KDM5A/JARID1A/RBP2 and its isoforms in differentiated U937 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the identification of genomic regions bound by RBP2 isoforms and define the functional categories that these regions represent. RBP2 modifies methylated lysine residues on histone tails. We found that RBP2 large isoform containing the recognition module for histone H3K4me3 and RBP2 small isoform lacking this module bind to to different regions in the human genome. Importantly, isoform-specific regions and overlapping regions belong to genes with different molecular functions. For example, chromatin binding and transcription factor binding functions can be ascribed to gene targets of RBP2 small isoform but not of RBP2 large isoform. By comparing gene sets generated for all isoforms and RBP2 large isoform, we can define if the small isoform is specifically recruited to genomic regions dispaying certain signatures, such as transcription start sites, CpG-rich regions, transcriptional activity and transcription factor binding.
