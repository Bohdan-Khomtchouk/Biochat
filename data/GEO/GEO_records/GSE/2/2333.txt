TITLE
Cytokine expression in macrophages and splenic CD4+ T-cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to study the cytokine gene expression profile of macrophage under 50uM DU exposure. the experiment was repeated three time, with duplicate spots for each gene on the array. Conclusion: DU exposure induces the expressions of IL-10, NF-kBP65, and Midkine and other cytokine genes, indicating the immunomodulation abilities of DU.  (GSM43230-GSM43241) This experiment was designed to study the cytokine gene expression of splenic CD4+ T-cells under 100uM DU exposure in 24 hours. Conclusion: DU induces Th2 cytokine gene expression (eg. IL-5), and midkine, as well as other cytokine genes, indicating the abilities of DU in promoting Th2 shifting during differtiation.
