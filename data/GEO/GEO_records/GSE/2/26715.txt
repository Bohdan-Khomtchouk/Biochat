TITLE
miR-1245 induce genomic instability

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment is design to evaluate genomic alteration following stably expression of miR-1245, stably knock down of BRCA2 is setup as a positive control

DESIGN
Primary normal breast epithelial cells (NBEC) were collected from the mammoplasty material of a 30-year-old woman at the Department of Plastic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (P. R. China), in accordance with rules and regulations concerning ethical issues on research use of human subjects in China, and were cultured in the Keratinocyte serum-free medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with epithelial growth factor, bovine pituitary extract and antibiotics (120 µg/mL streptomycin and 120 µg/mL penicillin).  NBEC were infected with virus produced from retro vector pMSCV-miR1245 or empty pMSCV vector; or pSuper Retro BRCA2 shRNA, or pSuper Retro empty vector.  After 2 days infection and 3 days culture, genomic DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGENE, Valencia, CA).  CGH microarray hybridization, data generation and normalization were performed in Shanghai Biochip Corporation.
