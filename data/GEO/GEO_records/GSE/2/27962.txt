TITLE
Expression data of Sham and post-MI myocardium from swine

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanism underlying cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction have been incompletely understood. Until now, most studies have been performed in rodents. We studied cardiac remodeling in the physiologically more relevant animal model, the swine. Microarray analysis was performed on animals that underwent either sham surgery or permanent ligation of the left coronary artery (MI). RNA was isolated from the remote, non-ischemic, regions of the left ventricle.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from 8 sham and 8 MI animals three weeks after surgery. Each group contained 4 males and 4 females. Animals used for the study were 2-3 months old Yorkshire x Landrace swine. Only neutered males entered the study.
