SUMMARY
Dr. Ladisch's work focuses on the establishment of the biological significance of gangliosides that are shed by tumor cells, particularly those involved in pediatric cancers, including brain tumors and neuroblastoma. These studies are directed toward illuminating the hypothesis that shed gangliosides enhance tumor formation, possibly both by inhibiting the antitumor immune response and by enhancing growth factor-induced signaling and proliferation of fibrobalsts and vascular endotheilial cells in the tumor microenvironment. Delineation of the signaling pathways affected by ganglioside exposure is currently under study.
