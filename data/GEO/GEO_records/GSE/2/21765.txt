TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis gapcp mutant treated with ABA

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Glycolytic Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phospate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate by coupling with the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. We generated mutants of the Arabidopsis plastidial GAPDH isoforms (At1g79530, At1g16300; GAPCp1, GAPCp2). gapcp double mutants (gapcp1 gapcp2) display a drastic phenotype of arrested root development and sterility.Complex interactions occurring between ABA and sugar signal transduction pathways have been shown, but the molecular mechanisms connecting both pathways are not well understood. Since we found drastic carbohydrate changes in gapcp1 gapcp2, we studied their response to ABA. by performing a microarray analysis comparing gapcp1 gapcp2 and wild type seedlings after a long term treatment with ABA.

DESIGN
15-day old Arabidopsis seedlings (Col 0)  and gapcp1gapcp2 double mutants were used  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
