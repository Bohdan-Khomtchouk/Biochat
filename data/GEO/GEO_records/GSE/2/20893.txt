TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling of the porcine developing brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression profiling with use of microRNA microarrays was performed on porcine developing brain. Two tissues, cortex and cerebellum were sampled at each of three different developmental stages: gestation day 50 (F50), gestation day 100 (F100) and three months old (named adult), respectively. The aim was to find developmental stage as well as the tissue specific microRNA candidates and validate them with qPCR.
