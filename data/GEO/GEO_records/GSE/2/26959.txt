TITLE
Screening the target genes of IRF10 in Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus

ORGANISM
Paralichthys olivaceus

SUMMARY
In previous study, we revealed that IRF10 is involved in the immune-reponse against bacteria and virus in Paralichthys olivaceus. However, the target genes of IRF10 is still unknown in teleosts. We searched the target genes of IRF10 by microarray in IRF10 over expressed HINAE cell

DESIGN
HINAE cells were culured in 24-well plate. HINAE cells were transfected using lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, USA) with 7.2nM IRF10 expression plasmid vector (pcDNA3.1-IRF10) or empty-vector (pcDNA3.1). The equal volume of sterile water was used as a control. On other hands, the 1Î¼g/ml of poly I:C also transfected to HINAE cells using lipofectamine2000 with each plasmid and vehicles (sterile water). After 48 hours from the transfection, we harvested the two samples of the control and poly I:C only and the three samples of plasmids or plasmids with poly I:C transfected cells (16 hybridization).
