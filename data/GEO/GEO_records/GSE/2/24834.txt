TITLE
Gene expression data by the Artemisia iwayomogi (Ai) on the LPS-stimulated human gingival fibroblast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Artemisia iwayomogi (Ai) has been known to inhibit the inflammatory cytokine production and the allergic reactions, and has been used to treat liver diseases. This study investigated the gene expression changes by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in the cultured human gingival fibroblast and the gene expression changes by the Ai when challenged with LPS using a microarray chip.

DESIGN
Human gingival fibroblast were divided into four experimental groups; ① C: Control, ② LPS: LPS-treatment only, ③ Ai20: LPS- and Ai20-treatments, ④ Ai40: LPS- and Ai40-treatments. Total RNA was isolated from each experimental fibroblast (4 experimental group × 1 sample of each experimental group = total 4 samples).
