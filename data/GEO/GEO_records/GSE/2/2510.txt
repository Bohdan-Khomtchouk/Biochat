TITLE
Expression profiling in preadipocytes in obese Pima Indians/humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis comparing gene expression profiles of primary cultured preadipocytes from non-diabetic lean vs non-diabetic obese Pima Indian subjects (a subset of the subjects from the adipocyte genechip project, GSE2508). Primary cultured  abdominal subcutaneous preadipocytes from 14 lean (7 Males / 7 Females) and 14 obese (7M/7F) subjects were hybridized individually to Affymetrix  oligonucleotide arrays HG-U133A and B. Keywords = Obesity Keywords = inflammation Keywords = microarray Keywords = gene expression Keywords = preadipocyte Keywords = stromal-vascular cells Keywords = adipose tissue Keywords: other
