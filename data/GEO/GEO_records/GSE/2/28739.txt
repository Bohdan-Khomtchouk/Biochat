Gene expression patterns of chemoresistant and chemosensitive serous epithelial ovarian tumors with possible predictive value in response to initial chemotherapy

SUMMARY
Chemotherapy (CT) resistance in ovarian cancer is broad and encompasses diverse, unrelated drugs, suggesting more than one mechanism of resistance. We aimed to analyze the gene expression patterns in primary serous epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) samples displaying different responses to first-line CT in an attempt to identify specific molecular signatures associated with response to CT. Initially, the expression profiles of 15 chemoresistant serous EOC tumors [time to recurrence (TTR) ≤6 months] and 10 chemosensitive serous EOC tumors (TTR ≥30 months) were independently analyzed which allowed the identification of specific sets of differentially expressed genes that might be functionally implicated in the evolution of the chemoresistant or the chemosensitive phenotype. Our data suggest that the intrinsic chemoresistance in serous EOC cells may be attributed to the combined action of different molecular mechanisms and factors linked with drug influx and efflux and cell proliferation, as possible implications of other molecular events including altered metabolism, apoptosis and inflammation cannot be excluded. Next, gene expression comparison using hierarchical clustering clearly distinguished chemosensitive and chemo- resistant tumors from the 25 serous EOC samples (training set), and consecutive class prediction analysis was used to develop a 43-gene classifier that was further validated in an independent cohort of 15 serous EOC patients and 2 patients with other ovarian cancer histotypes (test set). The 43-gene predictor set properly classified serous EOC patients at high risk for early (≤22 months) versus late ( > 22 months) relapse  after initial CT. Thus, gene expression array technology can effectively classify serous EOC tumors according to CT response. The proposed 43-gene model needs further validation.

DESIGN
