TITLE
Induction of pluripotency in human cord blood unrestricted somatic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have been generated from mouse and human somatic cells by ectopic expression of the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC as well as NANOG and LIN28. Here we report generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from human umbilical cord blood derived unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSC) using retroviral expression of the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC and evaluation of their molecular signature and differentiation potential in comparison to human embryonic stem cells. The reprogrammed cells (HUiPS) were analysed morphologically, by qRT-PCR, global miRNA and epigenetic profiling and gene expression microarrays, as well as in their in vitro and in vivo differentiation potential by embryoid body formation and teratoma assay. The cord blood iPS cells are highly similar to human embryonic stem cells morphologically, at their molecular signature as well as in their in vitro and in vivo differentiation potential. Human cord blood derived unrestricted somatic stem cells offer an attractive source of cells for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. Our findings open novel perspectives to generate HLA matched pluripotent stem cell banks based on existing cord blood banks. Besides its obvious relevance of such a second generation cord blood iPS bank for pharmacological and toxicological testing, its application for autologous or allogenic regenerative cell transplantation appears feasible.

DESIGN
For transcriptome profiling, 400 ng of total DNA-free RNA was used as input for labelled cRNA synthesis (Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit - Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions (IVT: 10h). Quality-checked cRNA samples were hybridized as biological or technical duplicates for 18 h onto HumanRef-8 v3 expression BeadChips (Illumina), washed, stained, and scanned following guidelines and using materials / instrumentation supplied / suggested by the manufacturer. Six sample types were analyzed, each one of them in duplicate. USSC: human umbilical cord blood unrestricted somatic stem cells (duplicates) HUiPS: human iPS cells from human umbilical cord blood USSC, hand-picked cols (duplicates) H9 hESC: H9 human ESCs grown on low-density CF1 MEFs (duplicates) H1 hESC: H1 human ESCs grown on low-density CF1 MEFs (duplicates) 1F hNiPS: One factor (Oct4) human iPS cells from hNSCs, hand-picked cols (duplicates) 2F hNiPS: Two factors (Oct4, Klf4) human iPS cells from hNSCs, hand-picked cols (duplicates)
