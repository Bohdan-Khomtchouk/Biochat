TITLE
miRNA expression in NK cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to characterize the miRNA expression in both freshly isolated and cultured NK cells from both mice and humans. (2 samples from mouse cells (naive and cultured), 2 from human cells (na√Øve and cell line), 4 samples total)

DESIGN
At this point, this experiment involves one replicate of each of the samples using dual channels to analyze freshly isolated cells and cultured cells on the same custom printed slide. (intended only to gain preliminary insight into miRNA expression in NK cells for further analysis) SUPPLEMENTARY FILE: File includes normalized total intensity and log2 ratio (representing RNA from freshly isolated cells-Cy5/cultured cells-Cy3[mouse] or freshly isolated cells-Cy5/cell line-Cy3[human]).
