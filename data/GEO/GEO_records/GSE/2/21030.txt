TITLE
Expression data from early preimplantation Bovine embryos

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The oviduct is a specialized organ playing crucial roles in the success of early reproductive events and it provides an optimal microenvironment for early embryonic development. However, changes in oviductal environment due to estrus synchronization and superovulation hormonal treatments and subsequent influence on embryos transcriptome profile are not yet investigated. For that, the objective of this study was to investigate differences in developmental rate and transcriptome profile of bovine blastocysts cultured under superovulation or synchronization oviductal environment.

DESIGN
Influence of oviductal environment on transcriptome abundance of produced blastocysts was examined using the Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Genome Array. Eighteen Simmental heifers were synchronized, superovulated and artificially inseminated, then nine of them were flushed at day 2 by transvaginal endoscopic means and 2-cell stage embryos were recovered and endoscopicaly transferred to only synchronized recipients. The remaining half of superovulated heifers and the synchronized recipients were flushed at day 7 to collect blastocysts which developed either in superovulated or synchronized oviduct
