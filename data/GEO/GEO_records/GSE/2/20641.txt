TITLE
Expression data for serum stimulation of human primary fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to profile gene expression changes following growth factor stimulation of primary human fibroblasts.

DESIGN
We serum starved (0.1% serum) fibroblasts for 48 hrs and restimulated with 10% serum for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hrs.  Total RNA was extracted from 2 independent biological replicas for each time point and hybridized to expression arrays.
