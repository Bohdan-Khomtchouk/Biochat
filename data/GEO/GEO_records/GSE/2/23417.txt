TITLE
Differential expression of E.coli mar/rob/soxS triple mutant and wild type in a mouse model of pyelonephritis

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Mutation of marA, rob, and soxS causes a clinical strain of E.coli to be attenuated at d3 post-infection in a mouse model of pyelonephritis, here we extract RNA at d2 post infection to analyze transcriptional differences between the two strains.
