TITLE
TAL1 knock down in Jurkat cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray profiling in Jurkat cells to uncover TAL1 dependent genes in a leukemic context.

DESIGN
Clonal Jurkat lines expressing a Doxycycline (Dox) -inducible shRNA against TAL1 coding sequence were generated. A clone in which Dox treatment led to 80% decrease of TAL1 mRNA was chosen. Reps 1 and 4 (2 and 5 / 3 and 6)  are technical replicates.
