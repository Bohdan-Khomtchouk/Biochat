TITLE
Effect of 52 weeks of chronic exposure to TCDD AND PCB126 on hepatic gene expression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study investigates the effects of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands TCDD and PCB126  on hepatic gene expression in female sprague dawley rats. Rats were treated with toxicological equivalent doses of TCDD (100ng/kg/day) (Toxic equivalence factor (TEF) = 1.0), PCB126 (30ng, 300ng or 1000ng/kg/day) (TEF = 0.1) or a vehicle control of corn oil:acetone (99:1) 5 days a week for 52 weeks.

DESIGN
There are 3 control chips and representing animals treated with vehicle control. There are 3 biological replicates (3 chips) for each treatment group (eg. TCDD, PCB126), each biological replicate is derived from 2 individual animals. A total of 15 chips were analyzed.
