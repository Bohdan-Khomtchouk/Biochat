TITLE
Comparative Expression Profiling of E. coli and S. aureus inoculated primary Mammary Gland Cells sampled from Cows with different genetic Predisposition for Somatic Cell Score

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Establishment of an in vitro system to explore molecular mechanisms of mastitis susceptibility in cattle by comparative expression profiling of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus inoculated primary cells sampled from cows with different genetic predisposition for somatic cell score Primary bovine mammary gland epithelial cells (pbMEC) were sampled from the udder parenchyma of cows that were selected for high and low mastitis susceptibility by applying a marker assisted selection strategy considering QTL and molecular marker information of a repetitively confirmed QTL for SCS in the telomeric region on BTA18 The cells were cultivated and subsequently inoculated with heat inactivated mastitis pathogens Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. After 1, 6 and 24 hours the cells were harvested and comparatively analyzed using microarray expression chip technology to identify differences in mRNA expression profiles attributed to cultivation, inoculation or to genetic predisposition.
