TITLE
Poplar tissue types 1

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
Global gene expression pattern of different poplar tissue types were determined using a Nimblegen microarray based on JGI v1.1 gene models. All tissue except reproductive tissue were obtained from the same clone used for the poplar genome sequencing project (Populus trichocarpa Nisqually-1). Reproductive tissue were from wild Populus trichocarpa trees.
