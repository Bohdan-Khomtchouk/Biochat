TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of a Bacillus subtilis mutant defective in the transcription termination factor Rho.

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
This analysis is part of the study GSE27219, The condition-dependent transcriptome of Bacillus subtilis 168. In this study, 120 transcription units where identified for which transcription did not terminate at any specific site, leading to mRNA extension over long distances with slowly decreasing signal intensity. In most cases, lack of termination and read-through generated antisense transcripts. These findings together with the lack of intrinsic terminators suggested that transcription termination of the 120 transcription units could be mediated by the transcription termination factor Rho. In order to investigate the impact of Rho-mediated termination, tiling array hybridizations using RNA samples of a B. subtilis rho-null mutant and its parental strain were performed.
