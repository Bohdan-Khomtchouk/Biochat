TITLE
Combining gene expression data from different generations of oligonucleotide arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compatibility between high-density oligonucleotide arrays is significantly affected by probe-level sequence information. With a careful filtering of the probes based on their sequence overlaps, data from different generations of microarrays can be combined more effectively. The dataset of 14 human muscle biopsy samples from patients with inflammatory myopathies that were hybridized on both HG-U95Av2 and HG-U133A human arrays for this purpose. Signal values from GCOS 1.2 with Detection call and p-value are provided here, and CEL files are also available for download. Keywords: parallel sample
