TITLE
SCREENING STUDY TO IDENTIFY DIAGNOSTIC MARKERS FOR LUNG CANCER IN ENDOBRONCHIAL LINING FLUID

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated whether biomarker analysis in endobronchial epithelial lining fluid (ELF) collected by bronchoscopic microsampling may be useful for a definitive preoperative diagnosis. Therefore we compared ELF samples close to nodule and from the contralateral site from patients with malignant or benign diagnosis.
