TITLE
Fast forward genetics: mutation mapping and identification using next-generation sequencing and enrichment of bulk segregant pools

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Phenotype-driven forward genetic experiments are among the most powerful approaches for linking biology and disease to genomic elements. Although widely used in a range of model organisms, positional cloning of causal variants is still a very laborious process. Here, we describe a novel universal approach, named fast forward genetics that combines traditional bulk segregant techniques with next-generation sequencing technology and targeted genomic enrichment, to dramatically improve the process of mapping and cloning multiple mutants in a single experiment. In a two-step procedure the mutation is first roughly mapped by ‘light’ sequencing of the bulk segregant pool, followed by genomic enrichment and deep-sequencing of the mutant pool for the linked genomic region. The latter step allows for simultaneous fine-mapping and mutation discovery. We successfully applied this approach to three Arabidopsis mutants, but the method can in principle be applied to any model organism of interest and is largely independent of the genome size. Moreover, we show that both steps can be performed in multiplex using barcoded samples, thereby increasing efficiency enormously.
