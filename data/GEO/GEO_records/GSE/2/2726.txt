TITLE
parous and AMV mammary gland before and after MNU treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Early full-term pregnancy affords lifetime protection against development of breast cancer. Parity-induced protection can be reproduced in a carcinogen-induced rat mammary carcinoma model. The molecular mechanisms of parity-induced protection against carcinogenic stimuli in rat mammary glands have not been fully characterized. In order to gain a better understanding of these molecular mechanisms, we performed gene expression analyses in parous and age-matched virgin (AMV) mammary glands of Lewis rats before and after carcinogen (N-methyl-N-nitrosourea; MNU) treatment.
