TITLE
The Role of microRNAs in Neural Stem Cell-supported Endothelial Morphogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNA microarrays and RNA expression arrays were used to identify  functional signaling between neural stem cell progenitor cells (NSPC) and brain endothelial cells (EC) that are critical during embryonic development and tissue repair following brain injury.
