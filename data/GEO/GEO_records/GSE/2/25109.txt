TITLE
Paneth cells constitute the niche for Lgr5 stem cells in intestinal crypts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Homeostasis of self-renewing small intestinal crypts results from neutral competition between Lgr5 stem cells, small cycling cells located at crypt bottoms1, 2. Lgr5 stem cells are interspersed between terminally differentiated Paneth cells, that are known to produce bactericidal products such as lysozyme and cryptdins/defensins3.  Single Lgr5-expressing stem cells can be cultured to form long-lived, self-organizing crypt-villus organoids in the absence of non-epithelial niche cells4. Here, we note a close physical association of Lgr5 stem cells with Paneth cells in vivo and in vitro. CD24+ Paneth cells express EGF, TGFÎ±, Wnt3 and the Notch-ligand Dll4, all essential signals for stem cell maintenance in culture. Co-culturing of sorted stem cells with Paneth cells dramatically improves organoid formation. This Paneth cell requirement can be substituted by a pulse of exogenous Wnt. Genetic removal of Paneth cells in vivo results in the concomitant loss of Lgr5 stem cells. In colon crypts, CD24+ cells residing between Lgr5 stem cells may represent the Paneth cell equivalents. We conclude that Lgr5 stem cells compete for essential niche signals provided by a specialized daughter cell, the Paneth cell.

DESIGN
We used intestinal cell fractions from Lgr5-EGFP-ires-CreERT2 mice, expressing GFP under the control of the Lgr5 promoter. RNA was isolated from two FACS sorted cell populations: stem cells were sorted based on high level of GFP expression (GFPhi) and Paneth cells were sorted based on high level of CD24 expression (CD24hi) and high side-scatter (SSChi). Differentially labelled cRNA from GFPhi and CD24hi/SSChi cells from two different sorts (each combining ten individual mice) were hybridized on 4X44K Agilent Whole Mouse Genome dual colour Microarrays (G4122F) in two dye swap experiments, resulting in four individual arrays.
