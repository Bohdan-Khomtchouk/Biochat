TITLE
Thrombopoietin (TPO) protects against heart damage induced infarction in rat model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In order to examine the mechanism of TPO on cardiac protection against myocardial infarction damage (MI), we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to delineate the TPO cardioprotective mechanism against infarction.

DESIGN
MI and TPO induced gene expressions in rat heart were measured at week 4. Two biological replicates were performed for each treatment group.
