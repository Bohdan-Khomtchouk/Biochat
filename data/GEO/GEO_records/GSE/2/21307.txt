TITLE
Characterization of Directly Regulated Thyroid Hormone Mediated Gene Expression Following Short-Term Perturbations in Thyroid Hormone Levels in Juvenile Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of thyroid hormone disruptions on gene expression in juvenile mice liver to develop a stronger understanding of the mechanisms by which thyroid disrupting chemicals impair development.  Gene expression was examined by hybridization of hepatic RNA to Agilent mouse microarrays for hyper-, hypo-, hypo-replacement (hypo+) and euthyroid animals. Keywords: Toxicogenomics, biomarkers of thyroid disruptors

DESIGN
Hypothyroidism was induced from post natal day (PND) 13 to 15 by adding model thyroid toxicants methimazole and sodium perchlorate to drinking water of pregnant females.  Hyperthyroidism was induced by intraperitoneal injections (i.p.) of THs at PND 15, 4 hours before decapitation and tissue collection.  For the hypothyroid/replacement group; dams were provided with drinking water for 3 days (PND 13 to 15), containing a mixture of methimazole/sodium perchlorate.  Pups then received intraperitoneal injections of thyoid hormones on PND 15, 4 hours before decapitation and tissue collection.
