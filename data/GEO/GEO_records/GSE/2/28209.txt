TITLE
Expression data from transgenic rice with anti-OsPDCD5

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Environmental stresses influence the growth of plants and the productivity of crops. Salinity is one of the most important abiotic stresses for agricultural crops. PCD is induced by various biotic and abiotic stresses in algae and higher plants, including high salinity treatment. OsPDCD5, an ortholog to mammalian-programmed cell death 5, is up-regulated under low temperature and NaCl treatments. We found that the transgenic rice which constitutively expressed anti-OsPDCD5 increased salt stress tolerance in unique ways. By using the Rice Genome Microarray, we identiÔ¨Åed target genes that were regulated in transgenic rice plants by anti-OsPDCD5.

DESIGN
Leaf tissues of 2-week-old transgenic and nontransgenic seedlings (10 plants each) before 200mM NaCl treatment, 20mins and 3 hours after 200mM NaCl treatment, respectively, were selected.
