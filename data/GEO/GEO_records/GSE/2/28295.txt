TITLE
Campylobacter jejuni Utilization of Mucin

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
While growing in the human intestine, C. jejuni grows within the mucus layer.  The largest constituents of this layer are the large mucin glycoproteins.  A transcriptomic profile of C. jejuni NCTC11168 growing in a mucin-containing minimal medium seeks to describe the effect of the presence of mucin proteins on the transcriptome of C. jejuni.

DESIGN
Microarray data was collected from three independent biological replicates and 9 technical replicates for each biological replicate.
