TITLE
Estrogen-independent genomic ER binding analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hormone-independent breast cancer cells (MCF-7/LTED and HCC-1428/LTED) were analyzed by ChIP-seq for estrogen receptor a to identify ER-DNA binding events that occur in the absence of estrogens.

DESIGN
MCF-7/LTED and HCC-1428/LTED cells were maintained in IMEM + 10% DCC-FBS (dextran-charcoal-treated serum). ChIP for ERa was performed, following by high-throughput DNA sequencing.
