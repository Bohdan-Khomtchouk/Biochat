TITLE
miRNA profiling of 36 cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression data from 36 cases of RCHOP treated DLBCL samples were correlated with clinical variables in order to find miRNA signatures related with outcome.

DESIGN
Cases classified according to the cell of origin classsifer (Wright G, Tan B, Rosenwald A, Hurt EH, Wiestner A, Staudt LM. A gene expression-based method to diagnose clinically distinct subgroups of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2003;100:9991-6.) based on gene expression were subjected to miRNA expression profiling.
