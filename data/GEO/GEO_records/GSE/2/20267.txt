SUMMARY
Full title: Environmental transcriptome analysis of LfeRT32a in its natural microbial community comparing the biofilm and planktonic modes of life. Extreme acidic environments are characterized among other features by the high metal content and the lack of nutrients (oligotrophy). Macroscopic biofilms and filaments usually grow on the water-air interface or under the stream attached to solid substrates (streamers). In the Tinto River (Spain), brown filaments develop under the water stream where the Gram-negative iron-oxidizing bacteria Leptospirillum ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans are abundant. Both microorganisms play a critical role in bioleaching processes for industrial (biominery) and environmental applications (acid mine drainage, bioremediation). The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological differences between the free living (planktonic) and the sessile (biofilm associated) lifestyles of L. ferrooxidans as part of a natural extremely acidophilic community.

DESIGN
Differential expression profile of biofilm cells using planktonic cells as control. Two biological replicates. Two replicates per array.
