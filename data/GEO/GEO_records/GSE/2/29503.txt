TITLE
Microarray CGH Profiling Of Serous Ovarian Tumours Identifies Novel Copy Number Alterations Associated with Patient Survival

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray CGH analysis with a tiling path BAC DNA microarray to profile DNA copy number alterations in 164 serous ovarian adenocarcinomas. Survival probabilities modelled by proportional hazards were used to stratify cases into good, intermediate or poor survival groups. Comparison of aCGH data from these groups was used to identify genomic alterations associated with patient survival.
