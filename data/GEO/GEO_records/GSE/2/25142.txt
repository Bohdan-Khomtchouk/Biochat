TITLE
Study of gene expression of mouse cMET experiments

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the molecular changes in a mouse c-MET over-expression model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

DESIGN
FVB mice overexpressing human c-MET carried one copy of the LAP-tTa transgene (the liver-specific LAP promoter driving the Tet-VP16 transactivator) and one copy of the TRE-c-MET transgene (Tet-operator regulated human c-MET gene).  Normal liver or liver tumor tissue (two per mouse) was collected and processed for gene expression profiling.
