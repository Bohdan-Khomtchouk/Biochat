TITLE
Genome-Wide Maps of WT and DBDmut Estrogen Receptor in Human Breast Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We wanted to explore the relative contributions of DNA binding and tethering regulation modes by the estrogen receptor in human breast cancer cells

DESIGN
We defined the genome-wide localization of WT and DBDmut estrogen receptors in human breast cancer cells
