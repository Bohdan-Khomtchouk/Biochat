TITLE
affy_mildew_sunflower-PAM2010

ORGANISM
Helianthus annuus

SUMMARY
affy_mildew_sunflower - A quantitative resistance of sunflower to downy mildew (Plasmopara halstedii) has been mapped on LG10 (Vear et al., 2008). Is this quantitative resistance involving novel biological mechanisms? Compare the pattern of expression of specific resistances harboured by the Pl5/Pl2 alleles and the quantitative resistance harboured by the favourable allele at the mapped QTL, during compatible and incompatible interactions in the pathosystem Helianthus annuus / Plasmopara halstedii

DESIGN
60 arrays - SUNFLOWER; normal vs disease comparison
