TITLE
Exogenous expression of CC3/TIP30 in U373 cells with or without UV treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The pro-apoptotic protein CC3/TIP30 has an unusual cellular function as an inhibitor of nucleocytoplasmic transport. This function is likely to be activated under conditions of stress. Here we examined the potential role of CC3 in regulation of cellular responses to genotoxic stress. We found that forced expression of CC3 in CC3-negative cells delays repair of both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. Exogenously introduced CC3 negatively affects expression levels of DDB2 and p21CIP11 and inhibits induction of c-FOS after UV exposure, which is likely to contribute to the observed delay in DNA damage repair. The increase in nuclear localization of p21CIP11 observed after UV exposure is diminished in cells expressing exogenous CC3. Expression of CC3 also delays repair of oxidative DNA damage and leads to a decrease in levels of nucleoredoxin. Silencing of CC3 in CC3-positive cells has a modest delaying effect on repair of the UV induced damage, but has a much more significant negative affect on the translesion DNA synthesis after UV exposure. This could be related to the higher expression levels and increased nuclear localization of p21CIP11 in cells where expression of CC3 is silenced.  Apparently, manipulation of the cellular levels of CC3 adversely affects DNA damage responses by affecting the levels and subcellular localization of relevant proteins.

DESIGN
4 groups - U373 Neo Control, U373 CC3, U373 Neo Control UV, U373 CC3 UV. Each group has 3 biological replicates. Each biological replicates has 3 technical replicates.
