TITLE
Long non-coding RNAs regulate adipogenesis (Illumina RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adipogenesis involves the regulation of hundreds of genes by several well-studied proteins, but the role of long, noncoding RNAs in this process has not been defined.  We track the regulation of hundreds of lncRNAs during adipocyte differentiation, and find several that are essential for this process.

DESIGN
We extractedbrown and white primary adipocytes and pre-adipocytes and profiled lncRNA expresssion via mRNA-Seq.  We also profiled cultured, differentiated adipocytes to verify that we could recapitulate the adipocyte expression profile in preparation for a loss-of-function screen for essential adipogenic lincRNAs.
