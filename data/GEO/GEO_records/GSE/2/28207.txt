TITLE
Two-step RNA sequencing identifies a tissue-specific landscape of sense/antisense transcription

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the complexity of the polyadenylated transcriptome of the mouse intestinal tract assessed by two step RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Screening and verification of non-annotated transcriptional units by different RNA-Seq protocols.
