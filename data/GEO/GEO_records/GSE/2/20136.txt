TITLE
Genome-wide nucleosome occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing, and microarray analysis of RNA abundance

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
We profiled nucleosome occupancy of different developmental stages in C. elegans. Mononucleosomal DNA was sequenced by Illumina paired-end sequencing. We used embryos, germlineless adults, germ line containing adults, and XO hermaphrodites at L3 larval stage. RNA abundance is determined by microarray analysis. We also digested naked DNA with MNase.
