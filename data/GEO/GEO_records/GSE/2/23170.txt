TITLE
ChIP-on-chip experiment from Ramos cells to analyze genome-wide CRTC2 binding sites in germinal center B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-on-chip experiment from Ramos cells to analyze genome-wide CRTC2 binding sites in germinal center B cells.  The goal was to combine information from our ChIP-on-chip and expression array analyses to compile a list of CRTC2 target genes.

DESIGN
CRTC2 was immunoprecipitated from sheared chromatin isolated from untreated Ramos cells using 2 antibodies which recognize distinct epitopes on the CRTC2 protein.  Immunoprecipitates were compared to total input chromatin.  2 biological replicates were performed for each antibody.
