TITLE
Effect of uniconazole-P on wt and pkl mutant germinating seeds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Relative expression data from germinating seeds of Columbia (wt), the pkl mutant (pkl), Columbia plus uniconazole-P (Uwt) and the pkl-mutant plus uniconazole-P (Upkl). Each experimental condition (wt, pkl, Uwt and Upkl) has four true replicates for a total of 16 chips. Keywords = CHD3 Keywords = chromatin remodeling factors Keywords = developmental transition Keywords = embryo Keywords = seed germination Keywords: other
