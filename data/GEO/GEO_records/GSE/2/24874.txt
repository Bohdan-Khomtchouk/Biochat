TITLE
Gene Expression Arrays comparing wild-type Kluyveromyces lactis a, alpha, and a/alpha cells and a comparison between WT a cells and rme1 knock-out a cells

ORGANISM
Kluyveromyces lactis

SUMMARY
WT and rme1 KO K. lactis cells (a, alpha, and a/alpha) were grown in YEPD, phosphate starvation and phosphate starvation with the addition of alpha pheromone. The goal was to identify cell-type regulated genes and to determine the effects of growth media on the regulation of cell-type regulated genes

DESIGN
Expression was measured relative to pooled references, note that only the arrays with matched pooled references can be compared to each other
