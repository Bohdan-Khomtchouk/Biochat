TITLE
MicroRNA expression of primary gastric adenocarcinoma compared to non-cancer gastric tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of the microRNA signature associated with human gastric adenocarcinoma.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 60 primary gastric cancer tissues and 8 surrounding non-cancer tissues was used for microarray analysis. For validation, real-time RT-PCR was performed.
