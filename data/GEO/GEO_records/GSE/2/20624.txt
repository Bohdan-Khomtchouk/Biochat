TITLE
Breast Carcinomas arising at a Young Age:  A Unique Biology or a Surrogate for Aggressive Intrinsic Subtypes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer is no longer viewed as a homogenous disease, but rather a compilation of several distinct subtypes as defined by microarray or other large scale genomic analyses.  Based on prior reports, we hypothesized that younger womenâ€™s breast tumors would be enriched for more aggressive subtypes (i.e. Basal-like) and higher grade, and that age-specific gene expression differences may be highly dependent on subtype classification and/or grade.  Using two independent datasets, our current analysis shows that breast tumors arising in women aged = 45 years are enriched for the Basal-like subtype (and higher grade) while those aged = 65 years are enriched for Luminal tumors.  Moreover, when evaluating gene expression differences between age-defined groups, sizable gene lists were identified which diminished to few, if any, age-specific genes when statistically correcting for significant clinical factors (i.e. subtype, grade, etc). Keywords: reference x sample

DESIGN
344 breast tumor samples hybridized with Stratagene common reference and profiled on Agilent microarrays.
