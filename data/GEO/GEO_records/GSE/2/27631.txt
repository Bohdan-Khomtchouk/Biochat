TITLE
Expression data of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with BMP-6 and BMP-9

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Smad1/5 are transcription factors that engage in BMP-induced transcription. We determined and analyzed Smad1/5 binding sites by ChIP-sequencing. We used expression microarrays to compare the Smad1/5 binding sites identified by ChIP-seq to BMP-induced gene expressions.

DESIGN
HUVECs were treated with BMP for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
