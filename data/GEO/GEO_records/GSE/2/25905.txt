TITLE
Expression data from mouse bone marrow adipocytes with age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to characterize the age-related gene expression profiles between bone marrow adipocytes and peripheral white adipocytes. Alterations of gene expression with aging were analyzed in bone marrow and peripheral white adipocytes isolated from C57BL/6J male mice using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays.

DESIGN
Bone marrow adipocytes and peripheral white adipocytes (n=6-10 animals per group) were isolated from male C57BL/6J mice (6-months, 14-months and 18-months of age).  Samples were grouped into cell type (bone marrow adipocytes vs. peripheral adipocytes) and age (6-month (6M), 14-month (14M) and 18-month (18M)).
