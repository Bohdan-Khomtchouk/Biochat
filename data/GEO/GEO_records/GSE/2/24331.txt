TITLE
Identification of Gene Products Involved in the Oxidative Stress Response of Moraxella catarrhalis

ORGANISM
Moraxella catarrhalis

SUMMARY
Series of DNA microarrays (4) comparing the M. catarrhalis strain 035E response to 50 mM hydrogen peroxide relative to a water-only control.

DESIGN
Wild-type cells were exposed to either 50 mM hydrogen peroxide or a water-only control for 15 minutes.  RNA was extracted and DNA microarray analysis performed.  4 biologic replicates were studied.  One dye swap was included in this series analysis.
