TITLE
The metalloregulatory site in Streptococcus pneumoniae AdcR,  a zinc-activated MarR-family repressor

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 AdcR (adhesion competence repressor) is the first metal-sensing member of the MarR (multiple antibiotic resistance repressor) family to be characterized.  Expression profiling of a âˆ†adcR strain grown in liquid culture under microaerobic conditions revealed that transcript amounts for 13 genes were up-regulated relative to the wild-type strain, among them adcR, adcCBA, encoding a high affinity ABC uptake system for zinc, and genes encoding cell-surface zinc-binding pneumococcal histidine triad (pht) and adcII (lmb, laminin binding) proteins. Down-regulated transcripts included those encoding two putative zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases.
