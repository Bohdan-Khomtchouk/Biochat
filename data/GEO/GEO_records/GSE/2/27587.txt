TITLE
Mixing Experiment - Mouse Kidney and Spleen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The design of this experiment was based on the assumption that transcript levels will change linearly while going from 100 percent of one tissue to 100 percent of the other. This assumed linear data set could be used to evaluate various issues related to low-level microarray data analysis.
