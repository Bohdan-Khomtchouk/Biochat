TITLE
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array data for chordoma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chordomas are rare, low to intermediate grade malignant bone tumors of the axial skeleton, believed to originate from the notochord. Treatment options are limited and mainly restricted to surgical excision, as chordomas have been proven to be largely resistant to conventional ionizing radiation and chemotherapy. Therefore a new cell line was established. The cell line has been characterized by immunohistochemistry,western blot and karyotyping using cobra fish technology. Copy number variations (CNV) and loss-of heterozygosity (LOH) from fibroblasts, tumor tissue, low and high cell line passage was evaluted by using Affymetrix 6.0SNP Arrays. DNA isolated from the patients MNCs was used as control. The cell line MUG-Chor1 is highly similar to genetic profiles of chordomas and provides therefore a powerful tool for further investigations.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryo material or cell lines. Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed for 4 samples. 60 samples from HapMap database were used as references for copy number inference.
