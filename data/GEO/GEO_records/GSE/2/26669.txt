TITLE
Expression data of alloantigen stimulated splenocytes treated with leukocyte costimulatory blockade antibodies or no treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the gene expression “footprint” of antigenically challenged T-cells which had been treated with anti-LFA-1, CTLA4Ig, anti-CD40-ligand antibodies, we performed microarray gene expression analysis comparing the expression profile of costimulatory blockade treated and untreated responder T-cells.

DESIGN
Allogeneic murine splenocytes were co-cultured in an vitro set-up for a mixed lymphocyte reaction. For the experimental/treated group, the leuckocyte costimulatory blocking antibodies anti-LFA-1, CTLA4Ig, anti-CD40-ligand were added to the media, the control group did not have any antiodies added to the media. After 5 days of incubation the responder CD4 and CD8 T cells were isolated by FACS and the gene expression was analyzed using affymetrix microarray platforms.
