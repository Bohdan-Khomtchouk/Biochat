TITLE
A Notch ligand, Delta-like 1 functions as an adhesion molecule for mast cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assess the effect of over-expression of Delta-like 1 on OP9 cells on gene expression in terms of Notch signaling and adhesion molecules, gene expressions of OP9, OP9-GFP (carrying GFP gene) and OP9-DL1 (carrying GFP and DL1 gene) cells (Immunity 2002;17:749-756) were analyzed.

DESIGN
Gene expression of OP9, OP9-GFP and OP9-DL1 were compared.
