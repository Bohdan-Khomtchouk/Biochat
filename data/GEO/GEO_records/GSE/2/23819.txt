TITLE
TFF3 miRNA expression in mus musculus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to investigate whether the trefoil peptide genes, in concerted action with a miRNA regulatory network, were contributing to nutritional maintrenance. Using a Tff3 knock-out mouse model, 21 specific miRNAs were noted to be significantly deregulated when compared to the wild type strain.

DESIGN
n = 6 mus musculus wild type samples and n = 6 knock-down experiments have been screened for a currently known mus musculus miRNAs and validated by TaqMan
