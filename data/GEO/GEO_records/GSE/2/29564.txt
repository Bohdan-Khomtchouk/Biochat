TITLE
ROP16-dependent host transcriptional responses in chicken embryonic fibroblasts infected with T. gondii [RH, ROP16-KO]

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous protozoan pathogen able to infect both mammalian and avian hosts.  Surprisingly, just three strains appear to account for the majority of isolates from Europe and N. America. To test the hypothesis that strain divergence might be driven by differences between mammalian and avian response to infection, we examine in vitro strain-dependent host responses in a representative avian host, the chicken. To identify parasite drivers of strain-dependent host response, QTL mapping was used; analysis revealed a locus on Toxoplasma chromosome VIIb.  To determine whether this was the parasite gene ROP16, array analysis was performed on chicken embryonic fibroblasts infected with Type I parasites and ROP16-KO parasites (of a Type I background).
