TITLE
Glyco-gene expression induced by IL-4 macrophage activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Evaluation of the changes in glycosylation induced by IL-4 alternative macrophage activation

DESIGN
Thioglycolate elicited murine peritoneal macrophages where incubated with and with out IL4 for 24 hours. Mouse RNA from macrophages incubated in OptiMEM10 and incubated in OptiMEM10 plus IL4, for 24 hours, was isolated and prepared in triplicate.  RNA was labeled and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 array. Resulting Gene expression patterns were analyzed.
