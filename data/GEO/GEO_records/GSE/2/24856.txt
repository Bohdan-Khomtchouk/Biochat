TITLE
Expression analysis of Candida tenuis NRRL Y-1498 grown in glucose or xylose

ORGANISM
[Candida] tenuis ATCC 10573

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Candida tenuis NRRL Y-1498 grown aerobically in xylose, compared to the same strain grown aerobically in glucose.

DESIGN
A six array study using total RNA recovered from three separate cultures of Candida tenuis NRRL Y-1498 grown in glucose and three separate cultures of Candida tenuis NRRL Y-1498 grown in xylose.  Each array measures the expression level of 363,196 probes (average probe length 53.1 +/- 3.8 nt) tiled across the Candida tenuis NRRL Y-1498 genome with a median spacing distance of 24 nt.  During data processing, probes are filtered to include only those probes corresponding to annotated protein-coding genes.
