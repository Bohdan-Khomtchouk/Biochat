TITLE
Gene expression profiles upon a microarray-based NSD3L-directed siRNA knockdown in human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
No genes have been described to be regulated by NSD3L. To identify genes regulated by NSD3L we inverstigated the effect of NSD3L depletion on gene regulation in the human breast cancel cell line MDA-MB-231 by a Illumina expression microarray (Human WG-6 v3.0) screening. We identified 113 different potential target genes out of 25.400 probe sets which have a more than 2-fold changed expression. Of these genes 44 were up-regulated and 69 down-regulated.

DESIGN
To deplete NSD3L we used siRNA directed specifically against this isoform. RNA isolated from NSD3L siRNA transfected cells was together with RNA from control siRNA transfected cells used to screen an Illumina expression microarray (HumanWG-6 v3.0). We identified 113 different potential target genes out of 25.400 probe sets which have a more than 2-fold changed expression. Of these genes 44 were up-regulated and 69 down-regulated.
