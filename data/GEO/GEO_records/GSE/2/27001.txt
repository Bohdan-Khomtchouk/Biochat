TITLE
Inhibition of Bcl6-SMRT/NCoR interactions by an inhibitory peptide affects inflammatory pathways

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using microarrays, we compared the changes in levels of gene expression between wild type mouse bone marrow derived macrophages upon treatment with the Bcl6 peptide inhibitor, RI-BPI, that specifically blocks interaction between BCL6 and the co-repressors NCoR or SMRT.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from cultered wild type primary bone marrow-derived macrophages that were treated with either 5 Î¼M control or RI-BPI peptide in MSF media for 12 hours.
