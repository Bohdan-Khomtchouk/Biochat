TITLE
Expression data from P4 and P10 mouse optic nerves

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Optic nerves are an accessible part of the CNS, providing a source of glia without the presence of neuronal cell bodies.  Therefore, an analysis was carried out of gene expression in optic nerves at P4, before myelination begins and at P10, when myelination is very actively proceeding.  The goal was to obtain a profile of the changing gene expression that accompanies this transition from unmyelinated CNS nerve to myelinated nerve.
