TITLE
Gene expression comparison among spleen dendritic cells, brain microglia, brain dendritic cells and bone marrow monocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the functional relationship between brain dendritic cells (brain DCs) and other myeloid cells, we compared the gene expression profile of m/chDCs to that of bone marrow monocytes, brain microglia and classical spleen CD8+ and CD8- DCs.  In order to obtain enough brain DCs for mRNA extraction, we expanded brain DCs with in vivo Flt3L treatment before purification.

DESIGN
This study includes data from FACs Aria-purified brain DCs, bone marrow monocytes, brain microglia and classical spleen CD8+ and CD8- DCs. The genearray was performed to compare expression of cell surface endocytic receptor, cytokine receptors, TLRs, transcription factors, molecules for antigen processing and presentation. Each Series consists of 3 individuall samples
