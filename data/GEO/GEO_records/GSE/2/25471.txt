TITLE
Expression profile in HEK293T cells transfected with control or ZAPS expression vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293T cells overexpressing ZAPS (zinc finger antiviral protein, short form; NP_078901), which is a member of the PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase)-superfamily. Results of gene profiles provide insight into the role of ZAPS in innate immunity.
