TITLE
mRNA-Seq of whole adult females and males, and miixed sex embryos, from multiple Drosophila species

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
We performed transcriptional profiling of sexed whole adults and mixed sex embryos of eight Drosophila species.  These data were used in a comparative transcriptomics analysis of multiple Drosophila species to define functional elements conserved throughout the Drosophila genus.
