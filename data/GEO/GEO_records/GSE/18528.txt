TITLE
Comparative analysis of ependymal cells from the lateral ventricular wall and the spinal cord of adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In contrast to ependymal cells in the lateral ventricle wall (LVW), spinal cord (SC) ependymal cells possess certain neural stem cell characteristics. Isolated CD133+/CD24+/CD45-/CD34- ependymal cells from the SC displayed in vitro self renewal and differentiation capacity, whereas those from the LVW did not. The molecular basis of this difference is unknown. In this study, antibodies against multiple surface markers were applied to isolate SC and LVW ependymal cells which allowed a direct comparison of their in vitro behavior and gene expression profile.
