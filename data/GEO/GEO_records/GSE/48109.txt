TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of gene expression in male and female mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in adult male and female mouse liver was assayed by RNA-seq, as part of a study on chromatin states in male and female mouse and their role in sex-biased liver gene expression (A Sugathan and DJ Waxman (2013) Mol Cell Biol. 33:3594-3610. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00280-13).

DESIGN
Total liver RNA was prepared from 12 individual male and 12 individual female mice.  Four RNA pools, comprised of RNA isolated from 6 individual male or female livers (2 pooled biological replicates for each sex) were then prepared and used for RNA-seq.
