TITLE
Transcriptional profiling during fetal skeletal muscle development of Piau and Yorkshire-Landrace crossbred pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways in longissimus dorsi (LD) of pigs at 40 and 70 d of gestation (stages encompassing the transition from primary to secondary fiber formation) in U.S. commercial crossbred pigs (Yorkshire x Landrace) and Brazilian native Piau pigs. We confirmed the expression patterns for a subset of genes by qRT-PCR. Pathway analysis revealed functionally related genes, and indicated commonalities and differences between the breed types and developmental ages evaluated. Results from qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression patterns observed on the array for most of the genes tested (85%). This study reveals transcriptional profiles in LD at 40 and 70 d gestation for commercial and Piau pigs, which helps elucidate phenotypic differences between these breed types.
