TITLE
Sigma factor E of Mycobacterium tuberculosis controls the expression of bacterial components that modulate macrophages

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Sigma factor E (SigE) controls the expression of genes that are essential for Mtb virulence. In this work, we have identified the SigE regulon during infection of macrophages Our results indicate that SigE regulates the expression of genes involved in the maintenance of Mtb cell envelope integrity and function (i.e., detoxification and secretion). Keywords: strains comparison

DESIGN
We compared the global gene expression of the H37Rv strain and the sigE mutant strain of Mtb  in different conditions: growing exponentially in liquid media; after 2h of incubation in RPMI; or after 24 hours of infection of human macrophage-like THP-1 cells.
