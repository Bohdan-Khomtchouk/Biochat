TITLE
Sigma factor E of Mycobacterium tuberculosis controls the expression of bacterial components that modulate macrophages

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Sigma factor E (SigE) controls the expression of genes that are essential for Mtb virulence. In this work, we have identified the SigE regulon during infection of macrophages Our results indicate that SigE regulates the expression of genes involved in the maintenance of Mtb cell envelope integrity and function (i.e., detoxification and secretion). Keywords: strains comparison
