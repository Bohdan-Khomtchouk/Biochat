TITLE
Effect of CDK8/19 inhibitor Senexin A on p21-regulated gene expression in human HT1080 p21-9 cells with IPTG-inducible p21

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
p21 (CDKN1A) expression from an IPTG-inducible promoter in HT1080 p21-9 cells was previously shown to inhibit a set of genes, many of which are involved in cell cycle progression, and to upregulate another set of genes, some of which have been implicated in cancer and age-related diseases. We have now developed Senexin A, a small-molecule inhibitor of p21-induced transcription, which we found to be a selective inhibitor of CDK8 and CDK19. Here we tested the effect of Senexin A on the induction and inhibition of transcription by p21. In this dataset, we include microarray gene expression data from samples of HT1080 p21-9 cells that were either untreated, treated with p21-inducing IPTG alone, with Senexin A alone, or with IPTG and Senexin A. This experiment shows that Senexin A inhibits primarily the induction but not the inhibition of gene expression by p21.

DESIGN
The data for each of the four samples were normalized to the sample from untreated cells, using GeneSpring GX. Fold changes in gene expression upon the addition of IPTG with or without Senexin A were compared using Microsft Excel. Changes in the expression of specific GO categories of genes were compared using GeneSpring.
