TITLE
Expression data  HEK293T cells transfected with either Ago2, Ago2 + miR-1, Ago2 + miR-124,  mock

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HEK293T cell expression data from four conditions: mock transfection, Ago2 transfection, Ago2 & miR-1 transfection, and Ago2 & miR-124 transfection. RNA was isolated directly from 10cm dishes using Trizol reagent and amplified. Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Compound Based Treatment: FLAG-Ago2 transfection Keywords: Biological Replicate
