TITLE
Comprehensive mouse alpha and beta cell transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rodent models are widely used to study diabetes. Yet, significant gaps remain in our understanding of mouse islet physiology that reduce their accuracy as a model for human islet disease. We generated comprehensive transcriptomes of mouse beta and alpha cells using a novel bitransgenic mouse model generated for this purpose. This enables systematic comparison across thousands of genes between the two major endocrine cell types of the islets of Langerhans whose principal hormones are of cardinal importance for glucose homeostasis. Our data leveraged against similar data for human beta cells reveal a core common beta cell transcriptome of 9900+ genes and marked differences in the repertoire of receptors and long non-coding RNAs between mouse and human beta cells. The comprehensive comparison of the (dis)similarities between mouse and human beta cells represents an invaluable resource to boost the effectiveness by which rodent models offer guidance in finding cures for human diabetes.

DESIGN
FACS purified alpha and beta cells from the same islets. Islets were isolated from bitransgenic offspring of a cross between mIns1-H2b-mCherry and S100b-eGFP transgenic reporter mice that mark beta and alpha cells, respectively. Islets from two replicate groups of 10 or 11 animals were pooled by sex to obtain sufficient material. Pooled islets were dissociated, sorted and collect in Trizol for RNA isolation and library construction.
