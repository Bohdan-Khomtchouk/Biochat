TITLE
Gene expression analysis of primitive erythroid progenitors from 5-FU-treated WT and ESAM-KO mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the compromised erythropoiesis of ESAM-KO mice, Lin- FCgRII/III-/Lo CD41Lo c-Kit+ Sca1- endoglin+ CD150+ cells, which contain mostly BFU-E and CFU-E, were sorted from 5-FU-treated WT and ESAM-KO mice, and were subjected to microarray analyses.

DESIGN
Microarray analyses of primitive erythroid progenitors from 5-FU-treated WT and ESAM-KO mice was performed as 1 color experiment.
