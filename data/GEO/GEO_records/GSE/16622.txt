TITLE
HIF-2alpha Knockdown in A498 (VHL-/-) ccRCC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIF-2alpha is essential for (VHL-/-) ccRCC subcutaneous tumor growth in mice, and in tumor cell lines, its inhibition results in increased ROS accumulation, tumor cell death and responsiveness to radiation treatment. We have utilized transcriptional profiling to screen for putative HIF-2alpha targets genes that serve an anti-oxidant and, thus, cell survival function. A498 ccRCC cell line was treated with control siRNA or mixture of two HIF-2alpha specific siRNA for 48 hours, and RNA was harvested.  4 independent experiments were performed, and expression was compared between control and HIF-2alpha knockdown groups.

DESIGN
8 total samples were applied to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.  We performed two-class paired analysis using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software to compare expression in the CT (control siRNA) and H2 (Hif2-alpha siRNA) groups.
