TITLE
SCBI Wild type and mutant Expression data

ORGANISM
Serratia sp. SCBI

SUMMARY
Purpose: To compare RNASeq data of wild type and mutants under standard growth conditions (Stationary Phase)28C for 18 h.  The mutants were found defective in genes encoding the following proteins: an alkaline metalloprotease secretion protein AprE,  GidA,  and a PIN domain protein. RNA-seq analysis provided insight into how inactivation of AprE, GidA and a PIN-domain protein influences global gene expression

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of wild type and mutants were generated by deep sequencing and mapped to SCBI genome by CLC Gemonic Workstation.  The transcriptome profiles of the mutants were compared to the wild type.
