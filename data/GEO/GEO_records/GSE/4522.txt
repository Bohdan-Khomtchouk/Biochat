TITLE
MicroRNA-134 Modulates Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profile of miRNAs during retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiation of mose embryonic stem cells Expression profile of mRNAs during retinoic acid (RA) amd miR-134 induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. Keywords: affymetrix custom array and illumina MouseRef-8

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC ) treated with retinoic acid (RA) over specified time periods (Day 0, 1, 4) and profiled using  acustom microarray designed by Affymetrix. Two biological repeats for every time point was measured. RNA was extracted from mESCs (Day 0, 2, 4 and 6) as well as from mESCs transfected with miR-134 precursor (134MM; 100nM) or scrambled oligomer or Lipofectamine only (MT) at Day3 post transfection. Two biological repeats for every time point or transfection. These RNA was then profiles using illumina beadarray MouseRef-8
