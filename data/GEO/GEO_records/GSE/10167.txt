TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Treacher Collins Syndrome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The object of this study was to identify genes transcriptionally upregulated and downregulated in response to Tcof1 haploin-sufficiency during mouse embryogensis Keywords: mouse embryo, littermates, Tcof1, Treacher Collins sydnrome, comparative hybridisation

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 3 E8.5 wild-type and 3 E8.5 Tcof1+/-  littermate embryos using the RNeasy Mini Protocol for Isolation of Total RNA from Animal Tissues (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality and quantity was determined using the Bioanalyser. To generate targets for microarray analysis, total RNA (100 ng) from each wild-type and mutant embryo was amplified using Two-Cycle Target Labeling (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Biotinylated target cRNAs (20 μg) from the 3 wild-type and 3 Tcof1+/- embryos were hybridised to separate GeneChip® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix), following standard Affymetrix procedures.
