TITLE
Identification of a novel NF-kB target gene in human triple-negative breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of human triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBCs) which have high NF-kB activity. Proteins derived from NF-ÎºB target genes might be molecular targets for cancer therapy. Results provide new insights into tumor proliferation mechanisms.

DESIGN
Exp. 1: Mock MDA-MB-436 cells vs. MDA-MB-436 cells infected with Adenovirus-IkBaSR; Exp. 2: MDA-MB-436 cells infected with Adenovirus-GFP vs. MDA-MB-436 cells infected with Adenovirus-IkBaSR.
