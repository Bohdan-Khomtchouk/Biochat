Plasmodium falciparum W2/Dd2 Day 8 gametocytes

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
The sexual stages are vital phases in malaria parasite transmission and are the targets of various interventions such as transmission blocking vaccines. The molecular mechanisms underlying sexual development, however, remain poorly understood. We report mappping of a determinant previously linked to a male gametocyte development defect in the P. falciparum Dd2 parasite to an 82 kb region on chromosome 12. In order to find a critical gene in this region, we compared gene expression pattern in sexual stage of the parasite between Dd2 and its normal gametocyte-producing ancestor W2 clones. The region contains a sexual stage specific gene (pfmdv 1) that is expressed substantially at a lower level in the Dd2 than in W2 parasite. Disruption of pfmdv 1 results in a dramatic reduction in mature gametocytes, especially male gametocytes, with the majority of sexually committed parasites arrested at stage-I. The pfmdv-1 knockout parasites show an enlarged nucleus, often with separation of the inner and outer nuclear membranes and presence of multi-membrane vesicles in red blood cell cytoplasm. Mosquito infectivity of the knockout parasites is also greatly reduced, but not completely lost, suggesting presence of compensatory mechanisms in the sexual development pathways. Data include Day 8 gametocytes of male defective Dd2 and parental W2 clones of Plasmodium falciparum. The series includes three biological repeats. Keywords: repeat sample
