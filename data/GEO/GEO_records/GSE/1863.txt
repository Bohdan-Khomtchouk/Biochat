TITLE
Dual Ligand Effects

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified differentially expressed genes in response to single and double ligand treatments (LPS, IFG, 2MA, LPS plus 2MA, and LPS plus IFG). The majority of the regulated transcripts responded additively to dual ligand treatment. However, a significant fraction responded in a non-additive fashion. Several cytokines showing non-additive transcriptional responses to dual ligand treatment also showed non-additive protein production/secretion responses in separate experiments. Many of the genes with non-additive responses to LPS plus 2MA showed enhanced responses and encoded pro-inflammatory proteins. On the other hand, LPS plus IFG appeared to induce both non-additive enhancement and non-additive attenuation of gene expression. The affected genes were associated with a variety of biological functions. These experiments reveal both dependent and independent regulatory pathways and further analyses may point out the specific nature of the regulatory interactions.
