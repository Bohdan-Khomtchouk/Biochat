TITLE
Osteoblast-specific deletion of Hrpt2/Cdc73 results in high bone mass and increased bone turnover

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq within OCN-Cre;Cdc73flox/flox osteoblasts showed that loss of Cdc73 led to a derepression of osteoblast-specific genes, specifically those for collagen and other bone matrix proteins.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of Flow-sorted calvarial osteoblasts of C57Bl/6J mice
