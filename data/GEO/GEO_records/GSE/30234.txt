TITLE
Mycobacterium smegmatis - Comparison of wild type SMR5 and glnR deletion strain MH1 under nitrogen starvation

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155

SUMMARY
In this approach, total transcript of the Mycobacterium smegmatis wild type SMR5 and a glnR deletion strain was compared under nitrogen starvation. Transcript levels of 6 genes were enhanced, 125 genes reduced in the mutant strain. This experiment confirmed GlnR as the global regulator of nitrogen metabolism in M. smegmatis. Two biological replicates were analyzed.
