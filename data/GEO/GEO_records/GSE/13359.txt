TITLE
Rat iPS F65 cells' gene expression difference compared with that of the adult cells including rat BMC and PEF cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat iPS F65 cells had different gene expression level compared with that of the adult cells including rat bone marrow cells(BMC) and rat primary ear fibroblasts(PEF). This difference gave rat iPS F65 cells unique characteristics which could then be compared with other species' ES cells or iPS cells like human ES cells and mouse ES cells by the homologue genes comparison to show which species' ES cells or iPS cells were more competitive with the other.

DESIGN
There were three replicates sample of the Rat iPS F65 cells named 1, 2, 3. And the adult cells were the mixture of rat bone marrow cells and rat primary ear fibroblasts named mix1. Rat iPS F65 cells samples were labled with Cy3 and the mix1 were labled with Cy5. The data was process to show the Rat iPS F65 cells' gene expression difference compared with that of mix1.
