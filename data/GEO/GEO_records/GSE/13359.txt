TITLE
Rat iPS F65 cells' gene expression difference compared with that of the adult cells including rat BMC and PEF cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat iPS F65 cells had different gene expression level compared with that of the adult cells including rat bone marrow cells(BMC) and rat primary ear fibroblasts(PEF). This difference gave rat iPS F65 cells unique characteristics which could then be compared with other species' ES cells or iPS cells like human ES cells and mouse ES cells by the homologue genes comparison to show which species' ES cells or iPS cells were more competitive with the other.
