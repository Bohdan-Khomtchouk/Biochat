TITLE
Gene expression of mouse embryonic gonad [Nanos2_Stra8]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine whether the meiosis was solo factor responsible for the disruption of the male gonocyte differenitiation in the Nanos2-/- male germ cells, we deleted Stra8 function from Nanos2-null background and performed expression microarray analysis of the Nanos2+/-/Stra8+/- , Nanos2-/-/Stra8+/-, and Nanos2-/-/Stra8-/- male emnbryonic gonads at E14.5.

DESIGN
Biological duplicates were examined at each stage, genotype, and sex for each experiment.
