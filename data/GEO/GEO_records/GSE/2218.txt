TITLE
Changes in transcript abundance and association with large polysomes in response to hypoxia stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
7d-old WT ler seedlings were submitted to 12h of non-stress (air) or hypoxia-stress treatment under low light conditions (45 uM m-2 s-2), and Total and Large Polysome RNA from both treatments were extracted and hybridized against Affymetrix genome chips. Values were used to evaluate changes in transcript abundance and transcript association with large polysomal complexes. TABLE 1 - Comparison between transcript abundance in non-stress and hypoxia-stress conditions. TABLE 2 - Comparison between transcript abundance in large polysome complexes (5 or more ribosomes per mRNA) in non-stress and 12 hypoxia-stress conditions. TABLE 3 - Proportion of total transcript that is associated with large polysome complexes (polysome loading) under non-stress conditions. Raw data (not normalized) TABLE 4 - Proportion of total transcript that is associated with large polysome complexes (polysome loading) under 12h of hypoxia-stress. Raw data (not normalized) Keywords: time-course
