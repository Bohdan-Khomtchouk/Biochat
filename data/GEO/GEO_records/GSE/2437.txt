TITLE
Transcriptional changes during neuronal death and replacement in the adult olfactory epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of mRNA abundance in the adult mouse olfactory epithelium during replacement of OSNs forced by the bilateral ablation of the olfactory bulbs.  The experiment was done on 6 week old male C57Bl/6 mice.  Olfactory epithelium tissue samples were collected on days 1, 5, and 7 after bulbectomy.  The cellular processes activated by bulbectomy include apoptosis of mature olfactory sensory neurons, infiltration of macrophages and dendritic cells, stimulation of proliferation of basal cell progenitors, and differentation of new sensory neurons. Keywords = olfaction Keywords = apoptosis Keywords = immune response Keywords = neurogenesis Keywords = gene silencing Keywords = microarray Keywords = transcription factor Keywords = spermatogenesis Keywords: time-course
