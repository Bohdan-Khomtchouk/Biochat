TITLE
Transcriptional alterations in cycling neural stem cells underlying alcohol use disorders

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ethanol inhibits the proliferation of neural stem cells in the fetal, adolescent, and adult brain.  The consequences are cognitive deficits associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and alcohol use disorder.  We tested the hypothesis that ethanol affects progression through cell cycle checkpoints by differentially modifying transcriptional processes.  Monolayer cultures of NS-5 neural stem cells were treated for 48 hr with the mitogenic agent FGF2 or the anti-mitogenic TGFÎ²1 in the absence or presence of ethanol.  Cell cycle elongation was induced by a global down-regulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression, including the cyclin E system.  Checkpoint regulation occurred downstream of p21 and Jun-oncogene signaling cascades.  Thus, ethanol can affect cell cycle progression by altering transcript expression of strategic genes downstream of the G1/S checkpoint.

DESIGN
NS5 neural stem cells were grown in Euromed Media supplemented with N2 and glutamine.  Cells were plated on poly-ornathine and laminin in the presence of FGF2 (10 ng/ul) and EGF (10 ng/ul) for 24 hrs.  Media was removed, cells were rinsed, and placed in growth factor free conditions for 4 hrs.  NS5 cells were then exposed to one of four treatment for 48 hrs: FGF2 (10 ng/ul) only, FGF2 (10 ng/ul) and ethanol (400 mg/dl), TGF-beta1 (10 ng/ul) only, or TGF-beta1 (10 ng/ul) and ethanol (400 mg/dl). Total RNA was collected immediately following treatment.
