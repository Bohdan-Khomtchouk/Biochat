TITLE
Differential gene expression between ERRa KO and WT mouse kidneys

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Estrogen-related receptor (ERR) alpha is an orphan nuclear receptor highly expressed in the kidneys. ERRalpha is implicated in renal sodium and potassium homeostasis and blood pressure regulation. We used microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in ERR alpha knockout mice kidneys versus wild-type. The results provide insight on the roles of ERRalpha in the kidney.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of WT and ERRaKO were performed, for a total of 6 samples. 2-3 month old males of each genotype were used.
