TITLE
Differentially expressed non-coding RNAs in mouse islets during pregnancy

ORGANISM
Mus

SUMMARY
Pregnancy is associated with increased β-cell proliferation driven by prolactin. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are the most abundant RNA species in the mammalian genome, yet, their functional importance is mainly elusive. This study tests the hypothesis that lncRNAs regulate β-cell proliferation in response to prolactin in the context of β-cell mass compensation in pregnancy.

DESIGN
Pancreatic islets were collected from pregnant C57BL/6 female mice at gestational day 14.5 or age matched non-pregnant mice as controls. Total RNA were isolated from about 600 islets pooled from 2-4 mice. cDNA were applied to Invitrogen NCode non-coding RNA arrays in triplicates.
