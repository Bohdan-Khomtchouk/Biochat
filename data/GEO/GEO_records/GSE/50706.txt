TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of open chromatin in mouse embryonic stem cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Micrococcal nuclease was used to digest mESC nuclei under a mild digestion condition to release the relatively open chromatin, and under an extensive digestion condition to release the genome chromatin. By comparing the genome distribution of mono-nucleasome under these two conditions, open chromatin regions were detected.

DESIGN
One mild digestion and one extensive digestion was applied to the mESC cells, followed by sequencing.
