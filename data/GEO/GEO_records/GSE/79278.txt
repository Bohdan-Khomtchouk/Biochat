TITLE
Identification of RNA interacting with the sRNA sponge 3'ETSleuZ

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
During glyW-cysT-leuZ polycistronic tRNA maturation, the 3’external transcribed spacer (3’ETS) sequence is excised and act as a sRNA sponge (Lalaouna et al., 2015). Using MS2-affinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing (MAPS), we demonstrated that 3’ETSleuZ was highly and specifically enriched by co-purification with at least two different small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), RyhB and RybB. Both sRNAs were shown to base pair with the same region in 3’ETSleuZ. Here, we use MS2-3’ETSleuZ as bait to co-purify all interacting sRNAs and confirm 3’ETSleuZ/RyhB and 3’ETSleuZ/RybB interactions.

DESIGN
Identification of sRNAs co-purified with MS2-3'ETSleuZ. 3'ETSleuZ (without MS2) was used as control
