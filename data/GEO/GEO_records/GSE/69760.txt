TITLE
Expression data from Bone marrow and Fetal liver Lineage-c-Kit+Sca-1+ (LSK) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of polycomb-group gene Ezh2 causes activation of fetal gene signature in adult mouse bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Ezh2 directly represses fetal-specific let-7 target genes, including Lin28, thereby cooperates with let-7 microRNAs in silencing fetal gene signature in BM HSPCs.

DESIGN
We purified Lineage-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) HSPCs from E14.5 FL and adult BM and subjected them to microarray analysis.
