TITLE
Characterization of AceA regulons in Bradyrhizobium japonicum under desiccation stress

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression was analyzed between B. japonicum wild type (Bj110) and aceA mutant (BjÎ”aceA) exposed to desiccation stress to find AceA regulons under the culture condition.

DESIGN
B. japonicum USDA110 wild type and aceA mutant were cultured under desiccation stress (27% RH for 24 h), then their tracrpitional profiles were compared.
