TITLE
Small RNA Solexa sequencing of 4 Plant Species in the Cucurbitaceae family

ORGANISM
Cucurbita moschata

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from different tissues (leaf, stem and flesh, rind and placenta of the fruits) using TRIzol reagent and small RNA libraries were generated from four cucurbit species: bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria (accession Grif 1617 collection from India)), Cucurbita moschata (accession Grif 14244 Early Butternut) Cucurbita pepo (accession NSL98075 Table King), and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus) (PI 438676 Charleston Grey) by pooling equimolar amounts of total RNA from the aforesaid tissues. Construction of small RNA libraries from size fractionated RNA was carried out as described previously. In brief, small RNA fractions of 18–28 nt were isolated from 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and sequentially ligated to 5′ and 3′ RNA adapters. Small RNAs ligated with adapters were converted to DNA by RT-PCR following Solexa protocol. The final PCR product was gel purified and sequenced by Genome Analyser II (Illumina).

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA transcriptomes in four plants species using Illumina/Solexa GA-II.
