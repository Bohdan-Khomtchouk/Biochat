TITLE
Gene Expression profiles in Retinoblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles in retinoblastoma by whole Human Genome DNA microarrays in comparison to  the normal retina gave an insight into several genes and pathways that were regulated in the tumor. The upregulated and the downregulated genes were further validated by quantitative real time PCR and tissue microarray (TMA) on retinoblastoma tumors. Theoverall  goal is to determine the global gene expression profile in retinoblastoma tumors which is first of its kind on a whole genome microarray.

DESIGN
Two coloured microarray:retinoblastoma tumor (4 samples) vs. normal retina (4 samples).
