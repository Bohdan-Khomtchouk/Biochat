TITLE
Identification of sex-specific hepatic lincRNAs using nuclear RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in adult male and female mouse liver was analyzed based on nuclear RNA-seq, as part of a study on hepatic lincRNAs.

DESIGN
Nuclear liver RNA was prepared from 6 individual male and 6 individual female mice. Pools comprised of RNA isolated from 6 individual male or female livers (1 pool of 6 biological replicates for each sex) were then prepared and used for strand-specific RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
