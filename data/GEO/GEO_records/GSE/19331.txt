TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of the effects of 089 on a panel of yeast strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The analysis allow to delve into the molecular activity of the molecule 089, wich induced a growth decrease on various yeast strains. Yeast strains selected are knock-out mutants in genes involved in MDR (BY4742Δerg6, BY4742Δsnq2) and the parental strain (BY4742).

DESIGN
Six samples analyzed, two biological replicatesfor each yeast strain, the referenze samples is the treatment with 089 of the parental strain, BY4742.
