TITLE
Insights into LMH cells response to fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) infection by transcriptome analysis

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To better understand the interactions between host and FAdV-4 infection at transcription level, and to explore the pathogenesis of this virus, a high-throughput RNA-seq technology was utilized in white leghorn male hepatocellular (LMH) cells at 12, 24, and 48 hours after FAdV-4 infection.

DESIGN
The FAdV-4 infected and non-infected cells were collected at 12, 24, and 48 hpi. There were six groups: 12 h mock, 24 h mock, 48 h mock, 12 h infected, 24 h infected, and 48 h infected group. Each group had 3 biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL19005 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Gallus gallus)
