TITLE
Expression analysis of sporulating Bacillus subtilis strain 168 deleted for prpE gene

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in sporulating Bacillus subtilis 168 delta-prpE mutant, compared to the wild-type strain.  The mutation engineered into this strain results in impaired germination of spores.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA extracted from three separate wild-type cultures of sporulating Bacillus subtilis 168 and three separate cultures of sporulating mutant strain, Bacillus subtilis 168 delta-prpE, in which prpE (yjbP BSU11630) gene coding for a protein phosphatase is deleted entirely.  Each chip consists of four fields able to measure the expression level of 4,104 genes from Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis strain 168 NC_000964 with eight 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with two-fold technical redundancy.
