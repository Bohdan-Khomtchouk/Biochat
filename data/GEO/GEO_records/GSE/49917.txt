TITLE
microRNA (miRNA) expression analysis of developmental retinoic acid exposure in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Investigation of microRNA expression profile of 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-fertilization Danio rerio embryos developmentally exposed to retinoic acid.

DESIGN
A twelve chip study using total RNA recovered from pools of 75 tropical 5D zebrafish embryos at 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours post fertilization (hpf). Embryos were exposed to control embryo medium or 5 nM retinoic acid from 6-24 hpf, with two biological replicates per condition. Control samples were pooled and hybridized to a single array. 12 miRZebrafish arrays (based on MirBase release 12.0) were used to measure the expression level of 218 mature miRNA from Danio rerio.
