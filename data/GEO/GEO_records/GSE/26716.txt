TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in QKI knockdown CG-4 cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
QKI is required for myelin formation in the verterbrate brain.  It functions by binding RNA and regulating its stability, translation, and/or aternative splicing. We have used Affymetrix exon arrays to assess changes in gene expression in response to QKI knockdown on an exon level in rat CG-4 oligodendrocyte precursor cells.

DESIGN
Knockdown cells were compared to control cells.  Knockdown groups included QKI siRNA transfection, QKI shRNA stable transfection, and hnRNP A1 transient transfection.  Control groups consisted of untransfected, control siRNA transfection, control shRNA stable transfection. Each group was analyzed in triplicate.
