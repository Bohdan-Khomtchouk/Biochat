TITLE
CDK inhibitor PHA-848125 gene expression profiling on MCF7 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effects of the CDK inhibitor PHA-848125  (referred to as CDK-125) on the MCF7 human adenocarcinoma mammary cell line were analysed by gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
The MCF7 cell line was treated with PHA-848125 for 6 hours at a dose equal to 5 times the IC50. Untreated MCF7 cells were used as a control. Two replicates per treatment.
