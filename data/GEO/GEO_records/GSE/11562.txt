TITLE
response of Escherichia coli and glutathion mutants to Cadmium

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
We investigated the impact of cadmium on the global transcriptome of E. coli wild type, ∆gshA and ∆gshB mutant cells to evaluate the molecular basis of cadmium toxicity in the presence or absence of cellular thiols. This global transcriptome analysis were done with cells synthezising GSH (wild type), gamma-glutamyl-cysteine (∆gshB mutant) or neither of the two cellular thiols (∆gshA mutant) under the influence of 100 µM Cd(II).
