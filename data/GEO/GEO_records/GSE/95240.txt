TITLE
RNA-sequencing of C.elegans isp-1 mutant and superoxide dismutase-isp-1 double mutants

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
isp-1;sod double mutants have decreased lifespan, increased resistance to oxidative stress and slow physiologic rates. We performed RNA sequencing to compare gene expression between isp-1 mutants and isp-1;sod-3 and isp-1;sod-5 double mutants

DESIGN
Nine biological replicates per genotype; mRNA was isolated individually from each replicate; three mRNA samples were pooled into one sample; three samples for WT, isp-1, isp-1;sod-3, isp-1;sod-5 were sequenced individually

PLATFORM
GPL19757 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Caenorhabditis elegans)
