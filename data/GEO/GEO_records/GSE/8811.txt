TITLE
Rice plants infested with planthoppers

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Infestation with white-backed planthopper (WBPH) to rice caused induced resistance to rice pathogens but brown planthopper (BPH) infestation induce weaker resistance to rice pathogens. We compared changes in gene expression in rice plants infested with WBPH and BPH to gain some insight into the WBPH-induced resistance to rice pathogens. An analysis, using microarrays, of gene expression in rice plants infested with these planthoppers revealed that WBPH infestation caused high induction of many defense-related genes including pathogenesis-related (PR) genes than BPH infestation. Furthermore, hydroperoxide lyase 2 (OsHPL2) which is an enzyme to produce C6 volatiles was induced by WBPH infestation, but not by BPH infestation. Keywords: response to herbivory; induced resistance
