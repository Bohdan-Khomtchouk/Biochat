TITLE
Rice plants infested with planthoppers

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Infestation with white-backed planthopper (WBPH) to rice caused induced resistance to rice pathogens but brown planthopper (BPH) infestation induce weaker resistance to rice pathogens. We compared changes in gene expression in rice plants infested with WBPH and BPH to gain some insight into the WBPH-induced resistance to rice pathogens. An analysis, using microarrays, of gene expression in rice plants infested with these planthoppers revealed that WBPH infestation caused high induction of many defense-related genes including pathogenesis-related (PR) genes than BPH infestation. Furthermore, hydroperoxide lyase 2 (OsHPL2) which is an enzyme to produce C6 volatiles was induced by WBPH infestation, but not by BPH infestation. Keywords: response to herbivory; induced resistance

DESIGN
Agilent rice oligo microarray was used to investigate the gene expression profiling in rice plants infested with WBPH or BPH. Total RNA was extracted from pooled leaf blades infested with WBPH or BPH for 24 h and from mock-treated pooled leaf blades. Total RNA (200 ng) was labeled with Cy-3 or Cy-5 using an Agilent low RNA input linear amplification kit. Fluorescently labeled targets were hybridized to Agilent rice oligo microarrays. Hybridization and wash processes were performed according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions, and hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner. Agilent Feature Extraction software was employed for the image analysis and data extraction processes. Fold changes in expression level in each treatment were compared with those of the respective mock-treated controls. In each treatment, the experiment was performed independently three times.
