TITLE
Human meniscus from late stages of osteoarthritis - Comparisons: diseased vs. less diseased samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Meniscus samples were taken from eight patients. Four patients were less diseased (LD) than the other four (D). Microarrays were used to detect differential gene expression between these two groups.

DESIGN
Differential expression analysis: diseased (D) vs. less diseased (LD) samples. Biological replicates: 4 diseased, 4 less diseased. One replicate per array.
