TITLE
Microarray analysis of a multiple myeloma cell line, MM1S, treated with adenosine A2A and Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptor agonists in combination with dexamethasone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used an agnostic approach to identify drug combinations by using combination high throughput screening (cHTS) technology and make the surprising discovery that adenosine A2A and beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists are highly synergistic, selective and novel agents that enhance glucocorticoid activity in B-cell malignancies. We used the microarray study to understand the synergistic mechanism between dexamethasone and A2A receptor agonist or Beta-2 Adrenergic receptor agonist in a multiple myeloma cell line, MM1S.

DESIGN
MM1S cells were treated with CGS-21680 or Salmeterol alone, or in combination with dexamethasone for six hours for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
