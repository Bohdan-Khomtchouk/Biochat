TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila Kc167 cell line

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The consitutive activation of the JAK/STAT signalling cascade is reponsible for the majority of meyoproliferative disorders in humans, a disease that is also conserved in Drosophila. A gain-of-function mutation in the Drosophila JAK kinase leads to blood cell (haemocyte) overproliferation which eventually is manifested as black melanotic tumors. Haemocyte-like Drosophila Kc167 cells were used to identify downstream target genes of the JAK/STAT pathway which may be responsible for tumour generation and progression.

DESIGN
Kc167 cells were activated with the principal JAK/STAT pathway ligand Unpaired (UPD) in a time course manner. To this end, for each transcript profiling condition and time point, biological duplicates were activated with UPD or Mock conditioned media for 30 min, and total RNA was extracted 2, 4 or 10h after initial addition of conditioned media. 12 samples were used for hybridization to the arrays.
