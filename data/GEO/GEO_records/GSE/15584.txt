TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila Kc167 cell line

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The consitutive activation of the JAK/STAT signalling cascade is reponsible for the majority of meyoproliferative disorders in humans, a disease that is also conserved in Drosophila. A gain-of-function mutation in the Drosophila JAK kinase leads to blood cell (haemocyte) overproliferation which eventually is manifested as black melanotic tumors. Haemocyte-like Drosophila Kc167 cells were used to identify downstream target genes of the JAK/STAT pathway which may be responsible for tumour generation and progression.
