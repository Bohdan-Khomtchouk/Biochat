TITLE
microRNA expression analysis of CMV infected human fibroblasts in two cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of microRNA expression patterns in cytomegalovirus infected human fibroblasts for two cultures with differing sensitivity to the virus

DESIGN
Non-coding RNAs were cloned from total RNA extracts obtained from 2 human fibroblast lines with differing sensitivity to CMV infection. For each line 3 types of samples are compared: pre-experimantal norm, 3 hours after infection, 3 hours without infection.
