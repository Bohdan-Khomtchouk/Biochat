TITLE
Sim3, a NASP (N1/N2) related protein, escorts CENP-A for deposition at fission yeast centromeres

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
A defining feature of centromeres is the presence of the histone H3 variant CENP-ACnp1. It is not known how CENP-ACnp1 is specifically delivered to, and assembled into centromeric chromatin. Through a screen for factors involved in kinetochore integrity in fission yeast we identified Sim3. Sim3 is homologous to known histone binding proteins NASPHuman and N1/N2Xenopus and aligns with Hif1S.cerevisiae to define the SHNi-TPR family. Sim3 associates with CENP-ACnp1 but is distributed throughout the nucleoplasm rather than being concentrated at centromeres. Cells defective in Sim3 function have reduced levels of CENP-ACnp1 at centromeres and display chromosome segregation defects. Newly synthesized CENPACnp1 can be deposited at centromeres by a replication-independent mechanism during G2. Sim3 is required to allow this new CENP-ACnp1 to accumulate at centromeres in S and G2-phase arrested cells. We propose that Sim3 acts as an escort which hands off CENP-ACnp1 to chromatin assembly factors, allowing its incorporation into centromeric chromatin.
