TITLE
IRAK-4- and MyD88-dependent pathways are essential for the removal of developing autoreactive B cells in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Most autoreactive B cells are normally counterselected during early B cell development.  To determine whether Toll-like receptors (TLRs) regulate the removal of autoreactive B lymphocytes, we tested the reactivity of recombinant antibodies from single B cells isolated from patients deficient for IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and UNC-93B.  Indeed, all TLRs except TLR3 require IRAK-4 and MyD88 to signal and UNC-93B-deficient cells are unresponsive to TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9.  All patients suffered from defective central and peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoints resulting in the accumulation of large numbers of autoreactive mature naïve B cells in their blood.  Hence, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 may prevent the recruitment of developing autoreactive B cells in healthy donors.  Paradoxically, IRAK-4-, MyD88- and UNC-93B-deficient patients did not display autoreactive antibodies in their serum nor developed autoimmune diseases, suggesting that IRAK-4, MyD88 and UNC-93B pathway blockade may thwart autoimmunity in humans.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 105-3.105 batch sorted new emigrant and mature naïve B cells isolated from donors using the Absolutely RNA microprep kit (Stratagene).  100-200 ng of RNA was obtained per sample, and the quality of the purified RNA was assessed by the Bioanalyzer from Agilent.  Using the Ovation biotin system kit from Nugen, 30-50ng of RNA was amplified and labeled to produce cDNA.  Labeled cDNA was hybridized on chips containing the whole human genome (Human Genome U133 2.0 from Affymetrix). Raw data from new emigrant (1 healthy donor) and mature naive (4 healthy donors) B cells were analyzed in order to determine the expression of some molecules involved in the TLR pathway in these B cell population in humans.
