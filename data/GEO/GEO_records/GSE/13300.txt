TITLE
IRAK-4- and MyD88-dependent pathways are essential for the removal of developing autoreactive B cells in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Most autoreactive B cells are normally counterselected during early B cell development.  To determine whether Toll-like receptors (TLRs) regulate the removal of autoreactive B lymphocytes, we tested the reactivity of recombinant antibodies from single B cells isolated from patients deficient for IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and UNC-93B.  Indeed, all TLRs except TLR3 require IRAK-4 and MyD88 to signal and UNC-93B-deficient cells are unresponsive to TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9.  All patients suffered from defective central and peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoints resulting in the accumulation of large numbers of autoreactive mature na√Øve B cells in their blood.  Hence, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 may prevent the recruitment of developing autoreactive B cells in healthy donors.  Paradoxically, IRAK-4-, MyD88- and UNC-93B-deficient patients did not display autoreactive antibodies in their serum nor developed autoimmune diseases, suggesting that IRAK-4, MyD88 and UNC-93B pathway blockade may thwart autoimmunity in humans.
