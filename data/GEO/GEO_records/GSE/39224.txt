TITLE
Agilent microarray analysis between a Dullard-heterozygous and a Dullard-homozygous E7.5 embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the loss of  Dullurd function in mouse embryo development, we have performed the Agilent microarray analysis between a Dullard-heterozygous and a Dullard-homozygous E7.5 embryo. Our findings show that Dullard does not act in concert with BMP4 and Smad1/5/8, whereas loss of Dullard is associated with a reduced level of WNT/Î²-catenin signaling activity, accompanied by elevated expression of Wnt3 and WNT antagonists including Dkk1, Sfrp1 and Sfrp5 in mouse germ cell formation.

DESIGN
E7.5 mouse embryos were collected. One Dullard-heterozygous embryo and one Dullard-homozygous embryo were used for the analysis.
