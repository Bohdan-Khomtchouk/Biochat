TITLE
Global transcriptional response to copper of Enterococcus faecalis  wild-type and copY mutant

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis V583

SUMMARY
We examined the whole-genome transcriptional response of E. faecalis wild-type (WT) and copy mutant cells exposed to non toxic Cu excess. The analysis was focused in those genes which changed significantly their expression levels in the Cu-treated cells when compared to their untreated counterparts. The results indicated that after 3 h at 0.5 mM CuSO4, WT cells exhibited a significant increment of Cu content and the induction of three genes of cop operon along with other 142 genes. The comparison with the copY mutant exposed to Cu showed an extensive overlapping of transcriptional changes suggesting that other transcription factors may be mediating the response to Cu.
