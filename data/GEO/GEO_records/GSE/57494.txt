TITLE
GPBAR1 agonism has a broad impact on blocking macrophage activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human D14+ / CD16+  monocytes were treated with GPBAR1 agonists or controls, and were stimulated with interferon gamma and LPS.  At 6 and 24 hours, the cells were profiled by RNAseq

DESIGN
40 total samples, 5 per group with eight groups.  Individual donors used for multiple comparisons, so paired analysis is possible.  Control samples include unstimulated cells, and stimulated cells treated with vehicle control (DMSO).

PLATFORM
