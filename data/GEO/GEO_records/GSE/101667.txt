TITLE
PGK cleavage mapping

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Mapping 3'ends of cleaved mRNAs derived from a reporter that is subject to no-go decay for the purpose of characterizing the cleavage reaction.

DESIGN
Libraries constructed from mRNA collected from S. cerevisiae expressing a PGK-stall seqeunce reporter gene. Three different libraries were seqeunced, each expressing a different stalling reporter: a stem loop, (CGA)12 or (AAA)12.

PLATFORM
GPL17342 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
