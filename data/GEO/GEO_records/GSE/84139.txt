TITLE
The de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3C protects male fertility from transposon activity (RNA-Seq).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To allow identification of differentially expressed genes and transposons in Dnmt3C IAP/IAP mutants, mutant and control RNA-Seq experiments were conducted starting from whole testis RNA.

DESIGN
Comparison of RNA-seq results from whole testis RNA of mutant Dnmt3C IAP/IAP and control Dnmt3C IAP/WT at 16.5 dpc, 10 dpp, and 20 dpp.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
