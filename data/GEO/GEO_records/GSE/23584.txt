TITLE
The Identification of Genetic Factors Influencing Susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus Infection in mice susceptible and resistant to S. aureus infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been shown that inbred strains of mice exhibit variable susceptibility to S. aureus infection, but the specific genes responsible for this differential phenotype are unknown. Using ISHM to identify genomic regions associated with the phenotypes, we considered genes within those interval to be candidate genes and used the gene expression patterns of the genes contained in the region to determine whether the genes are differentially expressed between the 2 phenotypically different groups of mice.

DESIGN
To identify genes differentially expressed between mice susceptible and resistant to S. aureus infection that could contribute to host susceptibility to S. aureus infection, we compared the gene expression profiles between 2 groups of mice where 3 were susceptible (A/J, BALBcBy/J, AKR/J) and resistant (C57BL/J, C3H/HeJ, NOD/ShiLtJ) to S. aureus. The susceptible group had high bacterial count values in the kidney while the resistant group had low values.
