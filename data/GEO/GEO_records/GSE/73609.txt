TITLE
Rice gene expression in irrigated and rainfed fields during two seasons

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To identify the concurrent effects of multiple environmental factors on gene expression under natural climatic fluctuations in rice, we examined global gene expression patterns in two fields typical of the main modes of rice cultivation, over two seasons, each comprising 15 time-points in three different genotypes

DESIGN
Two time-series of 15 time-points, one for each season (dry and wet) over two different fields

PLATFORM
GPL13160 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Oryza sativa)
