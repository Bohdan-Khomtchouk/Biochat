TITLE
Gene expression analysis of IL-17 induced mice small intestinal smooth muscle strips with or without 6-shogaol.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The etiology of post-inflammatory gastrointestinal (GI) motility dysfunction, after resolution of acute symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and intestinal infection, is largely unknown. Here, using an established mouse model of experimental enteritis, we show that enhancement of smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction by interleukin (IL)-17A may be involved in postinflammatory GI hypermotility. To examine the effect of IL-17 in the small intestinal smooth muscle, we used whole genome microarray expression profiling to find out the genes which respond to IL-17 stimulus. The smooth muscle strips were peeled off from mouse small intestine and incubated 24h with or without IL-17. And we also examined the effect of 6-shogaol, which is one of the ingredients of Japanese traditional medicine for intestinal mortor disorder, Daikenchuto, in IL-17 stimulated small intestinal smooth muscle strip.

DESIGN
The smooth muscle strips were peeled off from mice small intestine and incubated in the culture media for 24h with or without IL-17. A part of IL-17 stimulated strips were co-incubated with 6-shogaol. Six independent experiments were performed.
