TITLE
OGT, H2B S112GlcNAc, TET2 ChIP-seq results

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TET2 directly interacts with OGT, which is important for the chromatin association of OGT in vivo. Although this specific interaction does not regulate the enzymatic activity of TET2, it facilitates OGT-dependent histone O-GlcNAcylation. Moreover, OGT associates with TET2 at transcription starting sites (TSS). Down-regulation of TET2 reduces the amount of H2B S112 GlcNAc marks in vivo, which are associated with gene transcription regulation.

DESIGN
We found that OGT interacts with TET2 tightly. Using ChIP-seq with specific antibodies, we tested the co-localization of TET2 and OGT in genome level.
