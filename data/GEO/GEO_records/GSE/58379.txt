TITLE
Identification of alternatively spliced transcripts in brain metastatic derivatives of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in response to RBM47 expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Changes in alternative splicing in breast cancer cells expressing control, empty vector or Flag-tagged wild type RBM47 were analyzed using paired-end, 100bp RNAseq. Related data published together with these data are found in GSE53779

DESIGN
Triplicate RNAseq libraries were prepared from non-clonal brain metastatic breast cancer cells stably expressing empty-vector, and a clonal cell line (wt#10) expressing Flag-tagged, wild-type RBM47 under a doxycline-inducible promoter, both treated for three days with doxycycline to induce transgene expression
