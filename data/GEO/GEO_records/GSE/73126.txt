TITLE
Mapping of nascent RNA in MLL2 F/F and FC/FC MEF cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global Run-On has been performed in MLL2 F/F and FC/FC MEF cells. The aim of the experiment is to test how the lack of MLL2 affects nascent RNA transcription.

DESIGN
Four samples were analyzed - 2 independent replicates. The experiments were performed using immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) in which both MLL2 alleles were targeted by the loxp system (F/F cells). Tamoxifen treatment of the F/F cells for 24 hours results in the excision of both MLL2 alleles (FC/FC cells).
