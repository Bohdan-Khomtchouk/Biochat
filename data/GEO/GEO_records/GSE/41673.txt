TITLE
Effects of intranasal infection with γMHV-68 in naïve, and control challenged mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine if differences in gene expression are evident following intranasal infection with γMHV-68 compared to naïve, and control challenged animals

DESIGN
Naïve animals were infected with MHV-68 or vehicle, and sacrificed at 2h, 6h, 1 day, 4 day, 7 day, 14 day, 21 day, 35 day, 49 day and 70 day time points. Some animals were deliberately left untreated as a control. 8 biological replicates were obtained for each treatment-time point combination.
