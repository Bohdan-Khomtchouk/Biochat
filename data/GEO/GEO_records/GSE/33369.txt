TITLE
Mouse Inflammatory Cytokines and Receptors Microarray-RNA profiling in F4/80+ and CD11c+ cells from lungs of WT mice before and after Mycoplasma pulmonis infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA profiling of inflammatory chemokines, cytokines and receptors in AUTOMACS sorted F4/80+ and CD11c+ cells from lungs  of 6-12 week old wild-type C3H/HeN mice before and after 14-day Mycoplasma pulmonis infection

DESIGN
RNA pooled from pulmonary F4/80+ & CD11c+ cells of each group- Uninfected and Infected; Experiment performed twice. Comparison-RNA expression within each population of cells in Mycoplasma infected  vs. uninfected mice
