TITLE
Gene expression signature of DMBA induced hamster buccal pouch carcinomas: Modulation by chlorophyllin, and ellagic acid

ORGANISM
Mesocricetus auratus

SUMMARY
To examine the mechanism underlying chemoprevention and changes in gene expression pattern induced by chlorophyllin and ellagic acid during 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced hamster buccal pouch (HBP) carcinogenesis

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Control vs. DMBA, Control vs. DMBA+chloophyllin, Control vs. DMBA+ellagic acid. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 DMBA replicates, 2 DMBA+chlorophyllin replicates, 2 DMBA+ellagic acid replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL4135 Agilent-014879 Whole Rat Genome Microarray 4x44K G4131F (Feature Number version)
