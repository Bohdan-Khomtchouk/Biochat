TITLE
Gene expression signature of DMBA induced hamster buccal pouch carcinomas: Modulation by chlorophyllin, and ellagic acid

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To examine the mechanism underlying chemoprevention and changes in gene expression pattern induced by chlorophyllin and ellagic acid during 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced hamster buccal pouch (HBP) carcinogenesis
