TITLE
Identification of CLF-regulated transcripts in embryos at the mature-green stage by strand-specific RNA-sequencing in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
CURLY LEAF (CLF), the major histone methyltransferase of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), modifies trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and mediates dynamical chromatin repression in Arabidopsis. Our previous results suggested that CLF may play regulatory roles on seed size and lipid biosynthesis in embryos at the mature-green stages. Here we used strand specific RNA-sequencing to profile Arabidopsis transcriptomes obtained from isolated embryos at the mature-green stage of Col-0 and clf-28 plants. Our analysis identified a large number of CLF-regulatedd transcripts in developmenting embryos in Arabidopsis.

DESIGN
Issolated embryos of WT and clf-28 with 2 biological replicates
