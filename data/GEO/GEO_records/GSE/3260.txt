TITLE
Effects of iFGFR1 activation in the mammary gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was performed to identify genes that are regulated following iFGFR1 activation in mammary glands from MMTV-iFGFR1 transgenic mice. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Mammary gland samples were obtained following 0, 8, 16, and 24 hours of dimerizer treatment.  Four replicates were performed, rep1 and rep2, are technical replicates and the rest are biological replicates.  The non-treated (0 hour) transgenic littermates were used as reference.
