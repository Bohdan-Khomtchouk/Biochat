TITLE
The ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 regulates hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and lymphoid commitment [microarray]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 as a crucial regulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functions. We generated Huwe1 conditional knock-out mice and discovered that the loss of this ligase causes an increased proliferation and stem cell exhaustion, together with a decreased lymphoid specification in vivo. We observed that the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 is controlling the expression of N-myc at the level of the most immature stem and progenitor hematopoietic populations, mediating the described effects.

DESIGN
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from the bone marrow of transgenic animals carrying a  N-myc/mCherry fusion gene were sorted according to N-myc expression (defined by mCherry) into N-myc high and low subpopulations. Each of these 2 populations was subjected to microarray gene expression profiling.
