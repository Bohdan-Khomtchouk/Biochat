TITLE
Novel type of EATL evolving from mucosal γδ-T-cells in a RCD type I patient

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a rare non-Hodgkin lymphoma that may complicate celiac disease and typically occurs in patients with refractoriness to the gluten- free diet. The majority of these patients harbor intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL) with an aberrant phenotype in the small intestine which are thus considered as the ‘precursor’ lymphoma cells. We here report on a case of extra-intestinal EATL that originated from a clonal γδ-IEL population rather than from aberrant IEL. This EATL displayed a distinctive pattern of immunophenotypical, T-cell receptor immunogenetic, and chromosomal aberrancies defining this lymphoma as a novel variant of EATL.
