TITLE
H1 hESC Exposed to Butyrate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the effect of sodium butyrate exposure on human ESC grown without culture support for self-renewal (I.e. without conditioned medium and added bFGF) - three groups were compared - H1 culture in feeder conditioned medium vs without conditioned medium in 0.2 mM sodium butyrate vs. grown in sodium butyrate for 4 passages followed by return to conditioned medium conditions for 3 passages.  The three groups were grown in triplicate and compared on Agilent whole human genome array

DESIGN
H1 hESC were grown under 3 conditions: A.  48 passages total, the last 9 passages off of feeders on Matrigel in feeder conditioned medium B.  48 passages total, within the last 9 passges, #39-41 were in conditioned medium and #42-48 were without conditioned medium and added bFGF but with 0.2 mM sodium butyrate on Matrigel C. 49 passages total, within the last 10 passages #39-41 were in conditioned medium, #42-46 in 0.2 mM sodium butyrate (without feeder of bFGF support) and #47-49 back to conditioned medium + bFGF.  The RNA from these cells were compared via Agilent whole human genome array.
