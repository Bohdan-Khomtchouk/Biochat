TITLE
Genome-wide binding sites for RGA in Arabidopsis inflorescence apices

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis thaliana REPRESSOR OF GA gene (RGA) encodes a DELLA protein that associates with multiple transcription factors to control plant growth in response to the hormone gibberellin (GA) (1). As part of a screen for genes that mediate the function of RGA in stem growth and shoot meristem function, we performed ChIP-seq to identify genome-wide loci associated with RGA in inflorescence apices. To detect genes controlled by RGA in a gain-of-function semi-dwarf background, we used a GFP-tagged, gibberellin-insensitive version of RGA (RGAp:GFP-rga-delta17) (2). (1) J.-M. Daviere, P.

DESIGN
Plants expressing a GFP-tagged, gibberellin-insensitive version of RGA (RGAp:GFP-rga-delta17) were used for ChIP-seq with anti-GFP antibodies; wild-type controls (Landsberg-erecta) were used as epitope-negatve controls. The files that resulted from comparing the combined RGAp:GFP-rga-delta17 replicates with the combined control replicates are linked as Series supplementary files.
