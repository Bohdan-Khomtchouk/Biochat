TITLE
Comparative transcriptomics of Atlantic Salmo salar, chum Onchorhynchus keta and pink salmon O. gorbuscha responding to salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis infections

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
The present work characterizes the response of co-habited Atlantic (Salmo salar), chum (Oncorhynchus keta) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) to sea lice infections. Atlantic and pink salmon anterior kidney samples were profiled at three time points over nine days after the start of an experimental infection. Chum salmon anterior kidney was profiled at day six post infection only. All three species  were also profiled at six days post exposure for skin responses of the pectoral fin, typically associated with lice infection.
