TITLE
Sex differences in gene expression profiles during hantavirus infection of rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were examined in whole lung tissue collected from male and female Long-Evans rats at different time points after inoculation with Seoul virus (i.e., the species-specific hantavirus that infects Norway rats) We used microarray analyses to analyze global gene expression differences between the sexes during hantavirus infection Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Gonadally-intact male and female rats were inoculated with 10^4 pfu of Seoul virus (strain SR-11) and lung samples were collected 0, 3, 15, and 40 days post-inoculation (p.i.) to assess gene expression patterns during the acute (i.e., days 3-15 p.i.) and persistent (i.e., day 40 p.i.) phases of infection
