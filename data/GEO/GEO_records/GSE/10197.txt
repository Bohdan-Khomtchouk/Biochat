TITLE
cDNA aCGH study of pure DCIS without invasive tumor, DCIS associated with IDC and its IDC component

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cDNA aCGH study of pure DCIS (breast duct carcinoma in situ) without invasive tumor, DCIS associated with IDC (breast invasive duct carcinoma) and its IDC component 23 patients: 6 pure DCIS without invasive cancer and no history of invasive cancer, 17 DCIS associated with IDC. Out of the latter 1 tumor had only enough DCIS (#16) for aCGH and one - IDC (#23) Keywords: Comparative clinical study

DESIGN
Histological sections microdissected, DNA extracted, subjected to whole genome amplification protocol (SCOMP) and aCGH. The replicate raw data file GSM257548_2.gpr (dcis19_2.gpr) for GSM257548 is not available.

PLATFORM
GPL6382 UHN cDNA microarray
