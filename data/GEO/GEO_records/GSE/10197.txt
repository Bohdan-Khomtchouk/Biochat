SUMMARY
cDNA aCGH study of pure DCIS (breast duct carcinoma in situ) without invasive tumor, DCIS associated with IDC (breast invasive duct carcinoma) and its IDC component 23 patients: 6 pure DCIS without invasive cancer and no history of invasive cancer, 17 DCIS associated with IDC. Out of the latter 1 tumor had only enough DCIS (#16) for aCGH and one - IDC (#23) Keywords: Comparative clinical study
