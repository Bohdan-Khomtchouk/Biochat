TITLE
Deep sequencing of endogenous mRNA from Caenorhabditis elegans in the presence of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (DOG) at 4 different time points

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Background: C. elegans fed with a chemical inhibitor of glucose, namely 2-deoxy-D-glucose (DOG), exhibit considerably extended life span. DOG, in contradiction to D-glucose, cannot be metabolized in the glycolytic pathway. This results in the fact that less glucose is available for ATP production, and thus makes DOG-feeding of the roundworms equivalent to glucose restriction. The RNA-seq data comprises 4 age groups (1, 5, 10 and 20 days  after L4)

DESIGN
11 samples: mRNA profiles of 1-day, 5-day and 10-day old worms as triplicates for DOG treatment; mRNA profiles of 20-day old worms as duplicates for DOG treatment
