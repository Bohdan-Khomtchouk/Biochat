TITLE
Expression data from murine fibrotic liver tissues and normal liver tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes; however, few have been identified that regulate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation and the progression of liver fibrosis. To identify the possible roles of lncRNAs in regulating liver fiboris and the potential of lncRNAs as molecular markers for liver fiboris, we systematically analyzed the regulation of lncRNAs and mRNAs in a mouse model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrogenesis by microarray analysis, which revealed a panel of lncRNAs and mRNAs that were specifically regulated in livers of mice undergoing hepatic fibrosis. To identify the possible roles of lncRNAs in regulating liver fiboris and the potential of lncRNAs as molecular markers for liver fiboris,we determined the lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in the livers of fibrotic mice and normal mice by lncRNA and mRNA microarrays.

DESIGN
The lncRNA expression profile along with mRNA expression profile of five liver tissues from Balb/c mice treated with CCl4 for 6 weeks and five liver tissues from Balb/c mice treated with oil for 6 weeks were analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array.
