TITLE
Gene expression in liver and lung of a high-fat diet fed, metastasizing mammary tumor-bearing and obesity-resistant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We explored early changes in gene expression in the livers and lungs of the HFD-fed, metastasizing mammary tumor-bearing and obesity-resistant mice mice. These alterations may have led to favorable conditions for both the formation of pro-inflammatory and pro-mitotic microenvironments in the target organs that promote immune cell infiltration and differentiation, as well as infiltration and proliferation of metastatic tumor cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from hepatic and pulmonary tissues of high fat diet fed-4T1 cell-injected mice or high fat diet fed-sham mice. Gene expressions were compared to control diet fed-same conditional mice.
