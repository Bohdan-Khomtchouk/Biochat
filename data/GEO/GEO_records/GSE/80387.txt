TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by H19 in cornea epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the gene-regulatory role of H19 in corneal epithelial cells and to explore whether  CLIM activation of H19 might account for non-cell proliferation effects of CLIM, we used siRNA to knock down H19 in primary human corneal epithelial cells. Microarray gene expression analysis revealed that 1,249 genes are down regulated 1.5 fold or more by siH19 compared to scramble control, and that 944 genes are up regulated

DESIGN
H19 was knocked down with siRNA in triplicate to compare with a mismatch control, also in triplicate; RNA was isolated and microarray analysis performed to assess the effect of H19 knockdown on gene expression in corneal epithelial cells.
