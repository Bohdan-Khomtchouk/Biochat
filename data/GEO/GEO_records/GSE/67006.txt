TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa wild type and ∆anr grown as biofilms on ∆F508 cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells (CFBEs)

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Anr regulates the response to low oxygen in P. aeruginosa and is inhibited by oxygen. We used microarrys to compare gene expression in P. aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type with an isogenic anr mutant in order to determine which transcripts are affected by Anr. We grew P. aeruginosa cells as biofilms on CFBE cells in order to model cystic fibrosis airways infections.

DESIGN
Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms grown on CFBEs. Wild-type PAO1 and a ∆anr mutant. Three biological replicates of each strain were analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
