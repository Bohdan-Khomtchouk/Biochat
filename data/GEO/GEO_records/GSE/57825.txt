TITLE
DHA effect on endothelial cells (HUVEC) under proinflammatory condition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) comparing untreated control cells with IL-1-treated cells with or without pre-treatment with DHA.

DESIGN
Three condition experiment: DHA treated HUVEC  cells (25 µmol/L DHA for 48 hours) vs control; IL-1 treated HUVEC  cells (5ng/ml for 3 hours)  vs control; HUVEC treated with 25 µmol/L DHA for 48 hours and then stimulated with 5 ng/mL IL-1β for 3 hours. For each condition, 3 replicates
