TITLE
circRNA expression in basal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Punch biopsies from patients with BCC (n=3) and non-lesional skin (n=3) were included in the study. Microarray based circRNA expression profiles were acquired using Arraystar circRNA Arrays V. 2.0 screening for 13,617 distinct human circRNA candidates. We identified circRNAs differentially expressed in BCC compared to non-lesional skin (control).

DESIGN
The circRNA expression in BCC was compared to circRNA expression in non-lesional skin (control).
