TITLE
Alterations in miRNA levels in the dentate gyrus in epileptic rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the dentate gyrus of amygdala electrical stimulation model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying epileptogenesis.

DESIGN
This study was designed to estimate changes in miRNA expression levels after 7, 14, 30 and 90 days after electrical stimulation of amygdala as a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The advantage of this study is time matched control (sham operated animals sacrificed at the same age as stimulated animals).
