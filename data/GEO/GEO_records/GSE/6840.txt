TITLE
Cytological and molecular responses of Medicago truncatula to Erysiphe pisi

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
For transcript analysis of early hypersensitive and susceptible responses of Medicago truncatula to the powdery mildew pathogen, Erysiphe pisi, we compared transcripts from pathogen-inoculated and control (non-inoculated) plants 12 h after infection in resistant (A14), partially resistant (A20), and susceptible (DZA315.16) genotypes. Published in: Medicago truncatula to the powdery mildew 1 and anthracnose pathogens, Erysiphe pisi and Colletotrichum trifolii. Molecular Plant Pathology 8(3):307-319 Keywords: 1 time points and 3 genotypes

DESIGN
Single time point (12 h ) and 3 lines; consists of 18 microarrays. Each genotype experiment consists of three direct (reps1, 2, 3) and three dye-swapped (reps 4, 5, 6) technical replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL2930 Medicago truncatula 6K array
