TITLE
DOCK8 is critical for the survival and function of NKT cells [DOCK8_CPM_NKT]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of DOCK8 deficient animals revealed a key role for this protein the survival and maintenance of natural killer T cells. This work lead to the identification of genes regulated by the guanine exchange factor, DOCK8.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 3 biological replicates of thymic, DOCK8 deficient NKT cells and compared using an Illumina microarray to WT NKT cells.
