TITLE
Gene expression analysis of 35S::JMJ30-HA overexpression transgenic lines grown at 22°C under long day conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of overexpression of JMJ30 in Arabidopsis thaliana (Col). JMJ30 encode the histone demethylases that contain the catalytic JmjC domain. The trimethylation of Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) plays a key role in gene repression and developmental regulation. It is actively and dynamically deposited and removed in plants. However, while the H3K27 methyltransferases had been extensively studied, findings on the H3K27 demethylase were few. Here, we show that JMJ30 encodes a H3K27me3 demethylase, and genes up-regulated in 35S::JMJ30-HA transgenic lines are enriched for H3K27me3 targets.

DESIGN
Columbia wild-type (Col WT) and 35S::JMJ30-HA transgenic plants were grown at 22°C under long day conditions, and seedling samples were collected at 13 day-after-germination (DAG). Two independent sets of WT and 35S::JMJ30-HA seedling mRNA samples were used for this array.
