TITLE
Comparison of glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) binding in wild type and Klf15-/- MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to dertemine GR binding patterns within wild type murine embryonic fibroblasts in comparison to embryonic fibroblasts derived from mice containing a null mutation for Klf15.

DESIGN
This study utilized duplicate samples and the following conditions.  Wild type cells treated with ethanol (pooled single sample secondary to low starting material); wild type cells treated with dexamethasone for 1 hour (2 samples); Klf15-/- cells treated with ethanol (2 samples); Klf15 -/- cells treated with dexamethasone (2 samples). Samples treated with ethanol served as controls.
