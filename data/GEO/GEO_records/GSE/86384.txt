TITLE
Acsl4 Determines Ferroptosis Sensitivity by Shaping Cellular Lipid Composition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ferroptosis is a form of regulated necrotic cell death controlled by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). At present, mechanisms that could predict sensitivity and/or resistance and that may be exploited to modulate this form of cell death are needed. We applied two independent approaches, a genome-wide CRISPR-based genetic screen and microarray analysis of ferroptosis-resistant cell lines to uncover acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (Acsl4) as an essential component for ferroptosis execution.

DESIGN
Analysis of ferroptosis-resistant cell lines to uncover acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (Acsl4) as an essential component for ferroptosis execution. Expression data from ferroptosis-resistant cell clones and from ferroptosis-senitive parental cells
