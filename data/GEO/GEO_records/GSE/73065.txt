TITLE
High-throughput single-base resolution mapping of 2’-O-Methylated residues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Functional characterization of the transcriptome requires tools for the systematic investigation of RNA post-transcriptional modifications. 2’-O-Methylation of the ribose moiety is one of the most abundant post-transcriptional modifications of the RNA. We describe here a high-throughput method that enables fast and accurate mapping at single-base resolution, and quantitation, of 2’-OMe modified residues. Our approach expands the actual repertoire of methods for transcriptome-wide mapping of RNA post-transcriptional modifications.

DESIGN
Mapping 2’-O-Methylated residues in Hela cells and E14 mouse embryonic stem cells.
