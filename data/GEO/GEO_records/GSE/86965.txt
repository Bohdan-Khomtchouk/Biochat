TITLE
DNA methylation is required for chromatin binding by Mbd2 and Mbd3 in ES cells (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cytosine methylation on DNA is an important epigenetic and regulatory mark. Chromatin remodeling complexes containing methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins modulate chromatin structure and transcription at methylated loci. Two MBD proteins, Mbd2 and Mbd3, are mutually exclusive members of the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex, and have been shown to bind methylated or hydroxymethylated DNA, respectively. However, a recent study called both results into question, showing that chromatin binding by these proteins is partially (Mbd2) or completely (Mbd3) independent of DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation. Here we re-analyze these data and observe discrepancies with both conclusions. Furthermore, we describe multiple new datasets that demonstrate the dependence of endogenous Mbd2 and Mbd3 on DNA methylation. Interestingly, we find that Mbd2 and Mbd3 are also dependent on one another for binding, likely due to the fact that both are required for normal levels of DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation. These findings describe a regulatory loop controlling the DNA methylation machinery and its readers.
