TITLE
Genome-wide map of vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding in THP-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of acute effects of ligand-treatment on vitamin D receptor binding genome-wide using ChIP-seq. THP-1 monocytic leucemia cells were treated with 1?,25(OH)2D3 (1,25D) or left unstimulated to investigate the acute effects of VDR chromatin occupancy. We identified in total 2340 VDR binding sites with and without the ligand. Without the ligand, there is a considerable presence of VDR already on the chromatin. However, upon a short (40 min) ligand treatment VDR shifts from sites that rarely contain a DR3 type element to sites that frequently contain one or more DR3-type element.

DESIGN
Genome-wide identification of VDR binding in THP-1 cells at the unstimulated state and after 40 min ligand (10 nM 1?,25(OH)2D3 (1,25D, calcitriol)) treatment.
