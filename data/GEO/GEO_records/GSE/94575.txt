TITLE
Transcriptome analysis the genes expression in SsMYRV4-infected strain Ep-1PNA367T1 and SsMYRV4-free strain Ep-1PNA367

ORGANISM
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis the genes expression in SsMYRV4-infected strain Ep-1PNA367T1 and SsMYRV4-free strain Ep-1PNA367. the two strains were grown on a cellophane membrane overlaid onto PDA medium at 20â„ƒ for 3 days,  samples were collected for total RNA extraction. The RNA samples were sequenced and anlysized by the BGI Co., Ltd. Total clean reads of each sample above 5000000.The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 3-day old strains Ep-1PNA367T1 and  Ep-1PNA367  were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
