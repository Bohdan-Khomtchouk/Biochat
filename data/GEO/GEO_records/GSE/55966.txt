TITLE
Gene expression of early craniofacial development through RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report gene expression patterns in embryonic mice (E8.5, E9.5, E10.5) through RNA-seq of 13 tissue/stage combinations in order to generage an atlas of early mouse craniofacial gene expression.

DESIGN
Embryos  at E8.5, E9.5, and E10.5 CD1 were collected from CD1 mice, fom multiple micro-regions whose development, differentiation and signaling are responsible for the construction of the mammalian face.
