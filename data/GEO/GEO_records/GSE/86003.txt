TITLE
Identification of genes that play a role in menstrual breakdown and repair

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the molecular profile of human endometrium on days 2, 3 and 4 of menstruation to identify genes and pathways that play a role in the menstrual process.  Endometrial samples were collected by Pipelle biopsy on days 2 (n=9), 3 (n=9) or 4 (n=6) of menstruation and arrayed.  We identified key gene pathways involved in menstruation and identified a number of genes not previously associated with the process (Paiva et al. 2016. Mol Hum Reprod. In press).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from endometrial biopsies collected from women on days 2 (n=9), 3 (n=9) or 4 (n=6) of menstruation.
