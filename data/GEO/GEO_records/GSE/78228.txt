TITLE
Remission for loss of odontogenic potential in a new micromilieu in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During embryonic organogenesis, the odontogenic potential resides in dental mesenchyme from the bud stage until birth. Mouse dental mesenchymal cells (mDMCs) isolated from the inductive dental mesenchyme of developing molars are frequently used in the context of tooth development and regeneration. cultured mDMCs could retain the odontogenic potential for 24 h with a ratio of 60% for tooth formation, but mDMCs were incapable of supporting tooth formation after more than 24 h in culture. To reveal the underlying mechanism of the impairment of odontogenic potential, we generated gene expression profiles from mDMCs in culture using RNA-seq.

DESIGN
To determine the transcriptional regulation following in vitro culture, dMCs from developing molar germs in embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mouse embryos were isolated. The cells cultured for 12h, 24h, 36h, and 48h were isolated and RNA of these cells was extracted. Illumina-based high-throughput sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to obtain the transcriptome profiles of D0, D0.5, D1, D1.5 and D2 cells
