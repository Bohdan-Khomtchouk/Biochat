TITLE
The Neuron-specific chromatin regulatory subunit BAF53b is necessary for synaptic plasticity and memory.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed an RNA Sequencing experiment on dorsal hippocampal tissue from four groups of animals: Baf53b+/- homecage (Baf53b+/- HC); Baf53b+/- behavior (Baf53b+/- Beh); wildtype homecage (WT HC); and wildtype behavior (WT Beh).  Homecage animals were sacrificed directly from the animal's cage. Behavior animals were sacrificed thirty minutes following Object Location Memory training.  The objective of this study was to examine activity regulated gene expression following a learning event (HC vs Beh) in wildtype and Baf53b+/- mutant mice.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression following a learning event in wildtype and Baf53b+/- mutant mice in dorsal hippocampus.
