TITLE
Expression data of Col:LUC Arabidopsis treated with antimycin A (AA) in the presence or absence of a synthetic auxin analogue

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Mitochondrial stress stimuli such as AA caused a transient suppression of auxin signaling and conversely, auxin treatment represses a part of the response to AA treatment. Expression data of Col:LUC Arabidopsis treated with antimycin A (AA) in the presence or absence of a synthetic auxin analogue

DESIGN
Total RNA extraction was carried out on 80 mg of  Col:LUC Arabidopsis seedlings grown on B5 media for 10 days and transferred to fresh plates, containing either B5 media or B5 media supplemented with 4.5 µM NAA for an additional 3 days. Seedlings were treated with 50 µM AA for 3 hours.
