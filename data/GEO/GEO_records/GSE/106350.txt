TITLE
ZIC2 Is Required For Nodal Expression And The Establishment Of Left-Sided Identity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to identify putative downstream targets of the transcription factor ZIC2 in the mouse embryo. The results indicate loss of NODAL pathway expression, consistent with the observed phenotype of right isomerism in heart, lungs and viscera.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from wildtype whole embryos at day E8.0-E8.5 was compared to that from mutant Zic2 iso/iso embryos

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
