TITLE
Identification and developmental expression of the full complement of cytochrome P450 genes in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To determine the expression of cytochrome P450 genes during normal development

DESIGN
Zebrafish embryos were collected at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours post fertilization. Quadruplicate biological replicates of 100 embryos were hybridized.
