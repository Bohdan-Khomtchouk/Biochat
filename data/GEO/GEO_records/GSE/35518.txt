TITLE
WT vs WTmitomycinC comparison

ORGANISM
Streptococcus thermophilus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of S. thermophilus LMD-9 wild-type in the presence of mitomycin C. Cells were grown in CDM medium  supplemented with lactose 1% (CDML), without or with mitomycin C 0.08 microg/ml, and sampled at OD600 = 0.4 for mRNA extraction.

DESIGN
wild-type vs wild-type + mitomycin C, 2 WT biological replicates (one used as technical replicate for a dye swap), 2 WT + mitomycin C biological replicates (one used as technical replicate for a dye swap)

PLATFORM
GPL13365 UCL Streptococcus thermophilus 15K 60-mer array, Version 1, our ID Agilent-023342 LMD-9v2
