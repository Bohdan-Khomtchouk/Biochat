TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Bacillus subtilis sigF-mutant during vegetative growth and under sporulating conditions

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Bacillus subtilis’ sigma factor F is the first forespore specific transcription factor and controls genes required for the early stages of prespore development. The role of sigF is well studied under conditions that induce sporulation. Here, the impact of a sigF disruption on the transcriptome of exponentially growing cultures is studied by micro-array analysis. This is relevant because in various experiments, such as industrial fermentation, prolonged experimental evolution or zero-growth studies, sporulation is an undesirable trait that should be avoided, e.g by a sigF mutation. Under conditions that typically don’t induce sporulation, the transcriptome showed minor signs of sporulation initiation. The number of genes differentially expressed and the magnitude of expression were, as expected, quite small in comparison with sporulation conditions. The genes mildly down-regulated were mostly involved in anabolism and the genes mildly up-regulated were mostly involved in catabolism, in particular fatty acid degradation genes. Probably this is related to the arrest at sporulation stage II occurring in the sigF mutant where additional energy is required for further growth of the polar compartments formed.

DESIGN
Wildtype strain was compared to sigF-mutant under both sporulating conditions and vegetative conditions (3 slides for each condition, consisting of 2 biological replicates)
