TITLE
Human glioma cells: Control (GFP) vs PDGF-A expressing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human glioma cells comparing control GFP expressing cells with glioma cells transfected with a human PDGF-A gene. The isogenic cell lines were used to study the impact on glioma tumorigenesis and invasion. Goal was to determine the effects of PDGF-A gene transfection on global ES gene expression.

DESIGN
Two set of glioma cell lines, LN444 vs LN444/PDGF-A and LN443 vs LN443/PDGF-A. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 transfected replicates.
