TITLE
Interindividual comparison of methylation profiling by MSAM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Interindividual variation in methylation profiling of human DNA samples were detected using two-tissue screening by MSAM. 0.5ug of DNA was serially digested with SmaI and XmaI followed by an adaptor ligation and adaptor mediated PCR amplification

DESIGN
HF (hair follicle) and PBL (Peripheral Blood Leukocyte) DNA samples for 8 different individuals, two-color experiment, interindividual paired comparison (same sex and age)

PLATFORM
GPL9886 Agilent-017278 whole human genome (hg17) custom 4Ã—44k array
