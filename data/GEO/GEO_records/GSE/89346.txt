TITLE
BAF60 binding sites and their role in Modulating DNA accessibility in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
SWI/SNF protein BAF60 mediates seedling growth

DESIGN
Examination of BAF60 binding sites by ChIP-seq. ATAC-seq, MNase-seq and FAIRE-seq were also performed on wildtype seedlings.
