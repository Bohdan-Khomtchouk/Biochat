TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of EBF1 binding sites in murine pre B-cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Early B cell factor-1 (Ebf1), a transcription factor expressed in B cells, adipocytes and neuronal cells, has been identified as a determinant in the specification of the B cell lineage in which Ebf1 acts in a regulatory network with the transcription factors E2A and Pax5.  To gain insight into the molecular basis of Ebf1 function in early stage B cells, we compared the data set of a genome-wide ChIP sequencing analysis with gain- and loss-of-function transcriptome analyses.

DESIGN
Identification of genetic loci enriched by chromatin-immunoprecipitation using antibodies against EBF1.
