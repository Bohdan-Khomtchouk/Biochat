TITLE
Queen conch (Strombus gigas) testis gene expression profiling:  offshore versus near-shore

ORGANISM
Strombus gigas

SUMMARY
This study compares gene expression in the testis of three offshore (Pelican Shoal) and three near-shore (Tingler Island) adult male queen conchs (Strombus gigas) collected from the wild on February 15, 2007.

DESIGN
Six samples are analyzed, including three biological replicates from each of two locations (offshore = Pelican Shoal; near-shore = Tingler Island).  The offshore individuals are considered to be reference individuals, as they exhibit successful sexual reproduction, while near-shore conchs do not.  There are no technical replicates.  This is a single-channel (Cy3) microarray experiment.
