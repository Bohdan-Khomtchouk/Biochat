Niclosamide ethanolamine reverses gene expression and inhibits growth of hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a fatal malignancy with a dismal prognosis. The recent advances in genomics and transcriptomics have led to large volumes of molecular data for HCC, providing an unprecedented opportunity to translate these data into more effective therapeutics. By creating HCC gene expression signatures and comparing with drug response signatures from multiple datasets, we identified four antihelminthics (from over 1000 FDA-approved drugs) that can reverse the HCC disease gene expression. Among these four, niclosamide was the top hit, which we further evaluated in clinically relevant HCC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Given the poor water-solubility and limited systemic bioavailability of niclosamide, we also evaluated its ethanolamine salt (NEN), which has improved solubility and bioavailability. Both niclosamide and NEN significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation in vitro, which was associated with down-regulation of key proteins involved in the AKT-mTOR, Wnt, Stat3, and EGFR/Ras/Raf signaling pathways. NEN additionally decreased the growth of three PDX models after oral administration (1,5000 ppm in food) for 4-6 weeks. Expression profiling demonstrated that niclosamide and NEN induced highly similar gene expression changes in HepG2 cells and in PDX models, and that both compounds significantly reversed HCC gene expression in vitro and in vivo . Our results suggest that NEN may be a preferred drug candidate for the treatment of HCC.
