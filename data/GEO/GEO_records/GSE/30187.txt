TITLE
Expression data in the mouse brain following the glucocorticoid receptor overexpression in the forebrain (GRov) during different periods in development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The glucocorticoid receptor overexpression in early life is sufficient to alter gene expression patterns for the rest of the animal's life. Hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) are more responsive than the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) following the glucocorticoid receptor overexpression in the forebrain.

DESIGN
Laser capture microdissection was performed. Microdissected areas from the dentate gyrus or nucleus accumbens were collected from serial sections for each animal.
