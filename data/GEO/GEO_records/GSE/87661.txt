TITLE
AdipoQ-LPL transgene alters gene expression and alternative splicing in perigonadal adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Specific expression lipoprotein lipase in adipose by the adiponectin promoter alters the transcriptional response of adipose tissue to an acute high fat diet challenge. We include transcriptional changes in adipose tissue from 12 littermate control and 12 AdipoQ-LpL mice.  Gene expression and alternative splicing were analyzed.

DESIGN
24 samples were analyzed.  We identified changes in gene expression and alternative splicing.
