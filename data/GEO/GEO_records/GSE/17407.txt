TITLE
Microarray analysis to identify the molecular mechanisms whereby pDCs confer growth and drug resistance in MM cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple Myeloma (MM) remains incurable despite novel therapies, suggesting the need for further identification of factors mediating tumorigenesis and drug resistance. We performed microarray analysis to identify the molecular mechanisms whereby pDCs confer growth and drug resistance in MM cells.

DESIGN
Comparsion of MM cells in the presence and absence of pDCs (plasmacytoid dendritic cells)
