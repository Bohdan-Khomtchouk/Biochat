SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Richard Sandstrom ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Project. This track shows DNaseI sensitivity measured genome-wide in different cell lines using the Digital DNaseI methodology (see below), and DNaseI hypersensitive sites. DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and DNaseI hypersensitivity is a universal feature of active cis-regulatory sequences. The use of this method has led to the discovery of functional regulatory elements that include enhancers, insulators, promotors, locus control regions and novel elements. For each experiment (cell type) this track shows DNaseI sensitivity as a continuous function using sequencing tag density (Raw Signal), and discrete loci of DNaseI sensitive zones (HotSpots) and hypersensitive sites (Peaks).
