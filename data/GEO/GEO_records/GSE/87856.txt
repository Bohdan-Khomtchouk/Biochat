TITLE
The genome-wide transcriptional response to varying RpoS levels in Escherichia coli.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We varied RpoS levels using a mutation or an arabinose-inducible RpoS construct during stationary phase in rich media. We then sequenced cDNA from three separate RpoS levels, corresponding to 0%, 26% and 100% of wild-type levels.

DESIGN
Two replicates at each of the three RpoS levels.
