TITLE
The expression profiles of log-phase and stationary-phase cells of Shigella flexneri grown at 30 degrees and 37 degrees Celsius

ORGANISM
Shigella flexneri

SUMMARY
To obtain a global view of the response of S. flexneri at the expression level induced by temperature up-shift, we compared the expression profiles of log-phase and stationary-phase cells grown at 30 degrees and 37 degrees Celsius.

DESIGN
A virulent S. flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T was grown aerobically in 100 mL LB medium at 30°C and 37°C. Cells were harvested in the log phase (OD600nm=1.0) and stationary phase (about 9 hrs).
