TITLE
The expression profiles of log-phase and stationary-phase cells of Shigella flexneri grown at 30 degrees and 37 degrees Celsius

ORGANISM
Shigella flexneri 2a str. 2457T

SUMMARY
To obtain a global view of the response of S. flexneri at the expression level induced by temperature up-shift, we compared the expression profiles of log-phase and stationary-phase cells grown at 30 degrees and 37 degrees Celsius.
