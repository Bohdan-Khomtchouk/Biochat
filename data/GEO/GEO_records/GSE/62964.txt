TITLE
Gene expression profiling of murine WT and DNR Tregs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Donminant negative transform growth factor receptor II (DNR) mice were served as a murine primary biliary cirrhrosis model. CD4+Foxp3+ Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in self-tolerance and in regulating PBC. In order to determine whether DNR mice derived Tregs processed  defective function compared with WT Tregs, CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells were sorted from DNR and WT mice, respectively, then gene expression analysis was performed by using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays

DESIGN
CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs were sorted from the spleen of 10-week-old DNR mice and B6 wild-type mice, respectively. RNA of each sample was then extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays to detail differences between DNR Tregs and WT Tregs in gene expression.
