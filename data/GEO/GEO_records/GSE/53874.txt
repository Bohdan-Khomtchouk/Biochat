TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of deletion of adenylate cyclase in T. reesei upon growth on cellulose in light and darkness

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the transcriptome due to the lack of adenylate cyclase in light or darkness. As the cAMP pathway represents an output pathway of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling ACY1 is likely to be important for regulation of enzymes in response to different nutrient conditions. Also, a light dependent effect was found earlier.

DESIGN
Strains of this study were grown on Mandels Andreotti Minimal Medium with 1 % w/v microcrystalline cellulose as sole carbon source in constant light or constant darkness for 72 hours; 2 biological replicates were included

PLATFORM
GPL10642 NimbleGen Trichoderma reesei Whole Genome array v 1.0 [090708_Tres_MS_exp]
