TITLE
in-vitro differentiated midbrain dopaminergic neurons from isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have generated isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell lines by reprogramming human fibroblasts from patients carrying the LRRK2 G2019S mutation with subsequent zinc finger nuclease - mediated targeted correction of the diseased allele. These iPS cell lines were differentiated for 30 days using a direct differentiation protocol towards midbrain dopaminergic neurons (mDANs).

DESIGN
Isogenic human iPS cells carrying the LRRK2 WT and G2019S locus were differentiated to dopaminergic neurons to detect gene expression changes associated with mutated LRRK2.
