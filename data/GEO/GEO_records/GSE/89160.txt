TITLE
HCoV-229E infection of the human HuH7 cell line [Experiment A]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the experiment is to identify changes in host gene expression upon infection of HuH7 human hepatoma cells with Human corona virus-229E (HCoV-229E) compared to mock-infected cells. All experiments were performed at 33Â°C which is required for sufficient viral entry/replication.

DESIGN
Single-color hybridizations of RNA from different cell lines, either uninfected or infected with HCoV-229E. Duplicates.
