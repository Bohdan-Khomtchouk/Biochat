TITLE
Calorie/Dietary Restriction and Resveratrol in Female Drosophila Melanogaster Head/Thorax

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Feeding resveratrol to Drosophila melanogaster extends lifespan. Studies of microarray show similarities between calorie/dietary restriction and resveratrol on both a gene expression and biological pathway level.

DESIGN
9 samples: 3 biological replicates each of normal diet, restricted diet and normal diet plus resveratrol
