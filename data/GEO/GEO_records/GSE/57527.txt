TITLE
Altered epigenetic programming links intestinal inflammation to colon cancer (Bisulfite-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study uses whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to characterize the methylomes of the AOM/DSS mouse model at single-base resolution. In this model, mice are treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. When this treatment is preceded by injections of the weak carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) the mice develop intestinal tumors. Our results identify hypermethylated DMVs as a prominent feature of the colitis methylome that is conserved in intestinal adenocarcinomas. Further analyses reveal a subset of DMV-associated genes, expressed in normal intestinal epithelial cells, that were silenced and hypermethylated in inflamed and cancerous intestinal cells. Together, these findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that inflammatory signals induce a higher risk for cancer development by manipulating the epigenome. .

DESIGN
Whole genome methylation analysis of M. musculus. Three conditions were sequenced analyzed, the first is an untreated control, the second corresponds to inflammation, the third to cancer induced by inflammation. All three conditions were analyzed using three replicates.
