TITLE
Long-term effect on the transcriptome of a decrement in Norrin/Frizzled4/Lrp signaling in retinal endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize the long-term effect on the transcriptome of a decrement in Norrin/Fz4/Lrp signaling, microarray hybridization was performed with RNA from acutely dissociated and anti-PECAM immunoaffinity-purified adult WT, Fz4-/-, Lrp5-/-, and Norrin- retinal vascular cells.

DESIGN
Retinal endothelial cells from 5-10 adult mice were pooled for each sample, the cell immuno-purification procedure follows that described by Matsubara et al. (2000) and Su et al. (2003). 3 replicates of each mutant and 6 replicates of control wild type animals were analyzed.
