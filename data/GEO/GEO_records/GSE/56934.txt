TITLE
Analysis of altered microRNA expression profiles in proximal renal tubular cells in response to calcium oxalate monohydrate crystal adhesion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The present study aims to assess the potential changes in microRNAs of proximal renal tubular cells in response to the adhesion of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals.

DESIGN
microRNA microarray was applied to evaluate the expression of HK-2 cells exposed to COM crystals for 0 and 24 hours.
