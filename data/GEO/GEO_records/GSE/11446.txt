TITLE
CD8 T cells stimulated with IL-2 complex in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL-2 signals into CD8 T cells have a programming and regulatory role in driving cells to full effector and memory differentiation. This study was designed to look for IL-2 target genes that affect CD8 T cell responses. Keywords: Time-course, cytokine treatment Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
Treatment of mice with IL-2/anti-IL-2 immune complexes (IL-2 complex) stimulates all fraction of CD8 T cells in vivo. Because STAT5 phosphorylation peaked 1 h after injection of the IL-2 complex, gene expression in CD8 T cells was compared at 0 h (no treatment), 1 h and 3 h post treatment. Two mice were used for each time point.
