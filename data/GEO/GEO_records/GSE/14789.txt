TITLE
An integrative multi-platform analysis for biomarker discovery of osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines (MG-63, Saos-2 and U-2 OS) and 1 osteoblastic cell line (hFOB1.19) were collected for this work. MG-63 was kindly provided by Dr. Agi Grigoriadis from University College London. Saos-2, U-2 OS and hFOB1.19 were purchased from ATCC. All cells used were kept in exponential phase of growth. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Total RNA Isolation kit (QIAGEN). The quality and purity of the products were controlled by Agilent 2100. The final synthesized biotinylated cDNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® U133A 2.0 arrays following the protocol strictly. Arrays were scanned with the Affymetrix scanner 3000. Data analysis was performed by Microarray Suite 5.0 after pre-standard procedure.

DESIGN
Link-test on datasets from both SELDI-TOF-MS and microarray high-throughput analysis platforms can accelerate the identification of tumor biomarkers. The results confirmed that CYC-1 with important biomedical function was an effective candidate biomarker for osteosarcoma early diagnosis.
