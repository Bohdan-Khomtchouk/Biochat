TITLE
Expression data from Transgenic mice skin expressing deltaNp63alpha

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We developed a Tet-inducible system to express deltaNp63alpha isoform under the control of keratin 5 promoter. Transgenic mice, which were Bigenic (BG) developed a severe skin phenotype with abnormal keratinocyte differentiation and defects in hair follicle development and cycling. Skin samples from transgenic animals and wild type animals were analyzed for global transcriptome changes.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to performing transcriptional profiling of deltaNp63alpha transgenic and control dorsal skin at P16.
