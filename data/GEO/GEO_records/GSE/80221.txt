TITLE
Response to low-dose cortisol treatment in zebrafish embryos [larvae]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Chronic early life stress increases adult susceptibility to numerous health problems linked to chronic inflammation. One way that this may occur is via glucocorticoid-induced developmental programming. To gain insight into such programming we treated zebrafish embryos with 1 micromolar cortisol and examined the effects on larvae. Treated larvae had elevated whole-body cortisol and glucocorticoid signaling, and up-regulated genes associated with defense response and immune system processes.

DESIGN
6 samples total were analyzed. 3 DMSO controls, and 3 cortisol treated (1 micromolar).
