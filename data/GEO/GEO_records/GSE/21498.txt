TITLE
Dystrophic single myofibers vs. control single myofibers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; synthetic construct

SUMMARY
MicroRNA-expression profile of dystrophic single fibers compared to wild type single fibers isolated from different muscles of mdx and C57BL mice.

DESIGN
Myofibers were isolated from different muscle types (tibialis, diaphragm and quadriceps) of gender- (male) and age- (3 month old and half)  matched wt and dystrophic mice. 9 total samples per animal model (C57BL, mdx), 3 replicates per muscle type.
