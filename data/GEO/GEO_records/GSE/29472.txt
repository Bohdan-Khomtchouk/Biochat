TITLE
Identification of Transcription Factor C01B12.2::GFP Binding Regions in L2

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3371 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Michael Snyder. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: We are identifying the DNA binding sites for 300 transcription factors in C. elegans. Each transcription factor gene is tagged with the same GFP fusion protein, permitting validation of the gene's correct spatio-temporal expression pattern in transgenic animals.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation on each strain is peformed using an anti-GFP antibody, and any bound DNA is deep-sequenced using Solexa GA2 technology. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
EXPERIMENT TYPE: CHIP-seq. BIOLOGICAL SOURCE: Strain: OP343(official name : OP343 genotype : unc119(ed3);wgIs343(C01B12.2:TY1 EGFP FLAG;unc119) outcross : 0 mutagen : None tags : GFP::3xFlag description : This strain's transgene was constructed by Mihail Sarov at the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology in Tubiginen using Tony Hyman's recombineering pipeline.  The resulting plasmid was used for bombardment transformation of an unc-119(ed3) strain.  The C01B12.2::EGFP fusion protein has broad expression pattern at L2 stage.  This strain was used for ChIP-seq experiments to map the in vivo binding sites for the DPL-1 transcription factor. made_by : Bob Waterston's lab from UW ); Developmental Stage: L2; Genotype: unc119(ed3);wgIs343(C01B12.2:TY1 EGFP FLAG;unc119); Sex: Hermaphrodite;  EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS: Developmental Stage L2; Target gene C01B12.2; Strain OP343(official name : OP343 genotype : unc119(ed3);wgIs343(C01B12.2:TY1 EGFP FLAG;unc119) outcross : 0 mutagen : None tags : GFP::3xFlag description : This strain's transgene was constructed by Mihail Sarov at the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology in Tubiginen using Tony Hyman's recombineering pipeline.
