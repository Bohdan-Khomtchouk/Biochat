TITLE
A missense mutation in TFRC, encoding transferrin receptor 1, causes combined immunodeficiency (Family A)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix 6.0 SNP data for genome-wide linkage scans of a consanguineous Kuwaiti family with a combined immunodeficiency Peripheral blood or saliva were used for patients who had no history of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Fibroblasts cell lines were used as a source of DNA for individuals who received HSCT.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from 32 subjects (5 affected and 27 unaffected) from Family A was genotyped at 909,622 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array (Affymetrix).
