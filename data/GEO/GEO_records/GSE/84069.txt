TITLE
Prenatal hyperbaric normoxia exposure alters gene expression in male and female Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We investigated the hormetic effects of prenatal hyperbaric normoxia exposure on Drosophila healthspan related to molecular defense mechanisms. HN exposure had no disruptive effect on developmental rate or adult body weight. However, lifespan was clearly enhanced, as was resistance to oxidative and heat stress. In addition, levels of reactive oxygen species were significantly decreased and motor performance was increased. Furthermore, to determine the hormetic mechanism underlying these phenotypic and molecular changes, we performed a genome-wide profiling in HN-exposed and control flies. Genes encoding chitin metabolism were highly up-regulated in both sex, which could possibly serve to scavenge free radicals. These results identify prenatal HN exposure as a potential hormetic factor that may improve longevity and healthspan by enhancing defense mechanisms in Drosophila.

DESIGN
After HA exposure during development, all newly born (F1) flies were maintained in a climate-controlled incubator. Each experiment was performed with 10-day-old flies.
