TITLE
SKBR3 cells treated with epirubicin or hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intratumoral heterogeneity may generate a diversity of resistance mechanisms that could cause different therapeutic responses in different cell populations. Gene expression profiles were generated for breast cancer cells that had survived two different treatment and were also sorted by the cancer stem cell marker CD44.

DESIGN
SKBR3 cells were treated with epirubicin or hypoxia, and then flow sorted by CD44 expression and processed for expression profiles.  3 or 4 biological replicates were generated for each condition.
