TITLE
A prophage encoded actin-like protein mediates viral DNA segregation/replication in bacteria [Set2]

ORGANISM
Gluconobacter oxydans

SUMMARY
Active segregation of DNA in bacteria is catalyzed by cytomotive structures. Mediators of subcellular plasmid positioning are Walker-type ATPases (ParA), actin-like proteins, or tubulin homologs. These motor proteins are coupled to the DNA via adaptor proteins that recognize specific DNA motifs. Here, we describe that a temperate phage, CGP3, integrated into the genome of Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 encodes an actin-like protein, AlpC. Biochemical characterization confirms that AlpC is a bona fide actin-like protein and cell biological analysis shows that AlpC forms dynamic filamentous structures upon phage induction. The co-transcribed AlpA protein binds to a specific region of the phage DNA, possibly functioning as an adaptor protein that connects circular phage DNA to the tips of the AlpC filaments. The AlpC filaments transport phage DNA to the cell membrane of the host cell. Furthermore, both AlpA and AlpC are required for efficient phage replication. This is remarkably similar to actin-assisted membrane localization of eukaryotic viruses that use the actin cytoskeleton to concentrate virus particles at the egress sites.
