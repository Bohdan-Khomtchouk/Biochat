TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles of HCV-specific CD8 T cells from resolving patients and HCV-specific CD8 T cells chronic patients that target conserved or escaped epitopes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T cell exhaustion is a well-defined process diminishing the efficacy of the CD8 response in persistent viremia. What is less understood is whether early differences in T cell regulation already predetermine the fate of the T cell response and infection outcome. Its dichotomous outcome  that is unique among human viral infections makes hepatitis C virus infection uniquely suited to compare transcriptional regulation between HCV-specific CD8 T cells that do and do not achieve viral control. Using differential gene expression analysis and gene co-expression networks we define core programs of T cell regulation but also extensive differences in metabolic and nucleosomal processes as well as their underlying regulation by transcription factors.

DESIGN
We sorted HCV-specific CD8 T cells from 21 resolving patients and 22 chronic patients (15 with cells targeting preserved and 7 with cells targeting escaped epitopes) at multiple time points during the acute phase of infection (â‰¤36 weeks).
