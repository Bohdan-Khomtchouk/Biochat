TITLE
Microarray Analysis Reveal Global Differential Transcritomes of Mesorhizobium huakuii 7653R between Bacteroids and Free-living Cells

ORGANISM
Mesorhizobium huakuii 7653R

SUMMARY
Mesorhizobium huakuii 7653R is an Î±-proteobacterium that occurs either in a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with its host plant, A. sinicus, or free-living in the soil. Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Bacteroids compared to the free-living cells. Understand how M. huakuii 7653R responds to alterations in its environment and to the physiological changes that occur during bacteroid differentiation.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in free-living cells and bacteroids at 32 days postinoculation
