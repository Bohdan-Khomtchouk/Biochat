TITLE
Murine mature B Cells: Control vs. Notch1 Signaling Activated

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of murine splenic mature B cells that have experienced activation-induced cytidine deaminase (Aicda) gene expression comparing control untreated B cells with B cells in which transgenic Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1) gene, coding for an active form of Notch1, began to be expressed after Aicda promoter-driven expression of Cre recombinase. B cells that have experienced Aicda promoter activation were visualized by Cre-inducible expression of red fluorescent protein (RFP) which was inserted in the Rosa26 locus. Total RNA was extracted from splenic CD19+ RFP+ B cells isolated from mice using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Equal amounts of total RNA derived from 3 control mice and 3 mice with conditional activation of Notch1 signaling in mature B cells were pooled and submitted for gene expression microarray analysis. Goal was to determine the effects of conditional activation of Notch1 signaling in mature B cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, mature B cells vs. Notch1-activated mature B cells. Biological replicates: Equal amounts of total RNA from 3 mice per group were pooled together.
