TITLE
Gene Expression of HBEC-3KT cells exposed to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) over a period of 15 months

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We define how chronic cigarette smoke-induced time-dependent epigenetic alterations can sensitize human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) for transformation by a single oncogene. The smoke-induced, chromatin changes include initial repressive polycomb marking of genes later manifesting abnormal DNA methylation by 10 months. At this time, cells manifest epithelial to mesenchymal changes, anchorage-independent growth and upregulated RAS/MAPK signaling with silencing of hyper-methylated genes normally inhibiting these pathways and which are associated with smoking related NSCLC. These cells, in the absence of any driver gene mutations, now transform by introducing a single KRAS mutation and form adeno-squamous lung carcinomas in mice. Thus, epigenetic abnormalities may prime for changing oncogene senescence to addiction for a single key oncogene involved in lung cancer initiation.

DESIGN
Gene expression in CSC treated cells from two biological replicates (rep 1 and rep2) over a period of 15 months. Gene expression in Control and CSC treated at 15 months expressing empty vector (EV) or KRASV12. Data is represented as fold change in CSC treated cells over control (DMSO treated) cells.
