TITLE
Search for recessive retinitis pigmentosa genes using RNA expression analysis in lymphoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is often caused by nonsense mutations that lead to low mRNA levels as a result of nonsense-mediated decay. Some RP genes are expressed at detectable levels in leukocytes as well as in the retina. We designed a microarray-based method to find recessive RP genes based on low lymphoblast mRNA expression levels Keywords: Recessive mutations; mRNA expression; nonsense mediated-decay; retinitis pigmentosa; lymphocyte; Affymetrix genechip Human Genome U133Plus2.0.
