TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae bottom of the fermentor vs. fermentation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The main objective was to identify genes regulated during different stages of fermentation: bottom of the fermentor, feeding and the fermentation stage. The experiment was further validated by microbiological assays.

DESIGN
The control refers to the bottom of the fermentor. For analysis, fermentation was compared to the control for two strains: CAT and PE-2.
