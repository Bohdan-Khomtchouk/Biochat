TITLE
Epigenome analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from obstructive sleep apnea patients and healthy subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients and healthy subjects. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples. Samples included 8 normal subjects and 16 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 21 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
