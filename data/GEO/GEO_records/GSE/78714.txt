TITLE
Effect of STAT3c on the gene expression of MKN28 gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effect of STAT3 activation on the expression of gastric cancer cells, expression profile was compared in MKN28 cells overexpressed with control vector vs mouse constitutively activated STAT3 mutant (STAT3c).

DESIGN
MKN28 gastric cancer cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 (vector control) or plasmid overexpressing STAT3c (treatment). Stable clones were selected for RNA extraction and expression microarray analysis (Agilent). Experiments were repeated twice.
