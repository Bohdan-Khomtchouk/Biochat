TITLE
Retinoic Acid Is Sufficient for the in vitro Induction of Mouse Spermatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify RA-regulated genes in mSSCs, we treated mSSCs with vehicle, RA and RA plus CHX. To characterize the induced spermatogenic cells by transcriptome profiling, we cultured mSSCs on pup Sertolic cells supplemented with RA. Induced differentiating spermatogonia and induced spermatocytes were collected after a 3-day- and 6-day-induction, respectively.

DESIGN
We carried out RNA-seq analysis of samples after different treatment and samples from different in vitro induction stages.Two biological replicates were included for each sample.
