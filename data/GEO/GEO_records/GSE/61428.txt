TITLE
Cohesin regulates gene expression through spatial clustering of enhancer elements

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
H3K27Ac ChIP-seq in wild type and cohesin-deficient thymocytes

DESIGN
Rad21 was deleted in CD4+ CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes by crossing a Rad21 floxed allele with a Cd4-driven Cre transgene. DP positive thymocytes were FACS-sorted from control and Rad21-/- littermates, which were then used to perform chromatin immunoprecipitation for histone H3 acetylated on lysine 27 (H3K27Ac).
