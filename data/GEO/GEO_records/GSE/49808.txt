TITLE
Copy number data from five primary human glioblastomas (frozen surgical resection)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA hypomethylation could lead to activation of alternate promoters in GBM. We profiled DNA methylation and H3K4me3 genome-wide, and also performed expression and copy number analysis on the same samples In this dataset, we include all array CGH copy number data obtained for five GBMs. We used estimated copy number to normalize sequencing-based methylation data.

DESIGN
Five total samples were analyzed.
