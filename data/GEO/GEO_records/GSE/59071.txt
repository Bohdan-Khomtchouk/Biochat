TITLE
Mucosal gene expression profiling in patients with inflammatory bowel disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to analyze the gene expression in endoscopic-derived intestinal mucosal biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and controls

DESIGN
Mucosal biopsies were obtained at endoscopy  from the colon of 97 ulcerative colitis (UC), 8 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 11 controls. The biopsies were taken at the most affected sites but at a distance of ulcerations. Disease activity was endoscopically assessed. Total RNA extracted from mucosal biopsies was used to analyze mRNA expression via Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays
