TITLE
RNAome Modulation in Lung During Metabolic Syndrome in a Rat Model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is the name of cluster of risk factors that increases the risk for heart disease and other health problems by which several organs are affected, but research is lacking for those not involved directly in metabolism. The cluster is integrated by central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides and low density lipoprotein and decreased high density lipoprotein), and high blood pressure, according to the consensus released by the International Diabetes Federation [1]. This problem could be as the result of an unbalanced diets (high-fat and carbohydrates), and genetic background [2, 3]. There is evidence that suggests that MetS is a condition that increases the risk of different lung diseases. It have been reported in some MetS patients a diminished lung function, as assessed by spirometry, in addition, there is an association with insulin resistance, increase in body mass index; abdominal obesity and systemic inflammation (high levels of C reactive protein) [4-6]. In other cases, like asthma, some components of MetS such as abdominal obesity, hypertension and pro-inflammatory cytokines have been with related with this disease [7-9]. Also, a few clinical studies reported that abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia and elevated levels of systemic inflammatory markers, which are components of MetS, were significantly more prevalent in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [10-13]. In the present work we evaluated the  transcriptomic changes of lung tissue in an animal model of MetS induced by diet.

DESIGN
7 rats (3 with MetS and 4 control) were used for the microarray experiment for each group it has a one biological replicate
