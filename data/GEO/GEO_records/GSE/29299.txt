TITLE
Differential gene expression of adult rat retinas exposed to light.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed a microarray screening of adult rat retinas to identify genes that could show and up- or down-regulation due to exposure to light.

DESIGN
This study was performed using ex-vivo retinas collected from adult Long Evans rats that were exposed to light (1000 Lux), or were left in dark as control. All experiments were performed at the same hour, so that the contribution from the circadian rhythm would not affect the observations. The hours to which the experiment was performed were at 7am (always in dark), 10am (under 1000 lux) and as control 10am (always kept in dark), 1pm (under 1000 Lux) and 1pm (Always in dark).
