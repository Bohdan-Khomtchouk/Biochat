TITLE
De novo transcriptomic profiling of halotolerant microalga Dunaliella salina (Chlorophyta) in response to reciprocal alteration of salinities.

ORGANISM
Dunaliella salina

SUMMARY
The unicellular microalga Dunaliella salina is one of the halotolerant and cell wall-less green  microalgae in Dunaliella genus. The ability of halotolerance in Dunaliella is attributed to the  accumulation of glycerol. Both sugar made by photosynthesis and starch serve as carbon sources for  glycerol biosynthesis. Quantitative PCR-based analyses concluded no apparent transcriptional  regulation of glycerol, carbon fixation, and starch metabolisms upon salinity stresses. To examine  whether or not transcriptional regulation is involved at the transcriptomic level, we assembled a de  novo deep sequencing transcriptome. By using a pathway-based approach, we show that low- and  high-salt (i.e., 0.5M versus 2M NaCl) adapted cells share a common transcriptomic profile and that  subsets of ESTs associated with energy metabolisms are less affected upon salinity stress. We find  that enzymes involved in glycerol, carbon fixation, and starch metabolisms are encoded by multiple  EST isoforms. We show that EST isoforms encoding dihydroacetone reductase in glycerol  metabolism, phosphoglycerate kinase in carbon fixation, and beta-amylase and fructobiphosphate  aldolase in starch metabolism display a correlated transcriptional level change to the alteration of  glycerol and starch contents upon salinity stresses. Taken together, our results demonstrate that some  enzymes involved in glycerol, carbon fixation, and starch metabolisms are regulated at the  transcriptional level upon salinity stresses. Furthermore, our analyses indicate that energy  metabolisms are not drastically affected upon salinity stresses, consistent with its ability to adapt to a  wide range of salinities.
