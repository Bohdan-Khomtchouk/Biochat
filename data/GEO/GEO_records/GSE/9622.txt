TITLE
Methylation profiling of lung squamous cell carcinomas vs surrounding normal tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylated genomic fragments from tumor and matching normal DNA were enriched with the methylated-CpG island recovery assay (MIRA); amplified, labeled and hybridized on Agilent CpG island tiling oligo arrays. Samples from tumor were labeled with Cy5 while the matching normal were labeled with Cy3 so that methylation differences can be detected. Keywords: Cancer
