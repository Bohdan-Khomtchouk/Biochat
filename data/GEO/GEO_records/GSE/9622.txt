TITLE
Methylation profiling of lung squamous cell carcinomas vs surrounding normal tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylated genomic fragments from tumor and matching normal DNA were enriched with the methylated-CpG island recovery assay (MIRA); amplified, labeled and hybridized on Agilent CpG island tiling oligo arrays. Samples from tumor were labeled with Cy5 while the matching normal were labeled with Cy3 so that methylation differences can be detected. Keywords: Cancer

DESIGN
Comparison of methylation patterns between tumor and matching normal; five patients with stage I lung squamous cell carcinoma

PLATFORM
GPL4126 Agilent-014791 Human CpG Island ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 244K (G4492A) (Feature Number version)
