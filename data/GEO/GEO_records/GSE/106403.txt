TITLE
Old Human Serum Increases Apoptosis and Molecular Ageing Markers In Human Hippocampal Progenitor Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of old versus young serum on genome-wide expression in human hippocampal progenitor cells (HPC0A07/03C) as they differentiate into neurons/glial cells.

DESIGN
We compared the differential impact serum obtained from old versus young individuals had on genome-wide expression in human hippocampal progenitor cells as they differentiate (5 time points), whilst correcting for gender and batch effects.
