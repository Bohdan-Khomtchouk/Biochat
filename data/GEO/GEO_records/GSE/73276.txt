TITLE
Segregation of naturally occurring mitochondrial DNA variants in a mini-pig model

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We have generated a mini-pig model to study the transmission of naturally occuring mitochondrial DNA variants. To determine the chromosomal genotype of the model's founders, we have used the Illumina PorcineSNP60 v2 BeadChip.

DESIGN
DNA extracted from 15 mini-pig samples was run on an Illumina PorcineSNP60 v2 BeadChip, containing 61,565 SNPs, delivering uniform genome-wide coverage with an average probe spacing of 43.4 Kb. Image processing and SNP calling were performed using the genotyping module of GenomeStudio software (GenCall cutoff for failed genotypes of 0.15,  = software versions 1.9.4 and 2011.1, respectively).
