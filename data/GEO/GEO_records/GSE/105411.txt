TITLE
The effect of Dual Aurora A and PLK-1 kinases inhibitor to gene expressions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We designed and developed new chemical agents (AAPK) simultaneously targeting on the suppression of Aurora-A/PLK-1 activities. We used microarrays to investigate the whole gene expressions after AAPK administration in comparison to DMSO control.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of total RNA extracted from DSMO-treated or AAPK-treated Aurora-A and PLK-1 high expression HCT-116 cell lines was performed in triplicate using Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
