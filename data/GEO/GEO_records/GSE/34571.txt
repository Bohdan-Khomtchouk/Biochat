TITLE
miRNA profiling in the plasma of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studies of miRNA profiling in the plasma of AMI patients with Left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV) increase or LVEDV decrease between discharge and follow-up

DESIGN
Venous blood was collected in citrated tubes prior discharge. Plasma was harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80°C until assayed. Identical volumes of plasma from the 30 patients of a group (LVEDV increase or LVEDV decrease) were pooled to reach a final volume of 400µL for each group. The two pools were processed conjointly. Total RNA was extracted using miRVana isolation kit (Applied Biosystems), dephosphorylated and labeled using miRNA Complete Labeling and hybridization kit (Agilent). Hybridization was performed on miRNA Human Microarray Release 12.0 slides (Agilent). 4 arrays per pool were hybridized. Scanning was achieved with the Genepix 4000B Scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA). Raw data were acquired with the Genepix Pro software (Molecular Devices).
