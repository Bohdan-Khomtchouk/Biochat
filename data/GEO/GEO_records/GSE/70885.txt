TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of Hif-1α binding sites in zebrafish [microarray]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes in the von Hippel Lindau when mutant compared to wild-type at 4dpf using a whole genome microarray expression profiling. The von Hippel Lindau mutant displays a systemic hypoxic response under normoxic conditions. We performed single-colour microarrays to identify the gene expression changes which underpin the hypoxic phenotype.  We used 3 biological replicates from both mutant and control, followed by analysis using Limma to identify significant gene expression changes. This work, together with ChIP-seq data for the Hif-1α in von Hippel Lindau mutants, should allow for the Hif-1α dependency  of these gene expression changes to be assessed.

DESIGN
The changes in gene expression between von Hippel Lindau mutants and wild-type controls was measured at 4 days post fertilisation. For both wild-type and mutant, 3 biological replicates, each of 30 embryos were used.
