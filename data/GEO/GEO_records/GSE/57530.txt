TITLE
c-Jun promotes cell migration and drives expression of the motility factor ENPP2 in soft tissue sarcomas [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assayed the effect of c-Jun overexpression on gene expression in the three DDLPS cell lines using RNA-Seq (Illumina).

DESIGN
141, LPS12 and 510 has been overexpressed with c-Jun or control c-DNA and results were analyzed in high-througput sequencing metadata.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
