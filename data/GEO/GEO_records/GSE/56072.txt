TITLE
eIF4E hypersensitive mRNA translation is characterized by long and structured untranslated regions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Combining a genetic and pharmacological approach, we modulated eIF4E activity across its physiological activity range and identified subsets of genes whose translation was either hypo- or hyper- sensitive to eIF4E activity changes. eIF4E hypersensitive genes had longer 5'UTRs with higher GC content; and longer 3'UTRs with lower GC content and a higher density of unique microRNA target sites. Proliferation related genes were enriched among eIF4E hypersensitive genes; and consistent with this, decreasing eIF4E activity inhibited cell cycle transit. Our findings provide genome wide insights into the properties of mRNAs under translational control across the physiological range of eIF4E activity.

DESIGN
NIH 3T3 derivatives genetically altered to induce eIF4E when treated with mifepristone and a non-inducible control NIH 3T3 derivative were cultured with or without treatment with mifepristone and varying doses of a pharmacological eIF4E inhibiting agent, 4Ei-1 (0 μM, 10 μM, 50 μM, 100 μM, 200 μM). Total RNA and polyribosome RNA were isolated after 4h of treatment. Three replicates of each experimental group were completed. In addition, three replicates of the inducible cell line treated with less potent analog to the inhibiting agent, 4Ei-4, were completed to probe for non-specific drug effects.
