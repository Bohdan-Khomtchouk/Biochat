TITLE
Sorghum gene expression using Agilent custom 4x44K Microarray

ORGANISM
Sorghum bicolor

SUMMARY
As no commercial array is available for sorghum microarray analysis, we designed an array based on the annotation of Sbi1.4 gene set  and the available 209,835 sorghum ESTs from the NCBI EST database. The array will be used for investigating the expression divergence between grain and sweet sorghum lines under normal and sucrose treatments

DESIGN
The expression analysis was carried out using 14-day old whole seedlings from both grain and sweet sorghum lines. Three samples from sucrose treatment (0h, 2h and 6h) for each line were collected for the analysis . Two biological replicates were carried out for both control and sucrose treatments, resulting in a dataset of 12 microarrays.
