TITLE
Differential gene expression in ADAM10 over-expressing transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD), cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the α-secretase ADAM10 prevented amyloid plaque formation and alleviated cognitive deficits. Furthermore, there was a positive influence of ADAM10 over-expression on neurotransmitter-specific formation of synapses and on synaptic plasticity. To assess the influence of ADAM10 on the gene expression profile in the brain we performed microarray analysis using RNA isolated from brains of five month old mice over-expressing either the α-secretase ADAM10 or a dominant-negative mutant (dn) of this enzyme. As compared to non-transgenic wild-type mice, 355 genes were found to be differentially expressed in ADAM10 transgenic mice and 143 genes in dnADAM10 mice. A higher number of genes was found to be differentially regulated in double-transgenic mouse strains additionally expressing the human APP V717I mutant (APP[V717I]). Thus, α-secretase cleavage of over-expressed APP[V717I] alters CNS gene expression additionally. Keywords: genetic modification
