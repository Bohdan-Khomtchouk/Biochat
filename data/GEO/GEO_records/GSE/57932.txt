TITLE
Human parthenogenetic embryonic strem cell-derived neural stem cells express HLA-G.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate differences between human PG and N ESCs and NSCs, we performed global gene expression analysis. PG NSCs have unique immunological properties due to elevated HLA-G expression suggesting that parent-of-origin effects influence HLA-G.

DESIGN
Global expression profiling of PG and N hESCs and hESC-derived NSCs.
