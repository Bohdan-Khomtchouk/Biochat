TITLE
The effect of exogenous strigolactone on gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Strigolactones (SLs) have recently been found to regulate shoot branching, but the functions of SLs at other stages of development and the regulation of SL-related gene expression are mostly unknown in Arabidopsis. In this study, we performed microarray analysis to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying SL signaling.

DESIGN
We performed microarray analysis using strigolactone (SL)-deficient mutants to compare gene expression profiles in response to GR24 to determine whether exogenous applied SL would modulate gene expression. We used cRNAs prepared from max3 seedlings treated with GR24 (1 uM) or DMSO (mock) for 90 min. Two independent analyses were performed, including seedling preparation.
