TITLE
A. thaliana transcriptomic responses against drought stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Using A. thaliana microarray platform the transcriptomic response of shoot tissues was characterized at two different time points- 8d and 11d after withdrawal of regular water application..

DESIGN
Three weeks old Arabidopsis thaliana, Col0 plants were stopped watering for the treatment groups, while the control group was watered on regular intervals. Samples for early time points were harvested at 8 days after drought treatment began, while samples for late time-point was harvested after 11 days.

PLATFORM
GPL16892 Agilent-029132 At8X60 [Probe Name version]
