TITLE
RNA-seq for Thermotoga maritima MSB8 glucose evolved cultures

ORGANISM
Thermotoga maritima MSB8

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was performed on T. maritima wild type, three glucose evolved cultures, and three glycerol adapted cultures. Wild type and glucose evolved strains were grown on glucose minimal media and glycerol evolved cultures were grown on glycerol minimal media. All samples were harvested in exponential phase.

DESIGN
Seven samples are included with two biological replicates for each condition.
