TITLE
Evolution of the eye transcriptome under constant darkness in Sinocyclocheilus cavefish

ORGANISM
Sinocyclocheilus angustiporus ; Sinocyclocheilus anophthalmus

SUMMARY
we report a transcriptome-wide comparative investigation between surface and cave species in Sinocyclocheilus. De novo transcriptome assemblies were performed on surface and cave species; then the Sinocyclocheilus contigs were annotated with Gene Ontology. RNA-Seq assays revealed reduced transcription of a series of visual phototransduction and retinal disease related genes in cave-dwelling species compared with surface species. Degeneration of the retina in Sinocyclocheilus cavefish might occur in a lens-independent way by the down-regulation of several transcriptional factors, which have direct roles in retina development and maintenance, such as crx, rorb and Wnt pathway members.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different eye samples in 2 Sinocyclocheilus species.
