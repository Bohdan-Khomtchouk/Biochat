TITLE
Expression data from salivary tumor tissues derived from MMTV-ras transgenic mice with wild-type p53, no p53 or gain-of-function mutant p53

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Salivary tumors isolated from MMTV-ras transgenic mice expressing wild-type p53, no p53 or p53R172H gain-of-funcion mutant were subjected to genome-wide gene expression profiling to assess the effect of the different p53 status on tumor gene expression.

DESIGN
A total of 12 spontaneous salivary tumors from MMTV-ras/p53+/+, MMTV-ras/p53-/- or MMTV-ras/p53R172H/R172H mice (4 tumors per genotype) were analyzed using Affymetric GeneChip for gene expression profiling. The multi-class comparison function of Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) with an FDR of 1%  was used to identify genes that are differentially regulated across the three genotypic groups.
