TITLE
Role of beclin-1 in breast cancer microenvironment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comprehensive gene expression analysis was performed on a co-culture of breast cancer cells and mesenchymal stromal cells, the latter of which either expressed beclin-1 or was depleted of beclin-1 by siRNA.

DESIGN
To obtain the preliminary data, which was associated with expression genes in beclin-1 expression or siRNA-mediated beclin-1 knockdown of mesenchymal stromal cells, which were co-cultured with breast cancer MCF-7 cells, we used two cRNA samples.
