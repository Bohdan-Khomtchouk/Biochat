TITLE
Neosartorya fischeri Comparative Transcriptome when the fungi uses a differente carbon source, petroleum asphaltenes or glucose-peptona

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fischeri

SUMMARY
Neosartorya fischeri is a fungi that is able to grow in petroleum asphaltenes as sole carbon source. Here,  was investigated which enzymes were up regulated

DESIGN
Analysis used glucose-peptone condition RNA as control samples for comparison to the experimental samples when the fungi was growth in asphaltenes as sole carbon source.
