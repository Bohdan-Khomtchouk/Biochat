SUMMARY
Analysis of key genes and gene networks determining milk productivity of the dairy HF cows

DESIGN
Transcriptomes were compared of in the mammary glands of the healthy lactating Holstein Friesian cows of the high- (average 11097 kg milk/lactation) and low- (average 6956 kg milk/lactation) milk yield.
