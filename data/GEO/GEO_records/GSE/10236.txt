TITLE
Similar patterns of additive and non-additive gene expression in maize hybrids with varying levels of heterosis

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Expression profiling analyses for 5 maize inbreds and 4 hybrids, chosen to represent diversity in genotypes and heterosis responses, revealed a correlation between genetic diversity and transcriptional variation.  The majority of differentially expressed genes in each of the different hybrids exhibited additive expression patterns, and ~25% exhibited statistically significant non-additive expression profiles.  Among the non-additive profiles, ~80% exhibited hybrid expression levels between the parental levels, ~20% exhibited hybrid expression levels at the parental levels and ~1% exhibited hybrid levels outside the parental range.  These findings indicate that the frequencies of additive and non-additive expression patterns are very similar across a range of hybrid lines. Keywords: Genotype comparison series

DESIGN
Affymetrix expression profiling was used to study gene expression in aerial tissue from 11-day seedlings of maize. Three biological replicates were performed for nine different genotypes; B37, B73, B84, Mo17, Oh43, B37xB73, B84xB73, Oh43xB73 and Oh43xMo17.
