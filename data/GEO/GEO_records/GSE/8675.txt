TITLE
Transcriptional response of the marine pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to Fe limitation

ORGANISM
Phaeodactylum tricornutum

SUMMARY
Diatoms, which are responsible for up to 40% of the 45 to 50 billion metric tons of organic carbon production each year in the sea, are particularly sensitive to Fe stress. Here we describe the transcriptional response of the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to Fe limitation using a partial genome microarray based on EST and genome sequence data.  Processes carried out by components rich in Fe, such as photosynthesis, mitochondrial electron transport and nitrate assimilation are down-regulated to cope with the reduced cellular iron quota. This retrenchment is compensated by nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) reallocation from protein and storage carbohydrate degradation, adaptations to chlorophyll biosynthesis and pigment metabolism, removal of excess electron s by mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX), augmented Fe-independent oxidative stress responses, and sensitized iron capture mechanisms. Keywords: Marine phytoplankton, pinnate diatom

DESIGN
Wild-type Phaeodactylum tricornutum was grown under Fe replete (10,000 nM) and Fe limiting (5nM) conditions. Partial genome gene expression analysis of iron-inducible genes was conducted using a two-color competitive hybridization microarray.
