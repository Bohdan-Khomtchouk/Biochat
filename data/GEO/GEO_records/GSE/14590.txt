TITLE
The transcriptional pattern of Clostridium acetobutylicum following the downregulation of CAC0654 using antisense RNA

ORGANISM
Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824

SUMMARY
Little is known regarding the entry into and the regulation of genes during the sporulation process of clostridia.  Using C. acetobutylicum as a model organism we designed an antisense RNA construct targeting the CAC0654 gene to investigate the role of this gene during sporulation and solvent formation.  Samples were taken throughout the growth phase and compared to a plasmid control strain to elucidate the transcriptional changes induced by the downregulation of the two-component system CAC0653 and CAC0654
