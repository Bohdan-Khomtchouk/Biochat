TITLE
Expression data from control and Snai1 knockout embryonic stem cells (ESCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Snail1 is a master epithelial-mesenchymal trisition (EMT) factor but its role in ESC maintenance is unknown. We used microarrays to compare the global gene expression  between control and Snai1 knockout ESCs.

DESIGN
RNA extracted from control and Snai1 knockout ESCs were hybridizated on Affymetrix microarrays.
