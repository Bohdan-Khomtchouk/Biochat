TITLE
The identification and functional annotation of RNA structures conserved in vertebrates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the genome-wide screen of the vertebrate genomes for conserved RNA structures (CRSs) by CMfinder [Yao et al. Bioinformatics 2006] and predict around 515k human genomic regions that harbor such structures. For a customized CaptureSeq experiment 125k probes of 60bp length were synthesized for both strands. These probes target 77k CRS regions, which were selected by largest CRS prediction score (pscores), more than 3 substitutions to their closest genomic paralog, and conservation in human and mouse.

DESIGN
Expression analysis by customized CaptureSeq

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
