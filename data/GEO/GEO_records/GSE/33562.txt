SUMMARY
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic cancer frequently associated with activating mutations in NOTCH1. Early studies identified NOTCH1 as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of T-ALL through the use of gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs).  Here, we characterized the interaction between PF-03084014, a clinically-relevant GSI, and dexamethasone in preclinical models of glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL. Combination treatment of the GSI PF-03084014 with glucocorticoids induced a synergistic antileukemic effect in human T-ALL cell lines and primary human T-ALL patient samples. Molecular characterization of the response to PF-03084014 plus glucocorticoids through gene expression profiling revealed transcriptional upregulation of the glucocorticoid receptor as the mechanism mediating the enhanced glucocorticoid response.  Moreover, treatment with PF-03084014 and glucocorticoids in combination was highly efficacious in vivo, with enhanced reduction of tumor burden in a xenograft model of T-ALL.  Finally, glucocorticoid treatment was highly effective at reversing PF-03084014-induced gastrointestinal toxicity via inhibition of goblet cell metaplasia. These results suggest that combination of PF-03084014 treatment with glucocorticoids may be well-tolerated and highly active for the treatment of glucorticoid-resistant T-ALL.

DESIGN
Duplicate samples of the CUTLL1 T-ALL cell line were treated with vehicle only (DMSO), the gamma-secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 (1 microM), dexamethasone (1 microM), or PF-03084014 (1 microM).  plus dexamethasone (1 microM) for 48 hours. Gene expression profiling was analyzed to identify gene expression signatures assocuated with glucocorticoid treatment (dexamethasone), inhibition of NOTCH1 by gamma secretase inhibitor (PF-03084014) or the combination of both treatments.
