TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Lactococcus garvieae strains in response to growth temperature

ORGANISM
Lactococcus garvieae

SUMMARY
Analysis of the changes in the transcriptome of two different Lactococcus garvieae strains (21881 & 8831) at different temperatures of growth (18/37 ÂºC)

DESIGN
Reference design experiment  comparing samples of 21881 and 8831 strains of Lactoccocus garvieae, with three biological replicates for each condition grown at 18 and 37 degrees Celsius. The results were referenced to a equimolar mixture of both strains grown at 29 degrees Celsius
