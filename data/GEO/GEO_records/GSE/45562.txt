TITLE
Time course experiment of 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment in the zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of zebrafish (Danio rerio) livers comparing control untreated fish with fish treated with estrogen [17β-estradiol (E2)] for different time points (4, 12, 24, 48 hours).

DESIGN
For the assay experimental design, RNA from one of three different E2-treated fish (representing three biological replicates) of each time point was hybridized with RNA that was pooled from liver samples of 15 untreated fish (control pool) on one chip.

PLATFORM
