TITLE
Genome-wide examination of the transcriptional response to ecdysteroids 20-hydroxyecdysone and ponasterone A in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) hierarchy of gene activation serves as an attractive model system for studying the mode of steroid hormone regulated gene expression and development. Primary genes are activated by the direct action of the hormone and often code for proteins with regulatory function, some of which are responsible for the perpetuation of the response through the activation of secondary genes. Here we identify 35 primary 20E-response genes that are induced by 20E in the absence of protein synthesis in the embryonic cell line Kc167, and of those with known functions, most encode proteins with catalytic activity. Comparison of the genome-wide transcriptional response to 20E and to its plant derived structural analog ponasterone A (PoA) revealed a large difference in the transcriptional targets of these molecules. Despite the structural similarity of these two compounds, many more genes related to various aspects of development appear to be significantly induced by 20E than by PoA. Furthermore, we compared the 20E response in Kc cells to that of a natural 20E target tissue where the function of 20E has been well described, the salivary glands of wandering 3rd instar larvae, and found little overlap in 20E-responsive genes. Analysis of 20E-induced transcription of EcR, a known 20E-inducible gene and regulator of early and late 20E-responsive genes, reveals differences in the fold induction of EcR isoforms EcR-RA, ER-RC, and EcR-RD/E between Kc cells and salivary glands suggesting a possible cause for the observed differences in 20E-regulated gene transcription.

DESIGN
2-colour microarray desgin using 18 spotted oligonucleotide microarrays printed at the Canadian Drosophila Microarray Centre. Total RNA from Kc167 cells or salivary glands from 3rd instar larvae treated with 20- hydroxyecdysone, or from Kc167 cells treated with ponasterone A, cycloheximide, or a combination of 20-hydroxyecdysone and cycloheximide were were compared to total RNA from an EtOH (the solvent for ecdysone and ponasterone A) control sample pool.
