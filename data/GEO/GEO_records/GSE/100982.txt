TITLE
hMTR4 plays a central role in creating balanced nuclear RNA pools for degradation and export VI

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine whether the competition between hMTR4 with ALYREF is important for the specific exosome recruitment, we performed stranded RNA-seq using rRNA-depleted nuclear RNAs isolated from ALYREF and control overexpression cells.

DESIGN
rRNA-depleted RNAs isolated from control, ALYREF overexpression HeLa cells were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq X Ten.
