TITLE
Contribution of CgPDR1-regulated genes in enhanced virulence of azole-resistant Candida glabrata (part 1)

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
In this study, we aimed to determine genome-wide changes in gene expression driven by seven individual CgPDR1 hyperactive alleles as compared to wild-type allele to identify i) the CgPdr1p target genes differentially expressed in presence of CgPDR1 hyperactive alleles and ii)  potential virulence factor(s) regulated by CgPDR1 hyperactive alleles. Microarray experiments revealed a high number of genes (ranging from 80 to 400 genes) differentially regulated by individual CgPDR1 hyperactive alleles.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in 7 C. glabrata laboratory strains (SFY101, SFY103, SFY105, SFY109, SFY111, SFY115, SFY116) expressing different CgPDR1 hyperactive alleles, in 1 strain (SFY114) expressing a wild-type CgPDR1 allele and in one strain deleted for CgPDR1. The one-color system was used. 3 independent experiments were performed using 3 biological replicates for each strain.
