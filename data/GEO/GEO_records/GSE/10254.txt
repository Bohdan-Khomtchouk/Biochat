TITLE
Lactococcus lactis stringent response

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis

SUMMARY
The stringent response was defined in Lactococcus lactis through transcript profiling after the addition of a chemical inductor, the norvaline. Gene expression was measured in the exponential growth phase (reference sample) and at 1.6 h after norvaline addition. Four hundred and sixty one differentially expressed genes were identified and constituted the stringent response regulon. Keywords: stress response, time course

DESIGN
Stringent response was imposed through norvaline addition during the growth of Lactococcus lactis IL1403 under controlled conditions (30 °C, pH 6.6, nitrogen atmosphere). Cell samples were harvested in exponential phase and 1.6 h after norvaline addition. Total RNA was extracted from these samples and radiolabelled cDNA were prepared and hybridized on nylon arrays. 2053 amplicons specific of Lactococcus lactis IL1403 genes were spotted twice on the array. The 2 time-points were analyzed simultaneously and 3 independent repetitions were performed.
