TITLE
Expression data of ITK deficient, HVS transformed CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression profiles of unstimulated Herpesvirus Saimiri (HVS) transformed T cells (CD4+) of patients harboring a homozygous R335W mutation in the IL-2 inducible T cell kinase (ITK) compared to healthy control HVS cells. We identified a set of 1927 Affymetrix probe sets showing significant misregulation in the ITK deficient cells (Welch's T-test, p < 0.05).

DESIGN
HVS T cell lines (ITK wt or ITK R335W, each CD4+) from three independent culturing time points were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
