TITLE
Characterizing the profiles of Ebf1 in mouse fat cells (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq data from mouse adipocyte.

DESIGN
Mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde 10 days after induction with MDI. Frozen cell pellets were submitted to the Broad Institute for subsequent analysis of Ebf1-bound regions using anti-Ebf1 antibody (Abnova H00001879-M01).
