TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis plants treated with short oligogalacturonides and mock

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The importance of oligogalacturonides for plant defence and growth has been described extensively in litterature. However, much of previous global transcriptome analyses for plants treated with oligogalacturonides have focused on long ( > 10 galacturonosyl residues) oligogalacturonides. This study focuses on the transcriptomic impact that trimeric oligogalacturonides and a mixture of oligogalacturonides have on plant transcriptomes and overall biology.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seedling were grown on liquid 1/2 MS medium in 12-well culture plates in vitro for 12 days.  12 seedlings were cultured per well, and three wells were combined per biological replicate. The seedling plants were treated either with 1/2 MS medium (mock), 1/2 MS with trimeric oligogalacturonides (trimers) and a mixture of 1/2 MS and oligogalacturonides (short OG-mix) with a degree of polymerization of 2-20 for 3 hours. RNA was extracted from the seedlings, three biological replicates per treatment, and sequenced using the SOLiD 5500XL platform.
