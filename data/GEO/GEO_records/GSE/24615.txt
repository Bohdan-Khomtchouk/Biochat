TITLE
Analysis of gene expression among schistosoma japonicum from different hosts

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
The microarray analysis of gene expression difference between cattle,buffalo and goat,provide us a profiling as a new platform to discover the difference between their compatibility

DESIGN
schistosoma japonicum were collected by hepatic portal vein perfusion from the cattle,buffalo and goat after they infected 49d,7weeks.Three animals were perfused for each host.And worms from each animal for each experiment.
