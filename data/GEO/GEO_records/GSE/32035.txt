TITLE
miRNA expression profiles of erythroid cells following hydroxyurea treatment for sickle cell anemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that miRNA regulation may be invloved in hydroxyurea-mediated fetal hemoglobin induction. Microarray analysis was utilized as an initial screening tool to determine differential miRNA expression in CD71+ erythroid cells comparing cells from control individuals without sickle cell anemia to patients with sickle cell anemia prior to treatment with hydroxyurea and patients receiving the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hydroxurea.

DESIGN
CD71+ cells were isolated from whole blood of control individuals (n=2), pediatric patients without hydroxyurea treatment (n=3) and pediatric patients at hydroxyurea MTD (n=3). All 8 samples were analyzed for miRNA expression.
