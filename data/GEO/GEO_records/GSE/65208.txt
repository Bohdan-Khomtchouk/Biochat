TITLE
miRNA expression between CD4+PD1+ and CD4+PD1- T cells

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Recent success in cancer immunotherapy has come from the blockade of inhibitory receptors on T cells, such as programmed cell death-1, which can induce a state of T cell exhaustion upon constant antigen stimulation. Understanding miRNA regulation of PD1 can be useful to discover miRNAs for use in therapy or as prognostic markers in various diseases including cancer, autoimmunity and transplantation. We used microarrays to discover global miRNA expression changes upon PD1 upregulation and identified miRNAs that are both up- and down-regulated.
