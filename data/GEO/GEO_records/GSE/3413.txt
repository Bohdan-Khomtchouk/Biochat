TITLE
Dosage Compensation of the Active X in mammals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we show that doubling of the global expression level of the X chromosome achieves dosage compensation in somatic tissues from several mammalian species. X-linked genes are highly expressed in brain tissues, consistent with a role in cognitive functions. Keywords: Normal Tissue

DESIGN
Eight arrays were acquired from Affymetrix. Total gender-specific RNA was purchased from Stratagene. Probe labeling, array hybridization and scanning were done by the University of Washington Microarray Center (TU http://ra.microslu.washington.edu/UT ). cDNA arrays.
