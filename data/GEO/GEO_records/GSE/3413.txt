TITLE
Dosage Compensation of the Active X in mammals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we show that doubling of the global expression level of the X chromosome achieves dosage compensation in somatic tissues from several mammalian species. X-linked genes are highly expressed in brain tissues, consistent with a role in cognitive functions. Keywords: Normal Tissue
