TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse liver regeneration after PHx

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression analysis revealed that 3653 mRNAs and 465 putative lncRNAs were differentially expressed compared to transcripts isolated from livers of control sham operated mice. Analysis was done using the NCode Mouse Non-coding RNA Microarray (Invitrogen), which contains 25,179 coding featues and 10,802 noncoding features.

DESIGN
To identify lncRNAs that regulate cell proliferation during liver regeneration, we analysed lncRNA expression profiles in mouse liver tissue collected at 4, 12, 36, and 72 hours after PHx, using Sham operated mouse livers as control. -------------------------- submitter cannot locate original raw data files
