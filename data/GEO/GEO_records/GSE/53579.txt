TITLE
Microarray analysis of the self-pruning related transcriptome in sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) spring shoots

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Transcriptome changes were also examined at three stages of SAM self-pruning utilizing microarray. Combining results from different stages, 1,573 differentially expressed genes were identified; the extensive repertoire of genes associated with programmed cell death, cell wall biosynthesis and metabolism strongly suggests that abscission layers activate both catabolic and anabolic wall modification pathways during self-pruning process.

DESIGN
Three independent citrus RNA samples (Three days before self-pruning, begin self-pruning and seven days after self-pruning) were hybridized with microarrays separately

PLATFORM
GPL5731 [Citrus] Affymetrix Citrus Genome Array
