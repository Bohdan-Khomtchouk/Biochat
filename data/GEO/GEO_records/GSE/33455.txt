TITLE
Expression data from docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Docetaxel-based chemotherapy is the standard first-line therapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, most patients eventually develop resistance to this treatment. The aim of the study was to identify key molecular genes and networks associated with docetaxel resistance in 2 models of docetaxel-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines.
