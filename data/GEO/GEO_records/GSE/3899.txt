TITLE
GAS gene expression from mouse-passaged and clinical GAS strains

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
GAS strains were grown in THY broth to early exponential phase and RNA extracted.  cDNA was generated and the expression profiles were determined using the RMLgenechip.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes differentially expressed between strains.  This experiment compared pre- and post- mouse passaged GAS strains. Keywords: GAS comparison

DESIGN
3 biological replicates were analyzed for each of the 2 clinical GAS strains, no replicates for mouse passaged derivatives
