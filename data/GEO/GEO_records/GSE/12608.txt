TITLE
Rhesus macaque rhadinovirus (RRV) gene expression in vivo

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta rhadinovirus 17577

SUMMARY
Viral gene expression profiling in a rhesus macaque rhadinovirus positive B cell lymphoma obtained from a rhesus macaque experimentally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus and rhesus macaque rhadinovirus strain 17577. The experiment identified two viral open reading frames (ORFs) that were expressed in the lymphoma. Expression of these viral ORFs were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR.
