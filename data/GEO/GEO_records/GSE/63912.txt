TITLE
Genetic analysis reveals a longevity associated protein modulating endothelial function and angiogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis in HEK293T transfected with plasmid carrying different isoforms of BPIFB4 gene. This gene was previously associated with exceptional longevity in a GWAS study performed on three different populations. Results indicate an up-regulation of stress response genes and proteostasis genes in HEK293T transfected with plasmid carrying the longevity-associated variant (LAV) of BPIFB4.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HEK293T over-expressing wild-type or mutated form of BPIFB4.
