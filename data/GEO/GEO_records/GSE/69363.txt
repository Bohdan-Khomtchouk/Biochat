TITLE
RNA-sequencing of EpH4 and EpRas cells treated with Etv4 and Etv5 siRNAs and/or TGF-beta.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq analysis in mouse mammary gland epithelial EpH4 cell line and its Ras-transformed derivative (EpRas) to analyze the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation during TGF-beta-induced EMT.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was perfomed using EpH4 and EpRas cells transfected with Etv4 and Etv5 siRNAs and stimulated with 1 ng/ml TGF-beta or left untreated for 48 h.

PLATFORM
