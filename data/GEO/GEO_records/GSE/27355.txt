TITLE
Gene Expression patterns in mouse B16-OVA melanoma tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This laboratory focuses on selectin mediated recruitment during adoptive immunotherapy for metastatic cancer. This study seeks to determine changes in the expression levels of Fucosyltransferases, Selectins, and cytokines in normal and inflamed mouse skin, melanoma tumor tissue of different sizes, and tumor cells grown in culture. Since the ability to treat the tumor effectively is directly related to the size of the tumor, differences in glyco-expression patterns may be of interest. In this study, five groups were hybridized and analyzed using the GLYCOv2 array.

DESIGN
Each group was analyzed in triplicate. The groups were: Normal mouse skin, normal mouse skin inflamed by treatment with Oxazolone, B16-OVA melanoma tissue from 6 day tumors, B16-OVA melanoma tissue from 11 day tumors, and B16-OVA grown in cell culture.

PLATFORM
