TITLE
gene expression of CTCF-depleted mouse oocyte

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CTCF is a multifunctional nuclear factor involved in epigenetic regulation.  We have used transgenic RNA interference to deplete maternal stores of CTCF from growing mouse oocytes, and identified the potential target genes

DESIGN
We profiled the global gene expression in the wild type and CTCF-depleted GV oocytes, and identified a set of target genes.
