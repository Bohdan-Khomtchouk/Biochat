TITLE
gene expression of CTCF-depleted mouse oocyte

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CTCF is a multifunctional nuclear factor involved in epigenetic regulation.  We have used transgenic RNA interference to deplete maternal stores of CTCF from growing mouse oocytes, and identified the potential target genes
