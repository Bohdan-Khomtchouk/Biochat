TITLE
Comparison of the expression profiles of wild type (WT) and Oct-6-deficient (Oct-6-/-) macrophages in response to poly(I:C) treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of target genes of the POU-transcription factor Oct-6 in macrophages after poly(I:C) treatment

DESIGN
WT and Oct-6-/- fetal-liver macrophages were treated with poly(I:C) for 8 hours or were left untreated (3 independent expreiments = biological replicates). 200 genes differentially regulated in the absence of Oct-6  could be identified.
