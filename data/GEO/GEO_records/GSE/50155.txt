TITLE
Gene expression profile in response to SDH2 deletion during filament formation in both Spider medium and Spider medium supplemented with 100mM glucose

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Candida albicans comparing SDH2 deletion mutant cells with the wild-type cells in both Spider medium and Spider medium supplemented with 100mM glucose

DESIGN
The SDH2 deletion mutant sdh2Δ/Δ and the wild-type strain SC5314 were used to perform the microarray experiments. Two-condition experiments: sdh2Δ/Δ vs SC5314 in Spider midium and sdh2Δ/Δ vs SC5314 in Spider midium supplemented with 100mM glucose. Biological replicates: 3 SDH2 deletion mutant sdh2Δ/Δ samples (test group), 3 wild-type strain SC5314 samples (control group), independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL9728 28K Candida albicans Genome Array
