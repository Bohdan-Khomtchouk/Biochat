TITLE
mRNAs associated with Ago2: Ago2, Ago2+miR-1, Ago2+miR-124, mock transfected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As a core RISC component, Ago2 associates with miRNAs and target mRNAs. To identify these mRNAs, we ran lysate from HEK293T cells over a FLAG resin from 2 conditions: +FLAG-Ago2, +mock transfection.  To identify mRNAs associated with specific miRNAs, we ran lysate from HEK293T cells over a FLAG resin from 2 conditions: +FLAG-Ago2 & miR-1, and +FLAG-Ago2 & miR-124. Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Compound Based Treatment: mock transfected Keywords: Biological Replicate
