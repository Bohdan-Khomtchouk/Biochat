TITLE
Comparison of transcriptome between E .faecalis OG1RF and rnjB deletion mutant

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis

SUMMARY
To globally characterize the role of rnjB gene in E.faecalis, the transcriptome of âˆ†rnjB and OG1RF grown to exponential phase were compared using DNA microarray analysis

DESIGN
RNA obtained from cultures of the OG1RF and the mutant strains was used in  two separate dye swap hybridization (one with parent-Cy3/mutant-Cy5 and the other with parent-Cy5/mutant-Cy3)

PLATFORM
GPL23076 Enterococcus feacalis V583 genomic DNA array
