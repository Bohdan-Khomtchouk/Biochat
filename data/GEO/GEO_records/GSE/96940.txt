TITLE
The sea urchin larval response to immune challenge with Vibrio diazotrophicus

ORGANISM
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus

SUMMARY
Seawater exposure to the gram negative marine bacterium Vibrio diazotrophicus induces a robust cellular response in sea urchin larvae that includes the migration of pigment cells to the gut epithelium, changes in cell behavior and altered gut morphology (Ho et al., 2016; PMID 27192936). To investigate the transcriptional underpinnings of this response, whole transcriptome sequencing was performed on mRNA isolated from larval samples collected at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hr of exposure to V. diazotrophicus. The morphological simplicity of the sea urchin larva provides a systems-level model for identifying biologically relevant transcriptional state changes in response to dysbiosis in the gut lumen.

DESIGN
Sea urchin larvae were sampled at four time points in response to bacterial exposure
