TITLE
Genome-wide protein-DNA interaction analysis of CceR and AkgR transcription factors

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides

SUMMARY
To gain a better understanding of the transcription factors that regulate central carbon metabolism in Rhodobacter sphaeroides ChIP-seq was used to determine the genome-wide binding locations of 2 transcription factors: CceR (RSP_1663) and AkgR (RSP_0981) both predicted to be involved in the regulation of of central carbon and energy metabolism.

DESIGN
Genome-wide protein-DNA interaction analysis of 2 transcription factors predicted to be involved in regulation of central carbon metabolism CceR and AkgR
