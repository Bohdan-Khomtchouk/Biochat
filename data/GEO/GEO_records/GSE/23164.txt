TITLE
Cell envelope metabolism in phosphate limited Bacillus subtilis cells

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Investigation of the whole genome expression level changes in phosphate limited Bacillus subtilis wild-type and delta-phoPR cells Investigation of the whole genome expression level changes of wild-type and delta-phoPR Bacills subtilis cells comparing high and low phosphate medium

DESIGN
For each sample analyzed in this study 3 technical replicates were performed. 3 different samples were taken for wild-type cell and delta-phoPR cell, respectively. Samples were taken from exponentially growing cells in high and low phosphate medium as well as from phosphate-limited cells.
