TITLE
129, AJ and Balb CGH against C57 reference on Agilent whole genome and custom mouse long oligonucleotide arrays

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CGH comparing 3 inbred mouse strains to a C57BL/6 reference. The 3 inbred strains used have known trypanotolerance phenotypes, and these data were originally acquired as part of a study investigating the genetic mechanisms underlying trypanotolerance. These data have also been used in conjunction with the Perlegen 8 million SNP dataset to examine the effect of sequence mismatches on the log2 signal ratios acquired by these long oligonucleotide arrays. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridisation

DESIGN
2 separate array platforms were used - the standard Agilent mouse whole genome 244K CGH array, and a custom Agilent mouse 56K CGH array. There were twelve hybridisations in total, as for each of the two array platforms, six competitive 2-colour hybridisations were carried out. 129 vs C57BL/6 C57BL/6 vs 129 - dye-flip of the above AJ vs C57BL/6 C57BL/6 vs AJ - dye-flip of the above Balb vs C57BL/6 C57BL/6 vs Balb - dye-flip of the above
