TITLE
Low paternal dietary folate alters the sperm epigenome and is associated with negative pregnancy outcomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that the availability of folate, a soluble B vitamin, would alter the levels of DNA methylation in spermatogenesis with consequences for the sperm epigenome and pregnancy outcomes. We fed male mice with either a folate-deficient or a folate-sufficient diet throughout life. Males fed the folate-deficient diet had offspring with increased birth defects, which included craniofacial and musculoskeletal malformations. These phenotypes corresponded to developmental genes with altered methylation in sperm. To determine if there was transmission of epigenetic effects from sires to offspring, global gene expression levels were assessed in placenta from 18.5 dpc fetuses sired by either a folate-sufficient or folate-deficient male.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in placenta of 18.5 dpc fetuses sired by either a folate sufficient male (n=4 placentas from different litters and different fathers) or a folate deficient (FD) male (n=4 placentas from different litters and different fathers).
