TITLE
urea-Urea impact on the nitrogen metabolism of plant and on the nitrogen transport systems

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra05-09_urea - urea - What are the transcriptomic plant responses to urea nitrogen supply ? - Columbia Arabidopsis ecotype were grown hydroponically on 0.5 mM NH4NO3 as sole nitrogen source during 35 days under short days. Plants were then placed on 3 nutrient solutions supplemented, either with 1 mM NH4NO3, or with 0.5 mM NH4NO3 + 0.5 mM Urea, or with 1 mM Urea. Root and shoot samples were harvested separately 7 days after these different nitrogen treatments Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison

DESIGN
8 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2 GPL5337 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.1
