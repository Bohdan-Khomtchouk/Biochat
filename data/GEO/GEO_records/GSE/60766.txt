TITLE
Micro-RNAs expressed in oligometastases inhibit genes involved with adhesion, invasion and motility

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells 48 hours after transfection with non-targeting control, micro-RNA mimics or corresponding micro-RNA inhibitor. The hypothesis tested was that micro-RNAs previously identified as expressed in oligometastatic patients' metastases at a higher level than polymetastatic patients' metastases suppress genes regulating adhesion, motility, invasion and growth. Results showed that multiple micro-RNAs can suppress multiple genes involved in these pathways.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from MDA-MB-231 cells after transfection with micro-RNA mimic,  micro-RNA inhibitor, or non-targeting control MB231, performed in duplicate

PLATFORM
