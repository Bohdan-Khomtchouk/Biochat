TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Tuberculous Meningitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tuberculous meningitis is one of the fatal forms of extra pulmonary disease associated with high mortality and severe neurological defects in affected individuals.  We have carried out transcriptome level analysis using whole human genome microarrays to identify differential expression of genes between tuberculous meningitis and normals.  In our gene expression analysis, we found 2,434 genes that were differentially erexpressed with 2 or more than 2 fold changes between tuberculous meningitis compared to normal cases. Most of the genes encoded many of the proteins, which involves metabolism, energy pathways, cell growth and/or maintenance, transport and cell communication and signal transduction. We have performed immunohistochemistry for the validation of some of the novel candidates identified in our microarray studies.!Series_overall_design = Present study carried out mRNA expression profiling of five samples from patients diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis and four head injury cases were used as controls. We have used 4X44K arrays from agilent plaform. To validate our microarray results, we have done Immunohistochemistry on 15 TBM cases with control groups.
