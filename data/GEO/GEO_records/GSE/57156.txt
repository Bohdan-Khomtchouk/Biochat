TITLE
Expression data from EGFR WT or EGFR mutant NSCLC with or without erlotinib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring activating EGFR mutants show dramatic responses to EGFR TKIs, such as erlotinib and geffitinib. However, nearly all patients show relapse within 1 year after initial treatment. We used microarrays to detail global gene expression changes in EGFR mutant cells vs. WT cells responding to erlotinib.

DESIGN
4 EGFR mutant and 4 WT NSCLC cells were treated with or without erlotinib for 24 hr, followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
