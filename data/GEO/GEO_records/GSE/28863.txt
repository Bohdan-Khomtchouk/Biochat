TITLE
Exon array analysis in primary human fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exon usage analysis in in vitro cultured fibroblast cells. To assay the genome-wide splicing changes during cellular senescence, we performed splicing analysis on young and old normal fibroblasts, and in fibroblasts +/- tert (telomerase protein subunit Tert immortalized).

DESIGN
We analyzed primary fibroblasts from 5 healthy subjects at various passages and from 2 Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) patients using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. Two or three technical replicates were performed.
