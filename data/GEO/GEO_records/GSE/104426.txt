TITLE
Anti-GBM mouse model protection effect by DDR1 inhibitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A total of 40 female mice 129/SV aged 3-6 months and weighting 18-25 g were used (Janvier, Le Genest-St-Isle, France). NTS was injected in mice (10 Î¼l/gBW/day) during three consecutive days. The total number of mice was divided to five treatment groups as followed: 8 mice were injected with PBS and fed with vehicle, 8 mice were injected with NTS and fed with vehicle, 8 mice were injected with NTS and fed with low dose DDR1i, 8 mice were injected with NTS and fed with high dose DDR1i and 8 mice were injected with NTS and fed with Imatinib. All treatments were provided by oral gavage. Treatment was started one day [PM{1}] prior first injection of NTS or PBS. The average food intake was controlled by weighing the food every three days. Mice were found to consume about 4g/day/mouse [PM{2}] which was similar to all groups.

DESIGN
40 samples, 5 treatment groups Please note that one sample was discarded due to poor quality.
