TITLE
Spontaneous tumor regression is driven by Wnt/Retinoic Acid signaling cross-talk

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have identified by RNA sequencing the molecular signaling pathways that are involved in skin tumor regression and that fail to happen in malignant not regressing skin tumors .

DESIGN
mRNA profile from Keratoacanthoma tumors at 0 and 1 week post DMBA treatment was generated in duplicate for each timepoint analyzed

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
