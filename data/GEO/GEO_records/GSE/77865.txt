TITLE
A locus at 6p21.33 shows differential expression in peripheral mononuclear cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of PBMC gene expression levels according to homozygous haplotype rs9380217- rs4947296. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the haplotype rs9380217- rs4947296 at locus 6p21.33 influence gene expression of the immune response. Results provide important information involving class II HLA genes and TWEAK/Fn14 pathway

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from three peripheral mononuclear cells homozygous haplotype rs9380217/rs4947296 (CC/TT_1; CC/TT_2; CC/TT_3) compared to three homozygous haplotype rs9380217/rs4947296 (TT/CC_1; TT/CC_2; TT/CC_3).
