TITLE
Expression data from SPARKS CHARMS JIA cohort

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SPARKS CHARMS juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) cohort pre and post methotrexate therapy. This is the first study to our knowledge, to evaluate gene expression profiles in children with JIA before and after MTX, and to analyze genetic variation in differentially expressed genes. We have identified a gene, which may contribute to genetic variability in MTX response in JIA.

DESIGN
PBMC were isolated from blood samples taken from 11 patients with JIA pre methotrexate therapy  and at 6 months into therapy
