TITLE
The microRNA expression profile in donation after cardiac death (DCD) livers and its ability to identify primary non function

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The microRNA expression profile in donation after cardiac death (DCD) livers its ability to identify primary non function DCD livers are a marginal organ and their usein transplantation is associated with a higher risk of primary non function (PNF), or early graft dysfunction (EGD).

DESIGN
We compared a three groups of DCD livers defined as PNF (n=7) retransplanted within a week, good functional outcome (n=7) AST < 1000IU/L and EGD (n=9) AST > 2500IU/L . RNA was extracted from archived histology samples and miRNA expression was analysed using the affymetrix Genechip miRNA 2.0 assays.
