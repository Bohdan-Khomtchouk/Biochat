TITLE
Peri-adolescent high-fructose diet effects on hypothalamic transcriptome

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Fructose consumption has increased by over 25% since 1970, and excess consumption has deleterious metabolic effects. Additionally, fructose can alter hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function, potentially resulting in increased vulnerability to mood disorders. Adolescents are the greatest consumers of fructose and also at a critical period of development.  Here, we examine the effects of consumption of a 55% fructose diet from weaning until adulthood on the hypothalamic transcriptome.

DESIGN
RNA from whole hypothalamus of standard-chow and fructose-fed rats

PLATFORM
