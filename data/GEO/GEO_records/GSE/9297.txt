TITLE
Genomic profile of IL10-/- knocked out colitis model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Objetives: study and characterization of the IL10-/- knocked out colitis model in mice at genomic level and the study of the influence of bacteria in the development of the disease. Keywords: Differentially expressed genes analysis

DESIGN
We used three groups of animasl: 1)IL10-/- mice grown under conventional condition, 2)IL10-/- mice grown under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions, 3) Wild type mice grown under conventional conditions (CONTROL group). For each group, we recovered samples at 7, 9 and 12 weeks after birth According to colon length and colonic damage, three replicates were selected for each time point and each group (27 samples), for genomic analysis. RNA was extracted from homogenized full-thickness colonic tissues in Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen) and purified with RNeasy affinity columns (Qiagen), according to manufacturer´s protocol. The microarray analysis was performed by Progenika Biopharma (Bilbao, Spain) on GeneChip® Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). All sample labeling (biotin), hybridization, staining and scanning procedures were carried out using Affimetrix, standard protocols (www.affymetrix.com). Normalization was carried out using Bioconductor sofware (affyPLM package).
