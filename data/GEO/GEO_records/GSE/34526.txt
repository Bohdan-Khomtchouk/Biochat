TITLE
Differential Gene Expression in Granulosa Cells from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Patients with and without Insulin Resistance:  Identification of Susceptibility Gene Sets through Network Analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polycystic ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder that shows evidence of genetic predidposition among affected individuals. We have utilized the Microarray data from  granulosa cells of normal and PCOS women for network construction.

DESIGN
Human granulosa cells were isolated from ovarian aspirates from normal and PCOS women undergoing IVF and for each sample, RNA was extracted and hybridized to an Affymetrix GeneChip.
