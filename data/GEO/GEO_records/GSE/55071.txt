TITLE
Expression data from calcium-induced isolated keratinocytes from mouse skin with or without Ovol1 and Ovol2 expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During epithelial tissue morphogenesis, developmental progenitor cells undergo dynamic adhesive and cytoskeletal remodeling to trigger proliferation and migration. Transcriptional mechanisms that restrict such mild form of epithelial plasticity to maintain lineage-restricted differentiation in committed epithelial tissues are poorly understood. Here we report that simultaneous ablation of transcriptional repressor-encoding Ovol1 and Ovol2 results in expansion and blocked terminal differentiation of embryonic epidermal progenitor cells. Conversely, mice overexpressing Ovol2 in their skin epithelia exhibit precocious differentiation accompanied by smaller progenitor cell compartments. We show that Ovol1/2-deficient epidermal cells fail to undertake alpha-cateninâ€“driven actin cytoskeletal reorganization and adhesive maturation, and exhibit changes that resemble epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Remarkably, these alterations as well as defective terminal differentiation are reversed upon depletion of EMT-promoting transcriptional factor Zeb1. Collectively, our findings reveal Ovol-Zeb1-a-catenin sequential repression and highlight novel functions of Ovol as gatekeepers of epithelial adhesion and differentiation by inhibiting progenitor-like traits and epithelial plasticity.

DESIGN
Isolated keratinocytes from control, Ovol1 knockout and Ovol1/2 double knockout were physically isolated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. In order to identify differentiation changes, we isolated the keratinocytes from mouse skin and allowed them to grow in culture for 2-5 days, then added calcium and allowed them to grow another 3-5 days.
