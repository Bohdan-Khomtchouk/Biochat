TITLE
Non-canonical compensation of zygotic X transcription in Drosophila melanogaster development revealed through single embryo RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 24 single D. melanogaster embryos (12 male and 12 female) taken from 8 early embryonic timepoints to generate the first sex specific timecourse of gene expression in early Drosophila development

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in individual male and female embryos at 8 timepoints between the onset of zygotic transcription and gastrulation
