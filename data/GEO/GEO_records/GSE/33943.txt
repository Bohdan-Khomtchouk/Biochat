TITLE
Gene expression profiles of pediatric IBD remission patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clinical remission is apparent when laboratory markers of inflammation are normal and clinical symptoms are absent. However, sub-clinical inflammation can still be present. A detailed analysis of the immune status during this inactive state of disease may provide a useful tool to subcategorize patients with subclinical immune activation We performed (un)supervised clustering analysis of IBD-associated genes and applied Ingenuity® pathway software to identify specific molecular profiles between patients.

DESIGN
We analyzed RNA gene expression profiles of peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL) from pediatric IBD patients in clinical remission and age-matched controls.
