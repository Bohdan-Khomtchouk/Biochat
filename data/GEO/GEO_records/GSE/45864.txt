TITLE
PHF6 OCCUPANCYIN HUMAN T-CELL ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we identify the genome-wide occupancy of PHF6 in T-ALL cells.

DESIGN
Human T-ALL cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 20 min. DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. A sample of whole cell extract (WCE) was sequenced and used as the background to determine enrichment. ChIP was performed using an antibody against total PHF6 (Bethyl A301-451A). This represents the ChIP-seq portion of this dataset.
