TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of Fusarium fujikuroi Δset2 and Δash1 mutants

ORGANISM
Fusarium fujikuroi

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide transcriptome analyses of the Fusarium fujikuroi wild type (WT) in comparison to deletion mutants of the histone methyltransferase genes SET2 and ASH1 The results show that the two methyltransferases control large sets of genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism due to the modifications of the chromatin structure (methylation of histone 3 lysine 36)

DESIGN
The WT and mutant strains were grown for 3 days in synthetic medium with low (6 mM glutamine) and high (60 mM glutamine) amounts of nitrogen. The RNA was isolated from two biological replicates each and used for microarray analysis.
