TITLE
Influence of inflammation on the expression and activity of glycosyltransferases in human bronchial mucosa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bronchial inflammation is common in patients suffering from Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and is commonly responsible for mortality from CF. It is known that this inflammation has an influence over glycosylation events in bronchial mucins and abnormal glycosylation has been described in CF. These abnormalities can not be directly linked to CF, as the cells that secrete bronchial mucins do not express CFTR.

DESIGN
This study is to determine if bronchial inflammation could be responsible for abnormal glycoslylation in CF. Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL6, and IL8, as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 are present and seem to have active roles in the respiratory tree of CF patients. In this study, the effects of these cytokines on the expression of glycosyl- and sulfotransferases involved in the biosynthesis of O-glycans in the bronchial cell line Calu-3 were analyzed. Three replicates for each cytokine treated group and controls were hybridized to GLYCOv2 array.
