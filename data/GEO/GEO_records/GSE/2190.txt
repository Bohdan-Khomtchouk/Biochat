SUMMARY
Oxidative stress-dependent genes are defined as those induced or suppressed by H2O2 treatement in rat vascular smooth muscle cells. JNK-induced genes in rat vascular smooth muscle cells are defined as those induced by adenoviruses encoding constitutively active MKK7 (caMKK7) + wild type JNK1 (wtJNK1) and suppressed by adenovirus encoding dominant negative JNK1 (APF). JNK-suppressed genes in rat vascular smooth muscle cells are defined as those suppressed by adenoviruses encoding constitutively active MKK7 (caMKK7) + wild type JNK1 (wtJNK1) and induced by adenovirus encoding dominant negative JNK1 (APF). Adenovirus encoding nuclear localizing GFP was used as a control. Keywords = vascular smooth muscle Keywords = hydrogen peroxide Keywords = c-Jun N-terminal kinase Keywords = JNK Keywords = adenovirus Keywords = oxidative stress Keywords: repeat sample
