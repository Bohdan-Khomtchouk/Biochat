TITLE
Small RNA profiling of human cumulus cells and oocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cumulus cells are biologically distinct from other follicular cells and perform specialized roles, transmitting signals within the ovary and supporting oocyte maturation during follicular development. The bi-directional communication between the oocyte and the surrounding cumulus cells is crucial for the acquisition of oocyte competence. Using Illumina/deep-sequencing technology, we dissected the small RNAome of pooled human mature MII oocytes and cumulus cells.

DESIGN
Cumulus cells and MII mature oocytes small RNA profiles were generated by deep-sequencing, using Illumina 1G sequencer

PLATFORM
