TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of promoter-enhancer interactions with HiCap [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although the locations of promoters and enhancers have been identified in several cell types, we have yet limited information on their connectivity. We developed HiCap, which combines Hi-C with promoter sequence capture, to enable genome-wide identification of regulatory interactions with single-enhancer resolution. HiCap analyses of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) identified promoter-enhancer interactions predictive of gene expression change upon perturbation, opening up for genomic analyses of long-range gene regulation.

DESIGN
HiCap was designed by combining Hi-C with with sequence capture (for all promoters) and carried out in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC)
