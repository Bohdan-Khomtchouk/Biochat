TITLE
Expression data from liver samples of Pemt-/- and Pemt+/+ mice under high fat-high-sucrose (HFHS) diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in the liver of Pemt-/- and Pemt+/+ under HFHS diets.

DESIGN
Liver sample of Pemt-/- and Pemt+/+ mice under HFHS for 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Genes in liver of Pemt-/- mice, successively suppressed compared with Pemt+/+ mice, were obtained.
