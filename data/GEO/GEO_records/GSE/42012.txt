TITLE
Cell-density resolved comparative analysis of D. shibae wild-type vs. delta-luxI1 overexpressing luxI1 in trans

ORGANISM
Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12 = DSM 16493

SUMMARY
D. shibae delta-luxI1 overexpressing the luxI1 gene in trans was compared to the wild-type in order to identify quorum sensing controlled traits in this organism. Samples were taken at different optical densities in the exponential phase and in the stationary phase.

DESIGN
Samples from Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12 wild-type and delta-luxI1pDP1 are compared during exponential (OD600 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) and stationary phase (6h post maximum OD600), two biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL11243 Agilent-020623 Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12 15k Oligo Microarray (Feature Number version)
