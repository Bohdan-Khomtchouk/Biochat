TITLE
An arrayed CRISPR library for individual, combinatorial and multiplexed gene knockout II

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We have combined a machine-learning approach with other strategies to optimize the efficiency of sgRNAs for CRISPR screens and have constructed a genome-wide, sequence-verified, arrayed CRISPR library.  This incorporates expression strategies to facilitate multiplexed or combinatorial screening.  By conducting parallel loss-of-function screens, we compare our approach to existing sgRNA design and expression strategies.

DESIGN
High throughput sequencing was performed to identify the sgRNA representation  in depletion screens at the initial (T0) or final (T6) timepoints, with 3 biological replicates per screen. We compared 5 different sgRNA libraries, with around 200 sgRNAs per library.
