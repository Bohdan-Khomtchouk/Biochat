TITLE
Expression profiling identifies deregulated pathways and top diagnostic markers in papillary thyroid carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression microarray was used to compare 57 PTC with a reference sample (pool of 9 adjacent normal thyroid tissue) and 4 PTC against 4 matched adjacent normal thyroid tissue. A quality control filter was applied based on Feature Extraction flags (empty spaces replacing values)

DESIGN
Experiment condition, 61 PTC and 4 adjacent normal thyroid tissue samples obtained from total thyroidectomies were laleled with Cy3 and a pool of 9 adjacent normal thyroid tissue was labeled with Cy5. Samples Cy3 and Cy5 were mixed and hybridized at slide glasses Agilent 8x60k platform.

PLATFORM
GPL13607 Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
