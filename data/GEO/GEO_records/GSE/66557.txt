TITLE
Transcriptome analyses of skeletal muscle in αB-crystallin/HspB2 knockout and wild-type mice on a normal or high fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled the skeletal muscle transcriptome between wild type and αB-crystallin/HspB2 knock mice exposed to normal chow and high fat diets to examine the role of αB-crystallin/HspB2 in diet induced obesity.   Combined with metabolic profiling of the mice, these data reveal that αB-crystallin/HspB2 is involved in the genesis of insulin resistance on a high fat diet, and we provide extensive RNA profiling to illuminate potential mechanistic insights into the muscle-specific role of αB-crystallin/HspB2.

DESIGN
Hind limb muscle mRNA profiles of wild type and αB-crystallin/HspB2 knock mice exposed to either normal chow or high fat diets using RNAseq analysis
