TITLE
Genome-wide maps of the effect of antimicrobial compounds in P. putida DOT-T1E

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E

SUMMARY
We report the application of a high-throughput technique, RNA-seq, to study the transcriptomic response of P. putida DOT-T1E in the presence of antibiotics with different mechanisms of action with the aim to study in more detail the defense mechanisms that bacteria use to resist against toxic compounds. We find that P. putida DOT-T1E responde in a different way against each antimicrobial compound, what clearly shows that bacteria defense in different ways depending on the targets that compounds uses to attack. Our work is the first global transcriptomic analysis done in P. putida DOT-T1E in the presence of a considerable range of antibiotics.

DESIGN
P. putida DOT-T1E mRNA profiles in the presence of control condition (LB) and 8 different antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, gentamicin and rifampicin)

PLATFORM
GPL18568 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E)
