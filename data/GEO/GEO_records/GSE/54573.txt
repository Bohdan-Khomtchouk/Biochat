TITLE
Identification of target genes of translation-dependent signalling in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Changes ins organellar gene expression trigger retrograde signalling. Prolyl-tRNA synthetase (PRORS1) is located in chloroplasts and mitochondria. Thus, prors1-2 mutants are impaired in chloroplast and mitochondrial gene expression. The effects of the prors1-2 mutation on the global transcriptome were investigated with microarray analyses.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from Col-0 (WT, 4-weeks-old) and prors1-2 (38-d-old) leaves of the same developmental stage
