TITLE
mRNA expression analysis of T. thermophilus HB8 wild-type strain cultivated in a synthetic medium for 10 and 20 h

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA in Thermus thermophilus HB8 wild-type strain at 10 and 20 h.

DESIGN
Three wild-type strain of T. thermophilus HB8 were pre-cultured at 70 degC for 16 hours in 3 mL of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells (2 mL) were inoculated into 500 mL of the synthetic medium and then cultivated at 70Â°C.  Then, cells were collected at 10 and 20 h time point, and then crude RNA was extracted. The expression of each mRNA at each time point was analyzed on a GeneChip as described under Sample Description Sheet of each sample.
