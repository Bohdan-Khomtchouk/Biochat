TITLE
Effect of a DP1 agonist BW245C on concanavalin A-induced hepatitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the effect of a prostaglandin D2 receptor DP1 agonist BW245C on concanavalin A (ConA) hepatitis, we performed DNA microarray using SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray. Mice were treated with ConA for 3 or 24 hr with vehicle or BW245C . Livers were collected, homogenized, and subjected to total RNA extraction.

DESIGN
Mice were injected with 10 mg/kg ConA, followed by i.p. administration of vehicle or 1mg/kg BW245C 15 min later. Livers were collected at 3hr and 24hr, homogenized, and totalRNA was extracted. Each group consists of five mice (#1 to #5).
