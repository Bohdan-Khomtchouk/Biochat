TITLE
Biodiversity and functional genomics of endogenous small RNAs induced upon biotic and abiotic stresses in plant (gemsup)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au07-12_geminiselsup - gemsup - Determine the level of expresison in transgenic plants expressing geminviral gene silencing suppressors. - Transgenic lines of Arabidopsis overexpressing three different geminiviral silencing suppressors: C2, C4 and V2 were grown in adition to a control and their total RNA was extracted in order to study their genetic expressions profiles. Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic)

DESIGN
9 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
