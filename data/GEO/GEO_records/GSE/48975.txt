TITLE
Genetic disruption of Ctcf destabilizes DNA methylation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ctcf heterozygous knockout mice are susceptible to neoplasia in a broad range of tissues, including lymphoma, endometrial cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer.  Retention of the wild type Ctcf allele in these tumors establishes CTCF as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene.  Both human tumors and normal murine tissues with CTCF disruption are characterized by genome-wide differences in DNA methylation relative to CTCF wild type tissues, indicating even modest disruption of CTCF broadly destabilizes DNA methylation in vivo.  This cross species functional analysis identifies CTCF as a commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene and establishes a central role for DNA methylation stability in tumor suppression.

DESIGN
RRBS sequencing of transgenic Ctcf heterozygous mice and wild-type litter mate whole lung tissue.
