TITLE
Adaptor candidates

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
IP of candidate adaptor Ada5/Gdi1, tagged with HA, versus Mock (untagged) replicates. IP associated RNA was assayed. A replicate experimental design type is where a series of replicates are performed to evaluate reproducibility or as a pilot study to determine the appropriate number of replicates for a subsequent experiments. GeneticModification: HA-tagged candidate gene or control
