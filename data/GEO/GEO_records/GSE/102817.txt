TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of splenic monocytes from Foxp3DTR and WT mice post-MI versus sham operated animals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Objective: To study the impact of endogenous CD4+ Foxp3+ T-cells on splenic monocyte differentiation after MI.

DESIGN
Methods and Results: Sorting of splenic monocytes on day 5 after MI followed by transcriptome analysis by means of RNA sequencing revealed that depletions of CD4+ Foxp3+ T-cells imposed a pro-inflammatory bias on splenic Ly6Chigh monocytes. In contrast, as compared to sham surgery there is minimal regulation of transcriptional activity in splenic monocytes in the presence of endogenous CD4+ Foxp3+ T-cells in response to myocardial infarction.
