TITLE
ChIP-seq after immunoprecipitation with either IgG or SOX2 antibodies in murine genetically modified stem cells overexpressing the RAX gene (CCE-Rx cells)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify target genes of the SOX2 transcription factor, we tried to identify SOX2 binding site in murine genetically modified stem cells overexpressing the RAX gene (CCE-Rx cells) by ChIP-seq. SOX2 gene mutations are involved in anophthalmia and our hypothesis was that target genes of SOX2 transcription factor may also be candidate to be involved in ocular development.

DESIGN
High throughput sequencing after chromatin immunoprecipitation using either an antibody against our target transcription factor (SOX2) or using control antobodies (IgG). These experiments were performed on only one immunoprecipitation with each antibody.
