TITLE
Exosomal natural antisense transcripts released from colorectal cancer SW480 cells into culture supernatants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, natural antisense transcripts (NATs), transcribed from reverse strand deoxynucleic acids (DNAs) of genes, into exosomes released from colorectal cancer SW480 cells were searched using an sense/antisense-custom microarray.

DESIGN
SW480 cells were cultured with serum-free RPMI1640 for 48 h. Then, culture media were collected, centrifugated, and filtrated using 0.22-um filters. Exosomes from culture media were collected by ultracentrifugation.
