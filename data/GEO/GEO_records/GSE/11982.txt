TITLE
Expression data from WT and E2A-KO bone marrow stem and progenitor cell subfractions.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of WT and E2A-KO LSK FLT3- and LMPP protenitor cells.

DESIGN
LSK FLT3- and LMPP stem/progenitor cells from WT and E2A-KO mice were FACS sorted. Subsequently RNA was extracted, labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. Goal of experiment was to investigate expression changes between WT and KO LMPP cells.

PLATFORM
