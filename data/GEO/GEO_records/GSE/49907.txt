TITLE
Differential DNA methylation with age displays both common and dynamic features across human tissues that are influenced by CpG landscape [kidney]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of 4 human tissues of various ages: 83 samples of normal adjacent resected kidney tissue .The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs. Sentrix barcode provided for batch normalization

DESIGN
1ug of genomic DNA was bisulfite converted using EZ-96 DNA Methylation Kit from ZymoResearch, and hybridized to beadcheaps according to Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation standard procedures
