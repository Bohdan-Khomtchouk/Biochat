TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of chicken ES, blastodermal, primordial germ cells, embryonic fibroblasts and monocytic cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The comparative transcriptomic analysis of chicken stem cells defines a chicken set of pluripotency associated genes that is almost coincident with mammalian pluripotency-assocaited genes.  A total of 5944 differentially expressed unique identifiers (target IDs) were defined for CEF, 5942 for BM2  cells, 4550 for cES, 5465 for PGC and 5522 for cBC.

DESIGN
Chicken Blastodermal cells (cBC) were taken from stage IX-XII (Eyal-Giladi & Kochav, 1976) embryos,chicken embryonic stem (cES) cells were  established, amplified on inactivated STO feeder cells in proliferative medium containing cytokines and growth factors as described (Pain et al., 1996, Lavial et al., 2007). Long term cultured primordial germ cells (PGCs) were derived from 48h embryonic blood and maintained as described (McDonald et al., 2010). The non-tumorigenic BM2 monocytic cell line was grown as described (Solari et al., 1996). Primary chicken Embryonic fibroblasts (CEF) were prepared from 11-12 day old embryos according to  standard protocols (Gandrillon et al., 1987), maintained and homogenised for 3-4 passages before being used as a somatic cell control. RNAs were extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer and microarray analysis performed in biological triplicate.
