TITLE
Comparaison of left and right cervical motoneurons transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Left and Right phrenic nerves, which innervate the left and right diaphragm muscles, exhibit different innervation patterns. This left/right (L/R) asymmetry is established at the onset of innervation by a developmental program that requires Nodal. Phenotype analysis suggests that the cervical motoneurons, which innervate the diaphragm, have a L/R imprint that contributes to set the L/R asymmetries of innervation. We used microarray to analyze the expression profile of left and right cervical motoneurons before diaphragm innervation

DESIGN
Left and right cervical motoneurons pools were collected from E11.5 HB9::GFP mice embryos. Left and right pools were collected from the same sections to allow paired analysis. The three embryos were from the same litter to minimize expression changes due to variation of the developmental stages.
