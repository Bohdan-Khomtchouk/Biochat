TITLE
Exosome Transfer from Stromal to Breast Cancer Cells Regulates Therapy Resistance Pathways [set 2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stromal communication with cancer cells can influence treatment response. We show that stromal and breast cancer (BrCa) cells utilize paracrine and juxtacrine signaling to drive chemotherapy and radiation resistance. Upon heterotypic interaction, exosomes are transferred from stromal to BrCa cells. RNA within exosomes, which are largely non-coding transcripts and transposable elements, stimulates the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I to activate STAT1-dependent anti-viral signaling. In parallel, stromal cells also activate NOTCH3 on BrCa cells. The paracrine anti-viral and juxtacrine NOTCH3 pathways converge as STAT1 facilitates transcriptional responses to NOTCH3 and expands therapy resistant tumor-initiating cells. Primary human and/or mouse BrCa analysis support the role of anti-viral/NOTCH3 pathways in NOTCH signaling and stroma-mediated resistance, which is abrogated by combination therapy with gamma secretase inhibitors. Thus, stromal cells orchestrate an intricate cross-talk with BrCa cells by utilizing exosomes to instigate anti-viral signaling. This expands BrCa subpopulations adept at resisting therapy and re-initiating tumor growth.

DESIGN
Breast cancer cells lines and MRC5 fibroblasts were mono-cultured or co-cultured together. Cell types were separated by FACS and gene expression changes were examined using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0ST arrays. The effect of tumor-stromal cell interaction on different breast cancer cell types was analyzed using biological replicates. Gene expression changes resulting from knockdown of STAT1 was also investigated.
