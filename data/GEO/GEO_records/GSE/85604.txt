TITLE
miRNA expression of exosomes derived from lung cancer cells A549 and cisplatin (DDP) resistant lung cancer cells A549/DDP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the difference of miRNA expression in exosomes derived from A549 cells and its DDP-resistant cell strain A549/DDP, we have employed miRNA microarray expression to discover the difference expression of miRNAs in exosomes derived from A549 and A549/DDP. We conducted RT-qPCR to examine the expression levels of top differential expressed miRNAs, namely, miR-197-5p, miR-4443, miR-642a-3p, miR-27b-3p and miR-100-5p, confirming low variability between two methods.

DESIGN
The A549/DDP was established from A549 in our laboratory, by exposing A549 to gradually increasing DDP concentrations, until the final concentration at 1Î¼g/ml. To avoid the influence of drug to the A549/DDP cells, they were cultured in a drug-free medium for at least two weeks before gene expression analysis. After being incubated for 48-72h, the culture medium of cells was harvested. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation. And miRNA expression of exosomes derived from A549 and A549/DDP was then analzyed.
