TITLE
Expression data from control and colicin M treated E. coli MG1655 culture

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Among colicin producing E. coli, colicin M producing strains are the most frequently present in natural populations. Bacteria must be able to sense and respond to unfavourable conditions, resulting in adaptive responses. To gain insight into colicin M ecological role and the purposes related to antimicrobial therapy, the effects of subinhibitory concentrations of colicin M on E. coli whole genome transcription was investigated. We used microarray analysis to follow differential gene expression in E. coli upon colicin M exposure. Colicin M inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis altering expression of genes involved in envelope stress, osmotic and other stresses, exopolysaccharide prodoction, biofilm formation, and cell motility.
