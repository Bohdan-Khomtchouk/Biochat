TITLE
Expression data from control and colicin M treated E. coli MG1655 culture

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Among colicin producing E. coli, colicin M producing strains are the most frequently present in natural populations. Bacteria must be able to sense and respond to unfavourable conditions, resulting in adaptive responses. To gain insight into colicin M ecological role and the purposes related to antimicrobial therapy, the effects of subinhibitory concentrations of colicin M on E. coli whole genome transcription was investigated. We used microarray analysis to follow differential gene expression in E. coli upon colicin M exposure. Colicin M inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis altering expression of genes involved in envelope stress, osmotic and other stresses, exopolysaccharide prodoction, biofilm formation, and cell motility.

DESIGN
A sub-lethal concentration of colicin M was used to treat E. coli MG1655 cultures at an early logarithmic phase. The experiments were performed  in parallel with untreated control E. coli MG1655 cultures. Total RNA was extracted after 30 min and 60 min  treatment with colicin M and used for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
