TITLE
Loss of p21 expression enhances DNA damage, cholestasis and hepatocarcinogenesis in the liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Overexpression of p21 in NEMOÎ”hepa animals protects against DNA damage, acceleration of hepatocarcinogenesis and cholestasis. As strengthened by our LPS stimulation experiments, we identified a novel protective role of p21 against DNA damage.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of livers from wild type, NEMO, and NEMO-P21 null mice.
