TITLE
Toxicogenomic Screen of Replacements for bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) Using the Immortalized TM4 Sertoli Cell Line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phthalate plasticizers are being phased out of consumer products because of their endocrine disrupting properties. This has resulted in a need to find safe alternatives that can plasticize polyvinyl chloride (PVC) while being inexpensive and biodegradable. We aim to study the toxicogenomic profile of mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP, the active metabolite of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, DEHP), the commercial plasticizer 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH), and three plasticizers in development (1,4 butanediol dibenzoate (BDB), dioctyl succinate (DOS), and dioctyl maleate (DOM)) using the immortalized TM4 Sertoli cell line.

DESIGN
Each sample contains four biological replicates except for DOS that contains three. The control is 1.0% DMSO as this was the vehicle used to solubilize the test compounds.
