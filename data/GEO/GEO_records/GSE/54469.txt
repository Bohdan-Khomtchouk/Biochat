TITLE
Identification of genes cooperatively regulated by cytokinin and HD-ZIP III transcription factors

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In Arabidopsis thaliana, cytokinin responsive B-type ARR transcription factors and HD-ZIP III transcription factors such as REVOLUTA (REV), act cooperatively as master regulators of shoot regeneration. To identify the downstream targets of ARR-HD-ZIP III transcriptional complex, we used an inducible line of REV, 35S::FLAG-GR-rREV, in which FLAG-tagged miR165/6-non-targetable form of REV (rREV)-GR fusion protein was expressed from 35S promoter. DEX treatment induced activation of REV by translocation of FLAG-GR-rREV fusion protein from cytoplasm to the nucleus. We treated 35S::FLAG-GR-rREV seedlings with  6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA, a cytokinin), dexamethasone (DEX), or 6-BA+DEX for 2 hours. Total RNAs were extracted and subjected to Agilent Arabidopsis Gene Expression Microarray analyses. The differentially expressed genes ( > 1.5-fold, p < 0.05) were identified.

DESIGN
10-day-old 35S::FLAG-GR-rREV plants were treated with 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA), dexamethasone (DEX), or 6-BA+DEX for 2 hours. DEX treatment induced activation of REV by translocation of FLAG-GR-rREV fusion protein from cytoplasm to the nucleus. Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit and hybridized to Agilent Arabidopsis Gene Expression Microarray. Differentially expressed genes were defined by a 1.5-fold expression difference with a P value < 0.05. Biological replicates were performed.
