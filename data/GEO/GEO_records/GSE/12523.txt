TITLE
Ovarian cancer cell line study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An ovarian cancer cell line study to identify possible trends between chromosomal aberrations depicted from CGH microarray profiling with expression profiling. CGH microarray profiles of a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines will be analysed and 10 cell lines with chromosomal aberrations of recurrent regions (with the strongest trend) will be taken forward for further expression array analysis to identify candidate genes. CGH microarray analyses will restrict the regions of aberrations with high resolution and accurracy, combined with expression array analysis to pinpoint candidate genes that will relate to the amplified and deleted regions. Identified candidates will allow the better understanding of mechanisms and specific pathways involved in ovarian cancer development.

DESIGN
A collection of 31 cell lines in the laboratory will be used. CGH microarray profile analyses will be carried for all, a selection process will be used to separate the groups such as the subtypes of the cell line. An analysis program will be used to depict recurrent regions and 10 cell lines will be taken forward for further expression array analysis to identify candidate genes.
