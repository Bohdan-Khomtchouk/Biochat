TITLE
The poloxamer P-407 chronic hyperlipidemia mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed a systemic study of the poloxamer P-407-induced chronic hyperlipidemia in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were treated 96 days every third day.The poloxamer mostly elevates plasma triglycerides and cholesterol while change of the liver cholesterol is not significant. Keywords: Disease model state analysis

DESIGN
A group of 12 mice were administered 0.5 g/kg poloxamer P-407 by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (poloxamere group), a control group of 4 mice were injected every third day with normal saline. Total RNA from P-407 treated 12 mice has been pooled into 3 biological replicas (Smpl1, Smpl2 and Smpl3). Reference total RNA has been obtained by pooling 4 mice from control group. Each RNA sample has been splitted and hybridised in parallel on cDNA (G4104A) and oligonucleotide (G4120A) mouse microarrays (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA.
