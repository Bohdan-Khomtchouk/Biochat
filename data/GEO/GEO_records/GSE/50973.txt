TITLE
Analysis of the coding exome of follicular lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Follicular lymphoma (FL) constitutes the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the Western world.  FL carries characteristic recurrent structural genomic aberrations. However, information regarding the coding genome in FL is still evolving. Here, we describe the results of massively parallel exome sequencing and high-resolution SNP 6.0 array profiling of 12 highly purified FL cases and validation of mutations in an expansion cohort of 45 cases. In addition to confirming high-frequency mutations in MLL2, CREBBP and BCL2, we report identification of 18 recurrently mutated genes in FL. These include novel mutations in MCL1, IRF8 and POU2FA/OCT2, and high-frequency mutations in various components of the linker histone HIST1H1. Further, multiple novel mutated genes located within regions of acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) are identified, providing candidate genes for this common lesion type in FL. In aggregate, these data substantially broaden our understanding of the types and frequency of recurrently mutated genes and pathways in FL

DESIGN
Twelve paired normal and tumor follicular lymphoma cases were profiled by SNP array for this study.  However, in addition the data from 125 CEL files derived from the DNA of flow-sorted CD3+ cells from 125 CLL patients (122 CEL files from GSE30777) were used to firmly establish a normal copy number baseline for the dChip software to compute all subsequent normal and tumor DNA copy number values.
