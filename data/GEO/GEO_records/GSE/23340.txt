TITLE
Whole gene expression profiling: A study for analysing the gene expression of the retinal stem cells and the differentiated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparitive analysis of the retinal stem/progentior cells derived from the ciliary and iris pigment epithelial cells and the subsequent differentiated cells derived from the stem/progenitor cells. Gene expression profiling has shown great promise in analysing the reprogramming pattern of the cells under various culture conditions, in this context we analysed the various differential gene expression pattern of the neurospheres derived from the ciliary and iris pigment epithelial cells, and their differentiated cells. This provide an insite for the stem cell transplantation studies.

DESIGN
We analysed 3 biological cultures derived from each catogory like the primary cells of both ciliary and iris pigment epithelial cells, the stem/progenitor cells (Neurospheres), neurosphere derived differentiated cells. No technical replicates were performed.
