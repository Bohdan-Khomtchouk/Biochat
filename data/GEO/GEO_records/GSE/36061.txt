TITLE
Microarray analysis to identify genes that are differentially expressed in resting and in LPS-activated splenic B cells of Ebf1+/fl-RERTCre and Ebf1fl/fl-RERTCre mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using resting and LPS-stimulated B cells from mice carrying two Ebf1 alleles flanked with loxP sites and an inducible Cre recombinase, target genes of Ebf 1 and the effect of Ebf1 deletion on the cells was analyzed. Target genes of Ebf 1 and the effect of Ebf1 deletion on the cells was analyzed.

DESIGN
Ebf1 fl/fl mice and heterozygote control animals carrying an ER-Cre fusion protein were treated with  Tamoxifen-Citrate  and were  sacrificed for analysis. Resting B cells were sorted and were either left untreated or were stimulated with LPS,  followed by RNA extraction for expression analysis. See related Series GSE35915.
