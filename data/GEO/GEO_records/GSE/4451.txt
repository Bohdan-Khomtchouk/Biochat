TITLE
Met Expression Signature in Hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify HGF/Met regulated genes, we performed expression microarray analysis after inducible activation of Met receptor in primary cultures of hepatocytes established from wild-type control (Alb-Cre +/-) and Met conditional knockout mice (Alb-Cre +/-; Met Fl/Fl). Keywords: time series design
