TITLE
Met Expression Signature in Hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify HGF/Met regulated genes, we performed expression microarray analysis after inducible activation of Met receptor in primary cultures of hepatocytes established from wild-type control (Alb-Cre +/-) and Met conditional knockout mice (Alb-Cre +/-; Met Fl/Fl). Keywords: time series design

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from untreated hepatocyte cultures as well as from cultures treated with 50 ng/ml of HGF for 0.5, 2, 12 or 24 hours. RNA collected from these experiments was converted to fluorescently labeled cDNA and used for hybridizations of oligonucleotide microarrays. All experiments were repeated in triplicates. Total RNA from pooled wild-type mouse hepatocytes was used as universal reference and all hybridizations were repeated following a reverse flourescing.
