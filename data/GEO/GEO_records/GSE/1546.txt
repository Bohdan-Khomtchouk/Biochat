TITLE
MeJA treatment in sugarcane

ORGANISM
Saccharum officinarum complex

SUMMARY
Using nylon filter arrays, we analyzed the expression profile of 1536 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) exposed to the phytormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) for 0-12 h. 26 ESTs were differentially expressed, including novel genes and also genes that had not previously been reported as being MeJA-inducible. Data are for two independent experiments. Keywords = sugarcane Keywords = methyl jasmonate Keywords = nylon arrays Keywords: time-course

PLATFORM
GPL1329 Sugarcane ESTs nylon arrays I
