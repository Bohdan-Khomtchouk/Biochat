TITLE
Proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases promote human T helper 1 cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the dataset was to study on genome-wide level the effect of PIM kinase (PIM1+PIM2+PIM3) knockdown in gene expression on early differentiation of human cord blood derived CD4+ T cells cultured under Th1 (Act+IL12) polarizing conditions.

DESIGN
Total RNA from PIM1+PIM2+PIM3 siRNA treated cord blood CD4+ T cells 6 hours after culturing the cells in activating (antiCD3+antiCD28) plus IL-12 (Th1) or IL-4 (Th2) conditions was compared to total RNA from nonspecific control siRNA treated cells. Samples from 3 biological replicates were analysed.
