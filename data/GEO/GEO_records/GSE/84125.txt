TITLE
Gene expression profiles in na√Øve and activated CD4+ T cells from WT and Capicua (Cic)-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) to reveal CIC target genes in CD4 T cells. The goals of this study are to compare NGS-derived CD4 T cell transcriptome in the presence or absence of CIC.

DESIGN
To identify the genes regulated by CIC in CD4+ T cells, RNA-seq was performed using naive and activated CD4+ T cells in the spleen from Cic f/f and Cic f/f; Cd4-Cre mice.
