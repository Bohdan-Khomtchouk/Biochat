TITLE
Novel piRNA Pathway Components Identified Among the Class of TUDOR Domain Containing Proteins

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PIWI proteins and their bound piRNAs form the core of a gonad specific small RNA silencing pathway in animals that protects the genome against the deleterious activity of transposable elements. Recent studies linked the piRNA pathway to TUDOR biology, where TUDOR domains of various proteins recognize and bind symmetrically methylated Arginine residues in PIWI proteins. We systematically analyzed the Drosophila TUDOR protein family and identified three previously not characterized TUDOR domain-containing genes (CG4771, CG14303 and CG11133) as essential piRNA pathway members. We characterized CG4771 (Avocado) in detail and demonstrate a critical role for this protein during primary piRNA biogenesis in somatic and germline cells of the ovary. Avocado physically and/or genetically interacts with the primary pathway components Piwi, Armitage, Yb and Zucchini. Avocado also interacts with the Tdrd12 orthologs CG11133 and CG31755, which are essential for primary piRNA biogenesis in the germline and probably functionally replace the related and soma specific factor Yb.
