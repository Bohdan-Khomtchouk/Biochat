TITLE
Global analysis of truncated RNA ends reveals novel insights into ribosome stalling in plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
High-throughput approaches for profiling the 5' ends of RNA degradation intermediates on a genome-wide scale are frequently applied in the validation of cleavage sites guided by microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the complexity of the RNA degradome beyond miRNA targets is currently largely unclear which limits the application of RNA degradome. Here, we provide multiple lines of evidence to show that the plant RNA degradome contains in vivo ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. We observed a 3-nt periodicity and a bias toward the translational frame in the global analysis of 5' truncated mRNA ends mapped to the coding sequence (CDS) of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and soybean (Glycine max). In addition, predominant 5' termini of RNA degradation intermediates separated by a length equal to a ribosome-protected mRNA fragment were evident in some conserved peptide upstream open reading frames (uORFs) of Arabidopsis and rice. Through the analysis of RNA degradome data, we uncovered novel uORFs and CDS regions potentially associated with stacked ribosomes in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the analysis of RNA degradome data suggested that the binding of Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE7 to a non-cleavable target site of miR390 might directly hinder ribosome movement. This work demonstrates an alternative use of RNA degradome data in the study of ribosome stalling.
