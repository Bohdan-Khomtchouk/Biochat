TITLE
Intracellular expression pattern of recombinant Mtb strain TB294 overexpressing sigma factor A

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
We previously showed that increased expression of the principal sigma factor, SigA, mediates the capacity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 210 strains to grow more rapidly in human monocytes, compared to other strains. To identify SigA-regulated genes that favor intracellular mycobacterial growth, we used microarray analysis to compare gene expression between a recombinant M. tuberculosis 210 strain bearing a sense sigA construct and a vector control during growth in MonoMac6 cells. The most strongly upregulated gene in the sense sigA transformant was Rv2416c, which has previously been shown to enhance intracellular survival of M. smegmatis, and has been designated as eis. Real-time PCR confirmed marked upregulation of eis mRNA by the intracellular sense sigA transformant, and lysates of this transformant contained high concentrations of the Eis protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that SigA bound the eis promoter region in live bacteria. Deletion of the eis gene reduced growth of M. tuberculosis in macrophages, and complementation of eis reversed this effect. We conclude that SigA regulates eis expression, which in turn contributes to the enhanced capacity of the M. tuberculosis 210 strain to grow in human macrophages.
