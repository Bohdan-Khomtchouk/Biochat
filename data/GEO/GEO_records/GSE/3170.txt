TITLE
Barley single feature polymorphisms and drought stress gene expression

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Detection of single feature polymorphisms comparing five barley genotypes. Gene expression under unstressed and drought stressed conditions. Tissue from five entire five day old seedlings from drought stress or unstressed growth conditions was used for RNA extraction. For Barke, Morex and Stepoe the two types of RNA were pooled.  For Oregon Wolfe Barley Dominant and Recessive (OWBs), the two types of RNA were handled separately. Targets from three biological replicates of each genotype-treatment were generated and transcript levels were determined using Affymetrix Barley1 GeneChip arrays. Probe set, followed by single probe, comparisons between genotypes allows the identification of single feature polymorphisms in comparisons between genotypes. For the OWBs, comparisons between stressed and unstressed conditions defines stress-regulated genes. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
Three genotypes, three replicates each.  Two additional genotypes, two sets of three replicates each.
