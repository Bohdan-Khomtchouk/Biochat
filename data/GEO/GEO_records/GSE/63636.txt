TITLE
Expression analysis in roots and leaves of asparagus bean accesions B47 and B128 under well-watered and soil drought conditions

ORGANISM
Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in two asparagus bean accesions B47 and B128 under drought stress, compared to well-watered conditions. Two organs, leaf and root, were sampled for each accesion under both well-watered and drought conditions.

DESIGN
A 24-chip study using total RNA. A total of 29,471 unigenes, 26,156 functionally annotated, were represented on the microarray, and a total of 24 microarrays (2 genotypes × 2 tissues × 2 treatments × 3 replicates) were produced for hybridization.

PLATFORM
