TITLE
Gene expression in INA6 multiple myeloma cells in an acidic condition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in MM cells in acidic conditions. We further looked into gene expression in MM cells in acidic conditions using a cDNA microarray.

DESIGN
INA6 cells were cultured for 12 hours, at pH7.4 or pH6.8 in the absence or presence of valproiate at 100 ug/mL. The total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit.

PLATFORM
