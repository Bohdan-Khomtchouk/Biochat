TITLE
Leukocyte gene expression in depressed and non-depressed renal cell carcinoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cell mRNA samples collected from renal cell carcinoma patients.  The primary research question is whether gene expression differs as a function of patient's level of depression as measured by CESD score > 16.
