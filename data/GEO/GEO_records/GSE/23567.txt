TITLE
Genome-Wide CRX Binding Sites in adult mouse photoreceptors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CRX is a key transcript factor for photoreceptor development and homeostasis. We have characterized the CRX-dependent cis-regulatory network by ChIP-chip analysis of 2 month old BL/6 mouse retinas using Affymetrix Mouse Promoter 1.0 arrays
