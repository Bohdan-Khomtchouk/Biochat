SUMMARY
RNA-Seq technique was applied to investigate the effects of two semen collection methods (Pelleted vs Liquefied) and two sperm purification methods (SCLB vs PS) to the integrity of isolated RNAs at different perspectives.

DESIGN
The same set of semen samples were applied to investigate the qualitative and quantitative effect of semen collection methods and sperm cell purification methods on sperm transcript profiling.
