TITLE
Identification of candidate genes regulated by E4bp4 in murine bone marrow

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E4bp4 is essential for the development of natural killer (NK) cells. We sought to identify downstream targets of E4bp4 by comparing mRNA expression in wild type vs. E4bp4 knockout Lineage-depleted bone marrow, which is enriched for haematopoietic progenitor cells. We then went on to validate these targets using real time PCR, genetic complementation assays and ChIP

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from linege-depleted bone marrow from six wild type and six E4bp4 knockout mice. Labelled cDNA was hybridised to a GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. The data generated was imported into GeneSpring GXv11 (Agilent) and normalised using the Robust Multi-Array (RMA16) algorithm. Genes were filtered on expression value between 20th and 100th percentile to remove those with very low or no expression across all the samples. A moderated t-test was applied to the data and p values were adjusted for multiple testing using a Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction.
