TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae upon honokiol treatment

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Honokiol (HNK), one of the main medicinal components in Magnolia officinalis, possesses antimicrobial activity against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and fungi.S. cerevisiae is a model eukaryote used for investigating the cellular and  molecular mechanisms of anti-fungal drugs. To explore the molecular mechanism of its anti-fungal activity, we determined the effects of HNK on the mRNA expression profile of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a DNA microarray approach.
