TITLE
A Gene Expression Profiling of Early Rice Stamen Development that Reveals Inhibition of Photosynthetic Genes by OsMADS58

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Plant organ formation, or organogenesis is the process in which the primordium derived from shoot apical meristem develops into an organ with a given shape and proper function, through a series of cell division and differentiation. To decipher the genetic program underling plant organ formation, we targeted early rice stamen development that covers most important events in male organ formation and germ cell initiation in plants.

DESIGN
Totally, seven samples were used in this experiment. Stamens of stages 2-6 was collected through microdissection under microscope. And to ensure the stamen primordia collected are at corresponding stages, rice panicles were cut in half longitudinally, one half for paraffin sectioning to confirm developmental stages and the other half for preparing GEP samples. Samples of primordial and just-expanded third leaves were used as controls because leaf and stamen are homolog organs. RNA was extracted and amplified with Two-Cycle Eukaryotic Target Labeling Assay kit, and then hybridized to microarrays. Three biological replicates were applied for each sample.
