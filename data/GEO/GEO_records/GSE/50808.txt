TITLE
Saos-2 vs. Saos-2-2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Saos-2-2, a TSG101-deficient stable line, was dereived from Saos-2 cells. The goal of this experiment was to determine the effects of TSG101 down-regulation on global gene expression.

DESIGN
Saoa-2 and Saos-2-2 samples were labeled with Cys-3 and Cys-5 respectively, and hybrided with microarray simutaneously to differentiate the up- and down-regulated genes.
