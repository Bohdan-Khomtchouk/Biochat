TITLE
Expression analysis of M. tb H37Rv after treatment with DTT for 3 hrs

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Effect of Thiol reductive stress (DTT 5mM) on M.tb Rv was studied.

DESIGN
DTT reduced at 5 mM concentration was added to log pahse culture of M.tb H37Rv. After 3 hours RNA was isolated and  hybridization was done on  Affym Affymetrix microarrays.
