TITLE
Interpreting reverse transcriptase termination and mutation events for greater insight into the chemical probing of RNA

SUMMARY
Chemical probing has the power to provide insight into RNA conformation in vivo and in vitro, but interpreting the results depends on methods to detect the chemically modified nucleotides. Traditionally, the presence of modified bases was inferred from their ability to halt reverse transcriptase during primer extension and the locations of termination sites observed by electrophoresis or sequencing. More recently, modification-induced mutations have been used as a readout for chemical probing data. Given variable propensity for mismatch incorporation and read-through with different reverse transcriptases, we examined how termination and mutation events compare to each other in the same chemical probing experiments. We found that mutations and terminations induced by dimethyl sulfate probing are both specific for methylated bases, but these two measures have surprisingly little correlation and represent largely non-overlapping indicators of chemical modification data. We also show that specific biases for modified bases depend partly on local sequence context, and that different reverse transcriptases show different biases toward reading a modification as a stop or a mutation. These results support approaches that incorporate analysis of both termination and mutation events into RNA probing experiments.

DESIGN
Chemical probing using dimethylsulfate reactivity with structured RNAs Xist and 18S in mouse, with analysis of modification induced reverse transcriptase mutations or stops. This series contains only 18S samples.
