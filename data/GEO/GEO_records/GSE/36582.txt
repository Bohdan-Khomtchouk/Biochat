TITLE
Expression data from middle-aged and old Drosophila females

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The mechanisms underlying natural variation in lifespan and ageing rate remain largely unknown. We performed microarray experiment to characterise genome-wide expression patterns of a long-lived, natural variant of Drosophila melanogaster resulting from selection for starvation resistance (SR) and compare it with normal-lived control flies (C).

DESIGN
We sampled adult females at two time points representing middle age (90% survival) and old age (10% survival) respectively, in three adult diets (malnutrition, optimal food, and overfeeding).
