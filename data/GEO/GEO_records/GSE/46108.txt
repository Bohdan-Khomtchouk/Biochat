TITLE
Identification of transcripts bound by an RNA binding protein (RBP) in early erythroid progenitor using RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray (RIP-Chip) experiment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Early erythroid progenitors were isolated from mouse E14.5 fetal liver. After cell lysing, control IgG or RBP specific antibody were incubated with cell lysis. Immunoprecipitation followed by microarray experiments were carried out to identify transcripts that are immunoprecipitated by either control IgG or RBP specific antibody.

DESIGN
Examination of transcripts that are immunoprecipitated by either control IgG or RBP specific antibody in primary mouse early erythroid progenitor
