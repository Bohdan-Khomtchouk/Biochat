TITLE
Effects of Evi1 knockdown and overexpression in SKOV-3 ovarian carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the variations of mRNA amounts after Evi1 knockdown or Flag-Evi1 overexpression in SKOV-3 cells. Despites Evi1 discovery in 1988, its recognized role as a dominant oncogene in myeloid leukemia and more recently in epithelial cancers, only a few target genes were known and it was not clear why Evi1 was involved in cancer progression. Here we obtained the genomic binding occupancy and expression data for Evi1 in human ovarian carcinoma cells. We identified numerous Evi1 target cancer genes and genes controlling cell migration and adhesion. Moreover, we characterized a transcriptional cooperation between AP1 and Evi1 that regulated proliferation and adhesion through a feed-forward loop. Furthermore, this study provides human genome-wide mapping and downstream analyses for Evi1 that will be useful for the research community.

DESIGN
16 samples were collected. Each condition was done in 4 replicates, collected 65 hours after transfection. Transfections with control siRNA or Flag-expressing vector were used as controls.
