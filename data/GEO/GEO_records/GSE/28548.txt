TITLE
The effect of sirtuin 6 overexpression on TNFa stimulation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SIRT6 has been implicated in a range of biological processes including inflammation, aging and the control of metabolism. Hence inhibitors or activators of SIRT6 have the potential to be therapeutics for a number of indications. Genome wide expression studies were used to investigate the effect of overexpression of SIRT6 and mutant SIRT6 on a wide range of NFÎºB dependent gene expression
