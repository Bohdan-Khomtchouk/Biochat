TITLE
The effect of sirtuin 6 overexpression on TNFa stimulation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SIRT6 has been implicated in a range of biological processes including inflammation, aging and the control of metabolism. Hence inhibitors or activators of SIRT6 have the potential to be therapeutics for a number of indications. Genome wide expression studies were used to investigate the effect of overexpression of SIRT6 and mutant SIRT6 on a wide range of NFκB dependent gene expression

DESIGN
HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding wild type SIRT6 or the H133W mutant followed by stimulation with TNFα for one hour.
