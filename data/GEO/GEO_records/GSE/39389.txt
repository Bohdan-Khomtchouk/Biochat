TITLE
Expression data of wild type, dDP mutant, and de2f1, deleted in the posterior, Drosophila 3rd instar larval eye imaginal discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Apoptosis is an important process to eliminate cells from tissue which have incurred irreparable DNA damage. While dE2F1/dDP complexes respond to such damage by transcriptionally activating apoptotic genes, previous data suggests that activation of the previously characterized apoptotic target genes of dE2F1/dDP alone may not be the only gene regulation important for gamma irradiation-induced apoptosis. Here we report that following irradiation in dDP mutant 3rd instar larval eye imaginal discs, many genes important for oxidative phosphorylation are down-regulated, which are not down-regulated following irradiation in wild type eye discs.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates of wild type, dDP mutant and de2f1, deleted in the posterior, eye discs were untreated or irradiated with 40Gy of gamma radiation. Total RNA was extracted by Trizol from untreated eye discs and from irradiated eye discs 4h after irradiation. RNA was column purified. PCR amplified RNAs were hybridized on Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 Array.
