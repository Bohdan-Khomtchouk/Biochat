TITLE
Expression data from the mammary gland of ovariectomized (ovx) rats treated for three days with E2, 3-MC, E2+3-MC

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Crosstalk between Aryl hydrocarbonreceptor (AHR) and Estrogen receptor (ER) is poorly understood, but seems to play a major role in female reproductive organs. The study was designed to see the overall gene-expression change in the mammary gland induced by AHR ligand 3-MC alone and in combination with E2.

DESIGN
Rats were treated with vehicle control (DMSO), 17Î²-Estradiol (E2), 3-Methylcholanthrene (3-MC) or E2+3-MC for 48 h.  Mammary glands were obtained 24 h after the last treatment. 3 biological samples from three rats were analyzed for each treatment group .
