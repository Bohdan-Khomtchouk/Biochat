TITLE
Expresion analyses of red1∆

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in red1∆, compared to the wild-type strain.

DESIGN
A chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate wild-type cultures of fission yeast and two separate red1∆ cultures of fission yeast.  Each chip measures the expression level of 1997 genes from S.pombe with fourteen 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with seven-fold technical redundancy.
