TITLE
Microarray analysis of genes impacted by 5 day knockdown of SLC24A5 in normal human melanocytes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A major development in pigmentation research was the discovery of the involvement of SLC24A5 in natural variation in skin colour. This study used Agilent whole-genome microarrays to examine the impact of SLC24A5 knockdown on the transcriptome of normal human melanocytes derived from lightly and darkly pigmented donors.
