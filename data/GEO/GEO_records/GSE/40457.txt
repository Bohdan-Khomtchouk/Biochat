TITLE
Transgenerational profiling of small non-coding RNAs in C.elegans RSD mutants

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Attempt to identify progressive changes in small non-coding RNA levels in C.elegans lacking RSD-2 or RSD-6.

DESIGN
Small non-coding RNA (18-30nt) was extracted from animals the indicated number of generations after homozygosity was established

PLATFORM
GPL13657 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Caenorhabditis elegans)
