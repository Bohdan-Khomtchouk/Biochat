TITLE
Expression profiling after ICAP1 or constitutive active NOTCH1 over expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ICAP1 (also known as ITG1BP1) is a protein interaction partner of beta1-integrins and the cerebral cavernous malformation protein 1 (CCM1, also known as KRIT1). In mice Icap1 plays an important role for bone development. The function of ICAP1 in endothelial cells is poorly understood. However, the interactions with beta1-integrins and CCM1 suggest that ICAP1 should play an important role also in endothelial cells. We obtained data that ICAP1 might activate the Delta-Notch signaling cascade, a critical regulator of endothelial proliferation, migration and sprouting angiogenesis. This genome-wide expression analysis is aimed to unravelling novel mechanisms or signaling pathways how ICAP1 functions in endothelial cells. Secondly, this study aimed at defining novel target genes of Notch signaling and finally to compare the gene expression patterns of ICAP1 and NOTCH1. We used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as a model system to study ICAP1 and NOTCH1 functions after adenoviral over expression in comparison to GFP over expression as control. The results of this experiment suggest that ICAP1 and NOTCH1 control a series of genes involved in cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. A high proportion of ICAP1-regulated genes is also regulated by NOTCH1 in a very similar manner.

DESIGN
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were transduced with adenovirus expressing ICAP1, NOTCH1 (only the constitutive active intracellular domain) or GFP as control. 36 hours after transduction total RNA was isolated from duplicates for genome-wide expression analysis biological replicate: GFP_1, GFP_2 biological replicate: NOTCH1_1, NOTCH1_2 biological replicate: ICAP1_1, ICAP1_2
