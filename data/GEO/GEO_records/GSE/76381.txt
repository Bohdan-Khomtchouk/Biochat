TITLE
Single Cell RNA-seq Study of Midbrain and Dopaminergic Neuron Development in Mouse, Human, and Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to get a better molecular understanding of human midbrain development, this study defines cell types of the ventral midbrain in both human and mouse as well as stem cell-derived dopaminergic neuron preparations, and reveals the temporal dynamics of key lineages across development and the adult.

DESIGN
Single cells according to Samples list consisting of: Human embryo ventral midbrain cells between 6 and 11 weeks of gestation, mouse ventral midbrain cells at six developmental stages between E11.5 to E18.5, Th+ neurons at P19-P27, and putative dopaminergic neurons at P28-P56 FACS-sorted from Slc6a3-Cre/tdTomato mice. Stem cells (iPSCs and ESCs) preparation at different stages of differentiation towards Th+ neurons.
