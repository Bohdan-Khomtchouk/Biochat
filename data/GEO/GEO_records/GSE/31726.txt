TITLE
Expression analysis of G9C8 clone and NOD.G9C8 tg CTLs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Diabetogenic CD8+ G9C8 clone cells and the T cells from a transgenic mouse bearing the same TCR as the clone, displayed differences in their ability to induce disease in vivo.Microarray analysis was done to identify the molecular basis for  such differences between the two sets of CD8 T cells. Microarray analysis was done to identify the molecular basis for such differences between the two sets of CD8 T cells

DESIGN
3 vials of frozen G9C8 clone cells and spleen cells from 2 NOD.G9C8 transgenic mice were similarly peptide stimulated for 3 days and rested in IL2 for 2 days in order to obtain uniformly activated cells for analysis.
