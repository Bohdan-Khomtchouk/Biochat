TITLE
Isolated Blood Immune Cell Transcriptomics in COPD

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We observed separation of COPD patients from control smokers by CD4+ T cell transcriptomics.   In contrast to CD4+ T cells, there were no transcript differences in whole blood, CD8+ T cells or  CD14+ monocytes.

DESIGN
We examined transcripts of CD4+ T cells (n=79), CD8+ T cells (n=75) and CD14+ T cells (n=75) isolated from the whole blood of subjects.  The control group were smokers without COPD.  We examined differences between COPD and controls.
