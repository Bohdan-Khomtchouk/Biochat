TITLE
Gene expression profiles of MCF7 breast cancer cells following estrogen and anti-estrogen treatment.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have previously demonstrated that endoxifen is the most important tamoxifen metabolite responsible for eliciting the anti-estrogenic effects of this drug in breast cancer cells expressing estrogen receptor-alpha. The goals of this study were to compare the gene expression profiles elicited by endoxifen to that of other anti-estrogens in MCF7 cells.  We also examined the gene expression profiles elicited by various endoxifen concentrations in the presence of tamoxifen and its other primary metabolites in order to better understand the molecular contributions of endoxifen to the effects of tamoxifen.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from parental MCF7 cells following 24 hour treatments with various individual or combined ligands.  All studies were conducted in replicates of 3.
