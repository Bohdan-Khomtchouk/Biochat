TITLE
Global gene expression of Arabidopsis lines with altered ANAC102 expression under normal and low oxygen conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Global gene expression was compared between Arabidopsis lines with altered expression of ANAC102 (over-expressed and knocked-out) and wild-type. ANAC102 is a putative NAC domain transcription factor. Gene expression was compared between an ANAC102 over-expressing line and parental ecotype C24 under ambient atmosphere to determine which genes ANAC102 is capable of regulating. Gene expression was also compared between three week old plants of an ANAC102 knock-out line and parental ecotype Col-0 under 0.1% Oxygen and ambient atmosphere conditions to determine which genes may require ANAC102 for appropriate expression under these conditions. Gene expression was also compared between imbibed seeds of an ANAC102 knock-out line and parental ecotype Col-0 following a 0.1% Oxygen treatment. Keywords: Genetic modification
