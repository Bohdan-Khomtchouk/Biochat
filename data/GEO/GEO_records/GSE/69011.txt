TITLE
Expression data of  CD117+ splenocytes from C57BL/6 WT and RasGRP4 KO mice upon LPS stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RasGRP4 is required for CD117+  DCs to optimally induce certain NK cell-dependent immune responses in vivo and in vitro in response to LPSRasGRP4 expressed in DCs played an important role on NK cell IFN-Î³ secretion . We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated or down-regulated  genes between the two  DCs from WT  and RasGRP4 mice respectively upon LPS stimulation.

DESIGN
CD117+splenocytes were extracted from WT and RasGRP4 KO mice spleens aged 9-12 weeks  and plated in 6-well plates with 1ug/mL of LPS for 0h,6h,12h,24h and 48h repectively for  RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  Time course.
