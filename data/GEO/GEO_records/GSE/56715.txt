TITLE
Cytomegalovirus promotes maintenance and growth of glioblastoma stem cells [Human gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human GBM stem like cells were infected with HCMV TR strain (MOI=1) and treated with IE siRNA (a combination of oligos targeting IE1 and IE2 HCMV genes) 72 hours following siRNA treatment, RNA was harvested using Qiagen and divided equally for profiling using Affymetrix arrays and HCMV arrays.

DESIGN
Primary human glioma stem cells were maintained in neurosphere growth conditions, treated with IE1 and control siRNA for 48-72h prior to RNA harvesting. RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Genechips.

PLATFORM
