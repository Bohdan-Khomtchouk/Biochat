TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation map of Zebrafish male and female brain

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Using 2 male and 2 female zebrafish (pool of 6) brain samples, we generated base-resolution DNA methylation maps to document sex-specific epigenetic differences.

DESIGN
Here we generated single-nucleotide resoultion DNA methylation map of 4 zebrafish brain samples using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS)

PLATFORM
GPL14875 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Danio rerio)
