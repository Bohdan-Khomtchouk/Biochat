TITLE
Expression data of gastric cancer by conventional microarray and by suppressive subtractive hybridization coupled to microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of gastric tumors compared to paired adjacent non-tumoral gastric tissue by two strategies. The first strategy is a conventional microarray assay, while the second strategy involves a previous Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) followed by a conventional microarray assay. We applied subtractive hybridization followed by microarray analysis to identify tumor-specific low-abundance transcripts. The goal was to determine differences in gene expression profile in tumor samples by both strategies.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: tumoral vs. adjacent non-tumoral tissues. Biological replicates: 12 tumoral replicates, 12 non-tumoral replicates. The same replicates were used for both strategies (conventional, SSH). Human Universal Reference RNA (Clontech) was used as the reference.
