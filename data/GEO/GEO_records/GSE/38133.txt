TITLE
TGF-beta1 effect on human osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in human osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS treated by TGF-beta1 for three days (mesophase) and five days (sarcospheres iOSCs), compared to non-treatment cells (residual adherent cells).

DESIGN
A three chip study using total RNA cover from three cultures of non-treatment human osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS (residual adherent cells),  TGF-beta1 treated three days osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS (mesophase) and TGF-beta1 treated five days osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS ( only collected the suspending sarcospheres iOSCs). Each chip measures the expression level of 45033 genes from osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS.
