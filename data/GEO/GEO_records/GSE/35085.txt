TITLE
Transcriptome changes following castration of Korean cattle bulls in longissimus dorsi muscle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Transcripome of longissimus dorsi muscle was compared between Korean cattle bulls and steers by using a customized bovine Combimatrix microarray containing 10,199 genes.

DESIGN
A customized bovine Combimatrix microarray containing 10,199 genes were constructed, and transcripome of longissimus dorsi muscle was compared between Korean cattle bulls (3 bulls) and steers (3 high-marbled and 3 low-marbled steers) by using the microarray hybridzation.
