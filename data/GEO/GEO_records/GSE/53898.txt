TITLE
Microarray analysis of the Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) gonads

ORGANISM
Lates calcarifer

SUMMARY
In this study, we attempt to characterize the transcriptomic profile of the Asian seabass gonads at various developmental stages. The protandric Asian seabass or barramundi (Lates calcarifer) typically matures as a male at approximately 2â€“4 years of age and then changes sex to a female in later years. For this experiment, Asian seabass of several ages were collected from the Marine Aquaculture Center of the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore and from farms around Singapore. There were no treatments carried out in this experiment. The gonads were examined by histology and classified according to sexual maturation status as described by Guiguen and colleagues (Guiguen et al. Environmental Biology of Fishes, 1994). Altogether, we analyzed 22 gonadal samples that could be classified into six different types of gonads.

DESIGN
Total 22 samples: Adult Ovaries (F3-stage; 5 years old fish) : 4 Adult Testes (M3-stage; 5 years old fish) : 4 Early Testes (M3-stage; 8-9 months old fish) : 3 Early Transforming Gonads ( > 2 years old fish) : 3 Late Transforming Gonads ( > 2 years old fish) : 4 Undifferentiated Gonads (4.5 months old fish) : 4
