TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of 22Rv1 and its metastatic derivatives

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metastasis of prostate cancer lacks effective curatives and results in significant mortality in men worldwide. Here, we developed highly metastatic cells from 22 Rv1 cell line and characterized these sublines as exhibiting high invasion capacity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and stem cell-like properties. To understand the molecular signature causally related to these phenotypes, cDNA microarray was applied to compare 22Rv1 with the metastatic sublines for differential gene expression.

DESIGN
22Rv1 cells were subjected to in vivo propagation to develop their metastases. Total RNA obtained from 22Rv1 and 22Rv1-derived metastases were analyzed compared.
