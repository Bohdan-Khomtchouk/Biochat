TITLE
Expression data from HIF1A WT vs KD Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCK strain II cells (ATCC:CCL-34)) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
The expression of TGFbeta pathway genes were downregulated in HIF1A KD Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCKII) in hypoxic condition. We used microarray to study the differential expression of genes in HIF1A knockdown versus WT Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCKII)

DESIGN
Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCKII) were incubated 24h in normoxic condition then additionally were incubated 24h in normoxic or hypoxic conditions and total RNA was extracted for microarray analysis.
