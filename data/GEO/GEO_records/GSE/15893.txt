TITLE
Gene expression pattern in CXCR4+ and CXCR4- subpopulation of breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify signaling molecules downstream of CXCR4 in breast cancer cells. For this purpose, we sorted CXCR4-positive and CXCR4-negative cells from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line by flow cytometry and performed microarrays analysis.

DESIGN
Three sets of samples, each in quadrupicate, were analyzed. These include CXCR4-positive subpopulation, CXCR4-positive subpopulation treated with SDF-1 (ligand for CXCR4, also called CXCL12) for one hour and CXCR4-negative subpopulation.
