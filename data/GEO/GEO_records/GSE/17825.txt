TITLE
Murine fracture healing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Time-point expression analysis of fractures calluses at 1, 3, and 5 days post-fracture in young and old BALB/c mice.

DESIGN
Femur fractures were generated on female c57BI6 mice in triplicate: 8 month old retired breeders (old mice) and 6 week old mice (young mice) were used. 1, 3, and 5 days post-fracture, fracture calluses were dissected and total RNA isolated. Expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix's Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array.
