TITLE
Expression data of an albino mutant DS 13-2198-1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The effect Ds insertion mutation in Ds13-2198-1 line on the gene expression profiles was investigated. The genes for photosynthesis and some transcriptional factors were upregulated while genes for metabolism were downregulated. Keywords: strain comparison

DESIGN
To investigate the effect of an strong albino mutation, the genome wide gene expression profiles of plants were examined. Segregants with normal phenotype and albino phenotype obtained from the heterotalic parental line were grown on the same 1/2 MS plate for 3 weeks.
