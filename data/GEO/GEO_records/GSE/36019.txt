TITLE
Gene expression profiles in lymph nodes from ferrets infected with A/California/07/2009

ORGANISM
Mustela putorius furo

SUMMARY
Pandemic H1N1 influenza A Human infection leads to symptoms ranging from mild to severe with lower respiratory complications observed in a small but significant number of infected individuals. Microarray analysis of the lymph nodes from ferrets infected with A/California/07/2009 shows intense gene upregulation during days 3 and 5 post-infection, and followed by marked downregulation during days 7 and 14 post infection. Gene expression profiles during the upregulation phase show intense chemokine activity, cell replication and activation of the lymphocyte-related signaling pathways.

DESIGN
15 ferrets were randomly allocated to 5 groups: Day 0 (before infection), and Day 3, 5, 7 and 14 (post infection) with 3 biological replicates for each group. Infection was performed with 10E6 EID50 of influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1). Ferrets were euthanized and lymph nodes were excised for RNA purification on the scheduled date. The subsequent gene expression analysis was performed with Affymetrix GeneChip Canine Genome 2.0 Array. Day 0 groups were used as control.
