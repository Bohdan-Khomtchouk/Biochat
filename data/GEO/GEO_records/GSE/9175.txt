TITLE
Eye primordia vs. posterior neural plate vs. lateral endoderm normalized the whole embryos

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Tissues from the eye primordia, lateral endoderm, and posterior neural plate of stage 15 Xenopus laevis embryos were isolated and normalized to stage 15 whole embryos. Three biological replicates were prepared for each tissue and the expression patterns were profiled using Affymetrix Xenopus Laevis GeneChip microarrays. Keywords: Three way comparison of Embryonic Tissue Isolation
