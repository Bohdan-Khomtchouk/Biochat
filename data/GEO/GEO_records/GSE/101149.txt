TITLE
Microarray expression data from leukemia cell lines RS4;11 and REH with CASC15 KD or KO respectively

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs play a variety of cellular roles, including regulation of transcription and translation, leading to alterations in gene expression. Here, we assess the role of lncRNA CASC15 in RUNX1/AML translocated leukemia. Differentially regulated genes following CASC15 knockdown were enriched for predicted transcriptional targets of the Yin and Yang-1 (YY1) transcription factor. Our findings represent the first characterization of this CASC15 in RUNX1-translocated leukemia, and point towards a mechanistic basis for its action. We used microarrays to look at significantly differentally expressed genes and global effectes upon knockdown of knockout of CASC15 in two different leukemia cell lines

DESIGN
RS4,11 cells were transduced with an empty vector (control) or with siRNAs (1, 2, 3) against CASC15. After confirmation of successful knockdown one replicate of each line was used. REH cells were transduced with an empty vector (control) or with a pair of guide RNAs against exon 1 and exon 9 of CASC15 (C1,9). After confirmation of successful knockout three replicates of each line was used. Cell lines were harvested for RNA extraction, DNAse treatment, and hybridization on Affymetrix HG-U133_Plus_2 microarrays.
