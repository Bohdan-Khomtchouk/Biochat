TITLE
Promoter context-specific positive and negative transcriptional regulation of Glucocorticoid Receptor target genes by coregulator GLP.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A549 lung cancer cells were not infected (NI), transfected by plasmids containing shGLP (sequence targeting GLP gene) or shNS (non-specific sequence). These cells were treated with dex to identify subsets of genes regulated by dex (hormone) and GLP (EHMT1). NI and shNS data were submitted on the GSE35962.

DESIGN
Cells (NI/shNS/shGLP) were treated with 100nM dex for 24h and total RNA was extracted to identiy differentially expressed genes.
