TITLE
Combinatory microarray and SuperSAGE analyses identify pairing-dependently transcribed genes in Schistosoma mansoni males, such as follistatin [Microarray]

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of  S. mansoni pairing-experienced males (EM)  vs. pairing unexperienced males (UM)

DESIGN
Two conditions (EM vs. UM) with three biological samples of EM and in parallel other three biological samples of UM. For each sample (three EM and three UM) were performed four technical replicas.
