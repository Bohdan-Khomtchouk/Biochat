TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression changes upon overexpression of activated Thickveins in the Drosophila wing at larval vs. pupal stages

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression changes in dissected Drosophila wings at the wandering L3 larval stage and 24h after pupa formation, expressing UAS-activated Thickveins Q-D under control of apterous-gal4 with a tubulin driven temperature sensitive gal80 transgene, compared to the parental strain lacking the UAS-Thickveins transgene

DESIGN
A 20 chip study using total RNA recovered from five independently isolated samples of 10 dissected Drosophila wings at the indicated developmental stages expressing UAS-activated thickveins or the non-UAS containing matched control strain.

PLATFORM
GPL13782 NimbleGen Drosophila melanogaster Gene expression array [DM4_3_60mer_expr]
