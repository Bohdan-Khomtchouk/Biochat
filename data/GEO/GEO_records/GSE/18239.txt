TITLE
Expression data from JAK1 wild-type and JAK1 mutation-positive T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia blasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant signal transduction contributes substantially to leukemogenesis. The Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) gene encodes a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that noncovalently associates with a variety of cytokine receptors and plays a nonredundant role in lymphoid cell precursor proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Somatic mutations in JAK1 occur in individuals with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). JAK1 mutations were more prevalent among adult subjects with the T cell precursor ALL, where they accounted for 18% of cases, and were associated with advanced age at diagnosis, poor response to therapy, and overall prognosis We used microarray to compare the gene expression profile of JAK1 mutation positive or negative ALL blasts

DESIGN
Thawed or freshly isolated T-ALL cells ( > 90% blasts) were homogenized, total RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays
