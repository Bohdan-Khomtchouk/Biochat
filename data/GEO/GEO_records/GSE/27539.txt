TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of arabinose fermentation by engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Saccharomyces cerevisiae IMS0002 which, after metabolic and evolutionary engineering, ferments the pentose sugar arabinose. Glucose and arabinose-limited anaerobic chemostat cultures of IMS0002 and its non-evolved ancestor IMS0001 were subjected to transcriptome analysis to identify key genetic changes contributing to efficient arabinose utilization by strain IMS0002.

DESIGN
Glucose- and arabinose limited anaerobic chemostat cultivation of strains IMS0002 and glucose limited IMS0001 at D= 0.03 h-1
