TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of parental and wild-type SK-N-Be(2)C neuroblastoma cell lines as well as those co-treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of varied biologic pathways in neuroblastoma SK-N-Be(2)C cells grown in doxorubicin and/or SAHA. We hypothesized that SK-N-Be(2)C cells undergo a mesenchymal change through mesenchymal change resulting in a more invasive as well as drug resistant phenotype, and that the mechanism of SAHAs effect on drug resistance may be revealed through this analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from wild type, SAHA treated wild type cells, doxorubicin resistant, and SAHA treated doxorubicin resistant SK-N-Be(2)C cell lines in triplicate.
