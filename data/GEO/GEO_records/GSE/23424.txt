TITLE
Differentially expressed genes at molting and metamorphosis stages in Bombyx fat body

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
In the silkworm, Bombyx mori, juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) levels are high during the final larval molt (4M) but both absent during the feeding stage of 5th instar (5F), while JH level is low and 20E level is high during the prepupal stage (PP). Fat body is the important organs in insect, we want to find out differentially expressed genes which are respectively regulated by the two hormones.
