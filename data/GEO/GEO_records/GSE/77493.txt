TITLE
Genome wide map of  long noncoding RNA Tug1 binding sites in cultured mouse podocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated a genome wide map of instances where the long noncoding RNA, Tug1, binds to DNA in cultured mouse podocytes under normal glucose conditions using Chromatin-RNA Precipitation coupled with high throughput sequencing (ChIRP-Seq)

DESIGN
48 alternating (even, odd) biotynilated probes were designed to span the full length of Tug1 RNA. Chromatin was prepared from gluteraldehyde crosslinked nuclei from early passage podocytes. Chromatin extracts were duplicated with either even or odd probes. Duplicate samples for Input DNA, Even pulldown (PD) and Odd PD DNA was purified following incubation and supplied for Illumina sequencing by ArrayStar (Rockville, MD).

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
