TITLE
Genome-wide maps of CD14-dependent and CD14-independent bladder innate immune responses to UPEC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report a transcriptional response in the mouse bladder that encompasses multiple innate immune networks not previously associated with CD14. Major CD14-dependent pathways included immune cell trafficking, differential cytokine production in macrophages, and IL-17 signaling

DESIGN
We used RNA-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of innate immune responses in mouse bladder and the role of CD14 in these responses

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
