TITLE
mRNA microarray analysis on young adult Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to benzene, toluene, formaldehyde and a BTF mix

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In order to evaluate the identification of genes and pathways, the global gene expression profiles were assessed in response to three chemicals (benzene (B), toluene (T), formaldehyde (F)) individually and as a BTF mix on the soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. We performed whole genome DNA microarray experiments with subsequent quantitative analysis conducted on selected genes.

DESIGN
We used synchronized C. elegans populations exposed to B, T, F or a BTF mix, and whole genome microarrays to screen for global changes in C. elegans transcription profiles. Young adults of C. elegans were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
