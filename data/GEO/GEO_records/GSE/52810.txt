TITLE
The effect of miR196a of overall gene expression in oral keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We wished to assess the effect of miR196a on overall gene expression in reducing it in high expressing epithelial cells (D19 and B16) using antimiR196a and over expressing it in low-expressing cells (OKF4) using pre-miR196a.  We transfected anti miR196a in to D19 and B16 oral keratinocytes which express high levels of miR196a in triplicate cultures, harvesting 24h after transfection.  We transfected pre-miR196 in okf4 immorualised normal oral keratinocytes in duplicate culture. Successful transfection was ensured by qPCR.

DESIGN
16 Samples in total. 2 high expressing cells: control and anti-miR transfected, in triplicate. 1 low expressing cell: control and premiR transfected, in duplicate
