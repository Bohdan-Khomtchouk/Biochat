TITLE
Identification of Arabidopsis thaliana PRR9 regulated clock components and circadian outputs through genome-wide binding sites analysis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We identified genome-wide PRR9 targets by conducting chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing.

DESIGN
Plants were grown in cycling 12 h light/12 h dark for two weeks before harvesting at ZT4.  The four samples include the immunoprecipitated and input control for prr9-1 PRR9::HA-PRR9 CCR2::LUC #109 (HA9) and the prr9-1 (s9c) parental control. PRR5 PRR7 and TOC1 raw data available from the following Series: PRR5: GSE36361 TOC1: GSE35952 PRR7: GSE49282 (GSM1196649 and GSM1196650)

PLATFORM
GPL17639 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
