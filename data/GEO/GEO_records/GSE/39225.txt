TITLE
Chip-chip investigation of the effcts of phthalate plastisizers on fetal rat testes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
ChIP microarrays were used to investigate whether dibutylphthalate (DBP)-mediated repression of SF1-regulated genes was associated with changes in transcription factor binding to genes involved in DBP-induced testicular maldevelopment. The repressive effect of DBP on SF1 regulated gene expression in fetal testes correlates with inhibition of SF1 binding to steroidogenic gene promoters.

DESIGN
Comparison of control- and DBP- in utero 500mg/Kg treated fetal rat testes
