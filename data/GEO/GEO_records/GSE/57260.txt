TITLE
Transcriptome of the NWMN_0641 deletion mutant strain and the wild-type Staphylococcus aureus Newman strain

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus str. Newman

SUMMARY
To study the roles of NWMN_0641, we used microarray to compare the transcriptome of the NWMN_0641 deletion strain with that of the wild-type Staphylococcus aureus Newman strain. Transcriptome of the NWMN_0641 deletion mutant strain and the wild-type Newman strain

DESIGN
We sought to obtain the transcriptomes of the NWMN_0641 deletion mutant strain and the wild-type Newman strain when bacteria were grown TSB medium (without glucose)

PLATFORM
GPL1339 [S_aureus] Affymetrix S. aureus Genome Array
