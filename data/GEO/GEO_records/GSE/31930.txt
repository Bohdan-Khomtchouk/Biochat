TITLE
Mechanism of lacritin-dependent production of the important dry eye mucin 'MUC16'

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lacritin targets its coreceptor 'syndecan-1' in lacritin-dependent production of the important dry eye mucin 'MUC16'.  Real-time PCR analysis suggests that this effect is post-transcriptional.  In contrast, serum stimulation of MUC16 by these cells is transcriptionally dependent.  Our goal is to determine whether this regulation is global to other heavily O-glycosylated proteins, and if so, if it is dependent on transcription of a Golgi glycosyltransferases.  If not, the mechanism might be microRNA dependent.

DESIGN
Among other glycogenes, expression of heparanases, sulfotransferases and epimerase are also of interest.  Heparanase is required for lacritin binding to its co-receptor syndecan-1 and this binding site may require a sulfated iduronic acid.  In request 1705, we recently asked core D whether they could generate this sulfate iduronic acid-containing glycan (iduronic acid (2-O-sulfated)-N-acetylglucosamine-glucuronic acid-N-acetylglucosamine-[glucuronic acid-N-acetylglucosamine]5-glucuronic acid-galactose-galactose-SERINE) to test as a competitive inhibitor in binding studies. Our experiment is to compare Glyco-gene expression by human corneal epithelial cells in response to cell communication glycoprotein 'lacritin' versus negative control deletion construct 'C-25 lacritin' and versus positive control serum.
