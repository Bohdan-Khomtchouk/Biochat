TITLE
Hydrogen cyanamide breaks grapevine bud dormancy in the summer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis revealed specific alterations in gene expression in dormancy breaking buds induced by pruning (P), hydrogen cyanamide (HC), pruning plus hydrogen cyanamide (PHC) after 24 h of treatment. PHC treatment altered the expression of the largest number of genes and rapid accumulation of a sublethal level of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species subsequently induces cell wall loosening and expansion for bud sprouting
