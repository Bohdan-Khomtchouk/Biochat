TITLE
Gene expression profile upon forced Notch1 activation in LS174T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cell line was modified to express  activated form of Notch1 (NICD1 of mouse origin) upon Doxycycline addition to the culture medium. Generation was performed by using the T-rex system (invitrogen), following manufacturer's instruction. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Pulse-chase experiment, examining expression profile at 0h, 12h, 24h from Doxycycline addition. For details, please refer to our publication (American Journal of Physiology GI and Liver disease, e-pub at Nov 20th, 2008)
