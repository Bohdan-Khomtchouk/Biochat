TITLE
human primary monocytes: Control vs. oxLDL(oxidized low density lipoprotein)-stimulated 6h vs oxLDL-stimulated 12h

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
total RNA profiling of human primary monocytes comparing control untreated oxLDL cells with oxLDL cells for different time (6h and 12h),  The latter makes monocytes to macrophage and foam cells.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, human primary monocytes control vs oxLDL stimulated 6h  vs oxLDL stimulated 12h . Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 oxLDL stimulated 6h, 3 oxLDL stimulated 12h, independently grown and harvested. seven replicate per array.
