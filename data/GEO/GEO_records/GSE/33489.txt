TITLE
Shared and unique components of human population structure and genome-wide signals of positive selection in South Asia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the population genetic structure and genome-wide signals of positive selection we carried out Illumina genotyping for 142 individuals of Sout Asian origin

DESIGN
142 samples are analysed on thwo different Illumina platforms. 48 of them with  Human610-Quad v 1.0 are described herein. 142 samples are analysed on thwo different Illumina platforms. 94 of them with  HumanHap650Yv3_A are described herein.
