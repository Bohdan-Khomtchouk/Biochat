TITLE
Copy number variation analysis of human Barrett's esophagus stem cells (HumanOmniZhongHua-8 v1.1 Beadchip)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Barrett’s esophagus confers significant risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. We have established the cloning system of patient-matched stem cells of Barrett’s esophagus and  gastric cardia. Barrett's esophagus (BE) stem cells and gastric cardia (GC) stem cells from 12 patients were cloned.  To analyze copy number variation in BE and GC stem cells, we have performed SNP array.   It has shown that deletions such as p16 and FHIT in BE stem cells are significantly detected, while amplifications in BE stem cells are not. Also, we found some of BE stem cells did not share these deletions, suggesting emerging of BE does not require specific CNV.

DESIGN
SNP array based copy number variation study was performed for BE and GC stem cells from human endoscopic biopsy (12 patients) to assess genomic stability at chromosomal level.
