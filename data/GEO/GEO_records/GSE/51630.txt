TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of hormone-receptor-negative primary breast tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA was extracted from FFPE samples of 139 chemotherapy-na√Øve hormone-receptor-negative breast cancers pooled from three sample sources and assayed for the expression of 21 genes within two previously reported microarray-derived prognostic signatures in 6 RT-PCR multiplexes.

DESIGN
RT-PCR gene expression profiling. Total RNA was extracted from 10 micron FFPE sections, and expression levels of the 21 genes of interest plus two reference genes were quantified with 6 multiplex RT-PCR TaqMan assays.
