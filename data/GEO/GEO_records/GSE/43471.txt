TITLE
Gene expression changes in adipose tissue with diet- and/or exercise-induced weight loss

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An ancillary study within a randomized trial of diet, exercise, or combined diet+exercise vs. control among overweight/obese postmenopausal women. Subcutaneous adipose-tissue biopsies were performed at baseline and after 6 months and changes in adipose-tissue gene expression were determined by microarray with an emphasis on pre-specified candidate pathways, as well as by unsupervised clustering. Analyses were conducted first by randomization group, and then by degree of weight change at 6-months in all women combined.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies at baseline and 6 months. A total of 47 women were biopsied and one replicate participant was included for a total of 96 samples.
