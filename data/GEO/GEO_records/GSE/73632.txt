TITLE
Comparative analysis of Rtf1- and PAF1C-regulated genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Paf1 and Ski8 were selected as representative subunits of the Paf1 complex (PAF1C), and RNA-seq analysis was performed in triplicate to compare the genes affected by Paf1, Ski8, and Rtf1 knockdown in HeLa cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from control HeLa and Ski8 knockdown cells at day 4 and from Rtf1 or Paf1 knockdown cells at day 7 and was subjected to RNA-seq in triplicates.
