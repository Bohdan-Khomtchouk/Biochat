TITLE
Time course of MEK inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study used microarray expression analysis to identify global changes in transcript alteration in response to MEK inhibition. Genes under ERK control were identified in a representative V600E BRAF cell line as a function of time following exposure to a small molecule inhibitor of MEK. Keywords: Time course
