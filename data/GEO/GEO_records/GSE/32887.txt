TITLE
Molecular profiling and gene expression analysis in cutaneous sarcoidosis (CS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cutaneous sarcoidosis skin provides relatively non invasive access to granulomatous sarcoidosis tissue.

DESIGN
Twenty participants were enrolled: 15 with active CS and 5 healthy volunteers. Microarray analyses comparing non-LS and healthy volunteer skin with LS showed several thousand genes differentially expressed
