TITLE
Differential gene expression in lymph nodes from rhesus macaque subject to unstable social condition vs. control

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Differences in lymph node gene expression profiles between animals in stable vs. unstable social conditions

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was carried out on lymph node mRNA samples collected from 5 animals subject to unstable social conditions and 5 animals subject to stable social conditions.  The primary research question is whether gene expression differs in lymph nodes from animals exposed to unstable social conditions vs. stable social conditions.
