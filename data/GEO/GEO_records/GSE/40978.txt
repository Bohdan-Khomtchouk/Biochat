TITLE
A long noncoding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An inducible program of inflammatory gene expression is central to antimicrobial defenses. This response is controlled by a collaboration involving signal-dependent activation of transcription factors, transcriptional co-regulators, and chromatin-modifying factors. We have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that acts as a key regulator of this inflammatory response. Pattern recognition receptors such as the Toll-like receptors induce the expression of numerous lncRNAs. One of these, lincRNA-Cox2, mediates both the activation and repression of distinct classes of immune genes. Transcriptional repression of target genes is dependent on interactions of lincRNA-Cox2 with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B and A2/B1. Collectively, these studies unveil a central role of lincRNA-Cox2 as a broad-acting regulatory component of the circuit that controls the inflammatory response

DESIGN
Examination of Mus musculus (C57BL/6 background) gene expression changes following stimulation with Pam3Cys4 in presence or absence of shRNA specifically targetting lncRNA-COX2

PLATFORM
