TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Rapamycin treatment in yeast cells lacking the Ptc1 protein phosphatase.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We are interested in the study of the already reported sensitivity of yeast cells lacking the type 1 protein phosphatase Ptc1 to the drug rapamycin. In order to carry out our studies, we analyzed the changes in the transcription profile that a short-term incubation with rapamycin (200 ng/mL) has in both, wild type and ptc1 cells. It has been shown that inhibition of the TOR pathway by treatment with rapamycin has profound effects on the global transcriptional profile. We confirmed the previously described transcription changes induced by the drug in wild type cells. Under our working conditions rapamycin increased, in wild type cells, at least 2-fold the expression of 667 genes, whereas it decreased the mRNA level of 721 genes (13.8% and 14.9% of genes with measurable expression level, respectively). Gene ontology analysis shows that, as previously documented, many induced genes falls into the NCR, Msn2/Msn4 regulated stress response or Retrograde response categories, whereas genes encoding cytoplasmic, but not mitochondrial, ribosomal proteins and the so called RIBI regulon where largely repressed. Deletion of PTC1 decreases the number of genes induced or repressed at least 2-fold by rapamycin treatment. Remarkably, lack of Ptc1 seems to lead to a general attenuation of changes triggered by rapamycin.
