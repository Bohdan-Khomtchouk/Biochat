TITLE
IAH/VLA VA1 Virus Detection Array Dataset

ORGANISM
Infectious bronchitis virus ; Foot-and-mouth disease virus - type A ; Foot-and-mouth disease virus - type O

SUMMARY
Data from the IAH/VLA diagnostic pathogen/virus detection microarray.  The array platform for this data is GEO accession GPL5725 (provisional), and consists of 5824 oligos representing over 100 viral families, species and subtypes.  The data set itself consists of 12 arrays, 4 hybridised with RNA from cell cultured foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type O, 3 hybridised with RNA from FMDV type A, 1 hybridised with RNA from a sheep infected with FMDV type O, and 4 hybridised with cell-cultured Avian Infectious Bronchitis virus (IBV). Keywords: Virus Detection Microarray
