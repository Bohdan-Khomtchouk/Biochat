TITLE
Human hematopoietic leukemic k562 cells: control Vs CXCR4 constitutively active mutant cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The low homing and engraftment efficiency especially in context of low availability of donor CD34+ HSPCs is a major challenge, which limits the clinical applications of HSC therapies. SDF-1/CXCR4 axis plays a principle role in the homing and engraftment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Activation of CXCR4 induces cell trafficking and homing to the marrow microenvironment, where it retains hematopoietic stem cells in close contact with marrow stromal cells. The aim of our study is to understand the mechanisms of other molecules acting along with CXCR4 to provide new insights in the regulation of cell phenotypes. This data shows the transcriptional profiling of human hematopoetic leukemic k562 cells comparing control, wild type and two different mutant cells where mutant cells have constitutively activated CXCR4 gene expression where mutant 1 and 2 have different aminoacid substituions.

DESIGN
