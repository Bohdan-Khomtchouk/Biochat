TITLE
Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST array analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment accompanies the main analysis using a custom MHC array to define the first high-resolution, strand-specific transcriptional map of the MHC, defining differences in gene expression for three common haplotypes associated with autoimmune disease. Unstimulated samples for each haplotype were hybridised to Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays as well the custom MHC array. Exon array data were used to assess the concordance of signal obtained from the two platforms and to investigate the extent of alternative splicing in the MHC, and how it compares to the rest of the genome.

DESIGN
Lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying three common autoimmunity haplotypes (COX, PGF, QBL) were analysed in triplicate using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array.
