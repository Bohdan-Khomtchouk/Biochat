TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of small RNAs in maize under abiotic stresses

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
To identify novel miRNA and NAT-siRNAs that are associated with abiotic stresses in maize, we generated small RNA sequences from maize seedlings that grew under control and under dought, salt, and cold stress treatments.

DESIGN
Sequencing of small RNAs in maize under control, drought, salt, and cold stress conditions.
