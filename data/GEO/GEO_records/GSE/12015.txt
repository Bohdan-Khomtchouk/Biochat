TITLE
Silicon metabolism in diatoms

ORGANISM
Phaeodactylum tricornutum

SUMMARY
We investigated the effects of extracellular silicic acid on the whole Phaeodactylum triconutum transcriptome. In this work, global transcription analyses were combined with comparative studies of other elements, and detailed analyses of the silicon transporters. Our results provide insight on Si-sensing genes and further extend current models for Si uptake. Keywords: Comparative transcriptome analyses from Phaeodactylum triconutum fusiform cells acclimated in a Si-free or silicic acid medium.
