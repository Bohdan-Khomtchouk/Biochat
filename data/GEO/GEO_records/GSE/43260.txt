TITLE
Expression data from FACS-sorted CD8+BTLA+ vs CD8+BTLA- Human Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes in Metastatic Melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adoptive T-cell Therapy (ACT) involves using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) isolated from metastatic melanoma and expanding them ex vivo prior to infusion into lympho-depleted patients.  This is one of the most promising approaches to treat metastatic melanoma, with the rates of clinical response between 48-50% based on studies done at NCI, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), and Sheba Medical Center (Tel Aviv, Israel). In the Phase II ACT Trial at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center , our group has uncovered an association between positive clinical response and the amount of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes expressing B and T Lymphocyte Attenuator (BTLA), a reported inhibitory receptor on T-cells. We used microarrays to detail the differences in the global programme of gene expression between CD8+BTLA+ vs CD8+BTLA- TILs in order to understand the molecular basis of the clinical association.

DESIGN
TILs were isolated by enzymatically digest the melanoma tumor fragments obtained from Stage IIIc/IV melanoma patients at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.  The TILs were expanded with high-dose IL-2 for two weeks prior to sorting by FACS (fluoresecence-activated cell sorter) for CD8+BTLA+ and CD8+BTLA- susbets.  RNA was extracted from each sorted subsets and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays
