TITLE
Expression analysis data from large T antigen-immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to examine the genome-wide expression in FIH null, VHL null and VHL/FIH double null MEFs. We used these data to analyze how deletion of FIH or VHL alone affects gene expression and if VHL and FIH have synergistic effects and differential selectivity on regulating gene expression.

DESIGN
To assess how deletion of FIH, VHL or both VHL and FIH affect gene expression genome-wide, we generated FIH null, VHL null and VHL/FIH double null MEFs after adeno-cre virus infection on large T-immortalized FIHdf, VHLdf, and VHLdf/FIHdf MEFs. These MEFs were cultured under normoxia (21% O2) with complete culture medium before RNA extraction. Total RNA were isolated by using the Qiagen RNeasy kit and treated with on-column DNase digestion. Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array was used.
