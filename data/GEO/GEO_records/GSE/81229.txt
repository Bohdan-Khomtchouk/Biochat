TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of as1-1, tfl2-1 and as1-1 tfl2-1 mutants in comparison with wild type.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 (AS1) is an important transcription factor for leaf development in Arabidopsis. But how it regulates downstream genes is largely unknown. We found a co-factor of AS1, LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1), also named as TERMINAL FLOWER 2 (TFL2), a PcG protein in Arabidopsis. To further investigate how AS1 and LHP1 co-regulate downstream genes at the genome level, we perform the transcriptome analysis of as1-1, tfl2-1, and as1-1 tfl2-1 in comparison with wild type (WT).

DESIGN
12-day-old seedlings of wild-type (WT), as1-1, tfl2-1 and as1-1 tfl2-1 grown in normal growth condition were used for RNA extraction and microarray. Duplicate samples were analyzed.

PLATFORM
