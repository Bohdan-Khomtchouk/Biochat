TITLE
Transcriptional response induced by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) in mouse intestinal epithelial cells in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify genes that were differentally regulated upon oral infection with EPEC, we isolated 8 days post-infection intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from the small intestine of C57BL/6 neonate mice that were left untreated or orally infected with 5x104 WT EPEC E2348/69 or with 5x104 of the isogenic mutant ΔescV on their first day of life.

DESIGN
RNA from small intestinal epithelial cells isolated 8 days post-infection from newborn mice orally infected at birth with WT EPEC, ΔescV or left untreated. Each sample corresponds to one animal; 4 or 6 animals from 2 or 3 different litters were used per group. Single color array
