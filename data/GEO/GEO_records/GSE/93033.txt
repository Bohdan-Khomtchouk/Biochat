TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3K27 state in transfected NIH3T3 cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic H3k27me3 changes of mouse NIH3T3 cells comparing control NIH3T3 cells transfected with a pEFm6-BRAF with cells transfected with pEFm6-BRAFV600E. By obtaining over 30 Million bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of BRAF transfected. We find that global lysine 3 and lysine 27 trimethylation levels changed under the condition of activated ERK by BRAFV600E, and specific genes might be downregulated for the hight level of H3K27me3 induced by BRAFV600E

DESIGN
Examination global levels of H3K27me3 in the 2 transfected cells.
