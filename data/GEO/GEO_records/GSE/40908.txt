TITLE
Genome and transcriptome sequencing of lung cancers reveal diverse mutational and splicing events [array component]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease in terms of both underlying genetic lesions and response to therapeutic treatments. We performed deep whole genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing on 19 lung cancer cell lines and 3 lung tumor/normal pairs (provisional dbGaP accession number; phs000299.v2.p1). Overall, our data show that cell line models exhibit similar mutation spectra to human tumor samples. Taken together, these data present a comprehensive genomic landscape of a large number of lung cancer samples and further demonstrate that cancer specific alternative splicing is a widespread phenomenon that has potential utility as therapeutic biomarkers.

DESIGN
Nineteen non-small cell lung cancer cell lines were assayed for genotype, copy number and LOH using Illumina Omni2.5-4 arrays, GenomeStudio V2011.1, and a modified version of the PICNIC (PMID 19837654) algorithm.
