TITLE
Upregulation of Expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases in Alveolar Macrophages of HIV1+ Smokers with Early Emphysema

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV1+ smokers develop emphysema at an earlier age and with a higher incidence than HIV1- smokers. Based on the knowledge that human alveolar macrophages (AM) are capable of producing proteases that degrade extracellular matrix components, we hypothesized that upregulation of AM matrix metalloproteinases may be associated with the emphysema of HIV1+ smokers. To test this hypothesis, microarray analysis was used to screen which MMP genes were expressed by AM isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of HIV1+ smokers with early emphysema. For each of the MMP genes observed to be expressed (MMP-1, -2, -7, -9, -10, -12 and -14), TaqMan PCR was used to quantify the relative expression in AM from 4 groups of individuals: HIV1 healthy nonsmokers, HIV1- healthy smokers, HIV1- smokers with early emphysema and HIV1+ smokers with early emphysema. Strikingly, while AM gene expression of MMPs was higher in HIV1- individuals with emphysema in comparison with HIV1- healthy smokers, for the majority of the MMPs (-1, -7, -9, -10, -12), AM expression from HIV1+ smokers with early emphysema was significantly higher than HIV1- smokers with early emphysema. Consistent with these observations, HIV1+ individuals with early emphysema had higher levels of epithelial lining fluid MMPs (-2, -7, -9,-12) than the 3 HIV1 groups. Interestingly, the active forms of MMP-2, -9 and -12 were detected in epithelial lining fluid from HIV1+ individuals with early emphysema, but not in any of the other groups. Considering that the substrate specificity of the upregulated AM MMPs includes collagenases, gelatinases, matrilysins and elastase, these data suggest that upregulated AM MMP genes and activation of MMP proteins may contribute to the emphysema of HIV1+ individuals who smoke.
