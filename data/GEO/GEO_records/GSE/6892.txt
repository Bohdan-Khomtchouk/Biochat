TITLE
STAT1 (Interferon-alpha) ChIP-ChIP from HeLaS3 Cells using the NimbleGen ENCODE Array

ORGANISM
Pilot ENCODE

SUMMARY
STAT1 ChIP DNA was isolated from HeLaS3 cells following Interferon-alpha stimulation for 30 min and from HeLaS3 cells left untreated. These two STAT1 ChIP DNA samples were combined and compared in the ENCODE regions on NimbleGen ENCODE arrays. Keywords: ChIP-chip
