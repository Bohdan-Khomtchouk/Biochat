TITLE
STAT1 (Interferon-alpha) ChIP-ChIP from HeLaS3 Cells using the NimbleGen ENCODE Array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
STAT1 ChIP DNA was isolated from HeLaS3 cells following Interferon-alpha stimulation for 30 min and from HeLaS3 cells left untreated. These two STAT1 ChIP DNA samples were combined and compared in the ENCODE regions on NimbleGen ENCODE arrays. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Cultures of HeLaS3 cells were divided in half and were either stimulated with Interferon-alpha for 30 min. or left untreated. STAT1-ChIP DNA was isolated from both halves of the culture, labeled and then combined and hybridized to a NimbleGen ENCODE tiling array that contains overlapping 50nt oligonucleotide probes. The series is comprised of three biological replicates, hybridized separately to three arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL2533 Nimblegen ENCODE tiling array (HG17) with 50mer probe at 38bp interval for RenLab
