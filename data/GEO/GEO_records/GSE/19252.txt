TITLE
Identification of AtATM-dependent X-ray inducible transcript

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ATM plays an important role in the response of plants to forms of DNA damage that cause DNA double-strand breaks. Arabidopsis ATM has been shown to be important for the transcriptional induction of several DNA repair genes including AtRAD51 (Garcia et al 2003 Plant Cell 15, 119-132). In our experiment we compare the transcript profiles of wild type and mutant plants exposed to 10Gy X-rays (dose rate ~0.8 Gy/min). Plants will be grown on 0.5*MS + 1%sucrose at 22degC under short (9h) day conditions and treated after 5h light. We will irradiate wild type (Col-0) and atatm-3 mutant (N589805) seedlings at growth stage 1.06 and harvest tissue 1h post irradiation. RNA will be isolated using the SV RNA isolation kit (Promega). Comparison of the transcript profiles will then allow AtATM-dependent X-ray inducible transcripts to be identified.

DESIGN
6 samples (3 wild type, 3 mutant) were used in this experiment.
