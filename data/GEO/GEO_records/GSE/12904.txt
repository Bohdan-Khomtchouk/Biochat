TITLE
17b-Trenbolone study

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
We investigated the genomic transcriptional response of female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to an acute (4 day) exposure to 0.1 or 1.0 µg/L of, 17β-trenbolone (TB), the active metabolite of an anabolic androgenic steroid used as a growth promoter in cattle and a contaminant of concern in aquatic systems. Our objectives were to investigate the gene expression profile induced by TB, define biomarkers of exposure to TB, and increase our understanding of the mechanisms of adverse effects of TB on fish reproduction. In female gonad tissue, microarray analysis using a 22K oligonucleotide microarray (EcoArray Inc., Gainesville, FL) showed 99 significantly upregulated genes and 741 significantly downregulated genes in response to 1 µg TB/L. In particular, hydroxysteroid (17β) dehydrogenase 12a (hsd17b12a), zona pellucida glycoprotein 2.2 (zp2.2), and protein inhibitor of activated STAT, 2 (pias2) were all downregulated in gonad.

DESIGN
4 control samples compared to 4 exposed samples, ovary.
