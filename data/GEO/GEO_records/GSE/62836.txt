TITLE
Global host transcriptional profiles following Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We focused on how Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis influences the subsequent host response to investigate the host immunopathology accompanying the host anti-mycobacterial immune response during Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection in spleen of mice.

DESIGN
We analyzed altered transcription in the spleen of mice at 3, 6, and 12 weeks following Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection.
