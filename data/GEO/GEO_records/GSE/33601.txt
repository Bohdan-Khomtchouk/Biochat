TITLE
Human transcriptome pattern of primary cutaneous lesions from patients with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucosal leishmaniasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated the trancriptome of primary cutaneous leisions caused by infection with Leishmania braziliensis. mRNA-seq technique was used to study the trancriptome of both host and parasite. A total of 10 samples was obtained from primary skin ulcers of two extreme clinical forms of American tegumentary leishmaniasis: (i) individuals that after antimonial treatment cured completely (localized cutaneous leishmaniasis - LCL, n=5) and (ii) individuals that developed mucosal lesions in naso and oropharynx areas long after initial healing of the cutaneous lesion (mucosal leishmaniasis - ML, n=5).  The sequencing generated an average of 13+ 5 million reads per samples. The reads were aligned to Homo sapiens (USCS - hg19) and to Leishmania braziliensis (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute - V2_29072008) genomes. Approximately, 15,000 human genes could be detected in the samples. Low amount of L. braziliensis reads did not allow the evaluation of parasite gene expression. LCL and ML samples showed different patterns of gene expression, indicating a more robust immune response in LCL individuals. In summary, this study demonstrated that next-generation sequencing can be used for identification of potentially important biological pathways and drug targets in the host-response to L. braziliensis infection and for characterization of a gene expression signature that could be used to predict the disease outcome. Moreover, we also showed the ability of this technique in, simultaneously, sequence host and pathogen mRNA.

DESIGN
