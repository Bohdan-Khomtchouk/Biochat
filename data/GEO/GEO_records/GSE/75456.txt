TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of wild-type and VaERF73 overexpressing Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To gain the possible direct or indirect targets of VaERF73, RNA-Seq was carried out on two biological replicates of wild-type and 3 transgenic Arabidopsis lines mixture (OE1, OE2 and OE3) under normal conditions. The fold change analysis showed that 140 significantly differentially expressed genes were expressed > 2-fold in the transgenic as compared with WT plants. Among these changed genes, 89 genes were up-regulated while 51 genes down-regulated.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression changes after overexpression of VaERF73 in Arabidopsis and identification of VaERF73 downstream genes.
