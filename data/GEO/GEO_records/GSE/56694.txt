TITLE
Characterizing the contrasting roles of JMJD3 and UTX histone demethylases in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [JMJD3_CUTLL1_ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an immature hematopoietic malignancy driven mainly by oncogenic activation of NOTCH1 signaling. In this study we assayed for genome-wide localization of JMJD3 enrichment. This piece of data was further integrated to expression changes using RNA sequencing as well as ChIP-Sequencing analysis of H3K27me3 upon genomic/genetic knock-down or chemical inhibition of JMJD3 and UTX. These results, coupled to genomic analysis of primary samples for the genomic status of the UTX gene in T-ALL, helped us to identify a hitherto unknown role of JMJD3 as an oncogenice facilitator in leukemia whereas UTX plays a tumor suppressor role.

DESIGN
JMJD3 ChIP: 10 million cells were used for the ChIP and precipitated using 10micrograms of antibody (abgent, AP1022a) against human JMJD3.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
