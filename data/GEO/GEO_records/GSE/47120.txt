TITLE
Effect of ETV1 knockdown on genome wide AR binding in LNCaP Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Translocation of ETS transcription factors including ERG and ETV1 occur in half of all prostate cancers. LNCaP cells harbor an ETV1 translocation. We performed ChIP-Seq analysis to determine the role of ETV1 on AR binding. The localization of enhancers were determined by H3K4me1 ChIP-Seq.

DESIGN
To determine ETV1 and H3K4me1 localization, logarithmically growing cells

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
