TITLE
MR-1 nitrate sample to fumarate sample

ORGANISM
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1

SUMMARY
One of the most striking observations in the S. oneidensis genome regarding nitrate respiration is that napC is missing and nrfBCD is degenerated. To gain insights into candidate genes encoding the protein(s) in place of NapC and NrfBCD function, i.e., delivering electrons to NapA and NrfA, transcriptional profiling was carried out using the S. oneidensis whole-genome cDNA microarray. Cells of MR-1 grown on nitrate or fumarate under anaerobic conditions were sampled at the exponential phase for the analysis. The quality of the array data was statistically assessed using the method reported previously. Keywords: Compararive microarray study

DESIGN
Compare transcriptional profiles of MR-1 grown on nitrate and Fumarate aiming at finding the electron transfer proteins to NapA and NrfA.
