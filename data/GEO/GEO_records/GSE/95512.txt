TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in the exosomes derived from human suspended red blood cell unit with leukocyte reduced

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive miRNA array, we screened 30 microRNAs abundant in the exosomes derived from human suspended red blood cell unit with leukocyte reduced

DESIGN
In this study, three samples from human suspended red blood cell unit with leukocyte reduced were used to acquire the miRNA expression profiling in the exosomes

PLATFORM
GPL18058 Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA array, 7th generation [miRBase v18, condensed Probe_ID version]
