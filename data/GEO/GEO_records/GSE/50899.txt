TITLE
Expression data from fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe under nitrosative stress

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Nitric oxide being a versatile molecule inside biological systems, from being both a cell signaling molecule to a potent stress agent, has significant effect in the transcriptional response in fission yeast. We have used fission yeast microarrays to identify cellular targets of Nitric Oxide (NO) and to further understand the cellular mechanism of NO action. We report the change in the global gene expression profile response to NO in S. pombe cells

DESIGN
S. pombe cells were treated with pure NO donor compond detaNONOate for 15 minutes at 30 degrees celcius for both the wild type and pap1 deleted strain, the cells were processed through RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We included pap1 deleted strain of S. pombe alongside wild type strain as we earlier reported that pap1 is important to combat nitrosative stress, so pap1 might control the expression of several genes under nitrosative stress. Wild type control and treated samples as well as Mutant control and treated sets are included in 2 biological replicates for each.
