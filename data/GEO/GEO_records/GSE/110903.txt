TITLE
RNA-seq profiling identifies Androgen Receptor-regulated genes in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this analysis is to profile AR-regulated genes, especially non-coding RNAs in three androgen sensitive prostate cancer cell lines, MDA-PCA-2B, LNCaP and VCaP. The two cell lines were serum-starved first, followed by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulation or treated with Enzalutamide (AR inhibitor) without starvation. Transcriptome profiling was generated by RNA-sequencing from polyA-selected RNA. These experiments are followed by knock-down experiments of AR and ARlnc1 in MDA-PCA-2B, and also Enzalutamide (anti-androgen) treatment of LNCaP cells.

DESIGN
Identification of Androgen Receptor regulated transcriptome in three prostate cancer cell lines.
