TITLE
Expression Data from transNOAH breast cancer trial

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These data can be used for evaluation of the clinical utility of the research-based PAM50 subtype predictor in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) and event-free survival (EFS) in women enrolled in the NeOAdjuvant Herceptin (NOAH) trial. The NeOAdjuvant Herceptin [NOAH] trial demonstrated that trastuzumab significantly improves pCR rates and 3-year event-free survival (EFS) in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone in patients with HER2+ breast cancer.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed using RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded core biopsies from 114 pre-treated patients with HER2-positive (HER2+) tumors randomized to receive neoadjuvant doxorubicin/paclitaxel (AT) followed by cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF), or the same regimen in combination with trastuzumab for 1 year. A control cohort of 42 patients with HER2-negative tumors treated with AT-CMF was also included. This dataset represents 156 patients who had provided the samples at baseline (pre-treatment).
