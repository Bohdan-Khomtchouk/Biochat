TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of Cerebral Malaria

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cerebral malaria (CM) is a leading cause of death in the world. Better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease is critical for the development of novel therapies. In this work, we investigated temporal gene expression profiles in the brains of CM-susceptible and CM-resistant mice during infection with P. Berghia ANKA (PbA). In this model of CM, susceptible mice develop neurological signs by day 6 post infection while resistant mice do not develop neurological manifestations during malarial infection. Keywords: Time course
