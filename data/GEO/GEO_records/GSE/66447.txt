TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of ramie [Boehmeria nivea (L.) Gaudich] genes in response to ramie moth [Cocytodes coerulea Guenée] infestation

ORGANISM
Boehmeria nivea

SUMMARY
Comparative transcriptome analysis was performed to study differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Cocytodes caerulea Guenée challenged (CH) and unchallenged (CK) leaves of ramie.We obtained 40.2 and 62.8 million reads for CH and CK libraries respectively.De novo assembling of these reads generated 26,759 and 29,988 unigenes respectively. After a integrate assembly for all data of these two libraries, a total of 46,533 unigenes with an average length of 845 bp were obtained.A total of 1179 genes were identified as DEGs, 657 and 1230 of them were up- and down- regulated respectively, in response to C.caerulea infestation.

DESIGN
Leaf samples of Cocytodes caerulea infested (T2) and un-infested (T1) ramie were RNA-Seq sequenced to compare differented expressed genes.

PLATFORM
