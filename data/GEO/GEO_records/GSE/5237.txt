TITLE
gene expression profiles of healthy male participants in rest

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These gene expression profiles were measured to create a broad and balanced control for any project that examines gene expression changes in men exposed to a defined stimulus (see series 5105). Keywords: gene expression profiles of healthy males

DESIGN
9 healthy men (aged 21 to 44) gave written agreement to participate to this study. At the time of blood withdrawal all participants were non-smokers, with normal BMI and did not obtain any medicamentation. We collected 12ml of whole blood and isolated T-lymphocytes out of 4ml and monocytes out of 8ml whole blood.
