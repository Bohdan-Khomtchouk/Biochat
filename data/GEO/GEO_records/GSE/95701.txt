TITLE
Genomic characterization of murine monocytes reveals C/EBPb dependence of Ly6C-cells [Single Cell RNA sequence]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single cell RNA sequencing of murine circulating blood monocytes under steady state conditions. 2 plates of cx3cr1-cre:rosa26YFP monocytes and 4 plates (3 plates total monocytes and 1 plate Ly6Cint monocytes) were pre-enriched by CD115-biotin MACS and afterwards FACS sorted.

DESIGN
Indexed FACS sorting in 384well plates followed by MARS-Seq (Jaitin et al., Science 2014).
