Expression data from murine cardiac tissue

SUMMARY
Gender dimorphism exists in the physiological response to diet and other environmental factors. Trans-hydrogenated fatty acid (TFA)  intake is associated with an increase in coronary heart disease (CHD), and gender differences in the incidence of CHD are well documented. Neonatal administration of Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) causes stunted heart growth and hypoplasticity; and gender dimorphism at the growth hormone axis has been demonstrated in MSG-treated rodents. The identification of gender dimorphism in cardiac nutrigenomics may provide the basis for gender-specific medicine in the future. We used microarray analysis to examine changes in cardiac gene transcription in response to TFA and/or MSG feeding in male and female C57Bl/6J mice.

DESIGN
Our study animals were bred from female C57Bl/6J mice fed a standard chow diet until 6 weeks of age whereupon they were placed on one of 4 different dietary regimens for a period of 3 weeks prior to mating. The four dietary regimens used in this study were: [1] Standard Chow (Control diet) with ad lib drinking water. [2] Standard Chow, with ad lib drinking water containing 0.64 g/L Monosodium Glutamate (MSG diet). [3] Trans fat diet of 20% (w/w) Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Shortening containing 8.68% w/w Trans fatty acids(TFA diet).  [4] Trans fat Diet #5C4M together with ad lib drinking water containing 0.64 g/L Monosodium Glutamate (TFA+MSG diet). Following mating, the 4 groups of dams were maintained on their respective diets throughout the gestation and nursing period. Male and female offspring used in the following experiments were weighed, weaned onto the same diets and maintained on their respective dietary regimens until they reached 32 weeks of age.Cardiac tissues (8 per diet group) were used at 32 weeks for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
