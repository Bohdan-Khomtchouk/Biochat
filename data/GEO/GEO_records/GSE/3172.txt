TITLE
Adenovirus infected murine embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The innate immune response to 1st generation adenoviral vectors was ascertained through high level infection of primary cells from a inbred mouse strain, replete with an intact and functioning TLR system. Keywords: Immune Response

DESIGN
Quiescent murine C57/Bl6 fibroblasts were Ad (E1-E3-LacZ at MOI=300) or Mock infected.  Sixteen hrs post-infection, RNA was harvested, transcribe to cDNA and bitotin-labeled, and hybridized to Mu11k A and B arrays.
