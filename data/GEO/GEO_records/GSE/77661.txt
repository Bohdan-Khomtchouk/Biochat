TITLE
RNA Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Transcriptomes in Human Normal and Cancerous Tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a novel class of widespread and diverse endogenous RNAs that may regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. However, the regulation and function of human circRNAs remain largely unknown. Here we generate ribosomal-depleted RNA sequencing data from six normal tissues and seven cancers, and detect at least 27,000 circRNA candidates.

DESIGN
RNA profiles of six normal tissues and seven cancers were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
