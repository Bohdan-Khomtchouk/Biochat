TITLE
In vitro murine embryonic microRNA expression signatures predicting the non-genotoxic carcinogenic potential of chemicals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The human body is continuously exposed to various compounds that could initiate or accelerate cancer development. Such carcinogenic compounds can be classified into a genotoxic and non-genotoxic group. Especially carcinogenicity of non-genotoxic compounds is difficult to determine with current in vitro assessments and therefore has to be improved urgently. Here, we used a toxicogenomics-based approach by genome-wide microRNA expression profiling of mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells to identify microRNA classifiers for genotoxic carcinogens (GTXC), non-genotoxic carcinogens (NGTXC) and oxidative (Ox) compounds. We exposed mES cells to four different NGTXC, four GTXC and four Ox compounds. Differential microRNA expression was determined 4, 8 and 12 hours after exposure and was used to assess its discriminative power for NGTXC and GTXC. We generated an accurate classifier set, which was discriminative for NGTXC using a tiered approach. In conclusion, our study indicates that microRNA expression profiles can discriminate between NGTXC, GTXC and Ox compounds with high accuracy.
