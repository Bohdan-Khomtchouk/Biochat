TITLE
Populus homeobox gene ARK2 overexpression

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
The Populus homeobox gene ARBORKNOX2 was overexpressed behind the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in clone INRA 717 P. alba X P. tremula. The experiment here compares gene expression in defoliated stems of two independently transformed clones (mutants) versus wild type controls. Keywords: mutant versus wildtype

DESIGN
Experimental design has two biological replications of both mutant and wild type plants, and two technical replications within each biological replication.

PLATFORM
GPL2699 Populus 2.0
