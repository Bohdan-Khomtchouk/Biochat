TITLE
Populus homeobox gene ARK2 overexpression

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
The Populus homeobox gene ARBORKNOX2 was overexpressed behind the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in clone INRA 717 P. alba X P. tremula. The experiment here compares gene expression in defoliated stems of two independently transformed clones (mutants) versus wild type controls. Keywords: mutant versus wildtype
