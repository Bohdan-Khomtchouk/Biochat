TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from human renal cell cancer subtypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs play a vital role in the process of tumorigenesis. To identify and characterize miRNA Expression in renal cell cancer, we performed microarray based screening of miRNA expression profiles in clear cell, papillary type 1 and papillary type 2 renal cell cancer.

DESIGN
We selected cases of confirmed clear cell, papillary type 1 and papillary type 2 renal cell carcinoma and generated pairs of tumor and corresponding normal tissue by manual microdissection.
