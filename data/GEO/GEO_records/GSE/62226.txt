TITLE
Laccaria-Douglas fir: A Timecourse of Mycorrhizal Root Tip Development

ORGANISM
Laccaria bicolor S238N-H82

This study characterizes the transcriptomic alterations of Laccaria bicolor S238N during interaction with Pseudotsuga menziesii. Three time-points were analyzed, two weeks, four weeks and six weeks after inoculation and compared to the transcriptome of free-living mycelium from Laccaria bicolor S238N.
