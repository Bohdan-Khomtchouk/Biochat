TITLE
Laccaria-Douglas fir: A Timecourse of Mycorrhizal Root Tip Development

ORGANISM
Pseudotsuga menziesii ; Laccaria bicolor ; Laccaria bicolor S238N-H82

SUMMARY
This study characterizes the transcriptomic alterations of Laccaria bicolor S238N during interaction with Pseudotsuga menziesii. Three time-points were analyzed, two weeks, four weeks and six weeks after inoculation and compared to the transcriptome of free-living mycelium from Laccaria bicolor S238N.

DESIGN
We performed 9 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from Pseudotsuga menziesii /L.bicolor mycorrhizal root tips. Samples were taken after 2,4 and 6 weeks of interaction (three biological replicates).  These samples were compared to free-living mycelium from Laccaria bicolor S238N (three biological replicates). All samples were labeled with Cy3.

PLATFORM
