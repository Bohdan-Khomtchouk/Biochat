ra06-03_dspa-erwinia - dspa/e of erwinia amylovora - Identification of Arabidopsis genes regulated by the type three effector Dspa/E of Erwinia amylovora. - Regulation of the Arabidopsis transcriptome by the type three effector DspA/E of Erwinia amylovora. 5-week old Arabidopsis plants were leaf infiltrated with Erwinia amylovora wild-type (wt), type three secretion mutant (sec) or dspA/E mutant (dspA/E) strains. Keywords: wt vs mutant comparison
