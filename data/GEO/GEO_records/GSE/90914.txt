TITLE
The U6 snRNA m6A methyltransferase METTL16 regulates SAM synthetase intron retention

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Maintenance of the intracellular levels of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is essential for a wide variety of biological processes. We demonstrate that the N6-adenosine methyltransferase METTL16 regulates expression of MAT2A, which encodes the only SAM synthetase expressed in most cells. Upon SAM depletion by methionine starvation, cells induce MAT2A expression by enhanced splicing of a retained intron. Induction requires METTL16 and its methylation substrate, a vertebrate conserved hairpin (hp1) in the MAT2A 3´ UTR. Increasing METTL16 occupancy on the MAT2A 3´ UTR is sufficient to induce efficient splicing. We propose that under SAM-limiting conditions, METTL16 occupancy on hp1 increases due to inefficient enzymatic turnover, which in turn promotes MAT2A splicing. Interestingly, human and S. pombe METTL16 methylate the U6 spliceosomal snRNA at a sequence identical to hp1. These observations suggest that the conserved U6 snRNA methyltransferase evolved an additional function in vertebrates to regulate SAM homeostasis.

DESIGN
m6A-seq was performed on polyA-selected RNA from HEK293A-TOA cells from siCtrl or siMETTL16 knockdown conditions. 3 biological replicates were performed for each condition. Both the m6A-IP and the inputs are available for each sample.
