TITLE
Growth cone localization of the mRNA encoding a chromatin regulator modulates neurite outgrowth

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neurons exploit mRNA localization and local translation to spatio-temporally regulate gene expression during development. Local translation and retrograde transport of transcription factors regulate nuclear gene expression in response to signaling events at distal neuronal ends. Whether epigenetic factors could also be involved in such regulation is not known. We report that the mRNA encoding the high mobility group N5 (HMGN5) chromatin binding protein localizes to growth cones of both neuronal-like cells and of hippocampal neurons. We show that Hmgn5 3â€™UTR drives growth cone localization and translation of a reporter gene, and that HMGN5 can be retrogradely transported into the nucleus along neurites. Loss of HMGN5 function induces transcriptional changes and impairs neurite outgrowth while HMGN5 overexpression induces neurite outgrowth and global chromatin decompaction. Interestingly, control of both neurite outgrowth and chromatin structure is dependent on proper growth cone localization of Hmgn5 mRNA. Our results provide the first evidence that mRNA localization and local translation might serve as a mechanism to couple the dynamic neuronal outgrowth process with chromatin regulation in the nucleus.

DESIGN
N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells were transfected with control siRNAs or with siRNAs against Hmgn5. They were then allowed to differentiate and extend neurites for 4h or 24h. Total RNA was then extracted and subjected to microarray analysis.
