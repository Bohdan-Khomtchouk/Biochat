TITLE
Photooxidative stress and light acclimation in the PSII antenna-deficient ch1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
cea10-02_light - photooxidative stress  - To characterize the metabolic pathways implicated in oxidative stress responses and in acclimation mechanisms in the ch1 mutant  - The extracts are carried out starting from sheets of Arabidopis thaliana having pushed on compost in controlled conditions (light: 250 µmol.m-2.s-1, temperature: 22°C day 18°C night, moisture: 55%, photoperiod: 8:00 jour/16h night) during 4 and 8 weeks for respectively the Col0 genotype and the mutant ch1. The acclimatization of the plants is done during 48 H under an average luminous intensity (450 µmol.m-2.s-1, photoperiod 8:00), whereas the stress requires a strong luminous intensity (900 µmol.m-2.s-1, photoperiod 8:00) and low temperature (10°C day, 14°C night) also during 48 hours.

DESIGN
24 dye-swap - genotype comparison, treated vs untreated comparison
