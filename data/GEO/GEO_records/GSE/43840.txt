TITLE
Sliding of Bacillus subtilis Natto

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. natto

SUMMARY
Transcriptome comparison of Bacillus subtilis Natto under sliding permissive (0.7% agar) and restrictive (1.5% agar or spo0A mutant strain) conditions.

DESIGN
B subtilis Natto wild type cells were grown on the top of LB solid medium with 1.5% and 0.7% agar concentration (samples 1-4). B subtilis Natto wild type and spo0A derivative were grown on top of LB solid medium with 0.7% agar concentration (Sample 5-7). In first experiment, 4 biological replicates were used, while in the second experiment 3 biological replicates included. Dye swaps are included in both experiments.
