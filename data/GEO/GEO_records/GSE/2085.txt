TITLE
Transcriptome changes in Emericella nidulans due to oxidative stress - normalized experimental data

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Late exponential growth phase (18 h) Emericella nidulans mycelia were transferred to minimal media also supplemented with 1.8 mM diamide, 75 mM H2O2 or 0.8 mM menadione (sodium bisulfite addition compound) and transcriptome profiles were recorded at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6 and 9 h incubation times. Double printed EST-based (3533 unique sequences) DNA chips were used to monitor changes in cDNA populations prepared from mRNA pools isolated from oxidative stress exposed and untreated control cultures. Gene expression ratios were estimated with Genisphere (Hatfield, PA, USA) 3DNA Submicro EX Expression Array Detection Kit. Expression data were read with a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments). Intensity ratios were calculated with GenePix Pro 3.0 software. Gene expression ratios were subjected to LOESS-type block-by-block normalization using SAS for Windows, version 8. (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.) software. Global gene expression profiles were correlated to physiological changes quantified by intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and redox balances. Primary unprocessed experimental data are summarized Series GSE2100. Keywords: time-course
