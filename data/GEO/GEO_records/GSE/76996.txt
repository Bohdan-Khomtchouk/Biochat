TITLE
Gene expression profiling of immortalized normal fibroblasts from a breast cancer patient after transient transfection with miR-9 or control.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the conversion of breast normal fibroblasts to a CAF-phenotype, gene expression profile of normal fibroblasts transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed.

DESIGN
We performed a gene expression profiling of immortalized normal fibroblasts taken from a noncancerous region of the breast at least 2 cm from the outer tumor margin. Fibroblasts were transiently transfected with miR-9 or control for 24 hours. 3 independent biological replicates for each treatment.
