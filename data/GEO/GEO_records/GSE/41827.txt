TITLE
Expression data from HeLa cells treated with Casiopeina Cas-II-gly

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copper-based chemotherapeutic compounds Casiopeinas, have been presented as able to promote selective programmed cell death in cancer cells, thus being proper candidates for targeted cancer therapy. DNA fragmentation and apoptosis -in a process mediated by reactive oxygen species- for a number of tumor cells, have been argued to be the main mechanisms. However, a detailed functional mechanism (a model) is still to be defined and interrogated for a wide variety of cellular conditions; before establishing settings and parameters needed for their wide clinical application. Microarrays were used to determine the expression profile from HeLa cells in order to propose a model for the role played by intrinsic apoptosis triggered by the oxidative stress caused by Cas-II-gly.

DESIGN
The cervix-uterine cell line HeLa  was maintained at 37C in 5% CO2  under sterile conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Cells were treated with Cas II-gly in 96-well microplates by 6 h.  HeLa cells whole genome gene expression experiments (triplicates for cases/controls) were performed in total mRNA extracted under the GPL570 protocol.
