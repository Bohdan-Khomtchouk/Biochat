TITLE
Expression data from CCRF_CEM cell line treated with 7-(2-Thienyl)-7-deazaadenosine  (AB61), tubercidin and actinomycin D

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CCRF_CEM cell line was treated by AB61 which is potent cytotoxic compound, as the positive controls were used tubercidin and actinomycin D. To assay the biological activity of the AB61 more broadly we performed transcriptional microarray analysis. .

DESIGN
CCRF_CEM cell line was treated by AB61, tubercidin and actinomycin D at 5xIC50 for 3 hours. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain expressional profile to get differential expression of genes following the drug treatment.
