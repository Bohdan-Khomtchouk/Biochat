TITLE
ChIP-Seq of Histone H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 in human GIST48 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We previously mapped ETV1 using ChIP-Seq in GIST48 cells (GSE22441). Here, we map the enhancer landscape marked by histone H3K4me1 and the promoter landscape marked by histone H3K4me3 in GIST48 cells.

DESIGN
Crosslink ChIP-Seq of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 in GIST48 cells
