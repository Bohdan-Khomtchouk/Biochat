TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of Sexual Dimorphism in the Chinese White Wax Scale Ericerus pela Using RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Ericerus pela

SUMMARY
We constructed eight libraries of female and male E. pela at different developmental stages using RNA-seq technology. Many genes and pathways related to sexual dimorphism were identified.The female and male E. pela take different developmental patterns. The sexual dimorphism in E. pela may involve many different regulatory components.
