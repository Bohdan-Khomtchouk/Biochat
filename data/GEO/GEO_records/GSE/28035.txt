TITLE
Expression data from mouse oral keratinocyte

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Keratinocytes are the major constituent of epithelial cells at mucosal surfaces and skin, which cover organs, internal cavities and the body. Traditionally, keratinocytes have been considered as an inert component of the multilayered epithelium to protect the subepithelial compartments from the pathogenic microorganisms, toxic stimuli and physical trauma. However, accumulated researches of the airway, gastrointestinal tract and skin have demonstrated that keratinocytes function in the development of the immune system, promotion of pathologic inflammation and even impose diverse decisions on immune cells. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of oral keratinocyte during oral adaptive immune response.

DESIGN
Oral keratinocyte were collected at three time points (control, 48h and 96h) in oral adaptive immune response for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
