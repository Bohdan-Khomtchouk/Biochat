TITLE
Zebrafish embryo response to Diethyl maleate

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We have employed the Zebrafish gene expression microarray (MZH_Zebrafish_16k_v1.0) as a discovery platform to analyze the trancriptome of 108hpf (hours post fertilization) embryos exposed from the 96hpf to 108hpf to 100µM of diethylmaleate (DEM).

DESIGN
Four two-color microarray studies for measuring expression levels of zebrafish embryos treated with 100µM of diethylmaleate (DEM) were performed. 8 samples were analyzed in total. Four samples were treated with 0.1% DMSO as a control; four samples were treated with 100 µM of DEM and 0.1% DMSO.

PLATFORM
