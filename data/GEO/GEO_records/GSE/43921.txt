TITLE
H3K4 demethylation by Jarid1a and Jarid1b contributes to retinoblastoma-mediated gene silencing during cellular senescence (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cellular senescence is a tumor-suppressive program that involves chromatin reorganization and specific changes in gene expression that trigger an irreversible cell-cycle arrest. We combined quantitative mass spectrometry and ChIP deep-sequencing to identify changes in histone modification occurring during cellular senescence.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was carried out using H3K4me3-specific antibodies in growing, quiescent, senescent, or senescent with shRB targeting Rb, IMR90 cells. The control mock data (ChIP-seq using anti-mouse IgG antibody) is available in GEO Sample GSM497500 (Series GSE19898).
