TITLE
Expression Data from Acinetobacter baumannii strain ATCC 17978 and isogenic lpsB mutant cells

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter baumannii

SUMMARY
lpsB encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis.  LPS is a major component of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes. We used custom-made Affymetrix A. baumannii strain ATCC 17978 derived GeneChips to compare the gene expression properties of wild type and isogenic lpsB mutant cells.  Two mutants were evaluated; A. baumannii strain 5A7 is a ATCC 17978 derivative harboring a transposon (Tn5) within lpsB (A1S_0430 locus); A. baumannii strain containing a deletion of lpsB (A1S_0430).

DESIGN
A. baumannii strain ATCC 17978, 5A7 (lpsB:Tn5) or IH1∆lpsB (∆lpsB) were grown to mid-exponential phase growth, total bacterial RNA was isolated and subjected to GeneChip hybridization and analysis.  We sought to determine the transcription profile of lpsB mutated cells.
