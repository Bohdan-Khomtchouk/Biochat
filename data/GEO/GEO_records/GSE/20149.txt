TITLE
Microarray studies on effect of Pneumocystis carinii infection on global gene expression in alveolar macrophages

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
With a filter of false-discovery rate less than 0.1 and fold change greater than 1.5, 115 genes were found to be up- and 137 were down-regulated in alveolar macrophages during Pneumocystis carinii infection.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples from 4 each of normal, dexamethasone-treated, and Pneumocystis carinii-infected Sprague-Dawley rats were analyzed by the Affymetrix GeneChip RG-U34A
