MG-treated vs non-treated ST2 cells Mouse 32K

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In diabetics, methylglyoxal (MG), a glucose-derived metabolite, plays a noxious role by inducing oxidative stress, which causes and exacerbates a series of complications. With the use of microarray analysis, we comprehensively screened the gene expression profiles of ST2 cells, derived from a multipotent bone marrow stromal cell line, in the presence or absence of oxidative stress induced by100 μM methylglyoxal (MG) treatment to charactrize genes related to diabetic complications.

DESIGN
Mouse bone marrow stromal cell-line ST2 (RIKEN, Tsukuba, Japan) was cultured in α-MEM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 100 μg/ ml penicillin/ streptomycin (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH) and 100 μM methylglyoxal (MG), and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Total RNA was isolated from ST2 cells treated with or without 100 μM methylglyoxal (MG) or 1 μM of 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) by standard methods with the use of an RNeasy Protect Mini kit (Qiagen KK, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
