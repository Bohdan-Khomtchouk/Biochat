TITLE
Adaptation of Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 to fluctuating O2 concentrations

ORGANISM
Sulfolobus solfataricus P2

SUMMARY
Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 was grown aerobically, with O2 concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 26 % (v/v; gas phase). To gain some insight in control of the respiratory system, transcriptomes of the strain cultivated in different O2 concentrations (1.5 % vs 21 %, 1.5 % vs 26 %) were compared using a DNA microarray approach.
