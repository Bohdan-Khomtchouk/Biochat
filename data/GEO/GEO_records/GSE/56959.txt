TITLE
Identification of Novel Pre-Erythrocytic Malaria Antigen Candidates for Combination Vaccines with Circumsporozoite Protein

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Determination of gene expression level changes of whole genome during Plasmodium falciparum development in early liver stage (at 24h and 48h), compared to mixed blood stage and sporozoite stage. A set of Genes selected from this expression analysis are further verified by qPCR and a sub-set were tested for their vaccine efficacy.

DESIGN
6 genomic tiling arrays:  3 time points in early liver infection (spz, hr24, hr48), and 3 blood stage isolates

PLATFORM
GPL18591 NimbleGen Plasmodium falciparum 385K tiling expression array [2007-05-16_Pfal_DS_Tiling; gene-level]
