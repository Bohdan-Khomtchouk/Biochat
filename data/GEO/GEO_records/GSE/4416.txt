TITLE
MLL-AF9 transforms committted progenitors to leukemia stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Leukemias and other cancers possess a rare population of cells capable of self-renewal, and eradication of these cancer stem cells is likely necessary for long-term cancer-free survival. Given that both normal and cancer stem cells are capable of self-renewal the extent to which cancer stem cells resemble normal tissue stem cells is a critical issue if targeted therapies are to be developed.  We introduced the MLL-AF9 fusion protein encoded by the t(9;11)(p22;q23) found in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) into murine committed granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP). The resultant leukemias contained cells with an immunophenotype similar to normal GMP that were highly enriched for leukemia stem cells (LSC). Detailed gene expression comparisons between normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), committed progenitors, and the LSC population demonstrated the LSC were globally more similar to the normal GMP than any other population. However, a subset of genes highly expressed in normal stem cells was re-activated in the LSC. These data demonstrate LSC can be generated from committed progenitors without widespread reprogramming of gene expression, and a leukemia self-renewal associated signature is activated in the process. Our findings define progression from normal hematopoietic progenitor to leukemia stem cell, and suggest that targeting a self-renewal program expressed in an abnormal context may be possible. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
RNA from normal GMP, GMP-like cells isolated from leukemic bone marrow (LGMP) and cells derived from the in vitro propagation of LGMP were hybridized to affymetrix microarrays.
