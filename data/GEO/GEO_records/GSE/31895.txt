TITLE
ChIP with anti-orc2 antibody to identify regions of orc binding in third instar salivary glands of WT and SuUR mutant Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
ChIP was performed to identify regions of gDNA bound by orc2 in third instar salivary glands of Drosophila WT and SuUR mutants.  This demonstrated that ORC does not localize to regions that are under-replicated in SuUR mutant third instar salivary glands.

DESIGN
Comparison of ORC2 ChIP sample relative to input DNA or control IgG pulldown for two different Drosophila strains
