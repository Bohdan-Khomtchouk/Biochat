TITLE
Expression profiling in PFR40 (hpl-2) mutant early embryo

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Identification of genes significantly misregulated in hpl-2 mutant early embryo compared to wild-type early embryo

DESIGN
4 replicates of total RNA from hpl-2 mutant early embryo was compared to 4 replicates of total RNA from wild-type early embryo [GSE58759] obtained from PMID 20824077.
