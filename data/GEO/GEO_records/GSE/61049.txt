TITLE
Nervous system developmental genes are altered in fetal hippocampus by ethanol.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause long-lasting changes in functional and genetic programs of the brain, which may underlie behavioral alterations found in FASD. Here, we demonstrated that maternal binge alcohol consumption alters the expression of genes involved in nervous system development.

DESIGN
Maternal binge alcohol consumption alters several important genes that are involved in nervous system development in the mouse hippocampus at embryonic day 18 (ED18)
