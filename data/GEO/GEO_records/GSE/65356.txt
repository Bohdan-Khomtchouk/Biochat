TITLE
ChIP-seq analyses of 10 quorum sensing regulators in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing (QS) systems contribute to bacterial homeostasis and pathogenicity. Although many regulators have been characterized to control the production of virulence factors and QS signaling molecules, its detailed regulatory mechanisms still remain elusive. Here, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) on 10 key QS regulators. The direct regulation of these genes by corresponding regulator has been confirmed by Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR). Binding motifs are found by using MEME suite and verified by footprint assays in vitro. Collectively, this work provides new cues to better understand the detailed regulatory networks of QS systems.
