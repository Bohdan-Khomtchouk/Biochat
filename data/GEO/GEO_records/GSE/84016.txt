TITLE
Expression data from Rspo1-null differentiating primary myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regeneration of the adult skeletal muscle tissue relies on a population of muscle stem cells called satellite cells. During tisse repair, satellite cells exhibit active canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Rspo1 is a modulator of Wnt signaling in many tissue, and is expressed by muscle progenitor cells. To identify genes that become transcribed following activation of the Wnt/Î²-Catenin pathway in satellite cells, we performed microarray analysis of primary myoblasts expressing an active form of beta-catenin

DESIGN
Primary myoblasts were prepared from the limb muscles of wild-type and Rpos1-null mice. RNA was extracted from two independent cultures for each conditions.
