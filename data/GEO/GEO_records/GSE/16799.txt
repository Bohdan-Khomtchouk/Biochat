TITLE
Expression data for UV time course in Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type and mutant strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Treatment of cells with DNA damaging agents leads to large-scale gene expression changes. Proper transcriptional regulation is important for cells to arrest, repair damage and adjust cellular processes such as metabolism in order to survive the damaging assault. Damage-induced transcription is a highly regulated response. This study establishes a novel role for two factors, Snf1 and Rad23, in regulation of the UV-induced transcriptional response.

DESIGN
Yeast strains were grown to log phase and irradiated with 100 J/m2 UV-C light. Unirradiated samples were also taken. Three different strains (WT, snf1Δ, mig3Δ) were analyzed in the absence of damage and at 15, 30 and 60 minutes following irradiation. Three other strains (rad23Δ, snf1Δ rad23Δ, rad4Δ) were analyzed in the absence of damage and at 30 and 60 minutes following irradiation for a total of 21 different strain/condition combinations. Experiments were performed in duplicate (two biological replicates for each condition). Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix Yeast 2.0 arrays. Undamaged WT samples were used as a control.
