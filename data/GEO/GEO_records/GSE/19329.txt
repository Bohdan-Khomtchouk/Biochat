TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of testicular cells in wild type (VRK1+/+) and mutant (VRK1-/-) Mus musculus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of testicular cells in VRK1+/+ and VRK1-/- Mus musculus

DESIGN
Gene expression in whole testicular cells from wild type (VRK1+/+) and VRK1-/- mutant Mus musculus, respectively, was measured. Four independent experiment for wild type and mutant, respectively, were performed.
