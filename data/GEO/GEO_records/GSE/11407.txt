TITLE
SCFA-hexosamine scaffold

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to characterize the gene expression profile of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with various SCFA-hexosamine analogs to better understand the role of various modifications to this scaffold. Keywords: SCFA-hexosamine analog comparison

DESIGN
In total, six analogs were investigated in this study. For the relatively " toxic " C6-SCFA analogs, IC30 was selected to explore initial growth inhibitory and apoptotic gene expression changes.  Two independent biological replicates were analyzed for each analog-treated condition.  Three independent biological replicates were analyzed for the vehicle-treated control (EtOH).
