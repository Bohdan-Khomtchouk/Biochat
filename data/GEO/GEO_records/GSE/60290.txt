TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) priming by Ifng and Ifnb.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages are a heterogeneous population of immune cells, which are critical for both the initiation and resolution of inflammation. Pro-inflammatory macrophages can be induced by the Th1 cytokine IFNγ and/or TLR triggers, like LPS. Here, we investigated the effects of IFNγ priming on LPS-induced gene expression in primary mouse macrophages.

DESIGN
To investigate the effect of IFNγ priming on LPS-induced gene expression in macrophages, we stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages with IFNγ or IFNb for 18 hours and subsequently activated them with LPS for 6 hours.
