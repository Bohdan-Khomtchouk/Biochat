TITLE
Long non-coding RNA profiling of human lymphoid progenitors reveals transcriptional divergence of B cell and T cell lineages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate the transcriptional ‘landscape’ that regulates human lymphoid commitment during postnatal life, we used RNA sequencing to assemble the long non-coding transcriptome across human bone marrow and thymic progenitor cells spanning the earliest stages of B lymphoid and T lymphoid specification. Over 3,000 genes encoding previously unknown long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) were revealed through the analysis of these rare populations. Lymphoid commitment was characterized by lncRNA expression patterns that were highly stage specific and were more lineage specific than those of protein-coding genes. Protein-coding genes co-expressed with neighboring lncRNA genes showed enrichment for ontologies related to lymphoid differentiation. The exquisite cell-type specificity of global lncRNA expression patterns independently revealed new developmental relationships among the earliest progenitor cells in the human bone marrow and thymus.

DESIGN
We performed RNA-Seq of 10 distinct cell types isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). From BM, we isolated CD34+CD38neglinneg cells, a population highly enriched for HSC, as well as three lymphoid progenitor populations; LMPP (CD34+CD45RA+CD38+CD10neg CD62Lhilinneg), CLP (CD34+CD38+CD10+CD45RA+linneg ) and fully B cell committed progenitors (BCP, CD34+CD38+CD19+). From thymus we isolated three CD34+ subsets; Thy1 (CD34+CD7neg CD1aneg CD4negCD8neg), Thy2 (CD34+CD7+CD1aneg CD4negCD8neg), and Thy 3 (CD34+CD7+CD1a+CD4negCD8neg), as well as fully T cell committed populations CD4+CD8+ (Thy 4), CD3+CD4+CD8neg (Thy5) and CD3+CD4neg CD8+ (Thy6).
