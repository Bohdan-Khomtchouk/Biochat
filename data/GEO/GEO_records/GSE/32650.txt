TITLE
Global gene expression analysis in murine iPS cells derived with mouse, chick and zebrafish Nanog orthologs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nanog null  neural stem (NS) cells were reprogrammed to naive pluripotency in 2i/LIF conditions with chick (c) and zebrafish (z) Nanog orthologs. Global gene expression was compared to iPS cells derived with mouse (m) Nanog.

DESIGN
Murine iPS cells derived with zebrafish nanog, chick nanog, and mouse nanog orthologs (2 replicates each).
