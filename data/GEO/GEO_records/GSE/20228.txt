TITLE
Nuclear gene expression in response to chloroplast division inhibition

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim of this investigation is to analyse the effect on nuclear gene expression of inhibition of chloroplast division. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines (Ler) were generated that contained a chemically inducible promoter (XVE) upstream of AtMinD1. AtMinD1 encodes a product involved in chloroplast division; overexpression of AtMinD1 leads to chloroplast division inhibition.

DESIGN
6 samples were used in this experiment. Three treatments were performed: Treatment 1: Empty vector control seedlings (transformed with PER-10 only) were sown onto lehle, sprayed at 13 days old with 2uM 17-B-estradiol (inducer) and harvested 24 hours later. Treatment 2: Seeds were sown on lehle containing inducer and sprayed every 24 hours with 2uM inducer until harvested at 14 days old. Treatment 3: Seeds were sown on lehle plates, sprayed at 13 days old with 2uM inducer and harvested 24 hours later. For all three treatments, seedlings were grown in constant light conditions, and tissue was harvested from 14-day-old seedlings (4 rosette leaves) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before RNA preparation.
