TITLE
D. nodosus WT vs rpoN mutant

ORGANISM
Dichelobacter nodosus

SUMMARY
To determine the genes in addition to fimA regulated by sigma 54 by analysing the gene expression profiles of an rpoN mutant compared to the D. nodosus wild-type strain. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
RpoN regulated genes were determined by analysing four biological replicates, including two dye swaps. Raw data was compiled using IMAGENE. Normalisation and statistical analysis was undertaken using BASE. Statistics were performed using the Wilcoxon signed ranked test.

PLATFORM
