TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of goat mammary glands in peak-lactation and late-lactation periods

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
In comparison with cow milk, goat (Capra hircus) milk contains much higher levels of unsaturated fatty acids, as well as higher levels of total fat, proteins, carbohydrates, calcium, and vitamins.The main objective of the present study was to better define the relationship of known miRNAs regulating milk fat metabolism. Our main purpose is to search for some known miRNAs regulating milk fat metabolism, to this end, we screened potential miRNAs with differential expression between peak-lactation and non-lactation.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  Monocytes from three healthy goats (3 year old) of similar body weight. We screened a series of potential miRNAs involved in regulation of milk metabolism.
