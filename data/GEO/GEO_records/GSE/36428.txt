TITLE
Modulation of activation-associated host cell gene expression by the apicomplexan parasite Theileria annulata

ORGANISM
Theileria annulata ; Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The experiment investigates bovine gene expression in response to LPS in uninfected and Theileria annulata-infected cell cultures A subset of genes are identified which are activated in response to LPS stimulation with further modulation due to parasite infection.

DESIGN
Six experimental conditions with three replicates per condition. Total RNA prepared from cell cultures. BL20 (uninfected bovine lymphosarcoma cell line), BL20 4 hours post-LPS stimulation, BL20 18 hours post-LPS, TBL (T. annulata infected bovine cell line), TBL 4 hours post-LPS, TBL 18 hours post-LPS. Each hydridisation represents bovine and parasite gene expression on a single channel and 2 technical replicates of each probeset are represented on the chip.
