TITLE
Implication of Long noncoding RNAs in the endothelial cell response to hypoxia I.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein coding RNAs regulating gene expression. Although for some lncRNAs a relevant role in hypoxic endothelium has been shown, the regulation and function of lncRNAs is still largely unknown in the vascular physio-pathology. Taking advantage of next-generation sequencing techniques, transcriptomic changes induced by endothelial cell exposure to hypoxia were investigated. Paired-end sequencing of polyadenylated RNA derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to 1% O2 or normoxia was performed. Bioinformatics analysis identified ≈ 2000 differentially expressed genes, including 122 lncRNAs. Extensive validation was performed by both microarray and qPCR. Among the validated lncRNAs, H19, MIR210HG, MEG9, MALAT1 and MIR22HG were also induced in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. To test the functional relevance of lncRNAs in endothelial cells, knockdown of H19 expression was performed. H19 inhibition decreased HUVEC growth, inducing their accumulation in G1 phase of the cell cycle; accordingly, p21 (CDKN1A) expression was increased. Additionally, H19 knockdown also diminished HUVEC ability to form capillary like structures when plated on matrigel. In conclusion, a high-confidence signature of lncRNAs modulated by hypoxia in HUVEC was identified and a significant impact of H19 lncRNA was shown.

DESIGN
For H19 knock-down, 50 nM of antisense LNA™ GapmeRs customer-designed for H19 or Negative control A (Exiqon) were transfected by siRNA transfection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 40% confluent HAOEC according to the manufacturer’s manual.
