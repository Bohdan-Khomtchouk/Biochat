TITLE
Expression data from Trk-overexpressing NB cell line SY5Y

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neurotrophin receptors play a pivotal role in the biology and prognosis of neuroblastoma (NB). While expression of TrkA/NTRK1 confers a good prognosis to NB patients, expression of TrkB/NTRK2 is associated with unfavorable outcome. We have transfected the neurotrophin-receptor null cell line SY5Y with either full-length TrkA or TrkB and performed transcriptional profiling to analyse the effects of Trk-expression without activation and in a time course after activation.

DESIGN
SY5Y transfected with either full length TrkA- or TrkB cDNA or vector control were cultivated in the absence or presence of their ligands NGF and BDNF, respectively. At the indicated time points cells were harvested and analysed using Affymetrix U95Av2 chips.
