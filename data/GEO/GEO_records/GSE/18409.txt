TITLE
Expression data from Trk-overexpressing NB cell line SY5Y

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neurotrophin receptors play a pivotal role in the biology and prognosis of neuroblastoma (NB). While expression of TrkA/NTRK1 confers a good prognosis to NB patients, expression of TrkB/NTRK2 is associated with unfavorable outcome. We have transfected the neurotrophin-receptor null cell line SY5Y with either full-length TrkA or TrkB and performed transcriptional profiling to analyse the effects of Trk-expression without activation and in a time course after activation.
