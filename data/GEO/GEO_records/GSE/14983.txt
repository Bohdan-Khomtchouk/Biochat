TITLE
P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS3121 responses to apoplastic fluid of bean leaf

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. phaseolicola

SUMMARY
Many genes involve in pathogenicity and virulence are induced only in plant or in the presence of host components. Plant apoplast is the primary site of infection for P. syringae, which obtain nutrients directly from apoplastic fluid of host plants. In this work we investigated the effect of apoplastic fluid on the transcriptomic profile of the bacterium, when grown at low temperature in minimal medium with or without apoplastic fluid extracted from healthy bean leaves.

DESIGN
Two RNA samples were compared, one prepared from cells grown in minimal medium  and the other from cells grown in minimal medium supplemented with apoplastic fluid from bean leaves. To control de biological variation that might interfere with data interpretation, a minimum of three biological replicates were prepared and two technical replicates with the same RNA (swap).
