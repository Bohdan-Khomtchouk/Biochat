TITLE
Nonsense Mediated mRNA decay mutes the splicing defects of spliceosome component mutations

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The role of many splicing factors in pre-mRNA splicing and the involvement of these factors in the processing of specific transcripts have often been defined through the analysis of loss of function mutants in vivo. Here we show that inactivating the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) results in an enhancement of splicing phenotypes associated with several splicing factors mutations. Tiling microarrays showed that inactivation of the NMD factor Upf1p in the prp17Δ and prp18Δ mutant strains reveals a larger spectrum of splicing defects than what is observed in the single mutants, including new transcripts previously shown unaffected by Prp17p or Prp18p inactivation. In addition, inactivation of Upf1 in the prp22-1 mutant enhances the unspliced precursor accumulation phenotype of several specific transcripts and partially suppresses growth defects associated with the prp17Δ or prp22-1 mutations. These results support the idea that RNA surveillance by NMD mutes some of the effects of splicing factors mutations and show that the roles of splicing factors and their transcripts specificity cannot be fully understood in vivo unless RNA degradation systems that degrade unspliced precursors are also inactivated.

DESIGN
Three samples from the Prp17delta, Prp18delta, Prp17deltaUpf1delta and Prp18Upf1delta mutants were grown indepedently and analyzed by tiling arrays to understand the role of the NMD component Upf1 in minimizing the accumulation of unspliced RNAs generated by the Prp17delta and Prp18delta splicing mutations.
