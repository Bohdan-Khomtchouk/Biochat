TITLE
RNA sequencing of E11.5 Control and Prmt5cKO forelimbs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We preformed RNA sequencing on control and Prmt5cKO embryos at E11.5 to determine differentially expressed genes resulting from a loss of Prmt5.

DESIGN
We generated three control and two Prmt5cKO biological replicates for RNA sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
