TITLE
Comprehensive comparative analysis of strand-specific RNA sequencing methods

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Strand-specific massively-parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful tool for novel transcript discovery, genome annotation, and expression profiling.  Despite multiple published methods for strand-specific RNA-Seq, no consensus exists as to how to choose between them.  Here, we developed a comprehensive computational pipeline for the comparison of library quality metrics from any RNA-Seq method.  Using the well-annotated Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome as a benchmark, we compared seven library construction protocols, including both published and our own novel methods.  We found marked differences in complexity, strand-specificity, evenness and continuity of coverage, agreement with known annotations, and accuracy for expression profiling. Weighing each methodâ€™s performance and ease, we identify the dUTP second strand marking and the Illumina RNA ligation methods as the leading protocols, with the former benefitting from the availability of paired-end sequencing.  Our analysis provides a comprehensive benchmark, and our computational pipeline is applicable for assessment of future protocols in any organism.

DESIGN
Examination of 11 different strand-specific RNA-Seq libraries from 7 distinct methods; also 2 control non-strand-specific RNA-Seq libraries. To assess the performance of each strand-specific library in digital expression profiling, we compared them to reference expression measurements estimated from expression profiles using competitive hybridization of a mid-log RNA sample vs. genomic DNA using Agilent arrays.
