TITLE
DNA methylation analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines treated with epigenetic drugs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The impact of drugs inhibiting DNA methylation (5-aza-2'-deoxycytodine, DAC) and EZH2 (EPZ-6438) on the neuroblastoma methylome was analyzed in two neuroblastoma cell lines. Parallel analyses investigated associated changes in histone modification and RNA expression.

DESIGN
The neuroblastoma cell lines Be(2)-C and IMR5-75 were treated with a combination of DAC and EPZ-6438. Controls were treated with solvent (DMSO). DNA was isolated, bisulphite converted and hybridised to the llumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
