TITLE
Genome wide expression analysis of mouse xenograft tissues derived from urothelial cancer cell UM-UC3 orthotopic recycling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Urothelial cancer cells UM-UC3 was orthotopically implanted in mouse bladder wall and then recycled for multiple cycles. Spontaneous tumor tissues including primaries, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis (lung and bone) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were collected and the mRNA expression profiling was examed by microarray

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from mutilple xenograft tissues and 5 separate tumors for each tissue type (primaries, lynph note metastasis, distant metastasis and CTCs) were derived from UM-UC3 orthotopic recycling

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
