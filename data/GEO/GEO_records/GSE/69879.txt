TITLE
Gene expression profile of mouse CD206+F4/80+CD11b+ M2-like macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Characterisation of M2-like macrophage in terms of gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that M2-like macrophages in myocardial infarction (MI) heart have upregulation of genes relevant to cardiac repair. The results obtained showed tha various tanti-inflammatory and reparative genes were upregulated in M2-like macrophage from MI heart compared to those from intact hearts. M2-like macrophages from the heart (either MI or intact) were distinct from those in the peritoneal cavity.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from M2-like macrophages from peritoneal cavity, intact heart and myocardial infarction heart.
