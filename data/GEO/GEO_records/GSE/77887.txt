TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of total skin gene expression from presenilin (1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of differential gene expression of total skin from different Notch signaling pathway mutants (specifically PSmut, RBPjmut, and PSRmut). Preselin1 & 2 are the core components of g-secretase enzyme which essential for the Notch receptor activation. RBPjk is the DNA-binding partner of the Notch Intracellular Domain. The hypothesis tested in the present study was RBPjmut skin would resemble the wild-type skin at the transcriptional level, since RBPjmut mice exhibit milder phenotype than PSmut or PSRmut mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 4x RBPjmut, 4x PSmut, 4x PSRmut total skin at P0 and compared to wild-type total skin from littermates. All mice were raised in mixed genetic background.
