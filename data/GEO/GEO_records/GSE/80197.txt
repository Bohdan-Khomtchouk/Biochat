TITLE
ChIP-seq-based analysis of i) K27me3 promoter coverage and  ii) enhancer elements in neuroblastoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate whether a set of differentially methylated/expressed genes, identified in neuroblastomas of differential outcome, co-localizes with K27me3 marks or enhancer elements, we performed H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 ChIP seq in neuroblastoma cell lines.

DESIGN
Enhancers were defined in neuroblastoma cell lines as overlapping H3K4me1 and H3K27ac peaks with a minimal distance of 2 kb to the closest H3K4me3 peak, a criterion imposed to rule out selection of (unannotated) promoters. Promoter-near K27me3 coverage was also analyzed in neuroblastoma cell lines. The effect of MYCN on K27me3 occupancy was investigated upon  modulation of MYCN levels.
