TITLE
Determination of the protein interactome of the transcription factor Sox2 in embryonic stem cells engineered for inducible expression of four reprogramming factors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Coordinate expression of the somatic cell reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc within embryonic stem cells preserves the self-renewal of these cells, while allowing for the expression epitope tagged Sox2. Taking advantage of this observation, we engineered embryonic stem cells (i-OSKM-ESC) to inducibly express Oct4, Klf4, c-Myc and an epitope tagged form of Sox2 from a polycistronic element, in the presence of doxycycline. We isolated Sox2 and its associated protein complexes by co-immunoprecipitation. Subsequently, we identified the Sox2-protein interactome in self-renewing embryonic stem cells using an unbiased proteomic screen (Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology [MudPIT]). Affymetrix microarrays were used to characterize the gene expression profile of i-OSKM-ESC in the absence and presence of doxycycline.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic stem cells (KH2) were engineered to express Oct4, epitope tagged Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc in the presence of doxycyline, to produce i-OSKM-ESC. The i-OSKM-ESC were cultured in the absence or presence of doxycyline (4 Âµg/mL) for 24 hours. RNA was extracted from each condition, and used for microarray analysis.
