TITLE
Transcriptomic analyses of Kras induced zebrafish liver cancer

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The kras transgenic line was generated by using a mifepristone-inducible transgenic system in combination with a Cre-loxP system. Most of the induced transgenic fish developed hepatocellular carcinoma at 6 month-post-induction.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling of Kras tumor sample (6T1 and 6T2) and control samples (6M1 and 6M2) were generated by deep sequencing, using 3' RNA-SAGE on SOLiD system
