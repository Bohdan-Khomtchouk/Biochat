TITLE
Gene expression data from Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase knockout mouse muscle at 4 weeks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD)is the initial component of a pentose phosphate pathway inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that generates NADPH for ER enzymes. In liver, H6PD is required for the 11-oxoreductase activity of 11ss-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11ss-HSD1), which converts inactive 11-oxo glucocorticoids to their active 11-hydroxyl counterparts; consequently, H6PD null mice are relatively insensitive to glucocorticoids, exhibiting fasting hypoglycemia, increased insulin sensitivity despite elevated circulating levels of corticosterone, and increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscles normally enriched in Type II (fast) fibers which have increased glycogen content. They also display a progressive vacuolar myopathy evident after 4 weeks of age. We carried out microarray analysis on TA and soleus muscles from 4 week old WT and KO mice to determine an expression profile predicting myopathy. Keywords: Age dependant disease state phenotype comparison

DESIGN
4 week old mice are weaned and do not display overt histological evidence of myopathy. Soleus and tibialis anterior are used as comparison groups as they have distinct fibre type content and differing metabolic properties. 3 biological replicates are used for each genotpye and sample type.
