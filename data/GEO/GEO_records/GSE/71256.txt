TITLE
miRNA profiling of Terc-/- mice plasma samples: in selenium deprivation or supplementation at young or old ages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study describes a circulating miRNA signature of selenium deprivation or supplementation at young or old Terc-/- mice, which may indentify the candidate miRNAs related to systemic changes at different stages.

DESIGN
Plasma samples were taken from mice under selenium deprivation or supplementation at 12 month-old or 18 month-old. The plasma samples from three mice in each group were used for miRNA profiling. **Please note that [1] the normalized data matrix includes the result after filtering out all miRNA not presenting in all, and normalized as well [2] Although the results from Card A and Card B can identify up to 762 miRNA, the Raw_Ct.txt lists 315 out of 762 excluding those not detectable or below the threshold.
