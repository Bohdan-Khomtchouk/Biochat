TITLE
miRNA profiles associated with adynamic bone disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is observed universally in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Detrimental MBD-related skeletal changes include increased prevalence of fracture, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as useful biomarkers in various diseases, and the aim of this study was to identify miRNAs associated with parathyroid hormone level in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The PD patients were enrolled and grouped by their intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. Of the patients, total RNA was extracted from whole blood samples (n=15) and underwent miRNA microarray analysis.
