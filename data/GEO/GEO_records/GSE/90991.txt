TITLE
miRNA profiles associated with adynamic bone disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is observed universally in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Detrimental MBD-related skeletal changes include increased prevalence of fracture, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as useful biomarkers in various diseases, and the aim of this study was to identify miRNAs associated with parathyroid hormone level in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The PD patients were enrolled and grouped by their intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. Of the patients, total RNA was extracted from whole blood samples (n=15) and underwent miRNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
The patients with peritoneal dialysis were enrolled and grouped by their intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. Total RNA was extracted from whole blood samples. Total RNA from 15 patients underwent miRNA microarray analysis. 8 patients with iPTH â‰¥ 150 pg/mL (HP) and 7 patients with iPTH < 150 pg/mL (LP) had their miRNA profiles compared.
