TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing for cancer stem cell properties in MCF-7 cells with knocked down CD24

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD24 is the one of cell surface protein that anchored via glycosyl phosphatidylinositol that links to cell surface and modulates growth and differentiation signal many of cell types. A small population of cells, namely ‘Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs)’, charges highly aggressive and metastatic character of cancer cells and shows conformational change of ‘epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). To understand the role of CD24 in CSC and EMT, CD24 was knocked down using siRNA in the MCF7 cell line (MCF-7 hCD24 KD) and analyzed transcriptome profiles by mRNA-sequencing.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of MCF-7 hCD24 KD cells [‘monolayer (m) cultured MCF7 wild type (WT) and mMCF7 CD24KD’ and ‘sphere-forming (s) MCF7 WT and sMCF7 CD24KD’] were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx.
