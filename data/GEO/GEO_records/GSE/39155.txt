TITLE
Human Embryonic Kidney(293T) Cells: Control vs. Transfected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Human Embryonic Kidney(293T) Cells comparing control untreated 293T cells with 293T cells transfected with A) pcDNA 3.0(-) vector[Invitrogen] (Mock) and B) Expression vector pcDNA 3.0(-) containing cloned Influenza virus H5N1and H11N1-NS1 (Non-Structural1) gene.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 293T vs. TF-293T cells. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 transfected, independently grown and harvested for each set of experiment.Total 4 groups 1.Control untransfected (293T) cells 2. Mock 293T cells transfected with pcDNA3.0(-) expression 3. 293T cells transfected with NS1 gene of H5N1 virus cloned in pcDNA 3.0(-) vector 4.293T cells transfected with NS1 gene of H11N1 virus cloned in pcDNA 3.0(-) vector.
