TITLE
Expression profiles of HepG2 cells treated with low-, high-dose of acetaminophen and solvent control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptomics changes induced in the human liver cell line HepG2 by low and high doses of acetaminophen and solvent controls after treatment for 4 time points (12h, 24h, 48h and 72h)

DESIGN
The study investigated differential gene expression in HepG2 cell line mRNA following 12 to 72 hours of exposure to low and high doses of acetaminophen and solvent controls. Three biological replicates per compound/solvent.
