TITLE
Identification of a serum-induced transcriptional signature associated with metastatic cervical cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor cells that escape local tissue control can convert inflammatory cells from tumor suppressors to tumor promoters. Moreover, soluble immune-modulating factors secreted from the tumor environment can be difficult to identify in patient serum due to their low abundance. We used an alternative strategy,cell-based assay that uses PBMC “reporters” to predict biologically relevant factors in patient serum. We identified disease-specific transcriptional signatures induced by patient sera with local versus metastatic disease.

DESIGN
Sera from patients with local and metastatic cervical cancer were used to induce a disease-specific transcriptional signature in cultured, healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). An empirical Bayesian method, EBarrays, was used to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes with a target false discovery rate of < 5%. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used to detect the top molecular and cellular functions associated with the DE genes. IPA and in silco analysis was used to pinpoint candidate upstream regulators, including cancer-related microRNAs (miRNAs).
