TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis leaves after gamma irradiation of 200 Gy

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis cmt3 mutant showed neither DNA hypomethylation nor transcriptional activation of silenced repeats by gamma rays, which was found in wild type (WT). We used microarrays to compare the global transcriptional changes between the WT and cmt3 after the irradiation of 200 Gy. Transcriptions of transposition-related genes seemed to be differently affected in the WT and cmt3 by gamma rays, depending on the epigenetic codes of the genome. However, genome-wide transcriptions of the WT and cmt3 couldn't be positively correlated with the different levels of DNA methylation after the irradiation of 200 Gy.

DESIGN
Rosette leaves from more than 10 plants were pooled for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 genechips. We performed two independent array experiments using totally different biological replicates of WT and cmt3 mutant plants with or without gamma irradiation.
