TITLE
Measurement of inter-individual variability in gene expression in mouse neutrophils

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We extracted RNA from C57BL/6 mouse neutrophils to measure inter-individual variability in gene expression. 5 of the 10 blood samples were analyzed separately, the other 5 were pooled then split into 5 technical replicates to measure technical variability. We could then measure inter-individual variability in gene expression and compare it to the amplitude of miRNA-guided repression by miR-223.

DESIGN
5 samples were from individual mice (samples #1, 3, 5, 9 and 10) and 5 samples were from the pooled blood of the other five mice (samples #2, 4, 6, 7 and 8).
