TITLE
Identification of ZIC2 target genes in human pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and KP-4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PANC-1Tet/ZIC2 and PANC-1Tet/empty were established from human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1. PANC-1Tet/ZIC2 cells express FLAG-tagged human ZIC2 on the withdrawal of DOX. On the other hand, PANC-1Tet/empty was transfected an empty vector for the control experiment. To identify ZIC2 target genes, total RNAs were purified from the cells before and 48 hours after the DOX withdrawal. Gene expression profiles were analyzed by AGILENT human 4x44k cDNA microarray. As well as ZIC2-inducible system, we performed ZIC2-knockdown experiments in PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells. After 96 hours transfection of siRNAs for ZIC2 and its control, total RNAs were purified and gene expression profiles were analyzed by AGILENT human 4x44k cDNA microarray.

DESIGN
ZIC2 target genes were identified in PANC-1 cells. Gene expression profiles of PANC-1Tet/ZIC2 and PANC-1Tet/empty cells were analyzed by AGILENT human 4x44k cDNA microarray before and 48 hours after the DOX withdrawal. As well as ZIC2-inducible system, gene expression profiles of control- and ZIC2-knocdown PANC-1 cells were also analyzed by AGILENT human 4x44k cDNA microarray.
