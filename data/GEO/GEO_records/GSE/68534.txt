TITLE
Using RNA Seq to define the regulon of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa transcription factor Anr in low-oxygen colony biofilms.

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

SUMMARY
Purpose : The goal of this study was to use RNA Seq to define the regulon of the transciption factor Anr by comparing global transcriptional profiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 and a clinical isolate with their isogenic ∆anr mutants, grown in colony biofilms at 1% oxygen. Methods : mRNA profiles were generated for laboratory strain PAO1 and for a clinical isolate J215, as well as for ∆anr derivatives of each strain, in duplicate, by deep sequencing. Strains were grown for 12 hours in colony biofilms at 1% O2, 5% CO2 prior to RNA harvest. Ribosomal and transfer RNAs were removed using the MICROBExpress kit (Life Technologies). mRNA reads were trimmed and mapped to the PAO1 NC_002516 reference genome from NCBI using the ClC Genomics Workbench platform and defaut parameters.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 12 hour colony biofilms were generated for P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 WT, PAO1 ∆anr, clinical isolate J215, and J215 ∆anr, each in duplicate, by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq.
