TITLE
Krüppel-like Transcription Factor-10 (KLF10) Provides a Negative Feedback Mechanism to Suppress TGFβ-Induced Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have elucidated the potential role of KLF10 in inhbiting TGFβ-induced EMT. Further, we show that KLF10 directly binds to SNAI2 and recruit HDAC1 to inhbit the expression of SNAI2.

DESIGN
We performed ChIP-sequencing from A549 cells and generated ChIP-Seq data for KLF10. Furthermore, we also geneerated ChIP-Seq data for H3K27ac and H3K9ac (+/- siKLF10 and +/- TGFβ). Consistently, Input DNA was also included.
