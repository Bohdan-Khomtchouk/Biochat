TITLE
Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals genes regulating myogenesis and adipogenesis in Laiwu pigs over four developmental stages

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We performed transcriptome analysis of the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle during four development stages (60, 120, 240 and 400 days after birth) in Laiwu pigs, an indigenous fatty pig breed in North China. This study provides a reference for exploring transcriptome regulation mechanisms affecting muscle growth and development in obese pigs.

DESIGN
Examination of  transcriptional variation over four different development stages in Laiwu pig.

PLATFORM
GPL19176 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Sus scrofa)
