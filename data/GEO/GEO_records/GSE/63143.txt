TITLE
RNA-SEQ analysis of E14.5 pooled dorsal root ganglia control samples

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comparative RNA-SEQ analysis of control total RNA preparations from pooled E14.5 dorsal root ganglia was carried out to determine the performance of the RNAseq reactions at differing concentrations (3ng, 10ng & 30ng in high or low volumes) and concordance among different institutions using the same source of RNA.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from E14.5 dorsal root ganglia dissected from wild type C57BL/6J embryos and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
