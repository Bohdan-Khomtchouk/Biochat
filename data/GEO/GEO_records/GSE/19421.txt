TITLE
Profile of microRNA during adipogenesis regulating by microRNA and WNT signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate miRNAs that implicate the process of adipogenesis by interacting with canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, we constructed two cell models at first, and then investigated the expression profile of microRNAs by using Microarray. Based on the data of high throughput microarray, we identified 18 miRNAs which might promote adipogenesis by repressing WNT signaling, including mir-210, mir-148a, mir-194, mir-322 etc. On the other hand, we also identified 29 miRNAs which might repress adipogenesis by activation of WNT signaling, including mir-344, mir-27, and mir-181. The target genes involved in WNT signaling pathway of these identified miRNAs were also predicted through online tools.

DESIGN
Two cell models of 3T3-L1, i.e. activation and suppression of WNT signaling including four samples, i.e. preadipocytes, mature adipocytes (MDI induction), Lithium treated preadipocytes, MDI induction of Lithium treated preadipocytes. Each sample was replicated in triplicate.
