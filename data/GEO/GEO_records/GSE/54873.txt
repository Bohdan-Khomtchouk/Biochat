TITLE
Gene expression analysis in primary blasts of AML patients and CD34+normal progenitors after 6 hours of HDACi treatment.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AML blasts and CD34+ normal progenitors were treated with SAHA, and gene expression profiles were compared to 6-hours treatments. The analysis revealed commonly regulated genes in these systems by HDACi.

DESIGN
Total RNA were obtained from AML blasts and normal progenitors after 6 hours of treatment with SAHA and gene expression profiles were compared.
