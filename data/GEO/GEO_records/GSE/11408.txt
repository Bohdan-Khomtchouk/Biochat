TITLE
Expression Data From HCMV-Infected Human Monocytes Study 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human cytomegalovirus induces a pro-inflammatory monocyte following infection.  To begin to address how HCMV induces these rapid changes in infected monocytes, we examined the transcriptome of infected monocytes.  Global transcriptional profiling using cDNA microarrays revealed a significant number of pro-inflammatory genes were upregulated within 4 hours post infection. Keywords: Disease State

DESIGN
To begin to globally define the HCMV-induced changes in monocyte function, we performed a transcriptome analysis.  Specifically, a cDNA microarray containing 12,626 unique probe sets was utilized to assess the modulation of the monocyte transcriptome at 4 hours post infection.  A total of 6 replicates from mock-infected and 6 replicates from HCMV-infected monocytes were analyzed in this study.
