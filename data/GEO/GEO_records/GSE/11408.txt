TITLE
Expression Data From HCMV-Infected Human Monocytes Study 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human cytomegalovirus induces a pro-inflammatory monocyte following infection.  To begin to address how HCMV induces these rapid changes in infected monocytes, we examined the transcriptome of infected monocytes.  Global transcriptional profiling using cDNA microarrays revealed a significant number of pro-inflammatory genes were upregulated within 4 hours post infection. Keywords: Disease State
