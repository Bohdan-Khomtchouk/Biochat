TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of the marine oil-degrading bacterium Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 reveals genes important in dodecane uptake and utilization.

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 = CIP 110063

SUMMARY
In this study we compare the transcriptome of the strain RAG-1 grown in dodecane, the corresponding alkanol, and sodium acetate for the characterization of genes involved in dodecane uptake and utilization.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was used to compare A. venetianus RAG-1 grown to mid log phase in the presence of either dodecane, dodecanol or sodium acetate (control condition) as the carbon source. The number of genes differentially expressed in the pairwise comparisons were studied to identify genes involved in dodecane uptake and metabolism.
