TITLE
Evolutionary engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for enhanced tolerance to hydrolysates of lignocellulosic biomass Samples vs Reference

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Adaptive evolution experiment for enhaced tolerance to hydrolysates of lignocellulosic biomass in S. cerevisiae.  The samples involves a batch culture in YNB and Hydrolysates. Cells were harvested at mid-exponential phase.

DESIGN
Three biological replicas of 8 samples vs reference Samples 1-8 are the first replicate, Samples 9-16 are the second replicate, Samples 17-24 are the third replicate.
