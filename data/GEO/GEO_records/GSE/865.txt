TITLE
Nrf2 Knockout vs. Wildtype mice, spleen sample

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In situ synthesized oligo arrays, U74Av2, from Affymetrix were used to measure differential gene expression in RNA samples generated from the spleen of Nrf2 knockout and wildtype female mice at 5 month age. Total RNAs from two Nrf2 knockout or wildtype littermates were analyzed separately. There are two replicates (GSM 13470, 13472) for the female Nrf2 wildtype group and two replicates (GSM 13467, 13469) for the female Nrf2 knockout group. Keywords: parallel sample
