TITLE
ENOLASE treated PBMC vs Control relative to time

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Time dependant transcriptional profiling of healthy PBMC comparing a-ENOLASE (ENO) treatment to BSA (Control). Kinetic was performed : H0, H5, H20 and H45. Goal was to determine the biological pathways relative to ENO treatment.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, ENO vs. Control - PBMC. Biological replicates: 3 healthy donors  (P1-P3). Two-color technology : each donor treated by ENO (Cy-5) or control  (Cy-3).

PLATFORM
