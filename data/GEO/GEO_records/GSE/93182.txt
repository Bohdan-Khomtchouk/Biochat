TITLE
Impact on Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome of multifunctional silica nanoparticles based on metal atom clusters

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au14-09_silice - clustop transcriptomics. - Understand and categorize plant mechanisms implicated in the interaction with nanoparticles, both in the phenomena responsible for toxicity as in accommodation, see detoxication. - Phytotoxicity of Cs2[Mo6Br14]@SiO2 nanoparticles and their components, i.e. Cs2[Mo6Br14] clusters and SiO2 nanoparticles, has been studied usign Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension culture. Cs2[Mo6Br14]@SiO2 nanoparticles used here are composed of 7,5% clusters and 92,5% SiO2. Thus, to compare to the impact of a 100 mg/L Cs2[Mo6Br14]@SiO2 nanoparticle treatment (CS), we also treated Arabidopsis cells with clusters at 7,5 mg/L (C), SiO2 at 92,5 mg/L (S), and combined 7,5 mgCMB/L plus 92,5 mgSiO2/L (C+S).

DESIGN
8 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison
