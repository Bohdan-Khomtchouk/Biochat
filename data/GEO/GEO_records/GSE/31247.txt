TITLE
Gene expression profile on the penile tissue of erectile dysfunction (ED)  in cavernous nerve injury (CNI) RAT model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
(Erectile dysfunction) ED during the radical prostatectomy (RP) treatment is caused by surgical injury of the cavernous nerve which is the final neuronal pathways of penile erection. We performed microarray experiment focused on theto understanding the gene signature alteration in the corporal cavernous tissue of the CNI-induced ED rat model.

DESIGN
A total of 6 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups, sham operation (n=3) and bilateral CN resection (n=3) group. At 12 weeks after CN resection, penile tissue was harvested and microarray experiment was performed.

PLATFORM
GPL7289 Agilent-013162 Whole Rat Genome Microarray G4131A (Probe Name version)
