TITLE
M2 cytokines alter the miRNA expression profile in macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the miRNA expression profile of the profibrogenic macrophages, we compared miRNA expression in untreated versus IL-4 or IL-13-treated macrophages using miRNA microarray.IL-4 and IL-13 treatment resulted in marked changes in 18 and 19 miRNAs in macrophages, respectively.(n=3, fold changes > 2, P < 0.05)

DESIGN
Total RNA from human primary macrophages (n=3) treated with or without 20 ng/ml IL-4 or 20ng/ml IL-13 for 48 hr was isolated with a mirVana miRNA Isolation kit (Ambion, Foster, CA). The miRNA expression profile of the samples were examined using miRCURY LNA™ arrays (v18.0; covering 1921 human miRNAs, Exiqon ,Vedbaek, Denmark).
