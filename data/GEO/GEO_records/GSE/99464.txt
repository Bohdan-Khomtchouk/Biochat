TITLE
Identification of AtGRP7 targets by RIP-seq

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A key function for RNA-binding proteins in orchestrating plant development and environmental responses is well established. However, the lack of a genome-wide view on their in vivo binding targets and binding landscapes represents a gap in understanding the mode of action of plant RNA-binding proteins. Here, we conducted RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP-seq) for genome-wide determining the binding repertoire of the circadian clock-regulated Arabidopsis thaliana glycine-rich RNA-binding protein AtGRP7.

DESIGN
AtGRP7 RIP-seq
