TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of miRNA-associated transcriptome profiles in multiple cell models

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Schizophrenia-associated miRNA were bidirectionally modulated in HEK-293, HeLa, and SH-SY5Y cell models. Results provide important insights into the current understanding of miRNA function in various cellular environments.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from HEK-293, HeLa, and SH-SY5Y cells at 24hrs post-transfection with either synthetic miRNA (miR overexpression) or anti-miR inhibitor (miR inhibition) oligonucleotides.
