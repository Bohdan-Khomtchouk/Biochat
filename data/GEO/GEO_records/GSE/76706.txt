TITLE
The impact of transgenic Uchl1 on gene expression in germinal center B-cells from ImHABCL6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study seeks to understand the mechanisms behind enhanced lymphomagenesis observed in ImHABCL6/Uchl1 mice compared with ImHABCL6 alone. As the lymphomas arise from germinal center (GC) B-cells, we reasoned that transgenic Uchl1 altered the gene expression patterns in GC B-cells from these animals. We therefore isolated pre-malignant GC B-cells and examined the gene expression patterns to identify pathways affected by the addition of Uchl1.

DESIGN
Germinal center B-cells were isolated from from the spleens of ImHABCL6 and ImHABCL6/Uchl1 mutant mice (n= 3 each) after immunization with sheep red blood cells. RNA was extracted and hybridized to affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arrays.
