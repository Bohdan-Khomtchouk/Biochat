TITLE
Solexa sequencing of small RNAs in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat [dorsal root ganglia]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We applied Solexa sequencing technology to identify rat microRNA genes in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) following sciatic nerve resection. Using Solexa sequencing, computational analysis and Q-PCR verification, 114 novel miRNAs in rats were discovered and identified, of which 52 novel miRNAs were first reported in rat DRGs and 62 novel miRNAs were produced at days 1, 4, 7 and 14 after sciatic nerve resection. These data provide an important resource relating to the role and regulation of miRNAs for future studies relating to peripheral nerve injury and regeneration.

DESIGN
18-30 nt small RNAs from 30 Thirty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were sequenced at one Solexa lane

PLATFORM
GPL11282 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Rattus norvegicus)
