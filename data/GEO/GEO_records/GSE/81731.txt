TITLE
Distinct Functions of Argonaute Slicer in siRNA Maturation and Heterochromatin Formation [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Ago1 can mediate transcriptional gene silencing without slicing nascent RNA target

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis of H3K9me2 levels showing that Ago1 slicing activity is not required for priRNA1-dependent H3K9me2 at ura4+
