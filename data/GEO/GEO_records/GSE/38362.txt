TITLE
Molecular basis for the specification of floral organs by APETALA3 and PISTILLATA (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Characterization of the activities of the transcription factors that AP3 and PI encode throughout flower development using perturbation assays in combination with a floral induction system (FIS) that allows a stage-specific analysis of flower development. The series contains two types of perturbation experiments, static permutations (null alleles pi-1 and ap3-3, respectively) and dynamic perturbations (temperature-sensitive ap3-1 allele).

DESIGN
Two conditions (i.e. genotypes: ap3-3 or pi-1 homozygous in the FIS vs ap3-3 or pi-1 heterozygous in the FIS, respectively / ap3-1 plants vs AP3 plants shifted from 16degrees to 27 degrees ) at three developmental stages each
