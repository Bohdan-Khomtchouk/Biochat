TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3K9me3 in control ESCs and Rif1 knockdown ESC.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that Rif1 depletion leads to reduced H3K9me3 levels at 1/3 of the H3K9me3-enriched genomic regions (H3K9me3 peaks), and that reduced H3K9me3 de-represses Zscan4 and other genes that are specific to the 2-Cell stage embryo.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K9me3 histone modifications in 2 cell types.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
