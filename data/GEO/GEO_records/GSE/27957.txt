TITLE
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Gene Expression Profiles May Predict Poor Outcome in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background:  In this study we aimed to identify peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression profiles predictive of poor outcomes in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) Methods:  Microarray analyses of PBMC were performed in 120 patients from discovery (n=45) and replication cohorts (n=75).  Genes and pathways associated with transplant-free survival (TFS) were identified and confirmed by qRT-PCR. Findings:  52 genes were predictive of TFS in a discovery cohort (FDR < 5%, Cox score above 2.5 or below -2.5). Clustering the replication cohort samples using these genes distinguished two patient groups with significantly different TFS (hazard ratio 1.96, 95%CI 1.01-3.8, P=0.018). Decreased expression of “The co-stimulatory signaling during T cell activation” Biocarta pathway and in particular CD28, ICOS, LCK and ITK was associated with shorter TFS times in each cohort (FDR < 5%). qRT-PCR expression of CD28, ICOS, LCK and ITK correlated with the microarray results in the discovery cohort (P < 0.05) and their decreased expression was predictive of shorter TFS in the replication cohort (P < 0.05).  A genomic and clinical model demonstrated an area under the ROC curve of 78.5% at 2.4 months for death and lung transplant prediction. Interpretation:  Our results suggest that CD28, ICOS, LCK and ITK are outcome biomarkers in IPF.  They should be further evaluated for patient prioritization for lung transplantation and stratification in drug studies.
