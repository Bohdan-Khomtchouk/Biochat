TITLE
rlm1 mutant 3 hour exposure to zymolyase

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We did transcription profiling on the effect of rlm1 deletion, gene involved in cell wall stress response Keywords: cell wall stress response

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae (rlm1 mutant) was grown on YEPD. For Zymolyase experiments, yeast cells were grown overnight at 24 °C to an optical density 0.8 - 1 (A600). The culture was refreshed to 0.2 O.D and grown at 24 °C for 2h 30min. Next, culture was divided into two parts. One continues growing under same conditions (non-treated culture) while the other was supplemented with 5units/ml Zymolyase 100T. Cells were collected at 3 hours of growth, frozen at -80 °C and processed for RNA extraction. The total RNA from two different cultures was analyzed, and, in addition, for each sample two different hybridizations were performed, including fluorochrome swapping in order to minimize transcriptional changes due to technical variability. This therefore corresponded to four DNA microarrays analyzed for each condition.
