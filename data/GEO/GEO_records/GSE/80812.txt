TITLE
Klf5 regulates muscle differentiation via directly targeted muscle-specific genes in cooperation with MyoD in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deletion of Klf5 in satellite cells impaired muscle regeneration due to a failure of differentiation. Mechanistically, Klf5 controls transcription of muscle genes by interacting with MyoD and Mef2. These findings provide a potential intervention into the process of muscle regeneration through modulation of Klf5.

DESIGN
Genome wide localization of Transcription factors Klf5 and MyoD were assessed by ChIP-Seq. Genome-wide gene expression were analyzed by RNA-seq at indicated timepoint during myoblast differentiation.
