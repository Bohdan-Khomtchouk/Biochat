TITLE
Transcription start site analysis for Thermotoga maritima [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Thermotoga maritima MSB8

SUMMARY
Investigation of 5' transcripts using strand specific sequencing for T. maritima under logphase, maltose minimal media growth conditions

DESIGN
Two replicate samples were sequenced after isolating total RNA of cultures grown in maltose minimal media. Cells were harvested in logphase growth.
