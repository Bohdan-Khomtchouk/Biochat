TITLE
Isogenic mice exhibit sexually-dimorphic DNA methylation patterns across multiple tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our findings suggest that gender is underwritten in the epigenome in a tissue-specific manner. Gender-specific epigenetic states are likely to have important implications for understanding sexually dimorphic phenotypes in health and disease.

DESIGN
Methylation profiling male vs female by RRBS of 3 mouse tissues. 6 x 6 liver samples, 3 x 3 brain, 3 x 3 heart.
