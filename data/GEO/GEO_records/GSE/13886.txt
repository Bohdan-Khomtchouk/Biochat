TITLE
Response of p53 isogenic colorectal cancer panel to 12 Gy gamma irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Though targeted homologous recombination, we developed a panel of matched colorectal cancer cell lines that differ only with respect to their endogenous TP53 status.  We then used these lines to define the genes whose expression was altered following DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation.    Transcriptome analyses revealed a consistent upregulation of polo-like kinase I (PLK1) as well as other genes controlling the G2/M transition in the cells whose TP53 genes were inactivated compared to those with wild type (wt ) TP53 genes. Keywords: Genetic Modification, Stress Response
