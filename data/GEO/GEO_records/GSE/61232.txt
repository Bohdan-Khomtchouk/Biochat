TITLE
The impact of manganese on biofilm development of Bacillus subtilis.

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Transcriptome comparison of Bacillus subtilis 168 grown on solid agar (sample 1-3) or aerated liquid (sample 4-7) 2xSG medium with and without of 0.1 mM manganese.

DESIGN
B subtilis 168 wild type cells were grown on the top of 2xSG solid medium with 1.5% agar concentration (samples 1-3) with and without manganese in the medium. B subtilis 168 wild type cells were grown in aerated (225rpm) 2xSG liquid medium (samples 4-7) with and without manganese in the medium. In the first experiments 3 biological replicates, while in the second one, 4 biological replicates were used. Dye swaps are included in both experiments.
