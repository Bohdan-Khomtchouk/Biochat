TITLE
Expression profiling of myeloid leukemia cell treated with vibsanin A, PMA and ATRA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-based differentiation therapy has achieved success with the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a unique subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, other subtypes of AML display resistance to ATRA-based treatment. Here, we demonstrate that a novel natural vibsane-type diterpenoid vibsanin A promotes the differentiation of myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts. To reveal how vibsanin A function on promoting myeloid leukemia cell differentiation, we analyzed and compared the gene expression profiles in myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells treated with vibsanin A, PMA, and ATRA.

DESIGN
HL-60 cells were treated with vibsanin A, PMA and ATRA for 6 hours or longer up to 24 hours. Gene expression profiling was conducted
