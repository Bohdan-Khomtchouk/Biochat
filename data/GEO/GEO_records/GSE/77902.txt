TITLE
RNA-Seq of siRNA-mediated knockdown of the lncRNA SLNCR1 in WM1976 melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq was used to profile transcriptional changes induced by siRNA knockdown of the long non-coding RNA SLNCR1.

DESIGN
The WM1976 melanoma short-term culture was transfected with either scrambled or SLNCR1-targeting siRNAs

PLATFORM
