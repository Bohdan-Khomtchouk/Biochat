TITLE
Novel data integration approaches identify concordant and discordant immune responses between mice and humans [human cells]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have conducted experiments to compare transcriptional response to tuberculosis (TB) in THP1 cells in time points 1hr,6hr and 24hr after infection.

DESIGN
We infected THP1 cells with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, extracted total RNA at time points 1hr, 6hr and 24hr after infection and performed microarray experiments. We performed 5 experiments including 9 infected and 9 control (uninfected) samples (time points 6h and 24h) and 15 infected and 14 control samples in time points 6h and before infection.
