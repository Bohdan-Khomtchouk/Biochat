TITLE
PDGFRα+ cells in ESC cultures represent the in vitro equivalent of the pre-implantation primitive endoderm precursors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) express PDGFRα heterogeneously, fluctuating between a PDGFRα+ (PrE-primed) and a Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (PECAM1)-positive state (epiblast-primed). The two surface markers can be co-detected on a third subpopulation, expressing epiblast and PrE determinants.

DESIGN
Three different subpopulatiosn were sorted based on PECAM1/PDGFRa expression and analyzed by NGS
