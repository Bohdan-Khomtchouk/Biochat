TITLE
muscle mRNA tagging

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We present a global overview of muscle gene expression in C. elegans using a novel technique called mRNA-tagging, and have identified genes involved in contraction, muscle structure, and energy utilization.  Furthermore, we found that muscle-expressed genes are clustered in groups of 2-5 along the chromosomes, suggesting that expression from a chromatin domain can extend over several genes. These observations reveal a higher-order organization of the structure of the genome in which the order of genes along the chromosome is correlated with their expression in specific tissues. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
