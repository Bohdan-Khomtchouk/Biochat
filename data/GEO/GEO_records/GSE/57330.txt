TITLE
mRNA expression profile in CHME3 cells infected with Japanese encephalitis virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CHME3 cells grown on six-wells were infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (P20778 strain ) and total RNA was isolated from cells at 6, 24 and 48 h of post infection mRNA expression was significantly altered in JEV infected human microglial cells. A time dependant change in microRNA profile was noted. Bioinformatics analysis identified anti correlation between differentially expressed miRNAs and the gene expression at different time point which ultimately affected several signalling pathways in microglia cells. Brain enriched microRNAs and a set of microRNA previously designated as NeurimmiRs were also differentially expressed in response to JEV infection

DESIGN
Cells grown on 6-well well plate. Three replicates of uninfected and infected samples at each time point was used for mRNA experiment.
