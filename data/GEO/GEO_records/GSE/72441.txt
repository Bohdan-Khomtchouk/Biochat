TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of floral organ in Canna indica by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Canna indica

SUMMARY
In Canna indica L, 3-4 (occasionally 5) petaloid staminodes and a one-theca stamen with a petaloid appendage constitute the androecium. In order to find out the genetic basis of petaloid development of androecium members, RNA-Seq analysis of petal (P),  petaloid staminode (PS), anther (A) and petaloid appendage (PA) were carried out.

DESIGN
P-PS comparison was carried out to find the differences between the two kinds of petal-like organ, and A-PA comparison was conducted to reveal the mechanism for the differentiation of these two parts within stamen.
