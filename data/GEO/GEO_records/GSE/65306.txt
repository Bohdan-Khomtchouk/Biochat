TITLE
Comprehensive genomic analysis of relapse neuroblastoma [methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Relapse neuroblastoma were characterized by sequencing, gene expression, arrayCGH and genome-wide methylation. This data set contains genome-wide methylation data.

DESIGN
Array from tumours at relapse were compared to pretreatment tumours and corresponding normal samples.
