TITLE
Classification of Antipsychotic Drugs by Gene Expression in the Frontal Cortex of Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Antipsychotic drugs are classified as typical and atypical based on extrapyramidal effects. However, since the frontal cortex is one of the most important regions for antipsychotic actions, this study attempted to classify antipsychotic drugs based on gene expression in the frontal cortex. Chlorpromazine and thioridazine were selected as typical antipsychotics, and olanzapine and quetiapine as atypical antipsychotics. Since these drugs have similar chemical structures, the effect of the basic structure on gene expression can be eliminated. Cluster analysis of microarray experiments showed thioridazine and olanzapine constituted a robust cluster. K-means clustering separated 4-drug-administered mice into chlorpromazine-quetiapine and thioridazine-olanzapine groups. This classification scheme is different from that which is based on criteria currently used to group the typical and atypical drugs and suggests that antipsychotic drugs can be further separated into multiple groups.
