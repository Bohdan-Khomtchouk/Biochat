TITLE
Changes of mRNA expression levels in HBV-infected human primary hepatocytes and those cells treated with bionanocapsules containing microRNA-93.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human primary hepatocytes isolated from chimeric mice were infected with HBV for 7 days. The comprehensive changes of mRNA levels were determined by mRNA array. Also, microRNA93 was delivered into those cells using bionanocapsules to determine the effects of rescue expression of miR93 in HBV replicating cells, because we found that miR93 expression level was downregulated in HBV-infected hepatocytes.

DESIGN
mRNA expression levels were compared in among control cells, HBV-infected cells, miR93 delivered cells, and HBV-infected cells with miR93 delivered, by 25K mRNA arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL13915 3D-Gene Human Oligo chip 25k V2.1
