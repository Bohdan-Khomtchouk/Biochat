TITLE
A cross species and multi-omics (including metabolomics) analysis in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (tumor stages)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PanNET) is relatively infrequent but is nevertheless metastatic. Seeking to extend a new paradigm of personalized medicine, we performed an integrative analysis of transcriptomic (mRNA and microRNA) and mutational profiles and defined three clinically relevant human PanNET subtypes. Importantly, cross-species analysis revealed two of these three subtypes in a well-characterized, genetically engineered mouse model (RIP1-Tag2) of PanNET and its cell lines. Each subtype share similarities to distinct cell types in pancreatic neuroendocrine development, features are reflected in their metabolic profiles. Subtype-specific molecular signatures metabolites are proposed to identify these subtypes. Gene expression data from different stages of RIP1-TAG2 genetically engineered PanNET mouse model

DESIGN
RT2 mouse PanNET tumors, liver metastases, normal, hyperplastic, and angiogenic islets were dissected out or isolated. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays. The CEL files were processed using aroma.affymetrix.
