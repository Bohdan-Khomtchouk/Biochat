TITLE
Maize gene expression during infection with Colletotrichum graminicola

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
The hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola is the causal agent of anthracnose disease on maize stalks and leaves. After the formation of appressoria the host cell wall is penetrated by the conversion of appressorial turgor pressure into forceful ejection of a penetration peg. Subsequently, C. graminicola establishes biotrophic hyphae in the penetrated epidermis cell at around 36 hours post inoculation (hpi) until a switch of hyphal morphology and lifestyle takes place during the colonization of neighboring host cells at around 72 hpi. During the ensuing necrotrophic growth, dark necrotic lesions are formed that are visible as anthracnose symptoms. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression during the infection process of Colletotrichum graminicola in its host plant to get insight into the defense response of this compatible interaction and into the metabolic reprogramming needed to supply the fungus with nutrients.

DESIGN
In three independent experiments, maize plants were infected with conidia of the Colletotrichum graminicola strain CgM2 by spray inoculation of leaves. Samples from infected leaves were taken at 36 and 96 hours post infection, corresponding to initial biotrophic and necrotrophic phase, respectively. Samples from uninfected control plants were taken at the same time points.
