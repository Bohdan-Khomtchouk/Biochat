TITLE
Expression profiling of early-stage squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are investigating the molecular development of squamous cell lung carcinoma based upon analysis of global gene expression profiles representing progressive stages of cancer development, consisting of precancerous, carcinoma-in-situ, and invasive cancer. Keywords: global gene expression analysis, lung cancer development
