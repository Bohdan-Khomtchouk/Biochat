TITLE
Analysis of transcripts regulated by Dicer and Argonaute proteins in human HEK-293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HEK-293-derived cell lines depleted of Dicer or one of four Argonaute proteins were generated. Microarray analysis of these knock down cell lines and various control cell lines was performed to address how large the proportion of genes is that are regulated by RNA silencing in an individual cell type. Comparison of different arrays revealed commonly (up) regulated genes. The highest overlap was observed in Ago2 and Dicer knockdown cells. Keywords: different timepoints of induction of stable knock down cell lines compared to various control cell lines

DESIGN
three control cell lines (T-Rex, shRNA, empty vector), two induvidual Argonaute 1 and 4 (Ago1kd, Ago4kd) knock down cell lines, one Argonaute 2 and 3 (Ago2kd, Ago3kd) and two induvidual Dicer knock down cell lines were analyzed as biological replicates
