TITLE
Gene expression profile of inflorescence at early developmental stage

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of infrorescence was performed to obtain overall signature of transcriptome at early developmental stages of inflorescence.

DESIGN
After the reproductive stage transition, inflorescence samples corresponding to the early stages of development were collected based on the size. We obtained inflorescence samples ranging from 0.6 to 10 mm in two replicates representing 8  stages in inflorescence development. A total of 16 microarray data were obtained.
