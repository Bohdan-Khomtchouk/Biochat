TITLE
Creatine increases health and life span in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we show that oral creatine (Cr) supplementation leads to increased life span in mice. Treated mice showed improved neurobehavioral performance, decreased accumulation of the aging pigment lipofuscin and upregulation of “anti-aging” genes in brain. As Cr is virtually free of adverse effects, it may be a promising food supplement for healthy aging in man. Keywords: creatine, life span, neurobehavioural performance, microarray, oxidative stress, aging
