TITLE
High cholesterol diet and phenobarbital affect cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High cholesterol diet and xenobiotic treatment induce changes in cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism. Mice were either 7 days on high cholesterol diet or were treated with phenobarbital. Liver samples were anayzed using Affymetrix GeneChip MOE430A. Keywords: treatment and diet effects

DESIGN
One group of mice was treated 50 mg/kg of phenobarbital in vehicle (5% DMSO in corn oil). Untreated group was injected vehicle only. Third group was 7 days on 1% (w/w) cholesterol diet prior vehicle treatment. After 10 hours animals were sacrificed and total RNA was isolated from liver. Total RNA from two animals was pooled resulting in 4 pools per group. These pools were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip MOE430A.
