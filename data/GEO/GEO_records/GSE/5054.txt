TITLE
Effect of INF-gamma and IL1-beta on thyroid cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal primary thyroid cells were incubated with vehicle, 100 IU/ml IFN-gamma, 50 IU/ml IL1-beta, or a combination of both IFN-gamma and IL1-beta for 24 or 72 hours.  The experiment was repeated 5 times using thyroid cells from 5 different patients.   RNA expression was analyzed using Affymetrix HG_U133A arrays for 3 of the thyroids, and HG_U133A_2.0 (small version of HG_U133A)  arrays for 2 of the thyroids. Keywords: cytokine treatments
