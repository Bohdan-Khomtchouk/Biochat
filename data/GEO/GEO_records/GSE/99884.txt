TITLE
Dihydropyrimidine-thiones and clioquinol synergize to target b-amyloid cellular pathologies through a metal-dependent mechanism

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
DHPM-thiones rescue Ab-mediated toxicity in a metal-dependent manner that strongly synergizes with clioquinol, a known metal-binding and cytoprotective compound. RNA-seq experiments reveal a modest, yet specific effect on metal-responsive genes that do not change with the inactive control compound.

DESIGN
Treatment of biological replicates with DMSO, 0.8 uM clioquinol, or 20 uM 10{3,3,1} (DHPM-thione) for ~6 hours prior to harvesting of cells and isolation of total RNA.
