TITLE
Expression data from the mushroom bodies of Drosophila-PKA activity dependent manner

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Temperature preference behavior in Drosophila depends on the level of PKA signaling in the mushroom bodies. To identify new components downstream to PKA, we carried out a genome-wide screen for genes regulated by PKA signaling in the mushroom bodies.

DESIGN
Using the Gal4-UAS system, we increased or decreased PKA activity in the mushroom bodies by expressing dominant-negative (UAS-PKADN) or constitutively active PKA (UAS-PKACA), respectively. Expression of PKA transgenes was targeted to the mushroom bodies using the mushroom body-specific MB247-Gal4 driver. PKA expression was induced for 12-16 hours in three-day-old adults by inactivating the temperature-sensitive Gal80 at the restrictive temperature. We then analyzed gene-expression profiles to identify the genes showing altered expression levels in response to the high or low PKA activity.
