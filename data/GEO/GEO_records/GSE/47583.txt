TITLE
Gene expression analysis of MCF7 breast cancer cells cultured as xenografts, in two dimensional cultures, in polyHEMA anchorage independent three dimansional cell culture models and in Matrigel three dimensional cultures.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The traditional method for studying cancer in vitro is to grow immortalized cancer cells in two-dimensional (2D) monolayers on plastic. However, many cellular features are impaired in these unnatural conditions and big alterations in gene expression in comparison to tumors have been reported. Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models have become increasingly popular and are suggested to be better models than 2D monolayers due to improved cell-to-cell contacts and structures that resemble in vivo architecture.  The aim of this study was to compare gene expression patterns of MCF7 breast cancer cells when grown as xenografts, in 2D, in polyHEMA coated anchorage independent 3D models and in Matrigel on-top 3D cell culture models. Surprisingly small variations in gene expression patterns were observed between the models indicating that 3D and xenograft are not always that different from 2D cell cultures.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of MCF7 breast cancer cells cultured as xenografts for 43 days, in two dimensional cultures for seven days (2D7d), in polyHEMA three dimensional cell culture models for four and seven days (PH7d and PH7d), and in Matrigel three dimensional cultures for four and seven days (MG4d and MG7d). Two biological replicates was included for each sample.
