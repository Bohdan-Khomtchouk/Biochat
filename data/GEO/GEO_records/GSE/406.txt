TITLE
Heat shock - kin82 mutant and wildtype

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Wild type and kin82 mutant under heat shock. Cells grown at 25째C were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in an equal volume of 37째C medium, and returned to 37째C for growth.  Samples were collected at 0, 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after transfer to 37째C. Experimental samples were used to generate Cy5-labeled cDNA probes, whereas mRNA reference pools extracted from cultures of the respective strains grown to early log phase under normal conditions, were used to generate Cy3-labeled cDNA probes.  Cy5- and Cy3-labeled probes were hybridized together to microarrays printed with PCR-amplified fragments, representing 6280 of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORFs. Keywords: time-course
