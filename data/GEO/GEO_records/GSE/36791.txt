TITLE
Gene expression profiling of blood in ruptured intracranial aneurysms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study we aimed to investigate the systemic response to a rupture of intracranial aneurysms by an analysis of global gene expression profiles in peripheral blood cells. In addition, we sought to determine whether this approach could provide biomarkers related to clinical status of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.

DESIGN
Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured aneurysm were prospectively recruited from patients consecutively admitted to the Departments of Neurology or Neurosurgery and Neurotraumatology, University Hospital, Krakow, Poland in 2010 and 2011. Control subjects were recruited from patients of the Department of Neurology suffered from headaches.
