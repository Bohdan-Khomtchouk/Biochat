TITLE
Insert in CovS Gene Distinguishes a Pharyngeal and a Blood Isolate of Streptococcus pyogenes Found in the Same Individual.

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
Expression of the extensive arsenal of virulence factors by Streptococcus pyogenes are controlled by many regulators, of which covR/S is one of the best characterized and can influence ~15% of the genome. Animal models have established that mutants of CovR/S arise spontaneously in vivo resulting in highly invasive organisms. We analyzed a pharyngeal and a blood isolate of S. pyogenes recovered from the same individual 13 days apart. The two isolates varied in many phenotypic properties including speB production, which were reflected in transcriptome analyses. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and partial sequencing of some key genes failed to show any differences except for an 11-base insert in the covS gene in the blood isolate. These results showing that pharyngeal and blood isolates from a single individual which differ by a simple insertion, provide evidence for the model that regulatory gene mutations allow S. pyogenes to invade different niches in the body.

DESIGN
A chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate wild-type cultures of group A Streptococcus, Streptococcus pyogenes UH322 and UH328. Each chip measures the expression level of 1865 genes replicated twice from 7 fully sequenced strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (M1_GAS NC_002737; MGAS10394 NC_006086; MGAS315 NC_004070; MGAS5005 NC_007297; MGAS6180 NC_007296; MGAS8232 NC_003485; SSI-1 NC_004606 with fourteen 24-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
