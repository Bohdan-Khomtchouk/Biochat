TITLE
Expression data from an in vitro growth of Methanobrevibacter smithii PS

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
RNA-sequencing is a powerful tool for exploring expression profiles of microbial species that does not require the production of a custom genechip. We used microarrays to compare our quantitative RNA-sequencing method to the standard expression quantification methods
