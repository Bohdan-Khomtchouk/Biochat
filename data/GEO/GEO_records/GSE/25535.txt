TITLE
Expression data from an in vitro growth of Methanobrevibacter smithii PS

ORGANISM
Methanobrevibacter smithii ATCC 35061

SUMMARY
RNA-sequencing is a powerful tool for exploring expression profiles of microbial species that does not require the production of a custom genechip. We used microarrays to compare our quantitative RNA-sequencing method to the standard expression quantification methods

DESIGN
Methanobrevibacter smithii PS cultures were grown to stationary phase under 80% hydrogen, 20% CO2, with varying amounts of formate.  RNA was extracted and purified, then divided into two aliquots per sample.  One aliquot was prepared for hybridization on Affymetrix gene chips, the other was prepared for microbial RNA-sequencing.
