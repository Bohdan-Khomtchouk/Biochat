TITLE
Competence for reprogramming sex

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used RNA-Seq to compare transcriptomes of chemical reprogramming competent worms versus worms not competent for chemical reprogramming. We also performed RNA-seq during a time course of chemical reprogramming.

DESIGN
Three replicates of each of two reprogramming non-competent strains and three replicates of each of two reprogramming competent strains were collected. For the time course, five time points were analyzed (1, 2, 4, 6, and 18 hours) in either DMSO or DMSO + U0126 in three genotypes (non-reprogramming competent worms, reprogramming competent, and wildtype worms).

PLATFORM
