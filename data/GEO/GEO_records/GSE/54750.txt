TITLE
RNase J is required for processing of a small number of RNAs in Rhodobacter sphaeroides

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
A comparative RNA-seq approach between R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 wild type and an RNase J deletion strain 2.4.1∆rnj revealed the accumulation of different mRNA fragments in the mutant. The structural characteristics of these RNA fragments suggest that RNase J is responsible for the decay of degradation intermediates that cannot serve as substrates for the 3´-to-5´ exoribonucleases.

DESIGN
Total RNA from exponentially grown cultures (OD660 0,4) of 2.4.1 wild type and 2.4.1∆rnj has been isolated in triplicates using the hot phenol method and prepared for sequencing on a Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx machine.
