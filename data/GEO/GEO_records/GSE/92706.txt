TITLE
Differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells to mammary-like organoids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the different expression genes between iPSCs and differentiated mEBs. The purpose of this experiment is to test which stage of mEBs enrich the stem cells that pre-committed to mammary lineage experiment is to test which stage of mEBs enrich the stem cells that pre-committed to mammary lineage.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from iPSCs, 5-d mEBs, and 10-d mEBs for cDNA microarray.
