TITLE
Transcriptional response of Drosophila S2 cells in response the Drosophila C Virus infection (DCV)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We infected Drosophila S2 cells (invitrogen) with Drosophila C virus (DCV) (Multiplicity of Infection = 10), and harvested samples for further analysis at 8 and 24 hours post-infection.

DESIGN
We generated 6 datasets. Each samples was done in duplicate. We thus performed 2 mock infection (S2 medium only), 2 infections harvested 8 hours post-infection, and  2 infections harvested 24 hours post-infection
