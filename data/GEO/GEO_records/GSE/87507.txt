TITLE
Global transcriptome profiling of AtJUB1-OX and WT fruits at mature green (MG) and breaker+7 developmental stages.

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
To understand the AtJUB1 mediated regulation of tomato fruit development. To test how the NAC transcription factor JUNGBRUNNEN1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtJUB1, identical to ANAC042; At2g43000) affects the development of tomato fruits, AtJUB1-GFP was expressed in transgenic tomato plants under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. AtJUB1-GFP fusion protein was previously shown to encode a functionally active transcription factor in Arabidopsis (Wu et al., 2012). We then performed gene expression profiling of fruits from AtJUB1-GFP lines (AtJUB1-OX plants) and non-modified wild-type (WT) plants. Fruits at two developmental stages, namely mature green (MG) and Breaker+7 days (B+7), were analysed. To this end, the pericarp was separated from the rest of the fruits and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extraction. Gene expression analysis was performed using GeneChip Tomato Genome Arrays (Affymetrix). Probe preparation and microarray hybridizations were performed by ATLAS Biolabs (Berlin, Germany).
