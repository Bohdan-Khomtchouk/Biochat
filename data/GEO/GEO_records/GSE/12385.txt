TITLE
Gene expression changes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMC) induced by physical activity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMC) induced by physical activity was investigated in  sedentary middle-aged men (mean age 52.6 years and BMI 29.1) who undertook a 24-week physical activity programme with blood sampling in the pre-exercise period ,  at the end of 24-weeks prescribed physical activity , and following a two-week detraining period.

DESIGN
AgilentTM Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays were utilised to examine the effects of physical activity on mRNA expression profiles of the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMC) at 3 time points (pre-exercise, after 24 weeks physical activity, and at 26 weeks after 2 weeks detraining. There were 12 participants in this programme.
