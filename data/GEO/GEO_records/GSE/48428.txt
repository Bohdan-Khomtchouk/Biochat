TITLE
Expression data from Th17 cells of different origins

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Foxp3 is indispensable for Treg suppressive function, but the stability of Foxp3 has been controversial. In autoimmune arthritis, Th17 cells play a critically important pathological role, but the origin of Th17 cells remains unknown We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression of Th17 cells originated from Foxp3+T cells compared to conventional naive CD4+T cells derived Th17 cells. We also take samples of Treg cells and Th0 cells for the experimetnatl control.

DESIGN
Each T cell subset after the culture was subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
