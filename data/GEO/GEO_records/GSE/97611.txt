TITLE
Disrupted miRNA expression in HAND

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The role of miRNA disregulation in the development of HIV associated Neurocognitive Disorder was assessed in post mortem cerebral tissue. We used microarrays to compare the expression of miRNAs in patient with HIV showing no neurological complications to those with HAND in the presence or absence of active HIV encephalitis
