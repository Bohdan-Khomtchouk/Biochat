TITLE
Disrupted miRNA expression in HAND

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of miRNA disregulation in the development of HIV associated Neurocognitive Disorder was assessed in post mortem cerebral tissue. We used microarrays to compare the expression of miRNAs in patient with HIV showing no neurological complications to those with HAND in the presence or absence of active HIV encephalitis

DESIGN
30 post mortem human neocortex specimens were obtained from the NNTC, several of which had previously been examined using mRNA arrays, and total RNA was extracted, labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix miRNA 3.0 chips to assess specific changes in miRNA expression to provide clues to host genes with altered regulation in HAND.
