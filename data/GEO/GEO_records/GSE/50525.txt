TITLE
Expression data from control siRNA and β-catenin siRNA transfected cultured mouse dermal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
β-catenin activity of dermal cells is crucial for hair follicle neogenesis and strongly suggest that transcriptional target genes of β-catenin pathway are essential for maintaining trichogenicity of dermal cells. We used microarrays to identify genes targeted by the β-catenin pathway that are essential for maintaining the trichogenicity of dermal cells.

DESIGN
Freshly isolated dermal cells from the dorsal skins of C57BL/6 neonates (P0) were cultured for 24 hours and transfected with either control siRNA or β-catenin specific siRNAs (β-catenin siRNA) at a final concentration of 10 nM for 48 hours followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
