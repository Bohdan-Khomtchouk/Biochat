TITLE
Gene expression in primary isolated human myoblast during proliferation, G0 arrest, reactivation and differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A microarray study including two primary isolated human myoblast cell cultures ( samples A and B) was designed in order to detect the differences in global gene expression during four different culture conditions, two actively proliferating and two non-proliferating. Myoblasts were kept long term proliferating (BG0, before G0) followed by G0 arrest (G0), reactivation (AG0, after G0) and finally they were differentiated (Dif). The samples BG0 and AG0 were harvested when cells reached 70-80% confluence. The raw data from gene arrays were normalized, sample A and B were paired and the mean expression value used for further analyses. The four samples were compared to each other in order to detect differences in gene expression between the samples.

DESIGN
Primary isolated human myoblast cells were cultured through four different culture, BG0, G0, AG0 and Dif. Two independent studies were made with primary isolated myoblasts from two different individuals for each of the four culture condition. Thus the number of samples for microarray analyses was 8.
