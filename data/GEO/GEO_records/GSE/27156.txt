TITLE
TGFB signaling effect on cultured NHLF cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGFÎ² activates a signal transduction cascade that results in the microRNAs and genes transcription. The objective of this study is to identify miRNAs which are regulated through TGFB signaling pathway

DESIGN
Cultured NHLF cells at 30-50% confluence were treated with 5 ng/mL TGFB1 or DMSO.

PLATFORM
GPL8227 Agilent-019118 Human miRNA Microarray 2.0 G4470B (miRNA ID version)
