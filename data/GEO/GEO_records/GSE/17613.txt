TITLE
The effects of oxygen treatments on angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in mouse embryoid bodies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study investigates the processes of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in an in vitro mouse Embryoid Body (EB) model while maintaining as closely as possible an in vivo environment that is observed in human and murine placental development. Several studies have documented that human placental development is profoundly influenced by oxygen tension. Further the developing murine embryo also experiences hypoxic conditions prior to parturition, which regulates early organogenesis and embryonic blood vessel formation in vivo.  Embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from 129/SvJ mice were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs) and were subjected to two oxygen treatments: normoxia (21% O2) and hypoxia (2.6%). Hypoxia was achieved in a humidified chamber flushed with 95% N2/5% CO2 until the oxygen level was stably maintained at 2.6%. EBs were transferred on days E8, E12, E15 and E18 to hypoxia or maintained in normoxia. After 2 days of differential oxygen treatments, these EBs were analyzed at E10, E14, E17 and E20 respectively.

DESIGN
A 4 x 2, reference-based, experimental design was utilized consisting of 4 timepoints (E10, E14, E17 and E20) subjected to 2 oxygen treatments (normoxia, hypoxia)  with n=4 biological replicates present in each group. All EB samples were handled in parallel through all experimental steps. Each EB RNA sample was amplified, labeled with Cy5, and compared to the same Mouse Universal Reference RNA sample (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that was amplified and labeled with Cy3 dye. No dye swaps were utilized.
