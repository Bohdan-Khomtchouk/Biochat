TITLE
The effect of maternal diets on transcriptome profiling of in vivo bovine pre-implantation embryos

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Early embryonic development is enhanced in Holstein cows fed diets enriched in specific polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, the molecular mechanisms affected by specific polyunsaturated fatty acids during early embryonic development in cattle are poorly understood. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the maternal effects of diets enriched in linoleic or α-linolenic acid on transcriptome profiling of in vivo bovine pre-implantation embryos.

DESIGN
Non-lactating Holstein cows were blocked by parity and body weight, and assigned to one of three diets supplemented with rolled oilseeds: canola (n=8, high in oleic acid; control; CAN), sunflower (n=7, high in linoleic acid; SUN) or flax (n=8, high in α-linolenic acid; FLX). n is the number of maternal cows involved in each group. After a minimum of 35 d diet adaptation, ovarian status was synchronized and superstimulated by follicle-stimulating hormone treatments. Cows were artificially inseminated twice, 12h apart, with semen of the same sire. Once initiated, cows remained on the same diet until the end of the experiment.
