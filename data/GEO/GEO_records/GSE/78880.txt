TITLE
Embryonic exposure to 100 µg/L lead results in sex-specific expression changes in genes associated with neurological system and cancer in the aged adult zebrafish brain [female]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Developmental lead (Pb) exposure has been linked to neurological health issues appearing in children. Results from non-human primate studies also suggest detrimental effects of an early life Pb exposure on neurological health, showing a pathological evidence of Alzheimer’s disease in the aged animal brain. To elucidate the impacts of a developmental Pb exposure on neurological health-related molecular changes occurring in the aged brain, aged zebrafish with a control treatment or an embryonic exposure to 100 µg/L Pb were subjected to a zebrafish-specific microarray analysis by sex. Gene ontology analysis showed alterations in distinct sets of genes associated with nervous system development and function in each sex. In aged adult female zebrafish, significant changes in expression profiles occurred in a number of genes involved in neurological disease and nervous system development and function. On the other hand, in aged adult males, a number of genes with significant expression alterations were found to be associated with cancer and tumors.

DESIGN
Global gene expression changes induced by a developmental exposure to 100ppb lead (Pb) were analyzed in 12 months aged adult male (1 fish brain per sample; N=3 for control group, N=3 for Pb exposed group) and female (1 fish brain per sample; N=3 for control group, N=3 for Pb exposed group) zebarfish brains. A developmental Pb exposure was performed shortly after fertilization until 72 hours after fertilization.
