TITLE
Transcript profiling of Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells from mice reconstituted with wild type and necdin null fetal liver cells following a sublethal dose of irradiation (6,5 Gy)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
compare the gene expression profile between irradiated Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells from mouse bone marrow reconstituted with wild type and necdin null fetal liver cells The Affymetrix oligonucleotide array was used for this analysis
