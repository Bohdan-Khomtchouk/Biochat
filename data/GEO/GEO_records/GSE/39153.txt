TITLE
Transcript profiling of Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells from mice reconstituted with wild type and necdin null fetal liver cells following a sublethal dose of irradiation (6,5 Gy)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
compare the gene expression profile between irradiated Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells from mouse bone marrow reconstituted with wild type and necdin null fetal liver cells The Affymetrix oligonucleotide array was used for this analysis

DESIGN
compare the gene expression profile betweenirradiated Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells from mouse bone marrow reconstituted with wild type and necdin null fetal liver cells
