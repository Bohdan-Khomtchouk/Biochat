TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis suspension cells overexpressing LHW and T5L1-GFP

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant vascular tissues are essential for the existence of land plants. Many studies have revealed the process underlying the development of vascular tissues. However, the initiation of vascular development is still a mystery. LONESOME HIGHWAY (LHW), which encodes a bHLH transcription factor, is expressed in the initial step of vascular development in roots. LHW and TMO5 LIKE1 (T5L1) interact each other and function as a heterodimer. Here, we identified specific genes downstream of  LHW-T5L1 with transformed suspension culture cells in microarray experiments.

DESIGN
To identify genes downstream of LHW-T5L1, we collected three samples at 0h and 12h with or without estrogen with triplicates.
