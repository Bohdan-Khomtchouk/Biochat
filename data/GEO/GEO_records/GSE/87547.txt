TITLE
Randomized CRISPR-Cas transcriptional perturbation screening identifies individual and combinations of genes that protect against alpha-synuclein toxicity

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We compared transcriptome profile of ITox2C strain expressing dCas9-VP64 (aka screen strain) that express gRNA 9-1 with those expressing no gRNA

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303 expressing SNCA and dCas9-VP64 (screen strain) with gRNA 9-1 or no gRNA (negative control) were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicates, using Illumina HiSeq.

PLATFORM
GPL13821 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
