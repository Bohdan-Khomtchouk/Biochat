TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion collections chemogenomic screen with sr7575

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Growth assay in the presence of a toxic chemical (sr7575) that uses the barcoded collections of yeast gene deletions (haploid, diploid, DamP) to identify deletion strains that are hypersensitive to the drug.
