TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion collections chemogenomic screen with sr7575

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Growth assay in the presence of a toxic chemical (sr7575) that uses the barcoded collections of yeast gene deletions (haploid, diploid, DamP) to identify deletion strains that are hypersensitive to the drug.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment – growth of a pool of strains in the presence or absence of the drug. Two independent biological replicates for each collection (haploids - homozygous and diploids – heterozigous). Data for the article: Shriya Raj, Karthik Krishnan, David S Askew, Olivier Helynck, Peggy Suzanne, Aureslien Lesnard, Sylvain Rault, Ute Zeidler, Christophe d'Enfert, Jean-Paul Latgé, Hélène Munier-Lehmann and Cosmin Saveanu. Toxicity of a novel antifungal compound is modulated by ERAD components. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.
