TITLE
Profiling 11,639 genes in PBMCs from 2 donors: U133 A 2.0 Custom CDF Version 9

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The immune responses generated by YF-17D by profiling 11,639 genes in PBMCs from 2 donors cultured with YF-17D vaccine were accessed after 3 and 12 hours. Keywords: time course, in vitro stimulaion

DESIGN
PMBCs were isolated with citrate buffered cell preparation tubes (CPT) from 2 healthy donors who were not previously vaccinated with YF-17D.  Total RNA was either isolated directly from the freshly collected cells or after cell culture.  Cells were cultured for 3 and 12 hours in the presence or absence of YF-17D vaccine.
