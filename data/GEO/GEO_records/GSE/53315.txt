TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from human coronary artery endothelial cells treated with HDL components

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We quantified differential microRNA (miRNA) expression in human coronary artery cells treated with native HDL, reconstituted HDL, lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I, small unilamellar vesicles, or PBS control. These data were used to determine whichmiRNAs are regulated by native HDL compared to components of HDL and categorize data based on shared sets of miRNAs and distinct sets of miRNAs regulated by each component.

DESIGN
Each group had a n=5 and gene expression changes for each condition were compared to control PBS-treat HCAECs
