TITLE
Single-cell transcriptomics reveals receptor transformations during olfactory neurogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report RNA sequencing of single olfactory neurons from mouse olfactory epithelium in developmental progression from progenitors to precursors to immature neurons to mature neurons. Most mature neurons expressed only one of ~ 1000 odorant receptor genes (Olfrs) at high levels, whereas many immature neurons expressed low levels of multiple Olfrs.

DESIGN
Investigating expression of odorant receptors genes in mouse olfactory sensory neurons during development.
