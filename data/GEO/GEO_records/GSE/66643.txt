TITLE
Transcriptomic Evaluation of Pyrococcus furiosus strains engineered to produce 3HP

ORGANISM
Pyrococcus furiosus COM1

SUMMARY
A hybrid array setup containing WT Pyrococcus furiosus genes plus heterologous genes for engineered pathway producing 3HP from maltose and CO2 was used to study the impact of heterlogous pathway on native metabolic systems Four different experiments were run: 1) Pfu WT vs Pfu COM1; 2) Pfu COM1 vs MW56 (strain containing 3 heterologous genes from Metallosphaera sedula for production of 3HP); 3) Pfu COM1 vs MW76 at 72C before and after 3HP production; 4) MW76 at 72C before and after 3HP production at high agitation
