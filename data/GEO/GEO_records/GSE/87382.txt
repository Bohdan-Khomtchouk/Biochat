TITLE
Dietary medium-chain saturated fatty acids induce gene expression of energy metabolism-related pathways in adipose tissue of abdominally obese subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High MC-SFA intake resulted in a downregulation of gene expression of pathways related to complement system and inflammation, and an upregulation of gene expression of pathways related to citric acid cycle, electron transport chain and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue. Based on our results, we hypothesize that the beneficial effects of MC-SFAs on prevention of fat accumulation may be mediated by increases in gene expression related to energy metabolism in the adipose tissue. Additionally, decreases in inflammation-related gene expression in the adipose may potentially have beneficial effects in relation to cardiometabolic diseases.

DESIGN
In this 12 week, randomized, double-blind, diet intervention study, participants consumed 60 g milk protein (whey or casein) and 63 g milk fat (high MC-SFA or low MC-SFA) daily in a 2 by 2 factorial design. We used microarrays to measure whole genome gene expression in adipose tissue in a subpopulation of 12 participants, 6 in the casein + low MC-SFA group and 6 in the casein + high MC-SFA group, before and after intervention.
