TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of MCF10A cells exressing active mutant YAP-5SA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the direct target genes YAP transcription co-activator invovled with in gonome-wide levels, next generation sequencing was conducted in Flag-YAP-5SA overexpressing MCF10A cells using Flag (sigma) antibody.

DESIGN
Genomic profiles bound by YAP was generated in MCF10A expressing Flag-YAP-5SA using Illumina's Hi-Seq

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
