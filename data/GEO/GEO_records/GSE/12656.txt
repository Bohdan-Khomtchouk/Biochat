TITLE
Systems biology analysis of Korean red ginseng effects on Immobilization stressed mice brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we present molecular mechanisms of Korean red ginseng (KRG) on immobilization stresses Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Mice were divided into three groups (3 mice / group): control, stress + no treat, and stress + Korean Red Ginseng (KRG, 100 mg). Stress + KRG group were given KRG  100 mg orally for 7 days and then exposed to immobilization stress for 45 min. stress + no treat group were administrated with phosphate buffer saline (d-PBS, pH 7.4) together with IMO stress for 45 min.
