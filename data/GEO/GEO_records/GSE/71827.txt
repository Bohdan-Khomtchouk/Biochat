TITLE
Transgenic overexpression of Pla2g10 display alopecia and epidermal hyperplasia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray gene profiling of skin from PLA2G10-Tg mice in comparison with that from control mice yielded data for explaining the overall tendency of Tg skin to show hair follicle distortion and epidermal hyperplasia associated with hyperkeratosis in the absence of inflammation

DESIGN
Pla2g10-Tg/+ mice and littermate controls (C57BL/6 background); 25-day old; skin; pooled from 4 mice for each genotype.

PLATFORM
GPL2872 Agilent-012694 Whole Mouse Genome G4122A (Feature Number version)
