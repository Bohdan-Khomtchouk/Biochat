TITLE
Transcription Factor RFX2 Is a Key Regulator of Mouse Spermiogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify RFX2-dependent genes during spermatogenesis, We chose 24-day-old wild-type and mutant testes samples. Spermiogenesis in mutants was normal before this time point while massive round spermatids detached from the tubules thereafter. RNAs were isolated from the total testicular cells.

DESIGN
we carried out RNA-seq analysis using P24 wild-type and mutant testes samples.Two biological replicates were included for each genotype.
