TITLE
Gene expression in Kras-driven lung tumors in mice fed with standard or high calorie diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The results provide information on the gene expression in dissected  KrasG12D-driven lung tumor in mice. Mice were fed on high-calorie diet starting 3 months before tumor induction. Dissected tumors were obtained 11 weeks after tumor induction.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from Kras-driven lung tumors of mice fed with standard diet or high calorie diet
