TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of MNT-1 cell under hyperosmotic condition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the effect of hyperosmotic stress on melanoma cell line, we performed a gene expression microarray analysis from RNAs isolated from MNT-1 cells treated by sucrose or not

DESIGN
Duplicate experiments were performed on MNT-1 cells before and after sucrose treatments for 7 days. In each experiment, the total RNA was isolated from the MNT-1 cells that had been independently cultured using trizole (Invitrogen). The total RNA was reverse-transcribed, amplified, and hybridized onto an Agilent Human GE 4x44K V2 chip according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol.
