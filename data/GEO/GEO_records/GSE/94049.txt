TITLE
mRNA profiling after Inhibition of the lncRNA Ntep

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the effect of inhibition of Ntep on 3T3 cells, we treated cells for 48h with GapmeR control or Gapmer against Ntep Afterwards total RNA was isolated and used for microarray profiling.

DESIGN
Inhibition of Ntep in 3T3 for 48h

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
