TITLE
Genome-wide analysis reveals determinants of redundant and specific binding within a transcription factor family

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A central question in transcription factor biology is how a specific member of a transcription factor family occupies a promoter in vivo, when all family members bind the same consensus site in vitro.  To uncover the mechanisms regulating DNA binding specificity within transcription factor families, we have used the techniques of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with genome-wide microarray analysis to query the occupancy of three members of the ETS transcription factor family in a human T-cell line.  Unexpectedly, redundant occupancy was frequently detected while specific occupancy was less likely.  An unbiased bioinformatics approach correlated redundant binding with consensus ETS binding sequences near transcription start sites, whereas specific binding sites diverged dramatically from the consensus, were coupled with a site for a cooperative binding partner, and were found further from transcription start sites.  The specific and redundant DNA binding modes illustrate the regulation of transcription factor specificity in vivo and suggest two distinct roles for members of the ETS transcription factor family.
