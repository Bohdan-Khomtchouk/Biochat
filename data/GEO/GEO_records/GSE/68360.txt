TITLE
Genome-wide expression profile of livers from mice fed HFD,SO-HFD or Viv chow [RNAseq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Aim of the study is to identify changes in hepatic gene expression induced by either a 40kcal% coconut oil rich high fat diet (HFD), a 40kcal% soybean oil plus coconut oil high fat diet (SO-HFD) or a low fat vivarium chow diet (Viv).  Methods: Livers from mice that had been fed one of the above mentioned diets for 35 weeks, were used to make cDNA libraries that were then sent for deep sequencing, using the Illumina TruSeq RNA. Result: Many genes involved in metabolism, lipid binding, transport and storage and many Cyp genes are dysregulated in the two high fat diets as compared to Viv HFDs in SO-HFD mice. Comparing the two HFDs shows more metabolism and disease related genes  dysregulated in SO-HFD vs HFD. Conclusion: A diet high in soybean oil may be more detrimental to metabolic health than a diet high in saturated fats.

DESIGN
cDNA isolated from livers from mice fed HFD, SO-HFD or Viv for 35 weeks, were 50bp pair-ended sequenced in triplicate using Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep v2 Kit.
