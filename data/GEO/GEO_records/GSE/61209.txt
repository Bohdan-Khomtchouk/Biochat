TITLE
RNA-seq profiling of transcriptomes of control and Hif1a mutant E12.5 hearts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: to identify genes aberrantly expressed upon myocardial ablation of Hif1a Methods: a floxed Hif1a allele was deleted in mouse embryonic hearts using a NXK2.5Cre line. Total RNA was extracted from E12.5 hearts (n=3 for controls and mutants) usinz Trizol and processed for RNA-seq. Reads were mapped to Mm10 reference genome using TopHat2 and Bowtie2. Transcript expression values were determined after transcript normalization with AltAnalyze Results: this analysis revealed a total of 1451 genes significantely (|Fold| > 20% and P < 0.05) modulated in Hif1a cKO hearts

DESIGN
6 total RNAseq runs with 3 experimental samples and 3 controls samples

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
