TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of a mouse model of alveolar soft part sarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to dtermine how well a mouse genetic model of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) mimics the human disease, five human ASPS tumor samples and three normal skeletal muscle samples were profiled by RNAseq and compared to samples from five mouse tumors induced by expression of ASPSCR1-TFE3 and three normal mouse skeletal muscle samples, also profiled by RNAseq.

DESIGN
The reference was really comparing 5 human ASPS tumors to 5 mouse tumors that histologically mimic ASPS, but using skeletal muscle controls (3 from each species) as a sounding board for differential expression.
