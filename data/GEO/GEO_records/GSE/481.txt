TITLE
Allergen-induced goblet cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High numbers of goblet cells in airways contribute to the mucus obstruction characteristic of asthmatic airways.  Allergen challenged mice exhibit robust expression of goblet cells within airway surface epithelium.  This study looks at the temporal analysis of IL-13 exposed murine airways to elucidate pathways that result in differentiation of airway epithelial cells to goblet cells. Keywords: other
