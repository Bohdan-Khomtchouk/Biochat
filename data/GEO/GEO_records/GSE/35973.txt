TITLE
Gene expression levels in colon cancer cells with mutant K-ras under hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify those genes that were differentially expressed in colon cancer cells with mutant K-ras under hypoxic conditions

DESIGN
DKS-5 (K-ras mutant) and DKO-3 (K-ras wild-type) were cultured in normoxic (21% O2) and 12-hour hypoxic (1% O2) conditions.  This was repeated for a total of 2 samples per condition.
