TITLE
High-throughput SuperSAGE for transcript profiling in berry tissues of Vitis vinifera L. under different light regimes

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
SuperSAGE is a method of digital gene expression profiling that allows isolation of 26bp tag fragments from expressed transcripts. Because its tag size is larger than that of conventional SAGE, SuperSAGE allowed a secure tag-to-gene annotation using BLAST search against grape genome databases.Transcript profiles in nine samples of grape berry tissues under different light conditions were obtained by SuperSAGE analysis and used for screening the genes which have co-ordinated transcript profiles with the change in the flavonoid composition in the samples analyzed. Candidate genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis and regulation were identified.

DESIGN
Nine different grape samples, i.e., flowers, grape berries of Cabernet Sauvignon at 2, 7, 9 weeks after flowering (WAF), berry skins at 17 days after flowering (DAF) shaded after flowering, and berry skins at 17DAF shaded from flowering to 14DAF and then light exposed, were analyzed.
