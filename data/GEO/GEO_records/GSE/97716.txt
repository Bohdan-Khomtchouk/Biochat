TITLE
Lin37 is essential for repression of cell-cycle genes in quiescence

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The DREAM complex represses cell-cycle gene transcription in quiescence. To investigate the role of the DREAM component Lin37, we created Lin37 knockout cells by CRISPR/Cas9-nickase. pRTS episomal vectors expressing luciferase or Lin37 were introduced in two independent knockout clones (411-27 and 632-2) to create Lin37 knockout and rescue cells. To exit the cell cycle and to enter quiescence, cells were serum starved for 60h. RNA-seq was applied to identify genes de-regulated by loss of Lin37 during quiescence.

DESIGN
The following samples are included: clone 411-27 – two biological replicates of each Lin37 knockout and rescue cells; clone 632-2 – two biological and one technical replicate for both Lin37 knockout and rescue cells
