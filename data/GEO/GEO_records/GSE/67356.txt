TITLE
Increased level of glutathione contributes to stress tolerances and global translational changes in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Polysomal profiling results showed that global translation was enhanced in roots after 8 h and in shoots after 24 h of GSH treatment. By performing transcriptomic analyses of steady-state and polysome-bound mRNAs in GSH-treated plants, we reveal that GSH has more a greatersubstantial impact on translational change.

DESIGN
GSH-induced gene expression in Arabidopsis roots and shoots was measured seperately at 8 and 24 hours after exposure to 100 Î¼M GSH. Two independent experiments were performed at each time (8 or 24 hours).
