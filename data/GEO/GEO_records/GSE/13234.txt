TITLE
Human activated Treg cells and retrovirally engineered Th cells, transduced with GARP, FOXP3 or control GFP vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Goals and objectives of this study: to identify genes of the Treg signature induced by consitutive expression of GARP or FOXP3 in antigen-specific Th cells with potential role for stabililization & maintenance of the regulatory program. Keywords: T-cell receptor stimulation, gene-regulation, comparative gene expression profiling, cell type comparison, human, regulatory T cells, FOXP3, GARP

DESIGN
Human alloantigen-specific Treg cells (THU) and Th cells (CD4-39), established and described recently (Ocklenburg et al.. Lab Invest.2006; 86: 724-737), were sitmulated for 3 days  with cognate antigen (EBV B cells) and IL2 as described  (Ocklenburg et al.. Lab Invest.2006; 86: 724-737) and analyzed using human Affymetrix U133 2.0 in monoplicate. Th cells had been transduced with a retroviral vector containing human GARP (LRRC32) or FOXP3 and an IRES-driven GFP as marker or empty GFP control, sorted for GFP+, expanded as described recently (Ocklenburg et al.. Lab Invest.2006; 86: 724-737), and characterized functially, phenotypically, and genetically as described (WO/2007/113301). Abbreviations: Treg THU d3 = alloantigen-specific Treg cells; GFP d3 = GFP-transduced alloantigen-specific Th cells (CD4-39); FoxP3 d3 = FOXP-transduced alloantigen-specific Th cells (CD4-39); Garp d3 = GARP-transduced alloantigen-specific Th cells (CD4-39); all stimulated for 3 days (=d3) with EBV B cells and IL2.
