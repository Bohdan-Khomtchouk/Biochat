TITLE
NBAT1 overexpression effect on breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells overexpressing lncRNA neuroblastoma associated transcript 1 (NBAT1). Results provide insight into the function of NBAT1 in breast cancer.

DESIGN
NBAT1 overexpressed in breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 compared to control (empty vector alone). Three replicates of each treatment were analyzed.
