TITLE
Comparison of the migration profile of MSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare the gene expression profile of MSCs harvested from bone marrow in the context of cell migration.

DESIGN
A total of 4 MSCs isolated from different donors were used.  Duplicate samples were used for each hybridization.  The experiment was repeated twice.  CEL files obtained were imported into Partek Genomics suite for analysis.  The final processed data were obtained from selecting for genes that have at least 2-fold difference in expression.  The gene list was further narrow down to the keywords cell adhesion, chemokine, cytokine, and metalloproteinases.
