TITLE
Transcriptome analyses of the Corynebacterium glutamicum strains adapted to supraoptimal growth temperatures

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum

SUMMARY
C. glutamicum strains adapted to higher growth temperatures were obtained through an adaptive laboratory evolution experiment. To elucidate molecular basis for thermotolerance acquired by the evolved strains, we examined transcriptional responses of the evolved and parental strains to thermal stress using microarray technology.

DESIGN
Each strain was grown at the optimal growth temperature (33 ℃). When OD610 reached around 7, the growth temperature increased to 41 ℃, and transcriptional changes of the evolved and parental strains were examined with microarray technology.
