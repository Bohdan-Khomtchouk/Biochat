TITLE
Similar gene expression profiles of sporadic, PGL2-, and SDHD-linked paragangliomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The similarity in gene-expression profiles suggest that PGL2, like SDHD, is involved in the functionality of the SDH complex, and that tumor formation in these three subgroups involves the same pathways as in SDH linked paragangliomas. We were not able to clarify the identity of PGL2 on 11q13. The lack of differential gene-expression of chromosome 11 genes might indicate that chromosome 11 loss, as demonstrated in SDHD-linked paragangliomas, is an important feature in the formation of a paraganglioma regardless of the genetic background. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profiles of sporadic (n=7), SDHD- (n=6) and PGL2-linked (n=4) head and neck paraganglioma.
