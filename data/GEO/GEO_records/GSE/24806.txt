TITLE
Gene expression of Ewing tumor cell line SBSR-AKS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ewing tumor cell line SBSR-AKS grows adherent to the culture vessel. A spontaneously derived sub-line of cell line SBSR-AKS shows growth in suspension. We used microarrays to analyse gene expression in these Ewing tumor cell lines

DESIGN
Established Ewing tumor cell lines were grown under standard conditions
