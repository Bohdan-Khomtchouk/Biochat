TITLE
The Chimeric Oncoprotein TLS-CHOP Represses Expression of the Anticancer Cytokine MDA-7/IL-24 in Myxoid Liposarcoma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The TLS-CHOP fusion protein is found in the majority of human myxoid liposarcomas (MLS), and is thought to have oncogenic functions.  Until now, however, the molecular function of TLS-CHOP for oncogenesis is still elusive.  In this report, we have revealed that knockdown of TLS-CHOP by specific siRNA in MLS-derived cell lines inhibits cell growth and leads to cell death.  Thus, TLS-CHOP may be a promising therapeutic target for MLS treatment. Thus we explored the target genes of TLS-CHOP influence cell-proliferation or cell death with microarray.

DESIGN
We compared the whole mRNA profiles of cells treated with TLS-CHOP siRNA or control oligo in two myxoid liposarcoma cell-line.
