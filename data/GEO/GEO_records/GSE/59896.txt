TITLE
Gene expression profiling of dectin-1 and NFAT responsive genes in dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study provides the dectin-1 and NFAT responsive genes for 2h and 4h of curdlan treatment. Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0ST Arrays were used to profile gene expression in curdlan-stimulated D1 cells (2h or 4h exposure) that had been treated or not with FK506 for the duration of culture.

DESIGN
Dendritic cell line D1 was treated with curdlan for 2h and 4h, and curdlan + Fk506 for 2h and 4h in three replicate.
