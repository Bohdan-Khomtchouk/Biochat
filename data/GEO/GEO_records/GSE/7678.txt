TITLE
miRNA34 expression in SW480 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SW480 were stably transfected with an episomal plasmid expressing GFP and miRNA34 from a bidirectional doxycyclin regulatable promoter (Bornkamm et al Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Sep 7;33(16)). Polyclonal cell lines were obtained by selection with Hygromycin at 350ug/ml for 10 days. The cell llnes identified as GFP only express GFP, whereas the cell lines identified as miRNA34a express both GFP and miRNA34 under doxycyclin control. For the present experiment, cells were treated with 1ug/ml Docycyclin for 72h. Cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). After RNA cleanup (RNeasy, Qiagen) Affymetrix 133 Plus 2.0 micorarrays were hybridized using standard techniques. Keywords: Cell line transfection

DESIGN
2 cell lines with transfected miRNA34a with doxycyclin treatment, 2 cell lines with miRNA34a but without doxycyclin treatment, 2 cell lines with transfected GFP with doxycyclin treatment, and 2 cell lines with GFP but without doxycylin treatment.  One array for per sample. The log-transformed probe-set values and the results of the statistical analysis for each probe-set, and the associated README file, are included as Supplementary files.
