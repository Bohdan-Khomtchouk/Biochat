TITLE
Gene expression profiling of retinoic acid (RA)-treated embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from Elongin A+/+ and Elongin A-/- ES cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify potential Elongin A targets during neuronal differentiation of ES cells, a cDNA microarray analysis comparing embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from Elongin A+/+ ES cells and Elongin A-/- ES cells was performed.

DESIGN
Gene expression in EBs derived from Elongin A+/+ and Elongin A-/- ES cells was measured at day 4 after retinoic acid treatment (2 Î¼M).
