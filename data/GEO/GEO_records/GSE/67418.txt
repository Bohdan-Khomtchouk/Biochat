TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In addition to transcriptional regulation, mRNA degradation critically contributes to gene expression as shown by various biological analysis. The CCR4-NOT complex serves as a major deadenylase that initiates mRNA degradation. We used microarrays to identify CCR4-NOT targets by searching for genes specifically stablized in the absence of CNOT3, a core subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex.

DESIGN
Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. CNOT3-knockdown MEFs were generated by Cre-mediated somatic recombination. We treated both control and CNOT-knockdown (CNOT3KD) MEFs with a transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D to focus on a stability of mRNAs.
