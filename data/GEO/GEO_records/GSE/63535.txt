Transcriptome profiling of mouse embryonic fibroblasts upon contact inhibition

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromatin modifying activities for construction of appropriate epigenetic landscapes by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) play an essential role in development and tumorigenesis. However, the spatiotemporal mechanisms by which PRC2 achieves diverse epigenomes for specific tissue or cellular contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we discovered that LATS2 knockout causes dysregulation of PRC2 and subsequent transcriptome changes for differentiation in both mouse and human cells. LATS2 depletion dependent dysregulation of PRC2 also effects H3K4me3 and forms negative feedback loop for maintenance of PRC2. Further analyses reveal that LATS2 on chromatin binds to EZH2 and LATS2 has ability to phosphorylate PRC2 in vitro. These LATS2 dependent H3K27me3 targets are highly induced during neurogenesis, and statistical analysis of glioblastoma multiforme reveals that LATS2-high cases show more dedifferentiated transcriptome and poor prognosis with silencing of H3K27me3 targets. These observations suggest that LATS2-mediated epigenome coordination is pivotal for development and disease, including cancer.

DESIGN
The labeled cRNAs from MEFs in two different culture conditions (low density vs high density culture) were subjected to Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F in dye swap setup, resulting in two individual microarrays.
