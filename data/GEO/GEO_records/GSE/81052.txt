TITLE
Comparison of wt, Krt18+/- and Krt18-/- non-tumorous liver tissues at the age of 3, 6 and 12 months [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the different genotypes of non-tumorous mouse livers in 3 different ages revealed more genetic alterations in Krt18-/- and Krt18+/- compared to wt livers. This speaks in favor of a higher genomic instability being causally related to K-deficiency and aging, even at a preneoplastic stage.

DESIGN
Wild type healthy liver tissue vs. healthy Krt18+/- / healthy Krt18-/- at the age of 3, 6 and 12 months (35 samples)

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
