TITLE
Identification of the altered transcripts in the NMF291–/– cerebellum by exon array.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The U2 snRNA is a basal component of the major spliceosome, which is responsible for > 90% human pre-mRNA splicing. A 5-nucleotide deletion in one of the mouse U2 snRNA genes (Rnu2-8) causes cerebellar granule cell degeneration in the NMF291 mouse mutant strain. To identify the altered transcripts in the NMF291–/– cerebellum, we interograted Affy. mouse 1.0 ST Exon arrays with total RNAs from three postnatal-30-day (P30) wild type and three NMF291–/– cerebella.

DESIGN
Affy. mouse 1.0 ST Exon arrays were hybridized with total RNAs derived from three P30 female wild type and NMF291–/– mice (biological replicates).
