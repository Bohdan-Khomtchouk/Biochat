TITLE
The transcriptome of human epicardial, mediastinal and subcutaneous adipose tissues in men with coronary artery disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The biological functions of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) remain largely elusive. However, the proximity of EAT to the coronary arteries suggests a role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Objectives of this study were to identify genes that are up- or down-regulated among three adipose tissues (AT), namely EAT, mediastinal (MAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) and to study their possible relationships with the development of cardiovascular diseases. Samples were collected from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries. Gene expression was evaluated in all three AT depots of six men using the llluminaÂ® HumanWG-6 v3.0 expression BeadChips. Twenty-two and 73 genes were up-regulated in EAT compared to mediastinal and subcutaneous AT, respectively. Ninety-four genes were down-regulated in EAT compared to subcutaneous adipose depot. However, none were significantly down-regulated in EAT compared to mediastinal fat. More specifically, the expression of the adenosine A1 receptor (ADORA1), involved in myocardial ischemia, was significantly up-regulated in EAT. Levels of the prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) gene, recently associated with the progression of atherosclerosis, were significantly different in the three pairwise comparisons (epicardial > mediastinal > subcutaneous). The results of ADORA1 and PTGDS were confirmed by qPCR in 25 biological replicates. Overall, the transcriptional profiles of EAT and MAT were similar compared to the subcutaneous compartment. Despite this similarity, two genes involved in cardiovascular diseases, ADORA1 and PTGDS, were up-regulated in EAT. These results provide insights about the biology of EAT and its potential implication in CAD.
