TITLE
E. coli imp fabI(G93V) Mutant Cells: Control (E. coli imp fabI(G93V) ) vs. NTG-treated E. coli imp fabI(G93V)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of NTG-treated E. coli imp fabI(G93V) cells compared to control cells (E. coli imp fabI(G93V) ) in the absence or presence of sub-lethal concentration of triclosan.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiments with NTG-treated E. coli imp fabI(G93V) vs. control E. coli imp fabI(G93V). Biological replicates: 1 control (E. coli imp fabI(G93V) cell), 1 sample (NTG-treated E. coli imp fabI(G93V) cell), independently grown and harvested. Two replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL5482 Escherichia coli 5K oligo microarray
