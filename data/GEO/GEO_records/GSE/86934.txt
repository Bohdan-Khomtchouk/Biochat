TITLE
microRNA profiles from dorsal raphe and amygdala of high-responder and low-responder rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report 33 microRNAs are differentially expressed in the dorsal raphe and/or amygdala of rats selectively bred for high and low locomotor response to novelty (high responder and low responder rats)

DESIGN
microRNA profiles were generated from 4 tissue samples per region (dorsal raphe and amygdala) and per rat strain (high responder and low responder) were
