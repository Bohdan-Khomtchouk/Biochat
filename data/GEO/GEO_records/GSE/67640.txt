TITLE
Expression and methylation array analysis of CD19+ B-cells from Chronic lymhocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and age matched healthy donor samples [Expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome sequencing revealed CLL as a disease of the genome and epigenome defined by somatic mutations and aberrant DNA-methylation. To uncover the impact of aberrant methylation on transcription, gene expression and methylation array profiling was performed in CLL and B-cells.  RNA from 13 CLL patients and 6 healthy donor samples was analyzed on expression arrays.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from CD19+ sorted B-cells and CLL cells using the DNA/RNA all prep Kit (Qiagen). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood by density centrifugation using Biocoll. CD19+ PBMCs were purified using CD19 Micro Beads for magnetic positive selection.
