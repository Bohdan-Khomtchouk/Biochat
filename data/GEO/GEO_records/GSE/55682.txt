TITLE
Baf250a orchestrates an epigenetic pathway to repress the Nkx2.5-directed contractile cardiomyocyte program in the sinoatrial node

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We specifically deleted Baf250a in the SAN by using Hcn4-CreERT2 mice. We performed mRNA-seq to identify dysregulated genes in the SAN after deletion of Baf250a. To identify direct targets of Baf250a and sequential transcriptional events after deletion of Baf250a in the SAN, we performed mRNA-seq at 6 time points. i.e. 0 hr (tamoxifen treatment), 16 hr after tamoxifen treatment, 20 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, and 6 days after tamoxifen treatment.

DESIGN
mRNA-seq were performed at 0 hr, 16 hr, 20 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, and 6 days after tamoxifen treatment.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
