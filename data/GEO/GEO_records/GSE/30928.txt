TITLE
Role and function of MYC in BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the function of MYC in ALL, we isolated bone marrow cells from conditional MYC knockout mice and transformed them with BCR-ABL1. In a second transduction the BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B cells were transformed either with CRE or empty vector control.

DESIGN
Three days post transduction, total RNA of GFP positive sorted cells were extracted and subjected to gene expression analysis.
