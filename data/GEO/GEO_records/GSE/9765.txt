TITLE
Microarray analysis of rice plants irradiated with carbon ion beams (HIMAC)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
In this study, carbon-ion beams generated via the heavy-ion medical accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) were targeted to growing rice seedlings (7-days-old) to examine their effect on this genome model. Both physiological parameters, such as growth, and molecular events, specially the gene expression profiles were examined immediately after irradiation (at 270 Gy dose) by rice oligo (22K) DNA microarrays. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of radiation-response genes in rice provides us with first report on how our radioactive environment affects a plant species. Keywords: Irradiation response
