TITLE
Expression analysis of human osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS sarcospheres, hypoxia-induced sarcospheres and TGF-beta1-induced sarcospheres

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Invastigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in human osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS sarcospheres,hypoxia-induced sarcospheres and TGF-beta1 induced sarcospheres.

DESIGN
A three chip study using total RNA cover from three cultures of  human osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS sarcospheres, hypoxia-induced sarcospheres and TGF-beta1-induced sarcospheres. Each chip measures the expression level of 45033 genes from osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS.
