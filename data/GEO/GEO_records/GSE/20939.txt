TITLE
Genetic and Epigenetic Somatic Alterations in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas Are Globally Coordinated but Not Locally Targeted (Affymetrix Copy Number)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Solid tumors, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), arise as a result of genetic and epigenetic alterations in a sustained stress environment. Since it has been hypothesized that epigenetic alterations may act by providing the second carcinogenic hit in gene silencing, we sought to identify genome-wide DNA copy number alterations and CpG dinucleotide methylation events and examine the global/local relationships between these types of alterations in HNSCC. Importantly, we found that the global pattern of copy number alterations in these tumors was significantly associated with tumor methylation profiles. However, at the local level, gene promoter regions did not exhibit a correlation between copy number and methylation , and the spectrum of genes affected by each type of alteration was unique. A case-series of 19 tumors and matched blood references were hybrizided to Affymetrix Human Mapping 500k arrays and copy number was determined via HMM with Copy Number Analysis Tool v4.0.1.

DESIGN
This study was designed to investigate the relationship between copy number and DNA methylation alterations in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Data in this submission relates to the copy number portion only. Each patient tumor has been de-identified and assigned a number (1-19) and the blood samples with the same number correspond to the respectively-numbered tumor. The supplementary file 'GSE20939_tumor_copy_number.txt' contains the (blood normalized) copy number calls for each tumor sample.
