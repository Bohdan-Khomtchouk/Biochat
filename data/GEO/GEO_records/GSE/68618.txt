TITLE
Aging-dependent demethylation of regulatory elements correlates with chromatin state and improved insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aging at the cellular level is driven by changes in gene activity and epigenetic state that are only partially understood. We performed a comprehensive epigenomic analysis of the pancreatic β cell, key player in glucose homeostasis and diabetes, in adolescent and very old mice. Globally, we observe a general methylation drift resulting in an overall more leveled methylome, suggesting that the maintenance of highly differential methylation patterns becomes compromised with advanced age. Importantly, we discover targeted changes in the methylation status of β cell proliferation and function genes that go against the global methylation drift, are specific to β cells, and correlate with repression of the proliferation program and activation of metabolic regulators. These targeted alterations frequently occur at distal cis-regulator elements, and are associated with specific chromatin marks and transcription factor occupancy in young β cells. Strikingly, we find the insulin secretory response to glucose much improved in mature β cells in mice, as predicted by the changes in methylome and transcriptome and in contrast to the decline in function observed in aged human β cells. Thus, aging of terminally differentiated cells in mammals is not always coupled to functional decline.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was done on 3 biological replicas from old and three from young beta cells. each sample originated from a pool of 5-10 mic.e H3K27me3 ChIP-seq was done with two replicas for old mice (pool of 4-7 mice) and the rest of the ChIPseq (H3K4me1, H3K27ac and young H3K27me3) was sone with one sample (pool of few mice). BIS-seq was done on one sample from a pool of 10 young mice and one sample of a pool of old mice (18-22 months old)
