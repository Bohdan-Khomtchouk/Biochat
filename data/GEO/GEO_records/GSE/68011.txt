TITLE
Gene expression analysis in floral tissues from thermogenic skunk cabbage

ORGANISM
Symplocarpus renifolius

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression profiles in four different floral tissues, petals, pistils, stamens, and the pith, using Agilent custum array for Symplocarpus renifolius (4 x 44k).

DESIGN
Gene expression in floral tissues dissected from one female-stage spadix was measured and compared.
