TITLE
Gene Expression in Embryonic Stem Cells Grown in a Maintenance Serum vs. a Non-maintenance Serum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two sets of RNA samples were generated from 3 days growth in different serum lots, lot 6999 and lot 6473. Lot 6999 has been pre-screened for embryonic stem cell maintenance and is routinely used for that purpose. Lot 6473 failed all tests for embryonic stem cell maintenance. Keywords: other

DESIGN
this experiment include 2 samples and 12 replicates
