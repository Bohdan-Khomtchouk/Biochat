TITLE
Multiple roles of RNase Y in Streptococcus pyogenes mRNA metabolism

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes NZ131

SUMMARY
Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus, GAS) is an important human pathogen that causes a variety of infectious diseases and sequelae. Recent studies showed virulence factor expression was controlled at multiple levels, including the post-transcriptional regulation. In this study, we examined the global half-lives of S. pyogenes mRNAs and explored the role RNase Y played in mRNA metabolism with microarray analysis. key word: genetic modification
