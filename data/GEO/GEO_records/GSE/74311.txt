TITLE
H3K27ac ChIP-Seq in LOUCY

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H3K27ac ChIP-Seq data of the T-ALL cell line LOUCY was obtained to find active regions in the genome and to correlate that with expression profiling of lncRNAs in the LOUCY cell line.

DESIGN
ChIP-sequencing data was generated for H3K27ac in the T-ALL cell line LOUCY.
