TITLE
MiR-26 dampens IL-6 production by down-regulating TNF-a/NF-kB signaling through silencing HMGA1 and MALT1 and not by directly targeting IL-6 mRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We found NF-kB signaling as a major target of miR-26 based on an analysis of the changes in gene activation by TNF-a in response to alteration of miR-26 levels.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of genes in response to either a miR-26 mimic or miR-26 antagomir.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
