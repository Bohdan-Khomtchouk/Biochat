TITLE
Platform for Induction and Maintenance of Transgene-Free hiPSCs Resembling Ground State Pluripotent Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this series of experiments is to identify copy number variations, duplications, deletions and regions of homozygosity in human induced pluripotent stem (hiPSC) cell lines.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA of human induced pluripotent stem cell lines are extracted and hybridized to Agilent aCGH+SNP microarray, using genotyped Agilent Reference DNA as common reference. Differences and similarities between fibroblast and stem cell lines will be revealed.
