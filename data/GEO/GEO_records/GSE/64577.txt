TITLE
Track normalization and averaging of bislufite-seq DNA methylation data across various cell and tissue types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Data tracks from bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) experiments were sorted by tissue or cell types and processed using an in-house algorithm that provides normalization functionality followed by generation of a track average.

DESIGN
Re-analysis of Roadmap Epigenomics DNA methylation datasets using an in-house algorithm to create an average data track.
