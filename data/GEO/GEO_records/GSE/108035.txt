TITLE
Forced differentiation in vitro leads to stress-induced activation of DNA damage response in hiPSC-derived chondrocyte-like cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) constitute an important breakthrough in regenerative medicine, particularly in orthopedics, where more effective treatments are urgently needed. Despite the promise of hiPSCs only limited data on in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of hiPSCs are available. Therefore,the global gene expression profile of chondrocyte-like cells derived from hiPSCs (ChiPS) were compared to the hiPSCs (GPCCi001-A cell line) and to two cell lines of mature chondrocytes: HC-402-05a (Merck Millipore, Germany) (HC) and primary articular cartilage chondrocytes (ACC).

DESIGN
GPCCi001-A cells were generated from primary human dermal fibroblasts in reprogramming process using Stemcca-tetO lentiviral vector coding transcription factors responsible for pluripotency (Oct 4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4). GPCCi001-A cells express markers characteristic for pluripotent SCs and possess capacity to form embryoid bodies with the derivatives of three primary germ layers. The experiment was performed in triplicate. We performed global gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix platformâ€”to better understand the processes directing cell fate during chondrogenic differentiation in vitro (hiPSC,HC and ACC served as a control). This series includes GPCCi001-A and ChIPS samples re-used from GSE106239.
