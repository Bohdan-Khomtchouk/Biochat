TITLE
SNEP: Simultaneous detection of nucleotide and expression polymorphisms using Affymetrix GeneChip

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Nucleotide polymorphisms can potentially influence the hybridization of mRNA to 25-mer oligonucleotides. Because Affymetrix Rice Genome Array was designated mainly for Nipponbare genome of Oryza sativa, the expression level of other varieties could not be estimated correctly. We tried to apply new approaches to estimate expression level by discerning the probe-level differential hybridization.
