TITLE
Chlorella ingestion and suppression of resistin gene expression in borderline diabetics: a randomized, placebo-controlled study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Diabetes and Arteriosclerosis progression are frequently observed in borderline Type 2 diabetes cases. Onset of complications (arteriosclerosis and renal damage) due to Type 2 diabetes is well documented; it is extremely important to prevent or delay their progression. Type 2 diabetes onset and progression has been controlled through dietary habits and exercise, although these remain insufficient. Chlorella ingestion improves blood glucose and cholesterol concentrations in mice and humans, although no reports have evaluated Chlorella effects in borderline diabetics. Therefore, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial for borderline diabetics using laboratory results and comprehensive gene analysis as outcomes. Chlorella ingestion suppressed resistin gene expression, suggesting that Chlorella may be useful for preventing diabetes onset and ameliorating arteriosclerosis.

DESIGN
Subjects were randomly divided into two groups: Chlorella group (n = 28) ingesting Chlorella powder (8.0 g/day) and placebo group (n = 29) ingesting lactose formulation (8.0 g/day) for 12 weeks. Blood and urine were collected every 4 weeks for laboratory tests. Gene expression analysis used RNA extracted from peripheral blood samples before and after 12 weeks of Chlorella or lactose ingestion.
