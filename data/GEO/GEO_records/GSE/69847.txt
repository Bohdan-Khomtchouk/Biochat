TITLE
Chromatin-immunoprecipitant (ChIP) for CrdR binding site analysis in whole-genome tilling array

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori 26695

SUMMARY
The CrdR-ChIP profiling is comparing H. pylori gDNA without crdR interaction as control and CrdR interact with H. pylori gDNA (WT vs crdR). The goal was determine the crdR binding site on H. pylori genome, it provide possible crdR-regulated genes.

DESIGN
2 samples: H. pylori 26695 is control, and CrdR is experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL20328 NimbleGen H. pylori 26695 Array [080407_H_pylori_26695_GC_cgh]
