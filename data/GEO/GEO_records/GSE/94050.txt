TITLE
Single cell analysis of sister blastomeres of 2-cell mouse embryos respecting pair associations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Upon 2-cell embryo splitting, individual blastomeres were compared and contrasted with each other respecting pair associations (e.g. blastomere '1a' and '1b' of embryo 1, '2a' and '2b' of embryo 2, and so forth) Transcriptome analysis followed by cluster analysis (Ward) was able to match a minority of the blastomeres with the correct sister blastomere

DESIGN
Pair association (e.g. blastomere 'a' and 'b' from the same 2-cell embryo) was rigorously observed
