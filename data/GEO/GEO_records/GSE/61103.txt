TITLE
Transcriptomic characterizations associated with autopolyploidization of Chinese woad (Isatis indigotica Fort.)

ORGANISM
Isatis tinctoria

SUMMARY
The study was to obtain transcriptional data and examine gene expression of different ploidy based on RNA-Seq and bioinformatic analysis. Differentially expressed genes including both up- and down-regulated were received by pairwise contrasts of diploid, triploid and tetraploid.

DESIGN
RNA from young plant leaves were isolated and gene expressions of different autoploidy via RNA-Seq and bioinformatic analysis were conducted

PLATFORM
