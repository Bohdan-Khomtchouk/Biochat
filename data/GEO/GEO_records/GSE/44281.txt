TITLE
Serum microRNA expression as an early marker for breast cancer risk in prospectively collected samples from the Sister Study cohort

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
microRNAs are small, non-coding, single-stranded RNAs between 18-22 nucleotides long that regulate gene expression. Expression of microRNAs is altered in tumor compared to normal tissue; there is some evidence that these changes may be reflected in the serum of cancer cases compared to healthy individuals. This has yet to be examined in a prospective study where samples are collected before diagnosis. We used Affymetrix arrays to examine serum miRNA expression profiles in 410 participants in the Sister Study, a prospective cohort study of 50,884 women. All women in the cohort had never been diagnosed with breast cancer at the time of enrollment.
