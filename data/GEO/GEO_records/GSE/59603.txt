TITLE
Identifying interferon-stimulated genes enriched in multiple tissues of Irgm1-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We observed enhanced epithelial proliferation secondary to elevated Type I IFNs in multiple tissues of Irgm1-/- mice. We discovered that Type I IFNs signaled through macrophages to promote this epithelial hyperproliferation. To determine candidate factors that could play a role in this process, we performed whole genome microarray analysis of salivary gland, small intestine, and isolated colonic macrophages of Irgm1-/- mice and C57BL/6 WT controls. Genes enriched in at least 2 of the 3 sample sources were then screened for the ability to augment epithelial proliferation in vitro.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from three (small intestine and isolated colonic macrophage samples) or four (salivary gland samples) mice of each genotype (Irgm1-/- and WT). Both male and female six to nine week-old mice were used.
