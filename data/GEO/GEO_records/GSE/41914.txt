TITLE
Effects of exercise on gene expression level in human NK Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We tested the hypothesis on the mechanisms responsible for the early control of NK cell function by identifying a discrete set of genes in circulating NK cells that were altered by exercise. Exercise leads to a rapid change in the profile of gene expression in NK cells.

DESIGN
Twelve healthy men (20-29 yr old) performed 10 2-min bouts of cycle ergometer exercise interspersed with 1-min rest at a constant work equivalent to about 77% of VO2max. A baseline blood sample was taken before the and immediately after the exercise.  NK cells were isolated from PBMC using a negative magnetic cell separation methods (Miltenyi Biotec Kit #130-092-657 and the autoMACS® Pro Separator). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol®.  For this study we used Affymetrix plus 2  (total of 24 chips).
