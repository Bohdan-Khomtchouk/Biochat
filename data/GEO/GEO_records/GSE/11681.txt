TITLE
Expression profiling in LGMD2A muscles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify the genes showing an altered expression in LGMD2A patients and the possible pathways they are implicated in. Ten muscle samples from patients with calpainopathy in which molecular diagnosis was ascertained were invest Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
We used 10 microarrays of LGMD2A patients and 10 microarrays of control muscles. EXP-2, EXP-4 and EXP-28 HG-U133B arrays were excluded from the analysis due to problems with the samples.
