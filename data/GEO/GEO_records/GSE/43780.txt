affy_compartimentation_rice_albumen_embryon-Transcriptomic study of the rice seed compartimentation during germination

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
affy_rice_2011_03 - affy_compartimentation_rice_albumen_embryon - During germination, the rice seed goes from a dry quiescent state to an active metabolism. As with all cereals, the rice seed is highly differentiated between the embryo (that will give rise to the future plantlet) and the endosperm (that contains the seed storage compounds and that will degenerate). The molecular mechanisms operating in the rice seed embryo have begun to be described. Yet, very few studies have focused specifically on the endosperm during the germination process. In particular, the endosperm is mostly addressed with regards to its storage proteins but we have detected a large protein diversity by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Similarly, the endosperm is rich in total RNA which suggest that gene expression coming from seed maturation could play a role during the germination process. In this context, we want to compare the transcriptome of the embryo and the endosperm during rice seed germination. -We germinate rice seeds of the first sequenced rice cultivar i.e. Nipponbare during 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24h of imbibition in sterile distilled water. Germination occurs under constant air bubbling, in the dark at 30°C. These rice seeds are then manually dissected into embryo and endosperm fractions. -The embryo-derived samples are abbreviated in “E” while the endosperm samples are abbreviated “A”. The germination time-point is indicated after the letter (e.g. E8 for embryo samples harvested after 8 hours of germination). Finally, the biological repetition number is indicated before the letter and the time digit (e.g. 1-E8 for an embryo sample from the first repetition at 8 hours of imbibition).
