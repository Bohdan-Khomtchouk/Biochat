TITLE
Endogenous DAF-16 genome-wide recruitment under low Insulin signalling condition in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In order to understand the complexity of gene regulation downstream of IIS, we did RNA-seq in mixed culture in wild-type, daf-2(e1370), daf-16(mgDf50);daf-2(e1370) and daf-2(e1370);daf-12(m20 and correlated it with ChIP-seq data

DESIGN
RNA-seq profile of different mutants in mix stage

PLATFORM
GPL13776 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Caenorhabditis elegans)
