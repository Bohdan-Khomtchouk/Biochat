TITLE
Immortalized human hepatocyte (IHH) microRNA response to interferon alpha treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to obtain samples for microRNA analysis in IHH cells infected with human interferon alpha.

DESIGN
Immortalized human hepatocyte (IHH) cells were seeded at 1 x 10^6 cells per well on 6 well plates 3 days before infection.  Treatments were initiated by replacing culture medium (containing 10% FBS) with fresh medium containing 500 U/ml of human interferon α (PBL Biosciences).  Mock-treated cells were given normal culture medium only.  Mock and treated cells were incubated at 37°C until sample collection time points. Infected samples were collected in triplet; time-matched mocks were collected in triplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 6, 12, and 18 h post-infection
