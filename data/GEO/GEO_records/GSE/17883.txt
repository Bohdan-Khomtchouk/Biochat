TITLE
Global transcriptome profiling of wild soybean (Glycine soja) roots under NaHCO3 treatment

ORGANISM
Glycine soja

SUMMARY
Plant roots are the primary site of perception and injury for saline-alkaline stress. The current knowledge of the saline-alkaline stress transcriptome is most focused on salt (NaCl) stress. Only a little alkaline (NaHCO3) stress transcriptome is limited to one time point after stress. Time-course analysis and comparative investigation on roots in the alkaline stress condition are needed to understand the gene response networks that are subject to alkaline tolerance. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying NaHCO3 treatment and identified distinct classes of regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Three week old Glycine soja seedling roots from 3cm root apex were harvested in two independent biological replicates after 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24h treatment with 50mmol/L NaHCO3 stress for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To minimize biological variance, roots from three plants originating from the same experiment, condition and cultivar was pooled.
