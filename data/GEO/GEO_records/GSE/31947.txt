TITLE
Profiling aorta from high fat diet (HFD)-fed ApoE KO and wild type C57BL6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This program aimed to understand gene expression changes in aorta during atherosclerotic lesion progression with an objective to identify genes that may present new opportunities for drug intervention

DESIGN
The HFD-fed ApoE KO mice aorta profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in comparison to the HFD-fed WT C57BL6 controls.

PLATFORM
GPL3677 Rosetta/Merck Mouse 44k 1.0 microarray
