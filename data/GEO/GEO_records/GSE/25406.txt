TITLE
Comparative analyses of transcriptome during skeletal muscle development between pig breeds differing in muscle growth rate by deep-sequencing

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Obese and lean pig show breed-specific traits in muscle growth and meat quality. However, the mechanisms underlying remains unclear. Here, we reported the first genome-wide muscle development research from embryonic to 6 months old between Lantang (obese) and Landrace (lean) using Solexa/Illumina’s Genome Analyzer. We obtained 4.22±0.9×107 total reads per sample with approximately 5×106 distinct tags. Filtered adaptor tags, empty reads, low quality tags and tags of copy number =1, we obtained 3.84±0.9×107 clean total tags with 1.5±0.5×106 clean distinct tags.

DESIGN
20 libraries of longissimus muscle samples were sequenced in Lantang and Landrace at days 35, 49, 63, 77, 91 prenatal and 2, 28, 90, 120, 180 postnatal days.
