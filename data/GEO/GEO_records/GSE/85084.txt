TITLE
Sexually dimorphic induction of microglial-associated neuroinflammation with hippocampal aging

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hippocampal gene expression in male and female young (3 months) adult (12 months) and old (24 months) C57BL6 mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA from mouse (C57BL6) hippocampi [male and female, young (3 months) adult (12 months) and old (24 months) n=4/group)] was analyzed with Illumina Mouse Ref8 microarrays to identify age and sex differences in gene expression.
