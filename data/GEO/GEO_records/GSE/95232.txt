TITLE
Transient and permanent changes in DNA methylation patterns in inorganic arsenic-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the global impact of iAs on DNA methylation patterns. Genomic DNA was bisulfite converted and analyzed using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip.

DESIGN
DNA from NT, iAs-treated, and iAsT-reverse treated cells were bisulfite converted and used for analysis through Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip.
