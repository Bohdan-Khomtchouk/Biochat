TITLE
Early infection of poplar leaves by the rust pathogen Melampsora larici-populina

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
The identification of early-expressed pathogen effectors and early-modulated host functions is currently a major goal to understand the molecular basis of biotrophic lifestyle. Melampsora larici-populina isolates 98AG31 and 93ID6, respectively virulent and avirulent on the hybrid P. trichocarpa x P. deltoides poplar cultivar ‘Beaupré’ were used in this study. Inoculations were performed on 5 cm2 leaf disks. The following conditions were used for oligoarrays: Incompatible 18, 21 and 24 hpi, Compatible 18, 24 and 48hpi. One aim of this study was to compare RNA-Seq and hybridization-based approaches, therefore the cDNA templates were used for whole-genome poplar oligoarrays and 454-pyrosequencing.
