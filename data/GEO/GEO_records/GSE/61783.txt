TITLE
Metabolic Respiration Induces AMPK- and Ire1p-Dependent Activation of the p38-Type HOG MAPK Pathway

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In fungal species, differentiation to the filamentous/hyphal cell type is critical for entry into host cells and virulence. Comparative RNA sequencing was used to explore the pathways that regulate differentiation to the filamentous cell type in yeast. This approach uncovered a role for the stress-response MAPK pathway, HOG, during the increased metabolic respiration that induces filamentous growth. In this context, the AMPK Snf1p and ER stress kinase Ire1p regulated the HOG pathway. Cross-modulation between the HOG and filamentous growth (ERK-type) MAPK pathways optimized the differentiation response. The regulatory circuit described here may extend to behaviors in metazoans.

DESIGN
Comparison of expression patterns of wild-type and mutant yeast cells grown in salt, tunicamycin or galactose by comparative RNA sequencing analysis.
