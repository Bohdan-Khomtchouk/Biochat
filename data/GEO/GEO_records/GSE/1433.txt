TITLE
TIAR represses c-Myc biosynthesis following ultraviolet light irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from material that had been subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) from RKO cells that were either left untreated or irradiated with 20 J/m2 UVC and collected 1h later; IP assays were carried out using either an antibody recognizing RNA-binding protein TIAR, or using a control IgG1 antibody.  RNA was reverse-transcribed in the presence of [alpha-33P]dCTP and the radiolabeled product used to hybridize human cDNA arrays.  The experiment was repeated using three independent sample sets. The samples were numbered Tc-1, Tc-2, Tc-3, Tuv-1, Tuv-2, Tuv-3, IgG1c-1, IgG1c-2, IgG1c-3, IgG1uv-1, IgG1uv-2, and IgG1uv-3. ‘Tc’ denotes RNA from IP reactions using untreated cells and anti-TIAR antibody, ‘Tuv’ denotes RNA from IP reactions using UVC-treated cells and anti-TIAR antibody, ‘IgG1c’ denotes RNA from IP reactions using untreated cells and anti-IgG1 antibody, and ‘IgG1uv’ denotes RNA from IP reactions using UVC-treated cells and anti-IgG1 antibody.  The numbers 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the three independent experimental datasets.
