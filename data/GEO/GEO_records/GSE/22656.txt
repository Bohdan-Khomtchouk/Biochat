TITLE
Expression data from CD71+ cells from the bone marrow of WT, CD70TG, IFNg-/- and CD70TG*IFNg-/- mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD70TG mice are a model for sterile chronic immune activation and develop Anemia of Inflammation, which is dependent on the production of Ifng by effector CD4 and CD8 T cells. We used microarrays to identify Ifng-dependent differentially expressed genes that could account for the erythropoietic defect.

DESIGN
CD71+ cells were MACS-enriched from the bone marrow of WT, CD70TG, IFNg-/- and CD70TG*IFNg-/- male mice of 10-12 weeks of age (3 mice per genotype group).
