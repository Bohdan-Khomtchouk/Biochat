TITLE
The microRNA profile analysis of the function of HMGA2 in immortalized human ovarian surface epithelial cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify HMGA2-regulated downstream target microRNAs, we compared the difference of microRNA profiles between ovarian surface epithelial cells without HMGA2 (T29) and cells with HMGA2 (T29A2).

DESIGN
Immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells (named T29) were transfected with HMGA2 retrovirus vector pBabe-HMGA2 (named T29A2). Then cells were harvested for RNA isolation for microRNA expression analysis.
