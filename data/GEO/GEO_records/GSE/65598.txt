TITLE
Diurnal variation for rice leaves in Toyama field in 2012

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We have previously demonstrated statistical modeling of gene expression under various environmental factors using field transcriptome data obtained from samples grown in a paddy field at Tsukuba, Japan. In this series of experiments, we would like to improve the models for practical use. In order to do that, we have done field transcriptome assay in seven paddy fields at different sites in Japan (or, Sappro, Furukawa, Toyama, Tsukuba, Takatsuki, Furukawa, and Fukuoka). This data is from one of the places, Toyama.

DESIGN
Time-course transcriptional profiling of rice leaf in Toyama field in 2012. This experiment was performed to analyze the dynamics of field transcriptome data. 24h time series with 2h interval were sampled for 2 developmental stage with no replicate.
