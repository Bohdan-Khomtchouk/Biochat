TITLE
Stb3 deletion affects gene expression within 10 minutes of glucose addition

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Microarrays were conducted to asses the effect of Stb3 deletion in immediate transcriptional induction in response to glucose Keywords: Stb3, immediate glucose induction, growth genes.

DESIGN
Response of Stb3 delete cells was compared to that of wild type (BY4742) in cells grown for 3 days in YPD and cells that received 2% glucose for 10 minutes after the 3 day growth period. Two repetitive samples were done for each timepoint.
