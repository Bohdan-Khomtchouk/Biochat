TITLE
Longitudinal expression data from CD8+ T cells responding to LCMV-Armstrong or LCMV-Clone 13

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During acute viral infections, naïve CD8+ T cells differentiate into effector CD8+ T cells and, after viral control, into memory CD8+ T cells. Memory CD8+ T cells are highly functional, proliferate rapidly upon reinfection and persist long-term without antigen. In contrast, during chronic infections, CD8+ T cells become “exhausted” and have poor effector function, express multiple inhibitory receptors, possess low proliferative capacity, and cannot persist without antigen. To compare the development of functional memory T cells with poorly functional exhausted T cells, we generated longitudinal transcriptional profiles for each.

DESIGN
Naive CD44Lo CD8+ T cells were isolated and sorted from uninfected C57BL/6 mice and H2-Db GP33-specific CD8+ T cells were sorted using MHC-I tetramers at d6, 8, 15, and 30 p.i. with either LCMV Arm or LCMV clone 13. RNA from these CD8+ T cells was processed, amplified, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip MoGene 1.0 st microarrays
