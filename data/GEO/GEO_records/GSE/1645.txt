TITLE
TAcKLE - Transcriptome Amplification and cDNA Labeling for Expression analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the properties and evaluate the performance of the TAcKLE procedure, a novel method providing effective transcriptome amplification for expression analyses on oligonucleotide microarrays, we performed 20 two-color hybridizations using self-spotted Operon 27k arrays. A single source of universal human reference RNA (pooled from 10 cell lines) and RNA extracted from healthy breast tissue was used for all experiments to avoid differences in transcript abundance imposed by the RNA preparation. RNA was either amplified by one or two rounds of linear isothermal RNA amplification (starting from 2000 ng, 200 ng, 20 ng or 2 ng), followed by Cy-dUTP incorporation using Klenow fragment, or labeled directly by reverse transcription of 40 µg RNA with Cy-dUTP. For all quantities of starting material, one co-hybridization of reference RNA, two hybridizations of breast versus reference RNA as well as one hybridization of reference versus breast RNA were performed. In case of amplified RNA, all dye labeling reactions were made from distinct target preparations. Hybridizations were performed for 16 h at 42 °C in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions) using UltraHyb hybridization buffer (Ambion). Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 µm resolution on a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments). For all hybridizations, raw signal intensities were normalized applying variance stabilization (W. Huber et al., Bioinformatics 18 Suppl 1, 2002).
