TITLE
Defining precision probes which differentiate between the activity of type I and type II interferons.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To define probes which differentiate between the activity of type I or type II IFN, a human submandibular gland (HSG) cell line was cultured for 48 hours in the absence or presence of IFNa or IFNg. Gene expression was assayed at 4, 12, 24 or 48 hours and was compared to gene expression in untreated cells at each time point to define genes which are induced by type I or type II IFN.

DESIGN
HSG cells were cultured for 2 days in the absence or presence of IFNa [1000U/ml] or IFNg [50ng/ml], and total RNA was isolated at 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours of culture.
