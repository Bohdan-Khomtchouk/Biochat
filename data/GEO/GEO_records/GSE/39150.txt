TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of Chinese tree shrew, Tupaia belangeri chinensis

ORGANISM
Tupaia chinensis

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of mRNA from Chinese tree shrew; Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) is placed in Order Scandentia and embraces many unique features for a good experimental animal model. Currently, there are many attempts to employ tree shrew to establish model for a variety of human disorders such as social stress, myopia, HCV and HBV infection, and hepatocellular carcinoma .We present here a publicly available annotated genome sequence for Chinese tree shrew. Phylogenomic analysis of tree shrew and other mammalians highly supported its close affinity to primates. Characterization of key factors and signaling pathways of the nervous and immune systems in tree shrews showed that this animal had common and unique features, and had essential genetic basis for being a promising model for biomedical researches.

DESIGN
Analysis of ploy(A)+ RNA of different specimens:kidney, pancreas, heart, liver, brain, testis and ovary form Chinese tree shrew
