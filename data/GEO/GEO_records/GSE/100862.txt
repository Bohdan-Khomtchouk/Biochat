TITLE
Human embryonic stem cells contribute to embryonic and extraembryonic lineages in mouse embryos through inhibition of apoptosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated hESCs with inducible expression of anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 and BCL2L1, and found that the BCL2- and BCL2L1-overexpression could inhibit apoptosis of hESCs without affecting their pluripotent state.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of human embryonic stem cells with inducible expression of anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 and BCL2L1 were generated by RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 4000

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
