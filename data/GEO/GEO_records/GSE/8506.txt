TITLE
Yeast (S. cerevisiae SK1) Sporulation/Meiosis

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transription profile of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SK1 cultures undergoing synchronous sporulation. We have measured mRNA levels in synchronized SK1 cells immediately upon transfer to the sporulation medium and every 30 minutes after that for 6 hours.  mRNA extracted from these cultures were converted to cDNA and hybridized to microarrays and log2 ratios of hybridization signal of each time point was compared to that of time zero (immediately prior to transfer to the sporulation medium). Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
RNA from time zero is control, other time samples are experimental, two replicates per array, dye reverse of each time point on separate arrays, each time sample represents pooled cells from six independent synchronized cultures cultivated on the same day.
