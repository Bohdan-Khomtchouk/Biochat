TITLE
Integrated genomic and function characterization of the 8q22 gain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Integrated DNA and expression array analysis in primary human breast tumors identified chromosome 8q22 copy number gain and a suite of over-expressed genes in this region highly relevant to subsequent recurrence. 8q copy gain is associated with increased risk of distant metastasis despite adjuvant chemotherapy and multiple genes from 8q22 are overexpressed and have pleiotropic effects, contributing to tumor growth, survival, and reduced killing of tumor cell by chemotherapy.
