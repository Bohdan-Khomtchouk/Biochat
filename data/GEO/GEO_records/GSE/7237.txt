TITLE
CD14: A co-receptor for damage-associated molecular pattern

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles were compared between C57BL/6 WT and CD14 knockout mice using microarray analysis after stimulating peritoneal cells with necrotic fibroblasts. Keywords: stimulus or stress design

DESIGN
Two samples were from peritoneal macrophages isolated from C57BL/6 WT mice, one stimulated with necrotic fibroblasts and one untreated control. Two samples were from peritoneal macrophages isolated from C57BL/6 CD14 knockout mice, one stimulated with necrotic fibroblasts and one untreated control. Technical replicates were performed.
