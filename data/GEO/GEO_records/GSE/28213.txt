TITLE
Identifying the signaling cascades and regulatory mechanisms that control osmotic stress response

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We performed knockout and wild type expression experiments in yeast grown in soribtol to identify genes invovled in controling osmotic stress response.

DESIGN
Soribitol experiments were performed by growing to logarithmic phase in synthetic complete (SC) medium and then washing and resuspending in SC medium with 1M sorbitol for 30 minutes.  Two replicates were performed per knockout strain and compared with two or four control replicates depending on the platform.
