TITLE
Tissue culture model of hypoxia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Validation of an in vitro model of hypoxia using a primary cell culture of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) exposed to 1% oxygen at 37 degrees celsius. Control cells were exposed to atmospheric oxygen.

DESIGN
Hypoxic and normoxic MEF (in 100 mm dishes, four replicates per group) were submitted to gene expression analysis using Affymetrix Exon microarrays. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with R package DEMI ( http://biit.cs.ut.ee/demi/ ).

PLATFORM
GPL6193 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
