TITLE
miRNA array analysis following gefinitib/luteolin administration to PC-3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine if any altered miRNA expression is actually involved in the growth inhibition and/or cell death induction by luteolin and/or gefitinib, we performed miR-array analysis using RNA from PC-3 cells after 24h of treatment with 60μM luteolin and/or 60μM gefitinib.

DESIGN
PC-3 cells were treated for 24h with DMSO, 60μM luteolin (Lut), 60μM gefitinib (Gef) or their co-administration (Lut+Gef). Each sample was run in duplicate.
