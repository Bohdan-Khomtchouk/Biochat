TITLE
Expression data from zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish embryos are sensitive to chemical substance and often used as a in vivo model for enviromental toxicology research. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes after treated with chemical substance
