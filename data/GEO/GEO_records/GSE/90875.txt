TITLE
Expression data from zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish embryos are sensitive to chemical substance and often used as a in vivo model for enviromental toxicology research. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes after treated with chemical substance

DESIGN
Zebrafish embryos were selected at early development stages for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We tested the expression data of zebrfish embryos treated with  PM2.5

PLATFORM
GPL16933 [ZebGene-1_0-st] Zebrafish Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version] GPL21572 [miRNA-4] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-4 Array [ProbeSet ID version]
