TITLE
Dissecting the genetic basis of an evolved acute heat stress and oxidative stress resistance in the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei reveals a complex and unique genetic architecture

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis remanei

SUMMARY
Analysis of constitutive changes in gene expression patterns in populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei experimentally evolved to either acute heat stress, acute oxidative stress or the lab environment. Results of this study demonstrate that acute heat stress and acute oxidative stress are complex traits with a unique genetic basis. Overall design: Pooled population RNA sequencing libraries were obtained from the ancestor population and three evolved populations: one biological replicate of the control selected population, one heat stress selected population and one oxidative stress selected population per replicate. Tissue was collected from populations of L1 larval worms.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of ancestral and three experimentally evolved populations of C. remanei at 20Â°C, 6- 8  replicates/evolved line for each population

PLATFORM
GPL16141 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Caenorhabditis remanei)
