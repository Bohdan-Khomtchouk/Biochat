TITLE
A phase 1b study of the Akt-inhibitor MK-2206 in combination with weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab in patients with advanced HER2-overexpressing solid tumor malignancies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
16 patients with HER2+ tumors were enrolled (12 breast, 3 gastric, 1 esophageal).  27 samples (12 primary + 15 metastatic) from the 16 unique patients were assayed on Agilent 60K expression microarrays, and association between expression and response data were evaluated to identify potential biomarker of MK2206 response

DESIGN
We conducted a phase 1b study of MK-2206 in combination with weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 and trastuzumab 2 mg/kg in patients with HER2+ malignancies.  Dose escalation was performed using a modified toxicity probability interval method. Molecular profiling of archived tissue samples and limited PK analyses were performed.
