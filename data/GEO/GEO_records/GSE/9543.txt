TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana open flowers: Wild type vs. sdg4 mutant (SALK T-DNA line_128444)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling in open flowers of Arabidopsis wild type control plants and sdg4 mutant (SALK T-DNA line_128444). The sdg4 mutant is a Arabidopsis T-DNA mutant in which T-DNA is inserted in a SET domain protein, SDG4 (At4g30860). Expression profiling studies indicate that SDG4 might function in modulating the expression of the genes that function in the growth of pollen tubes. Keywords: epigenetic modification
