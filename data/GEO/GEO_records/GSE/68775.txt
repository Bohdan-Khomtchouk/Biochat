TITLE
Transcriptome analysis upon SIN3 or dKDM5/LID knockdown or both under normal  and paraquat induced stress conditions in Drosophila S2 cultured cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
SIN3 the scaffold protein of a histone deacetylase complex interacts with a histone demethylase KDM5 (little imaginal discs - LID) in Drosophila. Reduction of SIN3 or dKDM5/LID both result in similar phenotypes during cell proliferation and wing development. To identify underlying transcriptional changes that may contribute to these phentypic defects we performed whole genome expression analysis in Drosophila cultured cells upon RNAi-mediated knockdown of Sin3A, lid or both. We identified a large number of genes regulated by SIN3, dKDM5/LID or both. While many common genes were regulated by SIN3 and dKDM5/LID an enrichment for genes involved in stress tolerance pathways was observed. Additional RNAseq analysis of expression changes upon knockdown of Sin3A, lid or both under paraquat mediated oxidative stress conditions identified significant changes in genes involved in cell cycle related processes.

DESIGN
Drosophila S2 cells were treated with dsRNA targetting Sin3A, lid and both or GFP as control under normal or oxidative stress conitions induced by treatment with paraquat. mRNA profiling of these samples were performed by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq2500.Three biological replicates were performed.
