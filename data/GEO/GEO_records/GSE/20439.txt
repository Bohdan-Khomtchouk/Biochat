TITLE
Expression data from cumulus cells from C57Bl/6 and Ptger2 (EP2) KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the role of prostaglandin (PG) receptor EP2 (Ptger2) signaling in ovulation and fertilization, we investigated time-dependent expression profiles in wild-type (WT) and Ptger2-/- cumuli before and after ovulation by using microarrays.

DESIGN
We used Affymetrix U74A ver2 microarrays to investigate gonadotropin-induced gene expression profiles in WT and EP2KO cumulus cells before and after ovulation. Immature mice were primed with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) as an FSH-like stimulation. The cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were isolated from mice 48 h after PMSG injection (H0) and from PMSG-primed mice exposed to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as an LH-like stimulation for 3, 9 or 14 h (H3, H9 or H14, respectively).
