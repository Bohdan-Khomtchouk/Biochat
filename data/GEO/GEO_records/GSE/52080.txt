TITLE
Transcriptome of Nkx2-5-null atria

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Atrial specific knockout of Nkx2-5 results in hyperplastic atria with ASD and conduction defects. To examine how Nkx2-5 regulates cardiac proliferation at late gestational stages, RNA-seq was performed.

DESIGN
Examination of expression profile of 2 Nkx2-5-null atria and 3 controls

PLATFORM
