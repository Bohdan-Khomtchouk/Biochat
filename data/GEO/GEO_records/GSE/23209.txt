TITLE
Molecular Signature of response and potential pathways related to resistance to the HSP90 inhibitor, 17-AAG, in breast cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have done transcriptional profiling of 17-AAG treated (24h, 48H) breast cancer cell lines to understand  the mechanisms of the drug action and indicate novel set of pharmacodynamic biomarkers of the drug response as well as of resistance

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Untreated vs. Treated sensitive cells. Phenotype replicates: 8 untreated replicates, 14 treated replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
