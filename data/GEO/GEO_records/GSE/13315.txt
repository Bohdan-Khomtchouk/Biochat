TITLE
Identifying Sites Bound by Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1) in the Human Genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous gammaherpes virus that establishes a life-long latency in over 90% of the world's population. Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen 1, EBNA1, is the only viral protein consistently detected in all viral latency programs, as well as in all forms of EBV-associated malignancies. EBNA1 plays critical roles in the viral life cycle by fostering the replication and maintenance of the extrachromosomal viral genome as well as enhancing transcription from multiple viral promoters. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and human promoter microarrays (an analysis termed ChIP-chip) we found that EBNA1 binds site specifically within multiple human promoters. To determine whether EBNA1â€™s binding to these promoters perturbed gene expression, we measured the levels of cellular mRNAs by microarrays when EBNA1 was inhibited by a dominant negative derivative of EBNA1 (DomNeg1). Keywords: viral regulation of cellular genes

DESIGN
We analysed mRNA expression from the EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell line 721 transduced with either a control (empty) retroviral vector or a DomNeg1-encoding retroviral vector. For ChIP-chip, DNA from immunoprecipitated chromatin using a anti-EBNA1 antibody (IH4) along with total chromatin was hybridized to a Nimblegen human promoter arrays (CHAR0150-HP2).  A single ChIP-chip experiment was performed with DNAs pooled equally from three independent ChIP experiments.
