TITLE
Gene expression following miR-30a knockdown in bipotential mouse embryonic liver (BMEL) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal was to identify genes targeted by miR-30a. Keywords: Transfection of cultured cells with antisense oligonucleotide

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from BMELs tranfected with a locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotide to miR-30a or with a scrambled control oligo.
