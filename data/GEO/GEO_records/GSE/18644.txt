TITLE
Expression analysis in yeast model of Huntington's disease (HD)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Expressing a mutant fragment of huntingtin (Htt) in yeast produces several HD-relevant phenotypes.  We used microarrays to study global change in expression induced by this mutant htt fragment. Expression was also analysed in three suppressor deletion strains expressing a toxic mutant htt fragment: bna4Δ, mbf1Δ, and ume1Δ.

DESIGN
Yeast samples expressing either a wild-type or mutant htt fragment (Htt25Q or Htt103Q, respectively), and  suppressor deletion strains expressing Htt103Q: bna4Δ, mbf1Δ, and ume1Δ.
