TITLE
Expression profiling of luminal and glandular epithelia in the neonatal and adult mouse uterus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Laser capture microdissection coupled with microarray genes expression analysis were utilized in order to elucidate the regulatory networks active in epithelial cells of the neonatal and adult mouse uterus.

DESIGN
Genes predominantly expressed in the glandular epithelium (GE) in the neonatal or adult uterus were determined by comparing transcripts in the isolated samples of luminal epithelium (LE) and GE from postnatal day (PD) 10, day of psudopregnancy (DOPP) 2.5 or DOPP 3.5 uteri (n=2/cell type/day).
