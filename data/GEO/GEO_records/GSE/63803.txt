TITLE
To identify ATFS-1 target genes during mitochondrial stress

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To better understand genome coordination and OXPHOS recovery during mitochondrial dysfunction, we examined ATFS-1, a transcription factor that regulates mitochondria-to nuclear communication during the mitochondrial UPR, via ChIP-sequencing.

DESIGN
Wildtype worms treated spg-7(RNAi) are analyzed in the presence and absence of ATFS-1 antibody to identify ATFS-1 targets. Individual samples were analyzed. Wildtype worms treated spg-7(RNAi) in the absence of antibody is used as a control.
