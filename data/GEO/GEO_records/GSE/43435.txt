TITLE
Thymidine Kinase and mtDNA Depletion in Human Cardiomyopathy: Epigentic and Translational Evidence for Energy Starvation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comparison of epigenetic nuclear DNA methylation and gene expression changes between human dialated cardiomypathy left ventricle samples and non-failing cardiac left ventricule samples This study addresses how depletion of huaman cardiac left ventricle mitochondrial DNA and epigentic nuclear DNA methylation promote cardiac dysfunction in human dilated cardiomyopathy.

DESIGN
Each sample was fluorescently labeled and hybridized to Roche Nimblegen 2.1M Deluxe Promoter Arrays and Expression arrays.
