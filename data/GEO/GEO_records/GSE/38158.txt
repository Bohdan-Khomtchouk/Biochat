TITLE
mes-2, mes-4 or mes-2; mes-4 mutants vs. wild type

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Trascriptional profiling of C. elegans adult germ lines comparing mes-2(bn11)unc-4(e120) mutants and unc-4(e120) (wild type), mes-4(bn85) mutants and N2 (wild type), mes-2(bn11)unc-4(e120); mes-4(bn85) and unc-4(e120) (wild type) at 20 degrees.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, mutant vs. WT.  Biological replicates 4 mutant, 4 wildtype harvested indepedently.  One mutant replicate and one WT replicate per array.
