TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium LT2

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2

SUMMARY
We performed whole-genome transcriptomic analyses of the Salmonella Typhimimurium genome during  glucose-phosphate stress.  In particular, we wanted to elucidate the role of the the small RNA SgrS and protein regulator SgrT in the stress response.

DESIGN
Wild-type Salmonella cells, mutants of Salmonella either lacking sgrS or  lacking SgrS RNA/ SgrT peptide function were subject to glucose-phoshate stress
