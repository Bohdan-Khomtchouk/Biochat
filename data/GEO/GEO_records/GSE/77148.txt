TITLE
Comparisons of toxicogenomic responses in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to ZnO nanoparticles and ZnSO4: The impact of sublethal concentration (LC25) on global gene expression profiles

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To investigate the patterns of global gene expression profiles modulated by the ZnO nanoparticles and ZnSO4, and to differentiate their modes of toxicity, zebrafish (Danio rerio) will be exposed to the ZnO nanoparticles and ZnSO4 (LC25), and used for microarray analysis by Agilent Zebrafish Oligo Microarray system. 244 genes overlaped between ZnO nanopartices and ZnSO4 treatments in a total of 1,586 differential expressed genes.G-protein coupled receptor protein (GPCR)-signaling pathways, cell-surface receptor-linked signal transduction and immune response are most significant GO terms enriched in genes up regulated by two treatments. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions pathway and intestinal immune network for IgA production pathway were enriched among ZnO nanoparticles activated genes, and specifically induced by ZnSO4 include cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) pathway.

DESIGN
The zebrafish embryos were exposed to ZnO nanoparticles and ZnSO4 for 96hr. And then after total RNA extration from the each samples, the ZnO nanoparticles and ZnSO4 related gene expression profiles identified using Agilent Zebrafish Oligo Microarray. Significant alterations in gene expression were found for all treatments and many of the gene pathways connected.
