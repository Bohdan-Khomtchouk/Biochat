TITLE
ChIP-chip from lymph node-derived primary lymphocytes with anti-E2F2 and anti-SV40TAg

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E2F2 is essential for the maintenance of T lymphocyte quiescence. To identify the full set of E2F2 target genes, and to gain further understanding of the role of E2F2 in transcriptional regulation, we have performed ChIP-chip analyses across the genome of lymph node-derived T lymphocytes. Here we show that during quiescence, E2F2 binds the promoters of a large number of genes involved in DNA metabolism and cell cycle regulation, concomitant with their transcriptional silencing.

DESIGN
We performed 3 ChIP-chip experiments with an antibody against E2F2 and another 3 ChIP-chip experiments with an antibody against SV40TAg (irrelevant antibody).
