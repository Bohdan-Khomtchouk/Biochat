TITLE
Transcript profiling of oestrogen treatment of primary human neuronal and glial cell cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to identify oestrogen regulated genes in human primary cell cultures of neuronal and glial cells modelling the developing human nervous system. We were especially interested in genes involved in proliferation, differentiation and migration of neuronal cells and genes involved in or linked to neurodegenerative diseases. We have therefore assessed gene expression changes, using Affymetrix GeneChips (HG-U133A), of oestrogen treated human neuronal/ glial cell cultures. We continued with 14 selected genes and confirmed the gene expression changes, by relative quantitative real time PCR, of 6 genes (p < 0.05) important in neuronal development, three of which also are suggested to have links to neurodegenerative diseases. Keywords: Treatment vs Control
