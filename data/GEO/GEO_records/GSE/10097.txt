TITLE
Transcript profiling of oestrogen treatment of primary human neuronal and glial cell cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to identify oestrogen regulated genes in human primary cell cultures of neuronal and glial cells modelling the developing human nervous system. We were especially interested in genes involved in proliferation, differentiation and migration of neuronal cells and genes involved in or linked to neurodegenerative diseases. We have therefore assessed gene expression changes, using Affymetrix GeneChips (HG-U133A), of oestrogen treated human neuronal/ glial cell cultures. We continued with 14 selected genes and confirmed the gene expression changes, by relative quantitative real time PCR, of 6 genes (p < 0.05) important in neuronal development, three of which also are suggested to have links to neurodegenerative diseases. Keywords: Treatment vs Control

DESIGN
Primary mixed neuronal/glial cell cultures were established from human brain tissue, which was obtained from 8-12 weeks old fetuses at legal abortion after informed consent from the patients. Procedures were approved by the local Ethics committee at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm. A total of 23 tissue samples yielding 9 cell cultures were used in this experiment. Half of the cell cultures were treated with 2µM β-oestradiol the day after seeding. The duration of the oestrogen treatment was 7 days and the cells were harvested after 8 days of culturing for RNA extraction. Extracted RNA from untreated respectively oestrogen treated cell cultures were pooled yileding two samples, which were each hybridised to Affymetrix microarrys. In this study oestrogen treatment of human neuronal/glial cell cultures was found to regulate 6 genes important in the development of the nervous system.
