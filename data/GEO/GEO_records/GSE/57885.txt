TITLE
The network of genes regulated by Ago1 in metastatic prostate cancer PC3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to evaluate the consequences of Ago1 knockdown in metastatic prostate cancer cells PC3. To this end we profiled RNA from PC3 cells 72 hours following the transfection with a scramble siRNA (siGL3) and a siRNA targeting Ago1 (siAgo1).

DESIGN
We profiled RNA from PC3 cells 72 hours following the transfection with a scramble siRNA (siGL3) and a siRNA targeting Ago1 (siAgo1). siAgo1 vs siGL3 gene expression profiling, two technical replicates with dye swap labeling scheme.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
