SUMMARY
To identify genes differentially modulated by anti-miR-182 treatment in a liver melanoma metastasis mouse model. Targeting oncogenic microRNAs is emerging as a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Here we provide proof-of-principle for the safety and efficacy of miRNA targeting against metastatic tumors. We tested the effect of targeting miR-182, a pro-metastatic miRNA frequently overexpressed in melanoma, whose silencing represses invasion and induces apoptosis in vitro. In particular, we assessed the effect of anti-miR-182 oligonucleotides synthesized with 2â€™ sugar modifications and a phosphorothioate backbone in a mouse model of melanoma liver metastasis. Luciferase imaging showed that mice treated with anti-miR-182 had an appreciably lower burden of liver metastases compared to the control. We confirmed that miR-182 levels were effectively downregulated in the anti-miR treated tumors relative to the scrambled treated tumor both in the liver and in the spleen. This downregulation was accompanied by an upregulation of miR-182 direct targets. Transcriptome analysis of mouse tissues treated with anti-miR-182 or scramble oligonucleotides revealed an enrichment for genes controlling survival, adhesion and migration modulated in response to anti-miR-182 treatment. These data indicate that in vivo administration of anti-miRs allows for efficient miRNA targeting and concomitant upregulation of target levels. Our results suggest that the use of anti-miR-182 is a promising therapeutic strategy for metastatic melanoma and provide solid proof-of-principle for similar strategies against other metastatic tumors. Keywords: Differentially expressed genes (mRNAs) in response to miRNA inhibition

DESIGN
Quadruplicate (n=4) samples of anti-miR-182 treated human melanoma metastasis compared to quadruplicate control treated metastasis.
