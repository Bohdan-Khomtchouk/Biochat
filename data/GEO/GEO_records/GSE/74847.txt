TITLE
Expression data from 48 h incubation of RAW264.7 cells with 50 ng/ml RANK Ligand

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A variety of genes are responsible for regulating osteoclastogenesis in response to RANK Ligand. Microarray analysis was used to identify genes sensitive to RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells.

DESIGN
RAW264.7 cells were incubated with 50 ng/mL RANKL or vehicle control (3 replicates each).  After 48 h, total RNA were harvested by an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN).
