TITLE
Gene Expression profiles from allograft tumours

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent studies have suggested increased plasticity of differentiated cells within the intestine to act both as intestinal stem cells and tumour initiating cells. However, little is known of the processes that regulate this plasticity. Our previous work has shown that activating mutations of Kras or the NF-kB pathway can drive dedifferentiation of intestinal cells lacking Apc. To investigate this process further, we profiled tumours generated by subcutaneous injection of spheroids derived from villi (here called SFV) and from crypts (here called CC) purified from VillCreER Apcfl/fl KrasG12D mice.

DESIGN
Allograft tumours were generated injecting VillCreER Apcfl/fl KrasG12D CC and SFV (purified from mouse small intestine) in female athymic CD-1 nude mice. Tumours were collected at end-point. Two-condition experiments, CC and SFV tumours. Biological replicates: 3 CC and 3 SFV independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
