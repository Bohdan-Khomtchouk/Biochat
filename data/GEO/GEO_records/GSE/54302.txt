TITLE
Comparison of Transcriptomics of Mouse Skin Derived Precursors (SKPs) and Dermal Fibroblasts by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Skin-derived precursors (SKPs) from dermis possess the capacities of self-renewal and multipotency. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that they can differentiate into fibroblasts. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of the differentiation of SKPs into fibroblasts in vitro. To elucidate the genes involved in the process, transcriptome profiling of SKPs and fibroblasts was analyzed and compared using RNA-Seq. A total of 2659 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by RNA-Seq, which provided abundant data for further analysis. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that genes related to cell differentiation, cell proliferation, protein binding, transporter activity and membrane were significantly enriched. A novel gene 1700009N14Rik related to cell differentiation was significantly up-regulated. The most significantly up-regulated genes Wnt4, Wisp2 and Tsp-1 and the down-regulated genes Retn, Slitrk1, Klk6, Agtr2, Ivl, Msx1, IL15, Atp6v0d2, Kcne1l and Thbs4 might play important roles in the transition of SKPs to fibroblasts. KEGG analysis showed that DEGs were significantly enriched in the TGF-Î² signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway and Notch signaling pathway, which have been previously proven to regulate the differentiation and self-renewal of various stem cells. These identified DEGs and pathways could facilitate further investigations of the detailed molecular mechanisms, making it possible to take advantage of the potential therapeutic applications of SKPs in skin repair in the future.
