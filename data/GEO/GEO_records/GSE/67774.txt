TITLE
SNP-array profiling of 21 novel primary and metastatic colorectal cancer cell lines [Illumina HumanExome-12 v1.2 BeadChip]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: In vitro models are an essential tool towards understanding the molecular characteristics of colorectal cancer (CRC) and the testing of therapies for CRC. To this end we established 21 novel CRC cell lines of which six were derived from liver metastases. Extensive genetic, genomic, transcriptomic and methylomic profiling was performed in order to characterize these new cell lines and all data is made publically available. Additionally, sensitivity of oxaliplatin was tested as a measure for chemotherapy resistance. Results: By combining mutation profiles with CNA and gene expression profiles we constructed an overview of the alterations in the major CRC-related signalling pathways. The mutation profiles, along with the genome, transcriptome and methylome data of these cell lines will be made publically available . This combined dataset puts these cell lines among the best characterized CRC cell lines, allowing researchers to select appropriate cell line models for their particular experiment, making optimal use of these novel cell lines as in vitro model for CRC. Conclusions: By combining mutation profiles with CNA and gene expression profiles we constructed an overview of the alterations in the major CRC-related signalling pathways. The mutation profiles, along with the genome, transcriptome and methylome data of these cell lines will be made publically available . This combined dataset puts these cell lines among the best characterized CRC cell lines, allowing researchers to select appropriate cell line models for their particular experiment, making optimal use of these novel cell lines as in vitro model for CRC.
