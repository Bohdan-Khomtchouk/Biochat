TITLE
Comparison of transcript abundance in mycelium from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae grown in rich medium and in minimal medium using HT-SuperSAGE.

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe oryzae

SUMMARY
Mycelium from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae was grown in both rich medium and under nutrient limiting conditions. Genes were identified that were more highly expressed in one condition as compared to the other.

DESIGN
Samples were taken from mycelium grown in both complete medium and in  glucose minimal medium. Three replicates were taken for each condition.
