TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of hNAC1-dependent time course rescue of Nac1 null abnormal reprogrammed cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we dissected the functional contribution of NAC1 in establishing pluripotency during somatic cell reprogramming. We identified a critical role for NAC1 in transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally modulating E-cadherin expression during the generation of iPSCs. In the absence of NAC1 functions, reprogramming is diverted to an anomalous state that can be fully rescued with the re-expression of Nac1.

DESIGN
This study containes 6 microarrays from day 0, 2, and 5 samples  of the hNAC1 time course rescue experiments from two in-house generated null iPS lines: Nac1 null iPS clone #5 and Nac1 null iPS clone #7
