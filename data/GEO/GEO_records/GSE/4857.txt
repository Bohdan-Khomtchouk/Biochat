TITLE
Methylation profiling in pediatric medulloblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole-genome screening of CpG Island methylation status by array-based profiling of absolute methylation status (array-PAMS). Keywords: methylation profiling, pediatric medulloblastoma, single sample

DESIGN
Methylation-specifically digested DNA (Cy3) was hybridized against methylation-sensitively digested DNA (Cy5) from the same sample. CGI methylation in 20 pediatric medulloblastomas (M) and normal cerebellum (Cb, pool of five unaffected donors, age 25â€“33 years)
