TITLE
Expression data of Arabidopsis overexpressing ERF96 gene

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis overexpressing ERF96 are more resistant against necrotrophic pathogen such as Botrytis cinerea. ERF96 is a member of the AP2/ERF superfamily of transcription factor. We used Microarray to determine which gene expressions are up-regulated due to an accumulation of ERF96 and to identify the putative direct target of this transcription factor.

DESIGN
Microarray were performed from the RNA of a four-week old Arabidopsis overexpressing ERF96  and WT(col-0). RNA was extracted during three independant experiments
