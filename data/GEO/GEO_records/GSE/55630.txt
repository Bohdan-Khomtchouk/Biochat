TITLE
Jarid2 methylation is required for PRC2 functioning during ES cells differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that Jarid2 is methylated at K116 by the polycomb complex PRC2. We analyzed Jarid2 versus Methylated Jarid2 genomic localization by ChIP-seq. We also study H3K27 enrichment in Jarid2 knock out ES cells and in cells rescued for Jarid2 or a mutant that cannot be methylated. ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 was perfomed in undiffrentiated ES cells as well as after 8 days of diffrentiation toward Embroyid Bodies (Hanging Drop method).

DESIGN
Experiment 1: Jarid2 vs Jarid2me ChIP-seq in undifferentiated mouse ES cells (E14). Experiment 2: H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in Jarid2 -/- ES cells (peng, 2009, Cell), or the same cells rescue with a BAC expressing JARID2 or a mutant of K116 to A. H3K27me3 Chip-seq were perfomed in undifferentiated ES cells and in EB after 8 days of differentiation (hanging Drop method).
