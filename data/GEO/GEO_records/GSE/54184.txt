TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and fl4 mutant Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Analysis of  gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that fl4 mutant influence the ER stress pathway. Results provide important information of the gene expression level regulation of different ER stress pathways and apoptosis

DESIGN
Endosperm mRNA profiles of 19DAP wild type (WT) and fl4 mutant were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2000 (Zea mays).
