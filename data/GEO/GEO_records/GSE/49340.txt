TITLE
The global gene expression pattern by RCK1 over-expression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We did transcription profiling on the effect of RCK1 over-expression. rck1 mutant strain was transformed with empty high copy vector pRS425 empty vector), or  with RCK1 cloned into pRS425 (the RCK1-overexpressing strain: RCK1 cloned into pRS425).

DESIGN
Analysis was performed with rck1 (Empty vector, pRS425) mutant and RCK1 over-expressed cells (pRS425-RCK1). Yeast cells were grown on SD-leu medium. Yeast cells were grown overnight at 30°C . The culture was refreshed to 0.2 O.D and grown at 30°C  for 2h 30min. Cell wall stress was applied by addition of zymolyase to a final concentration of 5 unit/ml .  Cells were collected at 2 hours of growth and processed for RNA extraction.
