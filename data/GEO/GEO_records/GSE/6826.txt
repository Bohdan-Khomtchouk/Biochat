TITLE
Identification of candidate Arabidillo target genes in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis has two genes, Arabidillo-1 and -2, related to animal Armadillo/ beta-catenin (Coates, 2003).  Armadillo/beta-catenin directly activates the expression of developmental and cell proliferation genes, and also independently regulates cell-cell adhesion. Arabidillo proteins are nuclear and promote lateral root development. We aim to identify candidate Arabidillo target genes by comparing the transcriptomes of wild type, arabidillo-1/2 mutant and Arabidillo-1 overexpressing lines. The experiment will compare Col-0 (3 slides) with a 35S::Arabidillo-1-YFP overexpressing line (3 slides) and Col-3 with the arabidillo-1/2 mutant (3 slides).  Each RNA prep will be from plate-grown 7-day old  seedlings. Reference: Coates, JC (2003) Armadillo repeat proteins: beyond the animal kingdom?
