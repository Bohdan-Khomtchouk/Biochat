TITLE
Expression data sets for untreated and reprogrammed fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand global transcriptome during reprogramming fibroblasts to blood cells, we have analysed transcriptomes of untreated fibroblasts, CDH5 positives cells sorted at day 8 and C-Kit positive cells sorted at day 12.

DESIGN
6 samples, 2 biological replcated of  untreated fibrobalsts, Day 8 CDH5 positive cells, Day 12 C-Kit Positive cells

PLATFORM
GPL6193 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
