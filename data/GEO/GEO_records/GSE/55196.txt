TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of alkaloid biosynthesis induced opium poppy

ORGANISM
Papaver somniferum

SUMMARY
To identify the molecular basis of genome-wide transcriptome analysis in induced opium poppy capsule tissues NimbleGen microarray (12X135 K element) analysis was performed. Fungal elicitor methyl jasmonate (MeJa) treatment was applied on capsules of opium poppy during 0, 3, and 12 h.

DESIGN
Four sample sets were prepared for array analyses:  i) control ii) 0 hour after treatment iii) 3 hour after treatment iv) 12 h after treatment
