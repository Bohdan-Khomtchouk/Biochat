TITLE
profiling of hypothalamus from arthritic DBA/1 mice vs. control DBA/1 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The main function of the nervous system is to maintain homeostasis by sensing and reacting to signals that reach a certain threshold. For example, the brain can sense immune peripheral events through soluble compounds or the vagus nerve and can react through activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in the modulation of an ongoing immune response. Using microarrays we studied the gene expression profile of the hypothalamus in DBA/1 mice strain that developed collagen induced-arthritis vs control mice. Keywords: gene expression profile of the hypothalamus in response to induction of arthritis
