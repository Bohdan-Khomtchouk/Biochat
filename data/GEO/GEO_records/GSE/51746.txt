TITLE
ChIP-seq of MOF, MSL and NSL complex members in mouse ES cells and neuronal progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We assessed the genome-wide binding of the histone acetylase MOF and members of its two associated complexes, the male-specific lethal and the non-specific lethal complex (MSL, NSL). We generated ChIP-seq profiles for MOF, MSL1, MSL2, KANSL3, and MCRS1 from mouse embryonic stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells.  By using two replicates per sample and stringent filtering criteria, we identify five basic groups of genome regions where the proteins show either mutual or exclusive binding. We find that the NSL complex members (KANSL3, MCRS1) target the TSSs of broadly expressed genes with housekeeping functions in both cell types. MOF and particularly the MSL complex target a subset of these NSL-complex-targets, too. In addition, we find several thousand TSS-distal binding sites, particularly in ESCs, where KANSL3, MSL2 and MCRS1 show strong enrichments for annotated ESC enhancers. The vast majority of the binding to these ESC distal regulatory elements is lost in NPCs. Finally, we identify mostly intronic and intergenic regions with predominant MSL2 enrichments without the presence of its known interactors. These binding sites do not overlap with ESC marks of active chromatin (e.g. DNase hypersensitivity sites), but the they increase in number upon differentiation and we detect a strong signature of the (CAGA)n motif. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of MOF in the context of its two complexes in the mouse and reveals shared as well as distinct and dynamic functions for gene regulation and pluripotency.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of MOF and members of its associated complexes (MSL complex: MSL1, MSL2; NSL complex: KANSL3, MCRS1) in male mouse embryonic stem cells and  neuronal progenitor cells derived from them.
