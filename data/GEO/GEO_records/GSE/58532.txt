TITLE
Postnatal epigenetic development of mouse intestinal stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used unbiased whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to identify DNA methylation changes in the intestinal stem cells (ISCs) or their progeny during the suckling period of mouse colon development.

DESIGN
Lgr5-EGFP mice were used to identify ISC populations in the colons. WGBS were performed using EGFP labeled Lgr5+ ISCs and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) labeled epithelial cells isolated at the beginning and end of the suckling period (postnatal day 0-P0 and P21).
