Expression data from CD8+ Central memory T cells after different time periods of Concanavalin A  in vitro activation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD8+ tumor infiltrating T cells (TIL) lack effector-phase functions due to defective proximal TCR-mediated signaling shown to result from inactivation of p56lck kinase. We identify a novel interacting partner for p56lck in nonlytic TIL, Protocadherin-18 (‘pcdh18’), and show that pcdh18 is transcribed upon in vitro or in vivo activation of CD8+ central memory T cells (CD44+CD62LhiCD127+) coincident with conversion into effector memory cells (CD44+CD62LloCD127+). Expression of pcdh18 in primary CD8+ effector cells induces the phenotype of nonlytic TIL: defective; proximal TCR signaling, cytokine secretion, and cytolysis; and enhanced AICD. pcdh18 contains a motif (centered at Y505) shared with src kinases (QGQYQP) which is required for the inhibitory phenotype. Thus, pcdh18 is a novel marker of CD8+ effector memory T cells expressed upon cell activation that can function as a negative regulator by restricting the effector phase. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying CD8+ 'Central memory' T cells activation and identified distinct transcriptional pattern clusters.

DESIGN
Ten spleens were pooled from 62 week old C57BL/6 male mice and enriched for CD8+ T cells by negative selection using a cocktail of biotinylated antibodies to deplete CD4, CD11c, CD11b, MHC-II, B220, and NK cells.  Cells were then stained for CD8, CD44, CD62L, and CD127 and sorted (using a iCyt Reflection parallel cell sorter). Cells were collected and cultured (0.5 x106 cells/well) in 10% complete RPMI media supplemented with 0.005 ugr Con A and RNA prepared using TRIZOL and the 'RNeasy clean-up kit' (Invitrogen) after activation for different times.   We established single transcriptional profiles for 6 time points after T cell activation (4, 6, 8, 16, 20, 24 h) including a control zero h time point (prior to activation). RNA was isolated by standard procedures and its quality was assessed by the NYU Center for Health Informatics and Bioinformatics. cDNAs were hybridized to GeneSpring arrays using the mouse genome MOE430 2.0 array (Affymetrix) which interrogates ~45,000 transcripts.
