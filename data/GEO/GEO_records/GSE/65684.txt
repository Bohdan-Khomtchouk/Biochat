TITLE
Response of Prochlorococcus to varying CO2:O2 ratios

ORGANISM
Prochlorococcus marinus subsp. pastoris str. CCMP1986

SUMMARY
Carbon fixation plays a central role in determining cellular redox poise, increasingly understood to be a key parameter in cyanobacterial physiology.  In the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus--—the most abundant phototroph in the oligotrophic oceans--—the carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) is reduced to the bare essentials.  Given the ability of Prochlorococcus populations to grow under a wide range of oxygen concentrations in the ocean, we wondered how carbon and oxygen physiology intersect in this minimal phototroph.  We monitored genome-wide transcription in cells shocked with acute limitation of CO2, O2, or both.  O2 limitation produced much smaller transcriptional changes than the broad suppression seen under CO2 limitation and CO2/O2 co-limitation.  Strikingly, the transcriptional responses evoked by both CO2 limitation conditions were initially similar to that previously seen in high light stress, but at later timepoints we observed O2-dependent recovery of photosynthesis-related transcripts.  These results suggest that oxygen plays a protective role in Prochlorococcus when carbon fixation is not a sufficient sink for light energy.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of timecourses under four conditions:  medium bubbled with air (control) or three experimental gases (low CO2; low O2; or low CO2 and low O2)
