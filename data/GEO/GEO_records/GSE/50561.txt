TITLE
Trophoblast giant cell underrepresentation (sequencing)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We characterized the mouse trophoblast giant cell epigenome and gene expression profiles.  We then compared these data to our data on underrepresentation in the polyploid trophoblast giant cells.

DESIGN
We profiled 5 histone modifications (+ chromatin input) using ChIP-Seq, and digital expression profiles (3' RNA-Seq) for trophoblast giant cells derived from mouse.  Furthermore, we profiled digital expression profiles (3' RNA-Seq) for in vivo trophoblast giant cells samples from e9.5 wildtype mouse trophoblast giant cells.  We found that underrepresented domains in trophoblast giant cells are enriched for repressive marks and anti-correlate with active marks and transcription.
