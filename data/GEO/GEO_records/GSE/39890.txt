TITLE
Gene knockdown and overexpression of 402C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite their distinct biology, granulosa cell tumours (GCTs) are treated the same as other ovarian tumours.  Intriguingly, a recurring somatic mutation in the transcription factor Forkhead Box L2 (FOXL2) 402C > G has been found in nearly all GCTs examined.  This investigation aims to identify the pathogenicity of mutant FOXL2 by studying its altered transcriptional targets. The expression of mutant FOXL2 was reduced in the GCT cell line KGN, and wildtype and mutant FOXL2 were overexpressed in the GCT cell line COV434. Comparisons were made between the transcriptomes of control cells and cells altered by FOXL2 knockdown and overexpression, to detect potential transcriptional targets of mutant FOXL2.      Comparisons were made between the transcriptomes of control cells and cells altered by FOXL2 knockdown and overexpression, to detect potential transcriptional targets of mutant FOXL2.

DESIGN
Mutant FOXL2 was silenced in KGN cells with the use of siRNA and a non-targetting siRNA control. Wildtype and mutant FOXL2 were overexpressed in COV434 cells with the use of overexpression plasmids and an empty plasmid control.  Each experiment was performed in triplicate.  Total RNA was harvested at 24h post transfection and hybridised to Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays.
