TITLE
Iron-Deficiency in Pregnancy: Effects on the Rat Hippocampus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on the rat hippocampus identifies DMRs near genes concerning neuronal development and plasticity which are affected by an iron-deficient diet in pregnancy.

DESIGN
Hippocampus samples from three iron-sufficient rats, 3 iron-deficient rats are compared with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing.
