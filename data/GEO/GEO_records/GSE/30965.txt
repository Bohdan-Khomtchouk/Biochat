TITLE
Differentiation related tumorigenic potential and transcriptional profile of the fusion reprogrammed mouse cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rebuild tumorgenicity during differentiation of fusion reprogrammed Hepa1-6 cells.

DESIGN
Hepa1-6 was successfully reprogrammed by fusion with ES cells. After differentiation of hybrids in vitro for 7 and 14 days, gene expression was analysed and compared to Hepa1-6 and ES cells.
