TITLE
Expression data from DLD1 cells following H19 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knockdown of H19 leads to cell cycle arrest, reduced cell proliferation, and reduced cell migration in DLD1 cells. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression following H19 knockdown in DLD1 cells

DESIGN
We used two different siRNAs to knockdown H19 expression for 24 hr in DLD1 cells, and collected RNAs for gene expression profiling.
