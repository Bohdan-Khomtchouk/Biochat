TITLE
MAQC-II Project: NIEHS data set

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The NIEHS data set (endpoint C) was provided by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the National Institutes of Health (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). The study objective was to use microarray gene expression data acquired from the liver of rats exposed to hepatotoxicants to build classifiers for prediction of liver necrosis. The gene expression compendium data set was collected from 418 rats exposed to one of eight compounds (1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, bromobenzene, monocrotaline, N-nitrosomorpholine, thioacetamide, galactosamine, and diquat dibromide). All eight compounds were studied using standardized procedures, i.e. a common array platform (Affymetrix Rat 230 2.0 microarray), experimental procedures and data retrieving and analysis processes.

DESIGN
For each compound, four to six male, 12 week old F344 rats were exposed to a low dose, mid dose(s) and a high dose of the toxicant and sacrificed at 6, 24 and 48 hrs later. At necropsy, liver was harvested for RNA extraction, histopathology, and clinical chemistry assessments.
