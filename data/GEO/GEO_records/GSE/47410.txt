TITLE
Quantitative transcriptional changes associated with chlorosis severity in mosaic leaves of tobacco plants infected with the Cucumber mosaic virus

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
In this study, we compared transcriptomes in chlorotic tissues infected with wild type CMV or two CP mutants (129A and 129Q) with diverse chlorosis severity. Differentially expressed genes analysis showed that the CMV inoculation appeared to have similar effects on transcriptional expression profiles of the symptomatic chlorotic tissues and only the magnitude of expression differed among CMVs. Gene ontology analysis with biological process and cellular component terms revealed that many nuclear genes related to abiotic stress responses, including cadmium, heat, cold, and salt, were up-regulated while chloroplast- and photosynthesis-related genes (CPRGs) were down-regulated in the chlorotic tissues. Interestingly, down-regulation level of CPRGs was correlated with the chlorosis severity.

DESIGN
The expression difference genes (DEGs) between mock-inoculated healthy tissues and CMV-inoculated chlorotic tissues in mosaic leaves of tobacco plants were examined by the comparison on one-colour microarray data. Three biological replicates per each treatment were used in this experiment.
