TITLE
The role for TNF-alpha in murine type 1 and 2 diabetes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To search for new therapeutic targets for type 1 & 2 diabetes, we have applied genome wide transcriptional profiling and systems biology oriented bioinformatics analysis to examine the impact of the Power mix(PM) and Alpha-1 Anti-Trypsin( AAT) regimens upon pancreatic lymph node (PLN) and fat, a crucial tissue for insulin dependent glucose disposal, in new onset diabetic NOD mice.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiles of fat and PLNs in normal (non diabetic) NOD mice (NOR), new onset diabetic (DIA), new onset diabetic NOD mice treated with AAT or PM were perfromed in this study

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
