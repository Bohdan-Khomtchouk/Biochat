TITLE
GAS41 over-expression in Saos2 Tet-Off cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription initiation in eukaryotes by RNA polymerase II requires numerous general and regulatory factors including the general transcription factors. Here, we report a new cofactor of the general transcription factor IIF, GAS41, which was previously implicated in tumor development. Microarray analysis of cells with induced overexpression of cofactor GAS41 identifies a significant number of up-regulated transcripts (p-value of 0.01). Keywords: altered gene expression
