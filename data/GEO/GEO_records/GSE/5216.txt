TITLE
GAS41 over-expression in Saos2 Tet-Off cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription initiation in eukaryotes by RNA polymerase II requires numerous general and regulatory factors including the general transcription factors. Here, we report a new cofactor of the general transcription factor IIF, GAS41, which was previously implicated in tumor development. Microarray analysis of cells with induced overexpression of cofactor GAS41 identifies a significant number of up-regulated transcripts (p-value of 0.01). Keywords: altered gene expression

DESIGN
Saos2 Tet-Off clone B3-Dox, with induced GAS41 overexpression, was compared to Saos2 Tet-Off clone B3+Dox, without overexpression. Additionally, B3-Dox was compared to Saos2 Tet-Off clones F7 +Dox/ -Dox, both transfected with pTRE2pur response plasmid only, to exclude any doxycycline effect. All experiments were done in triplicates, revealing twelve data sets.
