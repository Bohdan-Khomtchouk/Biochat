TITLE
Altered gene expression in the neocortices and hippocampi of the adult S1P2-deficient and S1P3-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Altered gene expression in the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2)-deficient or sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1P3)-deficient brain. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
The S1P2-deficient mice suffer from spontaneous/sporadic seizures during 4-7 weeks of age. The S1P3 deficient mice do not show such seizures. The 8-week-old mice were sacrificed for sample preparation. Neocortices and hippocampi were isolated from wild-type, S1P2-deficient, and S1P2-deficient mice (n=10, 5, and 10, respectively).
