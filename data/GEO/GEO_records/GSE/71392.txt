TITLE
Dynamics of H3K4me2 during cardiac lineage reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells by overexpression of transcription factors, GATA4, Hand2, Mef2C and Tbx5 (GHMT), H3K4Me2, an active histone code, shifts from fibroblast-exclusive peaks to cardiomyocyte-exclusive peaks. Important cardiac genes are gradually marked by this active histone marker.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes (NMVMs) represent fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, respectively. Chromatins harvested from MEFs infected with retroviruses carrying GHMT  at day 3, day 5, day 7 post-viral infection were prepared for immunoprecipitation.
