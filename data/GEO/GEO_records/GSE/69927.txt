TITLE
Expression of miRNA in Embryonic Stem Cells-Derived Cardiomyocytes after coculture with Endothelial Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the miRNA that potentially promote the maturation of Embryonic Stem Cells-Derived Cardiomyocytes, we performed miRNA assay profiling to  further know the miRNA expression that differentially expressed after coculture with endothelial cells To further know the miRNA expression that differentially expressed after coculture with endothelial cells, we performed miRNA assay profiling to identify the miRNA that potentially promote the maturation of Embryonic Stem Cells-Derived Cardiomyocytes

DESIGN
Embryonic Stem Cells-Derived Cardiomyocytes were re-sorted from coculture system with GFP promoter
