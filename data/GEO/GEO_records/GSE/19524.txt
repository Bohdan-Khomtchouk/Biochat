TITLE
Potential Molecular Basis for Impaired Collateral Artery Growth in the Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of global gene expression in mesenteric control and collateral arteries was used to investigate potential molecules, pathways  and mechanisms responsible for impaired collateral growth in the Spontaneously Hypertensive rat (SHR).  A fundamental difference was observed in the overall gene expression pattern in SHR vs. Wistar Kyoto (WKY) collaterals (only 6% of the genes altered in collaterals were similar).  IPA analysis identified major differences between WKY and SHR in networks and biological functions related to cell growth and proliferation and gene expression.  Canonical pathways identified by IPA in WKY but not SHR included nitric oxide and renin angiotensin system signaling.  The angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) exhibited up-regulation in WKY collaterals, but down-regulation in SHR; pharmacological blockade of the AT1R with losartan prevented collateral luminal expansion in WKY. In SHR control arteries, several mechano-sensitive and redox-dependent transcription regulators were down-regulated including Jun (-5.2X, P=0.02), Egr-1 (-4.1X, P=0.01), and NFkB1 (-1.95X, P=0.04).   Predicted binding sites for NFkB and AP-1 were present in the genes altered in WKY but not SHR collaterals.    Immunostaining demonstrated increased NFkB nuclear translocation in WKY but not SHR collaterals, and in collaterals of SHR treated with apocynin to restore a normal redox status.  Based upon these results, we propose redox-dependent modulation of mechano-sensitive transcription factors as a mechanism to explain, at least in part, the fundamental differences in collateral gene expression between WKY and SHR and the impairment of collateral growth during chronic oxidative stress.
