TITLE
Globally construct ceRNA regulation network based on comparison with SHEE and SHEEC cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), new star ncRNA class of mRNA-like transcripts, play complicate and critical roles in regulating various key biological processes including chromatin modification, transcription and post-transcriptional processing. Remarkably, some lncRNAs serve as a miRNA “sponge” to inhibit mediation of the differentiation of miRNA target in post-transcriptional regulation. Here, we firstly constructed the putative ceRNA network by integrating lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs expression in compared with SHEE and SHEEC cell lines based on the high-though RNA sequencing data and microarray data. Though the biology function analysis, the result showed that ceRNA network mainly participate in PI3K-Akt pathway and may play a modulating role in regulation of essential signal molecules including SYK, FGF11, IL7R, MET, LAMB3, PRS6KB1, ITGB6, ITGB4, ITGA2, ITGA6, EPHA2, SOS2, VEGFA, GRB2, KRAS, CCDN1 and TP53 in primary ESCC. These results could provide us more essential clues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and efficient drugs target in primary ESCC.

DESIGN
The SHEEC and SHEE cell lines were pooled with 5 cell lines respectively.
