TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 and its ccpA deletion strain grown with and without glucose

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579

SUMMARY
The influence of the presence of glucose in the Y1 growth medium of Bacillus cereus strain ATCC 14579 was studied by transcriptional analysis. Furthermore, the role of CcpA in glucose induction or repression of gene expression was assessed by use of a ccpA deletion strain. In total, 300 genes were glucose repressed and 173 genes glucose activated. For 212 genes the glucose repression was clearly CcpA dependent, whereas for 116 genes CcpA dependent glucose induction was observed. Functional analysis of the glucose regulated genes showed these genes mainly to be involve in energy production and conversion and in metabolism. Furthermore, genes that were glucose repressed were shown to be involved in cell motility.

DESIGN
The wild type and its ccpA deletion strain were grown with and without 0.5% glucose in Y1. Comparisons performed were: 1. wild type and ccpA deletion strain with glucose 2. wild type and ccpA deletion strain without glucose 3. wild type with and wild type without glucose 4. ccpA deletion strain with and ccpA deletion strain without glucose. The experiments were performed in duplicate and the duplicate samples were hybridised with a dye-swap.
