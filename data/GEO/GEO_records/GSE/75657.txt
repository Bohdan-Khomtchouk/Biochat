TITLE
5-Day Gavage Study of 4-Methylcyclohexanemethanol (CASRN: 34885-03-5) in Male Harlan Sprague Dawley Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to characterize the potential toxicity and genomic benchmark dose  of 4-methylcyclohexylmethanol in liver and kidney of male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats using a 5 day dose-response toxicogenomics study design. The 5 day study is used to quickly identify the dose levels where changes in molecular pathways occur. These dose level where pathway level effects begin to occur have been shown to provide a close approximation of a no effect dose level from more resource intensive guideline toxicological assessments.

DESIGN
A total of 58 samples were evaluated in this study. 29 were from liver and 29  were from kidney. Five biological replicate were obtained for the 0 mg/kg/day control group for both liver and kidney. All other non-zero dose groups contain 4 biological replicates. The control groups for liver and kidney are the 0 mg/kg dose groups for those organs.
