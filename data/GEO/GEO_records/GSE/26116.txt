TITLE
Role of HIP1 in HIPPI mediated transcription regulation in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nuclear entry of transcription factor HIPPI is mediated by its interacting partner Huntingtin Interacting Protein 1 (HIP1), a nuclear localization signal containing nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein. In oredr to investigate the role of HIP1 in HIPPI mediated transcriptional regulation in cell, here we performed microarray experiments using stable HIP1 knocked down HeLa cells (Hip1Si) exogenously expressing Green fluorescent protein tagged HIPPI.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from HIP1 knocked down HeLa cells (Hip1Si) transfected with empty GFP vector served as control and Total RNA extracted from Hip1Si cells transfected with GFP-Hippi construct served as test. Biological replicates: 4
