TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of RANK-positive and RANK-negative luminal progenitor subpopulations in the human breast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RANK-positive and RANK-negative luminal progenitor cells were isolated by FACS from histologically normal human breast tissue from wild-type human donors. RNA-seq gene expression profiling was used to find differentially expressed genes between the RANK-positive and RANK-negative cell populations.

DESIGN
Cells were isolated from 4 human patients. A paired analysis was used to compare RANK-positive and RANK-negative cells within patients.
