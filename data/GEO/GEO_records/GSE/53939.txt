TITLE
The Demethylase JMJD2C/KDM4C Localizes to H3K4me3 Positive Transcription Start Sites (ChIP-seq MEFs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have mapped binding sites for the histone demethylase, Jmjd2c/Kdm4c/Gasc1, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and the impact of Jmjd2c depletion on H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 distributions.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was performed using antibodies recognizing Jmjd2c, H3K9me3 or H3K36me3. Chromatin was obtained from conditional Jmjd2c knockout MEFs cultured in the absence or presence of OHT to induce activation of Cre recombinase and loss of Jmjd2c expression.
