TITLE
MiRNA analysis during hepatitis C virus infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study is complementary to the " Genome-wide analysis of host mRNA translation during hepatitis C virus infection " study (GSE44210), for which sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation followed by microarray analysis was used to identify translationally-regulated mRNAs (mRNAs associated with ribosomes) from JFH1-infected and uninfected Huh-7.5.1 cells. MicroRNA arrays have been conducted in parallel on total RNA from infected and uninfected cells, in order to determine if microRNA regulation could explain some of the mRNA translation regulations.

DESIGN
Huh7 cells were infected with HCV JFH-1 strain. Controls consisted in non-infected cells. 3 days after infection, total RNAs were extracted from cell lysate and subjected to miRNA microarray analysis.
