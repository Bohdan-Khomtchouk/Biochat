TITLE
Whole Genome Analysis of a Well-Differentiated Liposarcoma Reveals Novel SYT1 and DDR2 Rearrangements

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used DNA content-based flow cytometry to distinguish and isolate nuclei from clonal populations in a single liposarcoma prior to array comparative genomic hybridization and whole genome sequencing.

DESIGN
We applied DNA content based flow sorting to isolate the nuclei of clonal populations in a single liposarcoma sample prior to array comparative genomic hybridization and next generation sequencing.
