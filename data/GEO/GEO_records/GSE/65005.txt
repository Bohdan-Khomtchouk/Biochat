TITLE
Snai1 regulates cell lineage allocation and stem cell maintenance in the mouse intestinal epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conditional knockout of Snai1 in the mouse intestinal epithlium results in apoptotic loss of crypt base columnar cells and bias towards differentiation of secretory lineages. In vitro organoid cultures derived from Snail conditional knockout mice also undergo apoptosis when Snai1 is deleted. Snai1 is required for regulation of lineage choice and maintenance of CBC stem cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from organoids cultured for 24 hours after treatment with 0.5ÂµM Tamoxifen derived from Villin-Cre and Villin-Cre, Snai1fl/fl mice.
