TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of rice in relation to infection with rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Near-isogenic lines TW16-4 and TW16-69 were developed from the cross between TN1 (recurrent parent susceptible to RTSV) and Utri Merah (donor parent resistant to RTSV). TW16-4 is susceptible to RTSV, whereas TW16-69 is resistant to RTSV based on a serolog. Keywords: time course, virus infection, disease response

DESIGN
Comparison between RTSV and mock-infected rice. Biological replicates: 2 control (mock), 2 RTSV-infected, independently grown and harvested at 7 days after inoculation (DAI). Each sample was prepared using leaf tissues pooled from 5 plants grown under the same conditions.

PLATFORM
