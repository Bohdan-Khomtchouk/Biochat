TITLE
The direction of cross affects obesity after puberty in male but not female offspring

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated parent-of-origin and allele-specific expression effects on obesity and hepatic gene expression in reciprocal crosses between the Berlin Fat Mouse Inbred line (BFMI) and C57Bl/6NCrl (B6N). We sequenced mRNA extracted from liver tissue of 10 M. Musculus individuals. 4 liver samples were collected from 10 week old inbred strains (1 male and 1 female Berlin Fat Mouse Inbred line (BFMI), 1 male and 1 female C57Bl/6NCrl (B6N)) and 6 liver samples collected from 10 week old F1 males using a reciprocal cross design (3 paternal BFMI (patBFMI) vs 3 maternal BFMI (matBFMI)).

DESIGN
Reciprocal crosses were generated from the Berlin Fat Mouse Inbred line BFMI860-12/Hber (BFMI) and C57BL/6NCrl (B6N). Seven BFMI males were mated with seven B6N females and six B6N males with six BFMI860 females to generate 48 F1 animals (deemed patBFMI and matBFMI, respectively). Each reciprocal F1 offspring groups consisted of 12 males and 12 females. From these animals three F1 males from three BFMI females and three F1 males from three B6N females were used for RNA-seq measurements. One high fat diet raised male and female from each inbred parental strain (BFMI and B6N) were used as parental strain control animals and measured via RNA-seq as well.
