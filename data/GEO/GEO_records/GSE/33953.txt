TITLE
Time-course transcriptome measure of HoxB4-mediated HSC development from ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Efficient in vitro generation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) holds great promise for cell-based therapies of hematological diseases. To date, HoxB4 remains to be the most effective transcription factor (TF) whose over-expression in ESCs confers long-term repopulating ability to ESC-derived HSCs. Despite its importance, the components and dynamics of the HoxB4 transcriptional regulatory network is poorly understood, hindering efforts to develop a more efficient protocol for in vitro derivation of HSCs. Towards this goal, we performed global gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) at four stages of the HoxB4-mediated HSC development. Joint analyses of ChIP-Seq and gene expression profiles unveil a number of global features of the HoxB4 regulatory network.

DESIGN
Cells from four time points of the developmental processes were collected, including days 0, 6, 16, and 26. Triplicate microarray hybridizations were done for cells from each time point.
