TITLE
Gene induction by Dex, IL-9 and CCL-1 in BW5147 mouse T cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this work was to determine the genes and mechanisms involved in IL-9- and CCL1-mediated protection against glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. We made the hypothesis that the expression of the really critical mediators could be regulated in a reciprocal way by Dex on the one hand and anti-apoptotic cytokines such as IL-9 and CCL1 on the other hand.Therefore, we performed a comprehensive study of the genes expressed by BW5147 cells stimulated with or without Dex, IL-9 and CCL1, taking advantage of the Affymetrix microarray technology. Keywords: cytokine and dexamethasone stimulation

DESIGN
One million BW5147 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of dexamethasone and/or with 100 U/ml of IL-9 or CCL1 for eight hours. RNA was then extracted for  hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. This experiment was performed in duplicates .
