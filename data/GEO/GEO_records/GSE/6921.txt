TITLE
Rice japonica gene expression array across eleven tissues

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To validate transcription of the japonica non-exonic TARs and to understand their transcriptional relation with annotated genes, we constructed a new array (designated the re-array) to surrogate 44,385 non-TE gene models and 25,313 TARs in japonica each with five independent 36mer probes. Using the re-array, we obtained triplicate expression estimates from 11 rice tissue. Keywords: gene expression
