TITLE
Rap1a GTPase mVSM Knockout vs. Rescue mRNA Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse tail artery explanted microvascular smooth muscle (mVSM) cells comparing Rap1a -/- mVSM cells transduced with vector backbone (control) with Rap1a -/- mVSM cells transduced with a Rap1 CA 'rescue' plasmid.  The experiment will compare mRNA expression in Rap1A -/- mVSMs and 'rescued'with Rap1A CA.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, mVSM Rap1a -/- (vector control) vs. mVSM-RapCA. Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 transduced replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
