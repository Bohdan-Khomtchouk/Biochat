TITLE
Determination of ABO blood type for prostate cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose:  This study uses a high-throughput glycan microarray to assign ABO blood type to patients from a clinical trial on PROSTVAC.  The goal is to determine if blood type correlates with survival for patients treated with PROSTVAC Results:  Blood types were assigned and type B and O patients were found to have longer survival than type A and AB patients Conclusion: Blood type may serve as a convenient method to identify patients likely to respond favorably to PROSTVAC therapy

DESIGN
Sera from 111 patients treated with either PROSTVAC or Control vector were profiled on the array.  ABO blood type was assigned, then evaluated for correlations with overall survival
