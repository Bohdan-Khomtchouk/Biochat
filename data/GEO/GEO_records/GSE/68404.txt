TITLE
Determination of ABO blood type for prostate cancer patients

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Purpose:  This study uses a high-throughput glycan microarray to assign ABO blood type to patients from a clinical trial on PROSTVAC.  The goal is to determine if blood type correlates with survival for patients treated with PROSTVAC Results:  Blood types were assigned and type B and O patients were found to have longer survival than type A and AB patients Conclusion: Blood type may serve as a convenient method to identify patients likely to respond favorably to PROSTVAC therapy
