TITLE
Human BJ fibroblasts containing control vs. BRD7 shRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human BJ fibroblasts comparing control FF shRNA expressing cells vs. BRD7 shRNA expressing cells under two conditions, either untreated or treated with 8uM nutln-3a for 8 hours. This experiment was done using two independent shRNAs targeting BRD7. Nutlin-3a was used to stabilize p53 and induce its transcriptional activity.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, FF shRNA cells vs. BRD7 shRNAs cells in two experimental conditions, either untreated or treated with nutlin-3a.
