TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of pre and post excision human induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis was performed on pre and post excision human induced pluripotent stem cells, the donor human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) they were derived from and control human embryonic stem cells

DESIGN
We isolated total RNA from pre and post excision human induced pluripotent stem cells, the donor human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) they were derived from and control human embryonic stem cells and analyzed via Affymetrix microarray analysis.
