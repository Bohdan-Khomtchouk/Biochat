TITLE
Profiling of genes regulated by TGF-beta in immortalized skin keratinocyte cells(HaCaT).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGF-beta is one of the key cytokines implicated in various disease processes including cancer. TGF-beta inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis in normal epithelial cells and in contrast, acts as a pro-tumour cytokine by promoting tumour angiogenesis, immune-escape and metastasis. The effect of TGF-beta on the regulation of gene expression is cell-type specific. In order to identify TGF-beta regulated genes in different cell-types, we followed the expression profiling approach. Keywords: cell type specific response to TGF-beta
