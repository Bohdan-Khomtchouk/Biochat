ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae ; Chlamydia trachomatis ; Mycoplasma genitalium ; Mycoplasma hominis ; Ureaplasma ; Human alphaherpesvirus 1 ; Human alphaherpesvirus 2 ; Human papillomavirus type 11 ; Human papillomavirus type 31 ; Human papillomavirus type 33 ; Human papillomavirus type 35 ; Human papillomavirus type 39 ; Human papillomavirus type 58 ; Human papillomavirus type 6 ; Human papillomavirus type 16 ; Human papillomavirus type 18 ; Alphapapillomavirus 13

SUMMARY
This work describes the development of the first microarray detection system that simultaneously identifies common pathogens associated with STDs from clinical samples, and paves the way for establishing a time-saving, accurate and high-throughput diagnostic tool.

DESIGN
The target genes are 16S rRNA gene for N. gonorrhoeae, M. genitalium, M. hominism, and Ureaplasma, the major outer membrane protein gene (ompA) for C. trachomatis, the glycoprotein B gene (gB) for HSV; and the L1 gene for HPV. 34 probes that reproducibly detected multiple Legionella species with high specificity were included in the array.
