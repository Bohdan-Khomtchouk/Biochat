TITLE
WRKY43 regulates polyunsaturated fatty acid content and abiotic stress tolerance of Arabidopsis seeds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Loss of the seed-specific WRKY transcription factor WRKY43 confers enhanced tolerance towards high salt, high osmolarity and low temperature with respect to seed germination. wrky43 loss of function lines display increased inhibition of seed germination in response to exogenous ABA, while WRKY43 overexpression lines are more tolerant towards exogenous ABA. The opposing effect of the wrky43 mutant on salt and ABA tolerance is reminiscent of fatty acid desaturase mutants. Loss of WRKY43 enhances polyunsaturated fatty acid content, particularly 18:2 and 18:3 in TAGs and Phospholipids. Gene chip arrays show that ABA-induced regulation of FUSCA3, ZAT10 and seed storage proteins are absent in the wrky43 mutant. Promoter-Luciferase studies confirm direct regulation of ZAT10 by WRKY43 and suggest indirect regulation of FUS3 and SSPs. In summary WRKY43 acts as a positive regulator of ABA-dependent gene regulation and of fatty acid desaturation that finally results in enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress.

DESIGN
2 biological replicates of Arabidopsis thaliana Ler-0 wildtype and wrky43 muatnt seeds were compared after incubation in liquid 0.5 MS media with 2 ÂµM ABA for 4 days
