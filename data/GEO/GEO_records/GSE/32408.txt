TITLE
Expression data from TOP-GFP sorted colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colon cancers typically contain tumor cell populations with differential WNT signaling activity. Colon cancer cells with high WNT-activity have been attributed increase tumorigenic potential and stem cell characteristics. We extracted tumor cells with differential WNT activity using fluorescent reporters from xenografted human colon cancer cell line tumors and primary human colon cancer xenografts and analysed their gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
Colon cancer cell lines and primary colon cancer xenografts were transduced with lentiviral TOP-GFP reporters, and grown as xenografts in NOD-SCID mice. We disaggregated these tumors, flow sorted for GFPhigh and GFPlow tumor cells and subjected these populations to gene expression profiling.
