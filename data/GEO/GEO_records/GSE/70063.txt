TITLE
Reconstructing genetic history of Siberian and Notheastern European populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To obtain a broad overview of the population genetic relationships, we genotyped 48 samples from the Mansi population and 48 samples from the Khanty population, and compared them to samples from 25 other populations.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA extracted from blood was genotyped using HumanOmniExpress-12 v1-1 (the first set of 48 samples) and HumanOmniExpress-24 v1-0 (the second set of 48 samples) Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).
