TITLE
Transcription profile analysis of S. cerevisiae ZTW1 wild-type and mutant strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for transcription profile analysis of two S. cerevisiae strains.  By combining the whole genome sequence of these strains,we sought to explore the effects of genomic structure variations on the transcription diversities.

DESIGN
Comparsion of transcription profiles in S. cerevisiae strains
