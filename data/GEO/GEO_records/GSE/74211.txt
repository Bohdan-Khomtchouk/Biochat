TITLE
Primary Human Osteoblasts miRNA array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A microRNA array was performed using human primary osteoblasts (hOB) obtained from trabecular bone of postmenopausal women after knee replacement due to osteoarthritis in order to determine the miRNAs expressed in these osteoblastic cells.

DESIGN
4 samples were analyzed: Human primary osteoblasts (hOB) were obtained from trabecular bone of postmenopausal women after knee replacement due to osteoarthritis (n=4).
