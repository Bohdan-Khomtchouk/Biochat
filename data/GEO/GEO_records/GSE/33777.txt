TITLE
Over-expression of the transcription factor ARID3A (Bright)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Retroviral contructs containing the full-length murine ARID3A (aka Bright) gene and a GFP gene or the GFP gene alone were used to electroporate the human RAJI B cell line. GFP positive cells were sorted and expanded in vitro. Differences in gene expression between the constructs were identified.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 4 independent cell culture replicates of each retroviral construct.
