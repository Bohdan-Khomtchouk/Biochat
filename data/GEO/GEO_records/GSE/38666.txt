TITLE
Molecular Profiling provides evidence of the existence of two functionally distinct classes of ovarian cancer stroma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA microarray profiling of 45 tissue samples was carried out using the Affymetrix (U133) gene expression platform. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was employed to isolate cancer cells from the tumors of 18 serous ovarian cancer patients (Cepi). For 7 of these patients, a matched set of surrounding cancer stroma (CS) was also collected. For controls, surface ovarian epithelial cells (OSE) were isolated from the normal (non-cancerous) ovaries of 12 individuals including matched sets of samples of OSE and normal stroma (NS) from 8 of these patients. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the microarray data resulted in the expected separation between the OSE and Cepi samples. Consistent with models of stromal activation, we also observed significant separation between the NS and CS samples. Unexpectedly, the CS samples sub-divided into two distinct groups. Analysis of expression patterns of genes encoding signaling molecules and compatible receptors in the CS and Cepi samples are consistent with the hypothesis that the two CS sub-groups differ significantly in their relative propensities to support tumor growth.The results indicate the existence of distinct categories of ovarian cancer stroma and suggest that functionally significant variability exists among ovarian cancer patients in the ability of the microenvironment to modulate cancer development.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of 8 normal stroma (NS) and 8 matched normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) from 12 individuals, along with 7 cancer stroma and 7 matched cancer epithelium from 18 additional ovarian cancer patients
