TITLE
MRC1-Dependent Scaling of the Budding Yeast DNA Replication Timing Program

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Fourteen yeast mutants with an extended S-phase were identified by a novel genome-wide screen. These mutants are associated with the DNA replication machinery, cell-cycle control and dNTP synthesis. We determined the genome-wide DNA replication timing profile of all these mutants as well as wild type, by FACS-sorting G1- and S-phase cells and co-hybridizing their DNA to Agilent genomic tiling arrays, in four repeats each. We find that MRC1 is required for scaling of the DNA replication timing program upon replication perturbation.

DESIGN
Four repeats for each strain, S vs G1 phase-cell DNA with different Cy dyes for each
