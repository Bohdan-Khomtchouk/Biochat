TITLE
Expression data from vehicle and adrenomedullin treated human lymphatic endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells were cultured and treated with either vehicle or 10 nM AM for 15 minutes, 1 hour, or 24 hours to assess gene expression changes across the human genome with AM treatment.

DESIGN
Two variable experiment, time (0.25, 1, 24 hours) and treament (vehicle vs adrenomedullin) of gene expression in human lymphatic endothelial cells. Biological replicates: 3-4 per condition.
