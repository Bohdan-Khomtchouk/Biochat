TITLE
RMA expression data for liver samples from subjects with HCV, HCV-HCC, or normal liver

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the pathogenesis of HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not completely understood, particularly at the molecular level. We studied gene expression in normal, pre-malignant (cirrhosis), and tumor (HCC) liver tissues using Affymetrix GeneChips. Keywords: cross-sectional

DESIGN
Liver tissue samples were obtained from patients waiting for liver transplantation at one of the GR2HCC Centers. Additionally, normal liver and tumor samples were also obtained from the Liver Tissue Cell Distribution System. For each sample, RNA was extracted and hybridized to an Affymetrix GeneChip.
