TITLE
Addiction of t(8;21) and inv(16) AML to native RUNX1 [Gene Expression data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer cells maintain a sensitive balance between growth-promoting oncogenes and apoptosis inhibitors. We show that WT RUNX1 is required for survival of t(8;21)-Kasumi-1 and inv(16)-ME-1 AML cell lines. The malignant AML phenotype is sustained by a delicate AML1-ETO/RUNX1 balance that involves competition for common DNA binding sites regulating a subset of AML1-ETO/RUNX1 targets.

DESIGN
Genome  expression was profiled after performing knockdown of RUNX1 and AML1-ETO in Kasumi-1 cells using specific siRNA-oligo nucleotides, and analyzed using Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
