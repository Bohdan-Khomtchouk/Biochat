TITLE
The Tight Junction Protein Claudin-2 Controls Mucosal Permeability, Immune Tolerance and Colitis in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mucosal epithelium plays a key role in regulating immune homeostasis. Dysregulation of epithelial barrier function is associated with mucosal inflammation. Expression of claudin-2, a pore-forming tight junction protein, is highly upregulated during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and, due to its association with epithelial permeability, has been postulated to promote inflammation. Furthermore, claudin-2 also regulates colonic epithelial cell proliferation and intestinal nutrient absorption. However, the precise role of claudin-2 in regulating colonic epithelial and immune homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate, using Villin-Claudin-2 transgenic (Cl-2TG) mice, that increased colonic claudin-2 expression unexpectedly protects mice against experimentally induced colitis and colitis-associated cancer. Notably, Cl-2TG mice exhibited increased colon length and permeability as compared with wild type (WT) littermates. However, despite their leaky colon, Cl-2TG mice subjected to experimental colitis were immune compromised, with reduced induction of TLR-2, TLR-4, Myd-88 expression and NF-kB and STAT3 activation. Most importantly, colonic macrophages in Cl-2TG mice exhibited an anergic phenotype. Claudin-2 overexpression also increased colonocyte proliferation and provided protection against colitis-induced colonocyte death. Taken together, our findings have revealed a critical role of claudin-2 in regulating colonic homeostasis, suggesting novel therapeutic strategies for inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract.

DESIGN
8-10 weeks old male Villin-Claudin-2 transgenic mice and WT littermates were provided either normal drinking water (control) or Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS: 4% w/v) for 10 days. 3 replicates each.
