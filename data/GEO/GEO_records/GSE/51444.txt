TITLE
Statin induced changes in gene expression in EBV-transformed and native B-cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Statin-induced gene expression differences observed in LCLs may be influenced by their transformation, and thus differ from those observed in native B-cells.  To assess this possibility, we prepared LCLs and purified B-cells from the same donors, and compared mRNA profiles after 24hr incubation with simvastatin (2µM) or sham buffer.

DESIGN
We prepared LCLs and purified B-cells from the same donors, and compared mRNA profiles after 24hr incubation with simvastatin (2µM) or sham buffer. Genes involved in cholesterol metabolism were similarly regulated between the two cell types under both the statin and sham treated conditions, and the statin-induced changes were significantly correlated.
