TITLE
The microRNA-200 family regulates pancreatic beta-cell survival in type 2 diabetes (islet)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Islets from control and beta-cell specific miR-141/200c overexpressing mice were extracted and Affymetrix gene expression analysis performed We used Affymetrix Chip analysis to address which genes are regulated upon miR-200-overexpression in beta-cells at the age of 6 weeks.

DESIGN
Transgenic mice overexpressing miR-141/200c and control mice were subjected to islet extraction, RNA was extracted using Trizol method, and Affymetrix analysis was performed.
