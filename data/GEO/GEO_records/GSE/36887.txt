TITLE
Impact of albino chemical on Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of wild type genome expression profile altered by albino chemicals. Results uncovered a several groups of genes that were significant responsive to these chemicals which may contribute to the albino phenotype.

DESIGN
WT (Col-0) sown on 0.5x MS agar medium and stratified in the dark at 4 °C for 3 days and then germinated in the light condition (16 h light/8 h dark) for 5 days at 22 °C, and then transfer to the 0.5x MS solution one day for adapt the treatment condition. In the DAG 6 (day after germination), final concentration 50 μM chemicals (7606596 and 5929745) were supplemented into the medium for chemical treatment. Approximately 2,000 seedlings were used to collect tissues before the chemicals treatment as the time zero samples. Seedlings were collected after the chemical treatment for 3 hours and 12 hours. Total RNA extracted from the collected samples was applied in each microarray experiment with Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip (Affymetrix). Qiagen RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen) was used for RNA preparation. cDNA labeling, array hybridization, and scanning followed by standard Affymetrix expression array protocol. Two independent sets of microarray analyses were performed in this assay.
