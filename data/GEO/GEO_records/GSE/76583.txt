TITLE
CRC cells_Aspirin treatment_48 hours_Rep8

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the lncRNA profiles of colorectal carcinoma cells treated with aspirin, we performed microarray analysis using primary cultured cancer cells obtained from 8 clinical CRC tissues. After the CRC cells were treated with aspirin for 48 hours, 28 lncRNAs were statistically up-regulated more than 2-fold.

DESIGN
We treated the primary cultured cancer cells obtained from 8 clinical CRC tissues with DMSO (negative control group_Rep8) and aspirin (Experiment group_Rep8).
