TITLE
Microarray analysis of miRNAs involved in Porcine Alveolar Macrophages at the early stage of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection [LCS_miRPig_18]

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
By analyzing the changes of miRNAs of piglet PAMs at different time points after PRRSV infection,we can find porcine miRNAs associated with viral infection and possible target sites in both PRRSV and pig genome and their roles in protection against viral infections. Then these targets will screened by bioinformatics methods to find the susceptibility genes, resistance genes and immune related genes, and formed molecular biology network of miRNAs at gene and protein level .

DESIGN
PAM cells were inoculated with HuN4, and were collected at 12h and 24h post-inoculation (pi), respectively. The uninfected cells served as mock-infected cells.The miRNA chip was according to the porcine miRNA sequences in Sanger miRBase Release 18.0 ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna/ )added with some miRNAs we found in reference. Then we confirmed the expression change of some important miRNAs by qRT-PCR
