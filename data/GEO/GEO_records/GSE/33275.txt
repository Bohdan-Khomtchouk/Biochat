TITLE
Gene expression in  P. aeruginosa cystic fibrosis isolates grown on Nematode Growth Medium

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) lung infection is a significant cause of mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Existing experimental data in our lab showed significantly different levels of virulence of " early " and " late " P. aeruginosa infection isolates in a C. elegans slow killing model. We wished to examine the expression profile of these isolates in order to explore genes that may be responsible for the observed differences. The expression profiles of two pairs of isolates (four isolates in total) were compared to each other  using the Affymetrix P. aeruginosa PAO1 genome array, to gain insight into properties mediating virulence in these isolates. Data analysis was carried out using BIOCONDUCTOR software. Keywords: Comparative strain hybridization

DESIGN
Two pairs of isolates (four isolates in total) were compared to each other when grown on Nematode Growth Medium (NGM).
