TITLE
microRNA signature in b-cell lymphomas and control human B cells from fresh tonsils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
147 B-cell lymphomas were studies for miRNA expression miRNA profiling of control human B cell populations Comparison of miRNA expression profiles of naive B cells (CD19+ IgD+ CD27-) from 3 individuals and germinal center B cells (CD10+ CD19+) from 4 individuals

DESIGN
147 B-cell lymphomas were hybridized on a human miRNA one-color platform containing probes for 470 human miRNAs. Each lymphoma type was compared to all set of NHLs. Burkitt Lymphoma was also directly compared to DLBCL miRNA expression signature is different in human naive B cells compared to Germinal Center B cells

PLATFORM
GPL9081 Agilent-016436 Human miRNA Microarray 1.0 G4472A (miRNA ID version)
