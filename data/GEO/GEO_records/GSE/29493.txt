TITLE
microRNA signature in b-cell lymphomas and control human B cells from fresh tonsils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
147 B-cell lymphomas were studies for miRNA expression miRNA profiling of control human B cell populations Comparison of miRNA expression profiles of naive B cells (CD19+ IgD+ CD27-) from 3 individuals and germinal center B cells (CD10+ CD19+) from 4 individuals
