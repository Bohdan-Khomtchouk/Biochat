TITLE
Expression data from HeLa cells transiently transfected with control siRNA or SON siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SON is a large Ser/Arg (SR)-related protein localized in nuclear speckles. SON siRNA causes defects in mitotic progression and genome instability. We used microarrays to detail the pattern of gene expression after SON knockdown.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were grown in 100 mm dishes and transfected with negative control siRNA or SON siRNA (400 pmol). Then, cells were harvested after 66 hours and RNAs were isolated. Microarrays were performed using GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 (Affymetrix).
