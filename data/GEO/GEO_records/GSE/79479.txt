TITLE
Difference in miRNA expression profiles of testes tissues from different breeder cock related to dietary intake of Astragalus Polysaccharide

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We generated miRNA expression profiles of testes from breeder cocks fed with control diets and extra Astragalus Polysaccharide.  A total of 663 and 660 miRNAs were expressed in control and APS groups, and there were 16 up-expressed miRNAs and 17 down-expressed miRNAs in APS group, compared with the control group meeting the criteria of P-values < 0.05.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiles of testes from breeder cocks fed with control diets and extra Astragalus Polysaccharide.
