TITLE
Gene expression profile in peritoneal macrophage stimulated with B-DNA or CpG-B

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Toll-like receptor and RIG-I-like receptor classs may evoke or instruct a distinct type of response that is more reflective of the pathogen encountered.  Although this issue may be critical to a better understanding of the regulation of immune responses to microbial infections, it has not been addressed through a direct, side-by-side comparison of the two receptor classes. To address this, we performed microarray analysis of mRNAs from peritoneal macrophages stimulated with a synthetic B-form DNA, poly(dA-dT)・poly(dT-dA) ( B-DNA) or a CpG-B oligonucleotide, which respectively activates RLRs or TLR9, and identified B-DNA inducible genes and CpG-B inducible genes.

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from B6 mice were stimulated with B-DNA (10μg/ml) or CpG-B(3μM) for 4 hous, and then subjected to microarray analysis.
