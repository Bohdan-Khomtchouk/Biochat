TITLE
Expression data from early Zebrafish embryos after knockdown of mir-34

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
microRNAs play crucial roles in the early development of an organism.  However the regulation of transcription through the action of microRNAs during the initial embyonic development has not been studied. We used microarrays to detail the effect of maternal microRNA mir-34 in regulation of zygotic trancription during the initial stages of Zebrafish embryonic development from one cell stage through the maternal-zygotic transition up to 24 hours post fertilization.

DESIGN
Zebrafish embryos were selected at specific stages of early embryonic development (1, 7, and 24 hours post fertilization). RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. The embryos were injected with anti-microRNA LNA and were kept for constant monitoring for the indicated time points. A mockLNA was injected as a control. The embryos were visualized for any visible developmental abnormalities.
