TITLE
A new multi-sample hybridized microarray platform for quantitative gene expression on a small scale

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
For increasing sample size in microarry experiments, we have developed a new oligonucleotide microarray technology. This microarray platform can greatly increase the sample size for increasing the veracity of gene expression and meeting the data analysis requirement. Keywords: Gene expression, Oligonucleotide microarray, Sample size

DESIGN
Limited by SpotBot microarrayer,we printed multiple copies(48)of sub-array which contained oligonucleotide probes of relatively small number of genes (20)and controls(12) on one slide. Multiple labeled samples hybridized individually on each sub-array at same time.

PLATFORM
GPL5442 Gallus gallus 3k multi-sample microarray platform
