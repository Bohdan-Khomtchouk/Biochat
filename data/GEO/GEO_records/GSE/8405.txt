TITLE
A new multi-sample hybridized microarray platform for quantitative gene expression on a small scale

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
For increasing sample size in microarry experiments, we have developed a new oligonucleotide microarray technology. This microarray platform can greatly increase the sample size for increasing the veracity of gene expression and meeting the data analysis requirement. Keywords: Gene expression, Oligonucleotide microarray, Sample size
