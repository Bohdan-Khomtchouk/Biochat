TITLE
Anticancer effects of pycnogenol, catechin, epicatechin, taxifol and resveratrol on human fibrosarcoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assessed the apoptotic and antiproliferative effects of resveratrol, pycnogenol and its metabolites on HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells in vitro. Viability, apoptosis and necrosis were quantified by FACS analysis (Propidiumiodide/AnnexinV staining). Gene expression was analysed by RNA-Microarray. Cell proliferation was analysed by BrdU ELISA assay.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to investigate differential gene expression in HT1080 fibrosaroma cells after incubation with pycnogenol, catechin, epicatechin, taxifolin and resveratrol. Microarray analysis revealed differential gene expression patterns of HT1080 after incubation with compounds.
