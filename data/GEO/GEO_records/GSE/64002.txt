TITLE
Single-cell RNA Seq of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This dataset is part of a study that investigated how the hematopoietic system coordinates the rapid and efficient regeneration of the megakaryocytic lineage during stress scenarios. We found that the phenotypic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment contains stem-like megakaryocyte-committed progenitors (SL-MkPs), a cell population that shares many features with multipotent HSCs and serves as a lineage-restricted emergency pool for inflammatory insults. This dataset contains single-cell RNA sequencing data of 30 hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells which, in the context of our study, confirmed that MK-specfic transcripts are of highly variable expression in HSCs. The dataset further showed that variations in MK transcript expression in HSCs is not correlated with global transcriptomic rearrangements.

DESIGN
Murine bone marrow cells were sorted by Lin-cKit+CD150+CD48- (referred to as cd150+ in the following) and Lin-cKit+CD150- (referred to as cd150- in the following). Transcriptomes of 11 cd150- and 9 cd150+ HSCs were determined using QUARTZ, a single-cell RNASeq protocol
