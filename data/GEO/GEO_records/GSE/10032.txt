TITLE
The acute effects of methoxyacetic acid exposure on testis gene expression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We evaluated the possible mechanisms by which 2-methoxyacetic acid (MAA) disrupts spermatogenesis using high density microarrays.  Levels of mRNA transcripts were determined in total RNA isolated from testes of MAA-treated (650 mg/kg i.p.) or concurrent control rats sacrificed 4, 8, 12 or 24 hrs post exposure (PE). Keywords: Toxicology, Time Course,
