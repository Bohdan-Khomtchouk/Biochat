TITLE
The acute effects of methoxyacetic acid exposure on testis gene expression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We evaluated the possible mechanisms by which 2-methoxyacetic acid (MAA) disrupts spermatogenesis using high density microarrays.  Levels of mRNA transcripts were determined in total RNA isolated from testes of MAA-treated (650 mg/kg i.p.) or concurrent control rats sacrificed 4, 8, 12 or 24 hrs post exposure (PE). Keywords: Toxicology, Time Course,

DESIGN
Sexually mature Sprague Dawley male rats were treated i.p. with 650 mg/kg of 2-methoxyacetic acid (CAS# 625-45-6).  Treated animals were sacrificed, along with concurrent control animals 4, 8 12 or 24 hr post exposure (n=6 per treatment or control per time point, 48 total animals).  Agilent 20K oligonucleotide microarrays were used to examine the levels of transcripts in whole testis total RNA.  Universal rat RNA was used as reference.
