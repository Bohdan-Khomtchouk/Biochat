TITLE
Identification of the cellular RNAs bound by MOV10

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the iCLIP protocol we have identified the cellular RNA entities that are bound by MOV10. We report the location and sequence of the MOV10 binding region on each RNA entity.

DESIGN
To identify the RNAs that bound MOV10, we UV-cross-linked HEK293F cells and immunoprecipitated with an irrelevant antibody (ir or " control " ) followed by a MOV10-specific antibody (MOV10) to isolate associated RNAs after stringent washing.

PLATFORM
