ENCODE Transcription Factor Binding Sites by ChIP-seq from Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Philip Cayting mailto:pcayting@stanford.edu ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( mailto:genome@soe.ucsc.edu ). This track shows probable binding sites of the specified transcription factors (TFs) in the given cell types as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Included for each cell type is the input signal, which represents the control condition where no antibody targeting was performed. For each experiment (cell type vs. antibody) this track shows a graph of enrichment for TF binding (Signal), along with sites that have the greatest evidence of transcription factor binding (Peaks).

DESIGN
Cells were grown according to the approved ENCODE cell culture protocols. Further preparations were similar to those previously published (Euskirchen et al., 2007) with the exceptions that the cells were unstimulated and sodium orthovanadate was omitted from the buffers. For details on the chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol used, see Euskirchen et al. (2007) and Rozowsky et al. (2009). DNA recovered from the precipitated chromatin was sequenced on the Illumina (Solexa) sequencing platform and mapped to the genome using the Eland alignment program. ChIP-seq data was scored based on sequence reads (length ~30 bps) that align uniquely to the human genome. From the mapped tags a signal map of ChIP DNA fragments (average fragment length ~ 200 bp) was constructed where the signal height is the number of overlapping fragments at each nucleotide position in the genome. For each 1 Mb segment of each chromosome a peak height threshold was determined by requiring a false discovery rate < = 0.05 when comparing the number of peaks above threshold as compared the number obtained from multiple simulations of a random null background with the same number of mapped reads (also accounting for the fraction of mapable bases for sequence tags in that 1 Mb segment). The number of mapped tags in a putative binding region is compared to the normalized (normalized by correlating tag counts in genomic 10 kb windows) number of mapped tags in the same region from an input DNA control. Using a binomial test, only regions that have a p-value < = 0.05 are considered to be significantly enriched compared to the input DNA control.
