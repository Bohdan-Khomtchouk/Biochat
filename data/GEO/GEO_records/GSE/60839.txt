TITLE
miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array (7th Gen) profiling of monocyte-derived macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the miRNA changes that occur during macrophage and dendritic cell differentiation we used the miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array (7th Gen) to profile monocyte-derived macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Of the 2046 probes present on the assay, we detected expression of ~400 (20%) miRNAs across all samples.
