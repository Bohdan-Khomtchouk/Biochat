TITLE
miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array (7th Gen) profiling of monocyte-derived macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the miRNA changes that occur during macrophage and dendritic cell differentiation we used the miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array (7th Gen) to profile monocyte-derived macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Of the 2046 probes present on the assay, we detected expression of ~400 (20%) miRNAs across all samples.

DESIGN
CD14+ monocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of 4 normal, healthy volunteers and differentiated into macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro. Total RNA was isolated from these cells at 0, 1, 4, 12, 24, 72, 120, and 168 hours of culture. RNA was profiled using the Qiagen miRCURY LNATM microRNA Hi-Power Labelling Kit and miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array (7th Gen).
