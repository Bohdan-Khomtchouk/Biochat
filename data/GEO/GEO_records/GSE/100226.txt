TITLE
An integrated computational-experimental approach reveals Yersinia pestis genes essential across a narrow or a broad range of environmental conditions

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis

SUMMARY
Using a library of over 1 million Y. pestis CO92 random mutants and transposon-directed insertion site sequencing, we identified 530 essential genes when the bacteria were cultured at 28oC. When the library of mutants was subsequently cultured at 37oC we identified 19 genes that were essential at 37oC but not at 28oC, including genes which encode proteins that play a role in enabling functioning of the type III secretion and in DNA replication and maintenance.

DESIGN
100 bp single end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 standard mode
