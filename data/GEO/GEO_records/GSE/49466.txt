TITLE
Effects of PP2Ac over-expression on mouse na誰ve CD4 T cell gene profile upon activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A transgenic mouse was generated using a CD2-driven transgene containing the cDNA of Ppp2ca to achieve over-expression of PP2Ac in T cells. Na誰ve CD4 T cells were isolated and lysed at times 0, 6, and 24 hours after stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28

DESIGN
Na誰ve CD4 T cells from wild type mice were compared with na誰ve CD4 T cells from PP2Ac transgenic mice
