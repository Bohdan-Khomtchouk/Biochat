TITLE
Analysis of 3' 2'-O-methylated small RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To identify methylated small RNAs in C. elegans, we deep sequenced both β-eliminated and untreated small RNAs isolated from wild type C. elegans.

DESIGN
Small RNAs were isolated from larval and adult stage C. elegans and either subjected to β-elimination or no treatment. Small RNA cDNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq instrument, and enrichment or depletion of small RNAs by β-elimination was assessed after library size normalization based on the number of mappable reads in each library.
