TITLE
Dynamic Changes in the Copy Number of Pluripotency and Cell Proliferation Genes in Human ES and iPS Cells during Reprogramming and Time in Culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (hESCs and iPSCs) are being considered as sources of differentiated cells for drug development and cell therapy. Genomic stability of these cells is important for in vitro studies, and is critical for clinical applications.  Of particular concern for cell therapy is the known association between genetic aberrations and tumorigenicity.  Our results highlight the dynamic nature of genomic abnormalities in pluripotent stem cell culture and the need for frequent genomic monitoring of pluripotent stem cells destined for transplantation in order to determine the impact of specific genomic changes on phenotypic stability and clinical safety.

DESIGN
To map genomic abnormalities in pluripotent cells, we compared 130 hESC, 56 iPSC, 55 somatic stem cell and primary cell, and 67 tissue samples using high resolution SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) analysis.
