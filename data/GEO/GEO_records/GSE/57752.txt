TITLE
Gene expression analysis during adventitious root formation in petunia cuttings

ORGANISM
Petunia x hybrida

SUMMARY
In order to identify genes specifically induced during various developmental stages of Adventitious Root (AR) formation (described in Ahkami et al. 2009) in leafy cuttings of Petunia hybrida (line W115) and to describe the series of physiological processes during adventitious rooting, a microarray-based transcriptome analysis in the stem base of the cuttings was conducted. The microarray was described by Breuillin et al. (2010) and included a normalized cDNA library from different time points after taking the cuttings from mother plant. Because physiological processes and molecular changes specifically involved in AR formation were considered as of major interest, rather than those associated with wound responses, a filtration approach was chosen to eliminate primarily wound-responsive genes. This study is mainly focused on changes in transcript abundances of genes related to specific metabolic pathways or cellular events including primary metabolism, membrane transport, cell division or signalling during various phases of AR formation.

DESIGN
The overall design of the custom microarray used in this study is described in Breuillin et al. (2010). In brief, a database of 24,816 unigene sequences (including 4,700 ESTs from P. hybrida cutting base and all public available P. hybrida and P. axillaris sequences) was used for construction of a custom microarray.
