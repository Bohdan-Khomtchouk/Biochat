TITLE
Inhibition of Ubc13-mediated ubiquitination by GPS2 regulates multiple stages of B cell development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Non-proteolytic ubiquitin signaling mediated by K63 ubiquitin chains plays a critical role in multiple pathways converging on NFKB activation that are key to the development and activation of immune cells. However, a complete understanding of how the regulation of ubiquitin signaling affects immune cells development and functionality is still missing. G Protein Suppressor 2 (GPS2) is a multi-functional protein that recently emerged as an important regulator of inflammation and lipid metabolism through inhibition of Ubc13 activity. Here, we have deleted GPS2 in the B cell lineage results and performed RNAseq of WT and KO splenic B cells.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of WT and_KO of GPS2 in Bcells.
