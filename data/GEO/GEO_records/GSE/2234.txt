TITLE
Osteoblast and Osteocyte Profiles at Different Cell-cummunication Status

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Type of Experiment: 1) Profiles of Osteoblast vs. osteocyte in vitro; 2) Profiles of osteoblast low density vs. confluency in vitro; 3) Profiles of osteocyte with gap junction vs. without gap junction. Experimental factors: 1) 2T3 osteoblast cells at low density expressed extensive filopodia, reminiscent of early osteoblast precursors and similar to MLO-Y4 dendritic processes. 2) MLO-Y4 osteocytes at low vs. high density represent the genes that are changed in a highly connected network vs. low connected network. The number of hybridizations performed:  Triplicate hybridizations for each status. Keywords = Osteoblast Keywords = Osteocyte Keywords: parallel sample
