TITLE
Cardiac and Soleus muscles following exposure of rats to heat acclimation and exercise training

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The processes of adaptation to environmental heat and aerobic exercise training improve efficiency in various body systems and bring about acclimatory homeostasis. In order to examine the global genomic responses of the soleus and heart following exposure of rats to these stressors, nylon cDNA Atlas Array was used. Male rats were exposed to one of the following stressors: heat acclimation, aerobic training (treadmill), and combined heat acclimation and aerobic training for short (2, 3 days) and long (1 mo) time period. The study comprised seven experimental groups: Controls-untreated. Heat acclimated groups (2dac, Acc)– exposure to environmental heat at 34C for 2 or 30 days. Exercise groups (3dex, Ex)– graduated training protocol under normothermic conditions for 3 and 30 days at 24C. Exercise training and heat acclimation – (3dexac, ExAc)- exposed to both environmental heat and aerobic exercise as above. The Series data tables appended below: 1) Heart - normalized log2 ratio of geomeans defined as treatment/control 2) Soleus - normalized log2 ratio of geomeans defined as treatment/control Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
21 samples, 3 pool each, of: 1) Control untreated rats 2) Long-term heat acclimated rats 3) Long-term aerobic-exercised trained rats. 4) Rats exposed to long-term heat acclimation and exercise training. 5) Short term heat acclimated rats. 6) Short term aerobic exercised trained rats 7) Rats exposed to short-term heat acclimation and exercise training.
