TITLE
p53 independent TAF6delta target genes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate the impact of TAF6d on cell death and gene expression, here we have employed modified antisense oligonucleotides to enforce expression of endogenous TAF6d. The induction of endogenous TAF6d triggered apoptosis in tumor cell lines, including cells devoid of p53. Microarray experiments revealed that TAF6d activates gene expression independently of cellular p53 status. Our data define TAF6d as a pivotal node in a signaling pathway that acts immediately downstream of p53 to control gene expression programmes and apoptosis. Keywords: Treatment with splice site switching antisense oligonucleotides, induction of apoptosis

DESIGN
Biological triplicates, 4 conditions: isogenic p53+/+ and -/- cells; control oligonucleotide,  TAF6 AS2 oligonucleotide
