TITLE
Identification of target genes of cancer-related microRNAs in human cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify target genes of cancer-related microRNAs in human cancer, several cell lines (bladder cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human cancer cell lines (BOY, T24, A498, 786-O, caki-1, LNCap, PC3, TE2, T.Tn, FaDu, SAS, HSC3, and IMC-3) were transfected with miRNAs (miR-375, miR-145, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, miR-429, miR-138, miR-218, miR-874, miR-31, miR-222, miR-1285, and miR-206) or siRNAs (si-FOXA1_1, si-FOXA1_3, and si-TAGLN2). The miRNA-transfected human cancer cell lines were compared to control cell lines.
