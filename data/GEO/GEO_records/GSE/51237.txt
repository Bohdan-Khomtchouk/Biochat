TITLE
Identification of CNA associated with bone metastatic breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis between Bone metastatic derivatives isolated in vivo and parental cells and focused on genomic changes affecting the expression of potential bone metastasis.

DESIGN
Total RNA from biological and technical replicates of parental MCF7 and BoM2 bone metastasis derivatives grown for 48 hours in regular media (see growth protocol). High-molecular DNA was isolated from in vitro cultured MCF7 and BoM2 cells using GeneElute™ Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) following manufacture’s instructions.
