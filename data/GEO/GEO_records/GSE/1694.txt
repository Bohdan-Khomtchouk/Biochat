TITLE
Promyelocytic cells response to Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of human promyelocytic cells in response to infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Total RNA derived from 3DPI Anaplasma phagocytophilum-infected HL-60 cells was labeled with A647 and total RNA derived from 3DPI Mock-infected HL-60 cells was labeled  with A546.  For each, 5 Âµg of total RNA was labeled using Genisphere Array900, Alexa Fluor dyes and SuperscriptII.   Slide scanned with ScanArray Express and images processed with GenePix Pro version 4.0.  Normalized log ratios VALUES determined using R-project statistical environment ( ) and Bioconductor ( ) through the GenePix AutoProcessor (GPAP, ) website (P. Ayoubi, unpublished results). Keywords: time-course
