TITLE
photomorphogenesis-Expression profile of DET1-1 mutant during photomorphogenesis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs09-01_det1 - photomorphogenesis - - Identification of the genes deregulated in det1-1 when seedlings grow in light or in dark (dark increase morphological differences between det1-1 and wild-type) - Expression profile of seedlings grown in dark then exposed to light - etiolated seedlings (5days) are briefly exposed to light to induce developmental transition between skoto- and photomorphogenesis without visible change in plant morphology and differences between col0 and the mutant det1-1 grown in light or in dark Keywords: treatment variations

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - CATMA arrays
