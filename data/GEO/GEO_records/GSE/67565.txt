TITLE
Comparative genome hybridization of Enteropathogenic Yersinia

ORGANISM
Yersinia enterocolitica ; Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ; Yersinia pekkanenii

SUMMARY
Enteropathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis share many traits in terms of infections they cause, but their epidemiology and ecology seem to differ in many ways. Pigs are the only known reservoir for Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 strains while Y. pseudotuberculosis strains have been isolated from variety of sources including fresh vegetables and wild animals. A comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis with a DNA microarray based on three Yersinia enterocolitica and four Yersinia pseudotuberculosis genomes was conducted to shed light on genomic differences between the enteropathogenic Yersinia. In total 99 strains isolated from various sources were hybridized and analyzed.

DESIGN
Array CGH. Two-color hybridizations on 8x15K Agilent arrays. Eleven reference strain (Y. enterocolitica strain 8081, Y. enterocolitica strain DSM 130 30 and Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953) hybridizations and four replicate hybridizations of strain HV.

PLATFORM
GPL19993 Agilent-036401 Yersinia panarray v.1.1
