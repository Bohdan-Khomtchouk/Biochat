TITLE
Identification of circulating microRNAs as potential biomarkers for detecting acute ischemic stroke

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to determine the serum microRNAs profile from middle-old aged patients with acute ischemic stroke and investigate possible diagnostic value of these differential microRNAs.The blood samples of 117 IS patients and 82 healthy people were collected. Differential miRNAs in serum from IS and control were screened with miRNA microarray analysis, and the expression of selected miRNAs were validated by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays (qRT-PCR). Results: We discovered 115 differentially expressed miRNAs, among which miR-32-3p, miR-106-5p, miR-532-5p were found be related to IS for the first time. Conclusions: In the present study, we identified the changed expression pattern of miRNAs in IS. Serum miR-32-3p, miR-106-5p, miR-1246 and miR-532-5p may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for IS.

DESIGN
During the initial screening stage, we divided the serum samples into five groups (10 serum samples were pooled to form a group). Group A1: A denotes thrombotic stroke and 1 denotes hepertension. Group A14: A denotes thrombotic stroke, 1 denotes hepertension and 4 denotes hyperlipidemia. Group B2: B denotes embolic stroke and 2 denotes heart disease. Group B12: B denotes embolic stroke, 1 denotes hepertension and 2 denotes heart disease. Group 0: healthy control group.
