TITLE
The ERI-6/7 helicase acts at the first stage of an siRNA amplification pathway that targets recent gene duplications.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To characterize the role of the ERI-6/7 helicase in endogenous small RNA pathways in C. elegans, small RNA populations from null alleles of eri-6 and eri-7, and from mutants of known endogenous RNAi pathway factors, eri-1 and ergo-1, were determined by deep sequencing, and compared to wild type.

DESIGN
Small RNA analysis in wild type and eri-1, ergo-1, eri-6 and eri-7 mutant C. elegans strains.
