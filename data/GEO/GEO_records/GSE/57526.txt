TITLE
Expression data from TGRL lipolysis products treated human brain microvascular endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lipotoxicity is a metabolic disorder that results from accumulation of lipids, particularly fatty acids, in non-adipose tissue leading to cellular dysfunction, lipid droplet formation, and cell death. Our studies indicate for the first time that the neurovascular circulation also can manifest lipotoxicity, which could have major effects on cognitive function. The penetration of integrative systems biology approaches is limited in this area of research, which reduces our capacity to gain an objective insight into the signal transduction and regulation dynamics at a systems level. We used microarrays to determine the TGRL lipolysis products induced gene expression and to understand the mechanism underline the vascular inflammation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from human brain microvascular endothelial cells treated with media (M), Lipoprotein lipase (L), triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TGRL or T), or  TGRL lipolysis products (TL) treatment. Affymetrix microarrays analyses of the pooled total RNA samples (n = 3 per group for Media, LpL, TGRL, and TGRL lipolysis products treatments) were performed.
