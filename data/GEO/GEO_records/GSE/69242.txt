TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Small RNA Mediated Rice Resistance to Xoo

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study is to identify small non-conding RNAs which are involved in rice resistance to Xoo. Methods: Rice leaves were inoculated with the Xoo strain PXO61 at the four-leaf to five-leaf stage by the leaf-clipping method. Control rice plants were inoculated with water (mock inoculation). And then, total RNA was extracted to be sequenced using Illumina GAIIx. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow to count the expression level of small ncRNA, we found several differentially expressed small ncRNA which may be participated in the interaction between rice and Xoo. Conclusions: Small ncRNA have be found to function in a variety of biological processes. Our study here has showed that several candidate miRNA or siRNA may play a significant role in rice immunity.

DESIGN
Plants were inoculated with the Xoo strain PXO61 at the four-leaf to five-leaf stage by the leaf-clipping method. Control rice plants were inoculated with water (mock inoculation). Samples were collected before inoculation (ck) and at 2, 4, and 24 hours after PXO61 or mock inoculation from Rb49 and MDJ8. Leaf fragments approximately 2 cm in length that were immediately next to the inoculation site were collected.
