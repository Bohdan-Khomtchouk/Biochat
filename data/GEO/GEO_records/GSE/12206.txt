TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mechano-responsive gene expression by tenocytes in fascicles subjected to cyclic tensile strain

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of mechano-regulation of tenocyte metabolism at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that cyclic tensile strain influence the balance of anabolism/catabolism of tenocytes. Results provide important information of the response of tenocyte to cyclic tensile strain, such as specific mechano-responsive genes, up- or down-regulated specific anabolic/catabolic cellular functions. Keywords: gene expression array-based, stress response, functional analysis
