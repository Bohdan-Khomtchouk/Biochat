TITLE
Impact of resistance exercise on human skeletal muscle gene expression - ageing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this work was to produce a reproducible molecular signature of human muscle responses to resistance training and examine how such a profile relates to new and established exercise adaptation gene networks.

DESIGN
Subjects were recruited from an age range of 18 to 75 y. Before beginning the study all subjects were screened using a medical questionnaire, physical examination and resting ECG with exclusions for overt muscle wasting ( > 2 SD below age norms)[85], metabolic, respiratory/cardiovascular disorders or other major contraindications to a healthy status. All subjects had normal blood chemistry and were normotensive (BP < 140/90). All subjects performed routine activities of daily living and recreation but did not participate in moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise and none had participated in RET in the last 24 months. Body composition was measured at screening and following RET by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) (Lunar Prodigy II, GE Medical Systems). Subject positioning on the DEXA bed was optimized to allow the region of interest (ROI) body compartments to be analyzed separately. The upper leg ROI was selected as the area inferior to the lowest visible point of the coccyx to the mid-point of the patella. The dataset comprises 44 pre-exercise and 44 post-exercise samples. In addition there is a baseline sample NB021_pre-training (D13_NB021F). Therefore there are 89 samples in total.  (Note: Singleton baseline sample NB021_pre-training was normalized only using all baseline samples.) Derby dataset.
