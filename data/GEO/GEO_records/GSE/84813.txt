TITLE
Exon level expression profile of MCF7 cells with p53β splice variant knocked out 4hr post 20gy irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to explore the funciton of p53β splice variant in DNA damage response, we utilized CRISPR-cas9 genome editing technique to specifically knock out this variant in MCF7 cells. Microarray analysis is then performed to compare gene expression before and after 20gy irradiation in these cells.

DESIGN
control and p53βCRISPR cells in triplicate are subjected to 20gy ionizing irradiation (IR) and 4 hrs post IR, cells are collected for RNA extraction and cDNA systhesis and microarray hybridization.
