TITLE
PBMCs exposed to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra strain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured in presence of H37Ra strain at 37oC, 5%CO2. Cellular aggregates were collected at 24h, and RNA extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays (HG-U133). Raw data from microarray experiments was analyzed with dCHIP and SAM programs to determine the significance of changes at the biological context.

DESIGN
PBMCs were exposed in triplicate to H37Ra strain. PBMCs from the same donor were cultured in triplicate at the same conditions than treated samples. RNA was extracted from each sample and hybridized to Affymetrix Human arrays.
