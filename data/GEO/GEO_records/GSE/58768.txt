TITLE
Non-coding roX RNAs Prevent the Binding of the MSL-complex to Heterochromatic Regions

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila simulans

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs are involved in dosage compensation both in mammals and in Drosophila by inducing changes in the X-chromosome chromatin structure. In Drosophila melanogaster, roX1 and roX2 are long non-coding RNAs that together with proteins form the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, which coats the entire male X-chromosome and mediates dosage compensation by increased transcriptional output. It has been shown that in polytene chromosomes, in absence of both roX1 and roX2, the MSL-complex is decreased on the male X-chromosome and found relocated to the chromocenter, and the 4th chromosome. Here we address the role of roX RNAs in MSL-complex targeting and in the evolution of dosage compensation in Drosophila. We performed ChIP-seq experiments and show that MSL-complex recruitment to high affinity sites (HAS) on the X-chromosome is independent on roX and that the HAS sequence motif is conserved in D. simulans. Additionally, a complete and enzymatically active MSL-complex is recruited to six specific genes on the 4th chromosome. Interestingly, our sequence analysis shows that in the absence of roX RNAs, the MSL-complex has affinity to regions enriched in Hoppel transposable elements and to repeats in general. We hypothesize that roX mutants reveal an ancient targeting of the MSL-complex and propose that the role of roX RNAs is to restrict MSL-complex from binding to heterochromatin.
