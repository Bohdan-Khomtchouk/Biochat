TITLE
Effects of Pre-freeze and Thaw Times on Gene Expression Profiles Using the PAXgeneÂ® Blood RNA System

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using Normal Donor Blood, the effects of pre-freeze and thaw incubation time variables on the global gene expression signature and yield from RNA extracted using the PAXgene Blood RNA System

DESIGN
Blood from healthy male volunteers (n=4) was collected into EDTA tubes or PAXgene collection tubes.  PAXgene tubes were mixed and then stored at room temperature for 0, 2, 5, or 17 hours before transfer to a -80C freezer, where they remained frozen until RNA extraction.  PAXgene tubes were then thawed for 2 or 17 hours prior to RNA extraction.  Yield and gene expression profiles were assayed for all samples and analyzed for gene expression changes and different yields relative to EDTA collection tubes.
