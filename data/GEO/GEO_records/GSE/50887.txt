TITLE
4T1 cells with Control vs SNAIL vs SNAIL/FBXO11

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells stably tranduced with pLEX-MCS based lentivirus. Three groups were compared, Vector cells, SNAIL expressing cells; and SNAIL+FBXO11 expressing cells. SNAIL expression induced strong EMT phenotype while SNAIL/FBXO11 reversed cells back to epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiments Vector vs SNAIL vs SNAIL/FBXO11.  No replicate.
