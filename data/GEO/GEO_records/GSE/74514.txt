TITLE
The isopeptidase inhibitor 2cPE triggers proteotoxic stress and ATM activation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we investigated changes in gene expression induced by 2cPE (a non-selective isopeptidase inhibitor) in leukemia cells isolated from 10 different patients suffering of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We compared 2cPE induced changes in mRNA levels with those induced by bortezomib, another well characterized proteasome inhibitor. Both inhibitors trigger apoptosis in leukemia cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of B-CLL cells coming from several patients treated with the UPS inhibitors bortezomib and 2cPE are compared to the profiles of untreated cells.
