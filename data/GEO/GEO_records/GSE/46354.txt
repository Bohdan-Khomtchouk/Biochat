TITLE
The expression analyses of trisomy 2L compared with normal

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Dosage compensation was referred as an equalized X chromosome gene expression between males and females in Drosophila. And inverse dosage effects, produced by genomic imbalance, are believed to account for this modulated expression. Here we made a global expression comparison of trisomy 2L with on extra copy of chromosome 2 long arm to normal diploid with two copies of 2L with high throughput RNA-sequencing. We want to test how about the gene expression pattern changes in those comparisons, including the genes on varied chromosome 2 long arm, some other autosomal genes except chromosome 2L and X chromosome genes. Dosage compensation with an expression level similar to normal diploid  and inverse dosage effects should be detected.

DESIGN
Comapare the global expression of trisomy 2L samples with the normal diploids Collected the females and males from trisomy 2L and Cantons and performed RNA-seq
