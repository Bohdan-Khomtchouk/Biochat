TITLE
High salt primes a specific activation state of macrophages, M(Na)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Investigate effects of high salt on human macrophage activation Methods: Human monocytes-derived macrophages were treated by additional 51mM NaCl for 24 hours (NaCl groups) or not (Control groups). mRNA profiles were generated by RNA-Seq, in triplicate, using Ion proton（Life tech). qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results: High salt significantly promotes pro-inflammatory gene expressions,while suppresses the expressions of anti-inflammatory genes and pro-endocytic genes in human macrophages. Conclusions: Our results identify a novel macrophage activation state, M(Na), and high salt as a potential environmental risk factor for lung inflammation through the induction of M(Na)
