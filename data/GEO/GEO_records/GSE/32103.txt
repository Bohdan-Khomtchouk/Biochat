TITLE
Expression data from mice mammary glands from Elf5 knockout (KO) and wildtype controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We developed conditional knockout mice where the transcription factor Elf5 (also called ESE-2) is deleted in the mammary glands. Loss of Elf5 results in block in alveologenesis and epithelial differentiation defects. Mammary gland samples from Elf5 knockout and wild type animals were analyzed for global transcriptome changes.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to performing transcriptional profiling of Elf5KO and control mammary glands at Lac1 (Lactation day 1)
