TITLE
The CNS-Heart Axis is a Source of Cardiac Dysfunction in Mouse Models   of Huntingtonâ€™s Disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) to microarray to evaluate transcriptional changes in the heart of HD mouse models Methods: Heart mRNA profiles of 4-weeks-old wild-type (WT) and R6/2 transgenic; 15-weeks-old WT and R6/2 transgenic mice; 8-month-old WT and HdhQ150 knock-in mice; 22-month-old WT and HdhQ150 knock-in mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hi-seq 2000. Conclusions: Our study showed that there is no major transcriptional deregulation in the heart of mouse models of HD.
