TITLE
Gene expression in hypoxic MEFs having only p300 and CBP with deleted CH1 domains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The CH1 protein interaction domain of the transcriptional coactivators p300 and CBP is thought to interact with HIF-1alpha and this interaction is thought to be critical to the expression of HIF-1alpha target genes in response to hypoxia.  To test the requirement of the CH1 domain for gene expression in response to hypoxia, rimary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated from C57Bl/6x129/Sv F2 e14.5 embryos that contain a deletion in the CH1 domain of three of four alleles of CBP and p300. The remaining allele of p300 or CBP was a conditional knock out allele. Control MEFs with only a single conditional knockout allele of p300 or CBP were also generated.  At passage 3 MEFs were infected with Cre Adenovirus and grown until they had expanded at least 100 fold. Subconfluent MEFs were treated with 21% oxygen (normoxia) or 0.1% oxygen (hypoxia) with 5% carbon dioxide at 37 C in a humid chamber for 6hrs. At the start of treatment, medium was removed and replaced with medium (DMEM+10% FBS+pen-strep+ l-glu) that had been preequilibrated overnight in normoxia or hypoxia as appropriate. Immediately after treatment, cells were lysed in Trizol for RNA extraction. Keywords: genetic modification, dose response

DESIGN
12 samples; 4 genotypes [CBP+/flox (flox1), p300 +/flox (flox2), CBP CH1/flox;p300 CH1/CH1 (triCH1flox1),CBP CH1/CH1;p300 CH1/flox (triCH1flox2)] , 2 treatments (normoxia and hypoxia).
