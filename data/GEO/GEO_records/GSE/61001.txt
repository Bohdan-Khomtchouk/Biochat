TITLE
MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profile in quadriceps of wild-type (WT) and NF90-NF45 double transgenic (dbTg) mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate regulation of miRNA biogenesis by NF90-NF45 complex, we performed comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression in quandriceps of WT and NF90-NF45 dbTg mice.

DESIGN
Comparison of miRNA expression profile in quandriceps between WT and NF90-NF45 dbTg mice.
