TITLE
Transcriptome of honey bee larvae

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
Honey bee drones, queens and workers have vastly different phenotypes.  Here we profile the the expression level of mRNAs and microRNAs of honeybee, drones, queens and workers at the L5 larval stage (91 hours +/- 1).

DESIGN
For both mRNA and miRNA, we analyse five replicates for drones, queens and workers (15 replicates for mRNA and 15 for miRNA).
