TITLE
Gene expression profile of the Cmah gene depletion on mouse liver, lung, kidney and heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is generated by hydroxylation of CMP-Neu5Ac to CMP-Neu5Gc, catalyzed by CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH). However, humans lack this common mammalian cell surface molecule, Neu5Gc, due to inactivation of the CMAH gene during evolution. CMAH is one of several human-specific genes whose function has been lost by disruption or deletion of the coding frame. It has been suggested that CMAH inactivation has resulted in biochemical or physiological characteristics that have resulted in human-specific diseases. To identify differential gene expression profiles associated with the loss of Neu5Gc expression, we performed microarray analysis using Illumina MouseRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip, using the main tissues (liver, lung, kidney, and heart) from a control mouse and a Cmah-null mouse.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted and purified from the liver, lung, kidney, and heart of WT and Cmah-null mice using RNeasy columns (Qiagen; Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. The RNA quality was verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies; Palo Alto, CA, USA) using the RNA 6000 Pico Assay. Generation of double-stranded cDNA, preparation and labeling of cRNA, hybridization to Mouse Ref-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.; San Diego, CA, USA), washing, and scanning were all performed according to the standard Illumina protocol. Arrays were scanned using the Illumina Bead Array Reader Confocal Scanner.
