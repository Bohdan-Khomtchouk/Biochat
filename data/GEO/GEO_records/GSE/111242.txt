TITLE
Astrocyte mRNA expression - comparison of wild type animals to CETP transgenic animals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CETP transfers lipids and cholesteryl esters between lipoproteins. This leads to elevated LDL-cholesterol levels. We found elevated cholesterol levels in the brains CETP transgenic animals. We wanted to test whether this is due to increased cholesterol synthesis by astrocytes 2 animals that were genotyped as wild type showed CETP transcription in our RT-qPCR (WT_1 & WT_5) and were excluded

DESIGN
purified astrocytes from wild type animals on a standard mouse diet are compared to astrocytes from CETP tansgenic animals on a 1% cholesterol diet (dietary cholesterol induced CETP expression)
