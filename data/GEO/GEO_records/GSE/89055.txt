TITLE
Role of N-a-acetyltransferase 10 Protein in DNA Methylation and Genomic Imprinting

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that Naa10-null mice display partial embryonic lethality, growth retardation, brain disorder and maternal-effect lethality, phenotypes commonly observed in defective genomic imprinting. Genome-wide analyses further reveal enriched dysregulation of imprinted genes in Naa10p-knockout ES cells.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 2 biological ESC replicates of each WT and Naa10-KO group

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
