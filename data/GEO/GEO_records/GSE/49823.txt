TITLE
miRNA profiling of plasma samples: patients with unstable coronary artery disease and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study describes a circulating miRNA signature of unstable angina (UA), which may be used as a novel biomarker for unstable coronary artery disease (CAD). The Taqman low-density miRNA array were used to identify distinct miRNA expression profiles in the plasma of patients with typical UA and angiographically documented CAD (UA group, n = 13) compared to individuals with non-cardiac chest pain (control group, n = 13).

DESIGN
EDTA-plasma samples were obtained before the cardiac catheterization procedure.The study included 2 groups that were classified according to angiographic evidence and clinical evaluation of chest pain. Patients with chest pain or discomfort but with angiographic exclusion of coronary atherosclerosis were enrolled in the control group (n = 13). Chest discomfort referred to the following complaints: chest pain, pressure, tightness, or heaviness; pain that radiated to the neck, jaw, shoulders, back, or one or both arms; and persistent shortness of breath. Patients with typical unstable angina (UA) and angiographically documented CAD were enrolled in the UA group (n = 13).
