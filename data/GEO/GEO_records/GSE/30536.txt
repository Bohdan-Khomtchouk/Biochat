TITLE
Expression data from IFN alpha 2-treated macrophages infected with HIV

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Temporal changes of the expression levels of the complete human transcriptome during the first 24 hours following infection of IFN-pre-treated macrophages. This approach has allowed us to identify genes involved in the IFN signaling that have an impact on HIV-1 infection of macrophages KEYWORDS: time course

DESIGN
Purified primary macrophages were treated with 1000 IU/ml of IFNÎ±2, for 18 hours before infection. Pre-treated macrophages were infected with the Bal strain of HIV-1 at an MOI of 1. Uninfected and untreated cells were used for control. Aliquots of cells (3x106 cells) were taken at 0,2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 hrs after infection for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. *** No CEL file for Sample GSM757646  MDMs CTL at T0
