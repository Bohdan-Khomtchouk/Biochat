TITLE
RNA binding protein KSRP mediated miRNAs processing reciprocally regulates granulocytic and monocytic differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KSRP is involved in RNA processing at multiple levels including alternative splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA localization and translation efficiency. Dysregulation KSRP can cause to hematological malignancies. However, the direct contribution of KSRP to myeloid lineage differentiation is poorly understood. KSRP, as a KH-type splicing regulatory protein, which interacts with single-stand AU-rich element containing mRNA and mediated mRNA decay, also serves as a component of Drosha and Dicer complexes and regulates the biogenesis of miRNAs. Whether KSRP mediated miRNAs maturation participated in myeloid lineage differentiation is unknown. Here, we analysis the miRNAs processing during over-expression KSRP in THP-1 cells by poly-A(riched) RNA-seq and miRNA-Seq. Our results suggest that KSRP regulate a class of miRNAs maturation and have a critical function in myeloid lineage differentiation.

DESIGN
The design was meant to identify differential miRNAs processing which regulated by KSRP in THP-1 cells.
