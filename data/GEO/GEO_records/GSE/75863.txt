TITLE
Gene expression profile of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cell line cultivated in 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional cell culture enriched with laminin rich extracellular matrix proteins.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obvious advantages of 3D cell culture model are the cell morphology better reflecting tissue cell morphology, the formation of zones of i) active proliferation, ii) quiescent viable cell zone and iii) necrotic zone, as well as formation of nutrition, oxygen and drug gradients better reflecting cellular environment in tissue. Nevertheless the 3D cultures are a model still not resembling full complexity of tumor tissue environment in vivo. Few obvious limitations of 3D cell cultures as cancer research model are the lack of vasculature, host immune response and other cell-cell interactions that occur between cancer and stromal cells in tumors. Recognized advantages and limitations of the 3D cell culture models, however do not suggest directly the areas of cancer biology where 3D models could be applied with highest success. Hence detailed analysis at the molecular level of 2D/3D cell cultures and tumors in vivo are needed to unlock the power of 3D cell culture model.  In order to elucidate which biological pathways of cancer cells in tumors are best resembled by the 3D cell culture model we have analyzed whole genome gene expression changes in mouse LLC1 cell line when cultured in 2D or laminin rich ECM 3D system.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated 48h after growing in two different cell culture systems.
