TITLE
Effect of BMPR2 mutation on vascular smooth muscle gene expression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
BMPR2 mutation is the cause of most hereditary pulmonary arterial hypertension, but the common molecular consequence of different types of BMPR2 mutation is still not known. The goal of this study was to determine the common molecular consequences of three different classes of patient-derived BMPR2 mutation in vascular smooth muscle gene expression.
