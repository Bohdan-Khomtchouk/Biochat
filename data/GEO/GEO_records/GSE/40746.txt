TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Bcl11a regulation genes in bone marrow derived pro-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of Bcl11a in pro-B cells, we performed global gene epxression in Bcl11a-deficient pro-B cells and Bcl2-rescued Bcl11a-deficient pro-B cells and compared it to that of the wild typle control pro B cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 3 batch of cultured pro-B cells of Bcl11a-deficient pro-B cells, Bcl2-rescued Bcl11a-deficient pro-B cells and control pro-B cells respectively.
