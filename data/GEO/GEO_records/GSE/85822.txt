TITLE
The Transgenerational Effects of Prenatal Synthetic Glucocorticoids

ORGANISM
Cavia porcellus

SUMMARY
First generation animals (F1) were exposed to multiple courses of synthetic glucocorticoids in utero. Animals were then bred to produce second (F2) and third (F3) generation offspring. These animals underwent behavioural assessmenets before sacrifice. In this experiment the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus fo F1, F2, and F3 female anmials (Beta and Control) have been extracted via micro-punch and RNA has been extracted.

DESIGN
F1 Control n=5 vs F1 Beta n=5, F2 Control n=5 vs F2 Beta n=5, F3 Control n=6 vs F3 Beta n=6

PLATFORM
GPL22346 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Cavia porcellus)
