TITLE
Gene expression analysis of IOSE cells treated with TGFb1, a time course study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Unlike ovarian cancer, normal ovarian epithelium response to TGFb1 induced growth inhibition. This time course study tried to idenify genes that showed changes after additionof TGFb1 in immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells (IOSE) which is derived from normal ovarian epithelial cells Keywords: Time-course
