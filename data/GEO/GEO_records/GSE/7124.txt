TITLE
Plant and pathogen gene expression during infection by P.sojae of 8 soybean cultivars varying in quantitative resistance

ORGANISM
Glycine max ; Phytophthora sojae

SUMMARY
Identify plant and pathogen genes differentially expressed during P. sojae infection of soybean cultivars differing in quantitative resistance, by using Affymetrix Soybean Genome Array analysis. Keywords: genotypic variation on quantitative resistance

DESIGN
RNA samples from mock-inoculated soybean tissue contain 2%-16% spike-in RNA from Phytophthora sojae mycelium grown in liquid sucrose-salts medium. 4 Experimental Replicates x 8 cultivars x  2 Treatments (inoculated or mock) x 2 Timepoints (72hr or 120hr)  = 128 samples in total

PLATFORM
GPL4592 [Soybean] Affymetrix Soybean Genome Array
