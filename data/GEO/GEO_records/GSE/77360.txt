TITLE
Gene Expression Changes in Definitive Endoderm in response to GATA6-depletion (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GATA6 is required for proper definitive endoderm formation.  The mechanism of this process is poorly understood

DESIGN
We used ChIP-Sequencing to identify genes that are direct targets of GATA6 during human endoderm specification using hES differentiation
