TITLE
SOX11-positive and SOX11-knockdown xenograft derived tumor Gene Expression Profilings

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The neural transcription factor SOX11 is overexpressed in aggressive lymphoid neoplasms mainly in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We have recently demonstrated SOX11 tumorigenic potential in vivo by showing a significant reduction on tumor growth of SOX11-knockdown MCL cells in xenograft experiments, confirming the clinical observations that SOX11 may play an important role in the aggressive behavior of MCL (Vegliante et al., 2013). However, the specific mechanisms regulated by SOX11 that promote the oncogenic and rapid tumor growth of aggressive MCL still remain to be elucidated. To further characterize the potential oncogenic mechanisms regulated by SOX11 in MCL, we have analyzed the GEP derived from the xenograft SOX11-positive and knockdown xenograft derived tumors. Differential gene expression  between SOX11-positive Z138 and SOX11-negative Z138 MCL cell lines xenotransplanted in SCID mices derived tumors.

DESIGN
To determine the transcriptional programs regulated by SOX11 we first generated a MCL cellular model with reduced SOX11 protein levels by infecting MCL cell lines with lentiviral particles carrying shRNA plasmids specifically targeting SOX11 (shSOX11.1 and shSOX11.3). Next, CB17-severe combined immunodeficient (CB17-SCID) mice (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA) were subcutaneously inoculated into their lower dorsum with Z138 shSOX11.1, shSOX11.3, shControl in Matrigel basement membrane matrix and compared the GEP of SOX11-positive and SOX11-negative MCL xenotransplant derived tumors using the Affymetrix U133+2.0 microarrays.
