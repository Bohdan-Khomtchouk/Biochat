TITLE
Gene expression analyses of mir-100 overexpression in ovarian clear cell cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A variety of human cancers demonstrate alterations in microRNA expression.  We hypothesized that regulatory defects in microRNAs play a central early role in organizing the molecular changes involved in ovarian cancer (OvCa).  Using both gene arrays and deep sequencing, we comprehensively profiled mRNA and microRNA expression, respectively, in human clear cell epithelial OvCa cell lines and short-term primary cultures of normal ovarian surface epithelium.  We expected that over-expression of a specific microRNA would lead to lower expression of its mRNA targets, and under-expression of a specific microRNA would lead to higher expression of its target genes.  Using our expression data in conjunction with established in silico algorithms, we found putative microRNA:mRNA functional pairs.  Furthermore, gene expression profiles were taken of clear cell cultures having functional knockdown or over-expression of specific microRNAs of interest.  Knockdown of mir-100 (found under-expressed in clear cell OvCa) resulted in down-regulation in vitro of a significant number of the in silico predicted mir-100 target genes that were normally over-expressed in OvCa. Keywords: two group comparison; gene expression profiling

DESIGN
We used miRNA mimics to overexpress mir-100, originally found under-expressed in OvCa (fold > 100).  After 48 hours of mimic treatment, we profiled gene expression for both cells with mir-100 knockup and cells with mimic control (having minimal sequence identity with all human miRNAs).
