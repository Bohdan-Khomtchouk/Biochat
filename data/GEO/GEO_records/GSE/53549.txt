TITLE
NeuCode metabolic labeling reveals a high correlation between mRNA and protein abundance during salt adaptation in S. cerevisiae.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiling of yeast strains responding to 0.7M NaCl treatment for 30 or 60 minutes. This study identified affected genes under both conditions tested. Transcript and protein changes were compared to determine mRNAs contribution to protein levels during salt acclimation.

DESIGN
Two-color fluorescence arrays reporting on mRNA abunance in strains before and at 30 min or 60 min after a shock with 0.7M NaCl, hybridized to yeast tile-genome Nimblegen arrays

PLATFORM
GPL15778 NimbleGen UW-Madison Saccharomyces cerevisiae 380K tiling array [2006-10-12_Ansari_tiling_51mer; gene-level version]
