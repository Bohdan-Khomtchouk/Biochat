TITLE
Inhibition of beta-catenin signalling in dermal fibroblasts enhances hair follicle regeneration during wound healing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profiling of P1 and P5 back and tail dermis to uncover potential explanations for the differences in HF formation at different ages and in different body sites.

DESIGN
To generate back and tail dermis microarray from P1 mouse (C57Bl6/CBA F1), tail skin was incubated in 5mM EDTA/PBS solution at 37°C, 1h, whereas back skin was incubated in dispase-trypsin solution at 37°C, 1h. Tail and back skin dermis were separated from the epidermis with forceps, washed once in PBS and digested as described above. Single-cell suspensions were washed 3x in PBS, before cells were lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNA was purified using Qiagen RNeasy columns. RNA was extracted from triplicate mice. cDNA was amplified from purified RNA and hybridized to Affymetrix MG430.2A arrays by the Cancer Research UK Patterson Institute Affymetrix Genechip Microarray Service.  Array images were produced by the Affymetrix PICR 3000 scanner and analysed as Cell files using Genespring-13X (Agilent Technologies). RMA normalization was used and the bottom twentieth-percentile of genes (i.e., the 20% of genes with the lowest expression levels) were excluded from subsequent analysis.
