TITLE
Tonicity induced changes in Gene expression in IMCD cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Tonicity induced massive changes in gene expression. Already the acute challange for 3 h affected significantly the expression of thousands of genes. The overall differences in gene expression were hightes between cells cultivated at 300 compared to cells cultivated at 900 mosmol/kg

DESIGN
30 Samples were analyzed

PLATFORM
GPL6247 [RaGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
