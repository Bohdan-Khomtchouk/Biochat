TITLE
Role of oxylipins in pathogen defense of potato

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Oxylipins play a role in the response of plants to pathogens both as antimicrobial compounds and as signaling molecules. In potato, pathogen infection leads to the stimulation of the 9-lipoxygenase pathway (Göbel et al. 2001; 2002; Stumpe et al. 2001). In order to analyze whether 9-LOX-derived oxylipins such as colnele(n)ic acid (products of the 9-divinyl ether synthase reaction) act as signaling molecules for the activation of defense responses, transgenic potato plants (Solanum tuberosum cv. Désirée) were generated which express an RNAi construct directed against the pathogen-induced 9-lipoxygenase (Göbel et al. 2003) or against the pathogen-induced 9-divinyl ether synthase (Stumpe et al. 2001). Highly reduced transcript levels correlate with low levels of 9-lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins (Göbel et al. 2003).  Transgenic and wild type plants were grown as sterile plants on MS medium supplemented with agar in a phytochamber with 16 h of light [200 µE] at 22 °C. After transfer to soil, plants were kept in a phytochamber with 16 h of light [200 µE], 18 °C and 60 % humidity for four weeks. Lower leaves were infiltrated with a suspension of Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola at a concentration of 108 cfu/ml MgCl2 or, as a control, 10 mM MgCl2-solution. RNA was isolated both from the infiltrated leaves and the upper, non-treated leaves using the trizol method. Subsequently, RNA was digested with DNase and purified via Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer´s instructions. Keywords: Direct comparison
