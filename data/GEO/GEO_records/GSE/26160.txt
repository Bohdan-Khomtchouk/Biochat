TITLE
Conserved generation of short products at piRNA loci

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed small RNAs from three mammalian species, and found that in all these species piRNA-directed targeting is accompanied by the generation of short sequences that have a very precisely defined length and a specific spatial relationship with the guide piRNAs.

DESIGN
small RNA-seq of testes lysate (beta-eliminated)
