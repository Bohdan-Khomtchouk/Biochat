ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There were no studies about gene expression of umbilical cord tissue before. We performed this study to identify the gene expression of umbilical cord tissue.

DESIGN
Umbilical cord  were obtained from three newborns. Gene expression profiles were conducted using cDNA microarray analysis.
