TITLE
Global analysis of p53-regulated transcription reveals its direct targets and unexpected regulatory mechanisms (microarray)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HCT116 microarray done 12 hours after treatment with DMSO (control) or Nutlin

DESIGN
Total RNA from HCT116 cells was harvested with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and analyzed on Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 ST arrays following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Microarray data were processed using Partek Genomics Suite 6.6. Anova was used to call differentially expressed genes for which any isoform showed a fold change > |+/-1.5| with FDR < 0.05. There were 362 genes called as upregulated and 367 genes as downregulated.
