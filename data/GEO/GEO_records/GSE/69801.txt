TITLE
Analysis of the role of Micu1 in maintaining functional homeostasis in mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we analyzed global liver gene expression in MICU1 knock-down (KD) mice. To generate liver-specific MICU1 KD mice, MICU1loxp/loxp male mice were treated with an AAV8-Cre under the control of a hepatocyte specific promoter (TBG). AAV8-TBG-Null treated littermates were used as controls. Liver samples were collected 3-5 weeks after injection. Knockdown was verified by protein and mRNA (94%, 98%, respectively). Mouse Gene 2.0 ST (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) arrays were used to obtain global gene expression data.

DESIGN
Gene expression was profiled in control and in liver-specific Micu1 knockdown mice liver samples; 4 biological replicates per condition.
