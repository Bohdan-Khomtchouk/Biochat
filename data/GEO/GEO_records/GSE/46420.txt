TITLE
The effects of MyD88 deficiency on disease phenotype in dysferlin-deficient A/J mice: Role of endogenous toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome wide expression study of the effect of single stranded RNA (ssRNA) in A/JOlaHsd (WT), A/J and A/J-MyD88 deficient mice. The hypothesis for this study was that endogenous TLR ligands released from the leaking dysferlin-deficient muscle fibers engage TLRs on muscle and immune cells and contribute to disease progression.These data point to a clear role for the TLR pathway in the pathogenesis of dysferlin deficiency.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated tibalis anterior muscles (TA) of A/JOlaHsd (WT), A/J and A/J-MyD88 deficient mice that were subjected to 3 intramuscular injections of ssRNA over the period of 10 days compared to their contraleteral legs that were injected with saline (control).
