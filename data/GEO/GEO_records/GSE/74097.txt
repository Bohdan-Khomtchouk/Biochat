TITLE
Silencio/CG9754 connects the Piwi-piRNA complex to the cellular heterochromatin machinery

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The  repression  of  transposable  elements  in  eukaryotes  often involves  their transcriptional silencing via targeted chromatin modifications. In animal gonads, nuclear Argonaute proteins of the PIWI-clade complexed with small guide RNAs (piRNAs) serve as sequence specificity determinants in this process. How binding of nuclear  PIWI-piRNA  complexes  to  nascent  transcripts  orchestrates heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing is unknown. Here, we characterize CG9754/Silencio as an essential piRNA pathway factor that is required for  Piwi-mediated  transcriptional  silencing  in Drosophila.  Ectopic  targeting  of Silencio to RNA or DNA is sufficient to elicit silencing independent of Piwi and known  piRNA pathway  factors.   Instead,  Silencio  requires  the  H3K9  methyl-transferase  Eggless/SetDB1  for  its  silencing  ability.  In  agreement  with  this, SetDB1 but  not  Su(var)3-9 is  required  for  Piwi-mediated  transcriptional silencing genome-wide. Due to its interaction with the target-engaged Piwi-piRNA complex we suggest that Silencio acts as linker between the sequence specificity factor Piwi and the cellular heterochromatin machinery.
