TITLE
EHEC O157 EDL933 & sdhA mutant comparison

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7

SUMMARY
The microarray study was used to compare the gene expression profile of EDL933 in LB, sdhA deletion mutant in LB, and sdhA deletion mutant in LB with 2.5 mM Fumaric acid.

DESIGN
The total RNA samples from EDL933 in LB (two replicates), sdhA deletion in LB (three replicates) and sdhA deletion mutation in LB with 2.5 mM Fumaric acid (three replicates) were used in this microarray study.

PLATFORM
