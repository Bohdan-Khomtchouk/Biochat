TITLE
Seabuckthorn carpenter moth (Eogystia hippophaecolus) Transcriptome or Gene expression

ORGANISM
Eogystia hippophaecolus

SUMMARY
By comparing transcriptome profiles for differential gene expression, genes and pathways probably involved in insect cold hardinesswere identified. This dataset provides a global transcriptome data and differential transcriptome comparisons in E. hippophaecolus under cold stress. This may facilitate future genomic studies aimed at improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of insects to low temperatures.

DESIGN
T01 & T02 represent control groups without treatment; T04, T05 & T06 are low temperature treatment groups; T01 & T04 are young larvae; T02 & T05 are middle-aged larvae; T06 is old larvae.
