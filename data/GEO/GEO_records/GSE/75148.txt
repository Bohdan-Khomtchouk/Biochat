TITLE
Gene expression profiles in rat lung following intratracheal instillation with short size single-wall and multi-wall carbon nanotubes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression approach to assess the effects of manufactured nanomaterials at the transcriptional level, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to discuss the differences of the pulmonary and pleural

DESIGN
Groups of nine-week-old male Wistar rats (n = 4 per group/ time point) were intratracheally instilled with short SWCNTs and MWCNTs suspended in 0.4 mL of 10mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a single injection, respectively. Control groups received 10mg/
