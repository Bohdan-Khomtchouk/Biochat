TITLE
Gene Regulation of Intestinal Porcine Epithelial Cells IPEC‑J2 is Dependent on the Site of Deoxynivalenol Toxicological Action

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Here we analysed different mechanisms of apical and basolateral deoxynivalenol (DON) toxicity reflected in the gene expression. We used the jejunum derived, polarized intestinal porcine epithelial cell line IPEC‑J2 as an in vitro cell culture model. Luminal and blood stream DON intoxication was mimicked by a DON application from the apical or basolateral compartment of ThinCert® membrane inserts for 72 h.

DESIGN
We compared the genome wide gene expression of untreated and DON-treated IPEC-J2 cells by the GeneChip® Porcine Genome Array of Affymetrix.
