TITLE
Yeast linker histone HHO1p effect on transcription before and after heat shock

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
DNA array expression analysis comparing RNA transcripts in wild type and hho1 strains before and after a heat-shock from 25 to 37 degrees. Keywords: expression, heat shock

DESIGN
We used a reference design to hybridize three microarrays with the following cRNA samples labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively: 1) wt25 and wt37, 2) mu37 and wt25, 3) mu25 and wt25. wt25, wt37, mu37 and mu25 represent cRNA made on RNA templates isolated from wild type cells grown at 25 degrees C, wild type cells following heat shock at 37 degrees C, hho1 delta cells following heat shock at 37 degrees C and hho1 delta cells grown at 25 degrees C, respectively.
