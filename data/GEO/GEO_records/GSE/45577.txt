TITLE
Profiling of glycerol- and CTX-induced models of muscle regeneration in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Utilizing glycerol and cardiotoxin (CTX) injections in the tibialis anterior muscles of M. musculus provides models of skeletal muscle damages followed by skeletal muscle regeneration. In particular, glycerol-induced muscle regeneration is known to be associated with ectopic adipogenesis. We characterized genome-wide expression profiles of tibialis anterior muscles from wild-type mice injured by either glycerol or CTX injection. Our goal was to detect gene expression changes during the time course of glycerol-induced and CTX-induced muscle regeneration models, that can lead to ectopic adipocyte accumulation.

DESIGN
Tibialis anterior muscle of 12 week old wildtype C57BL/6J male mice injected i.m with either glycerol or CTX were collected 3, 7, 14 or 21 days after injection. 6 biological replicates were used for each time points. Please note that a few replicate samples did not pass QC test, thus, were removed from the submission. Unchallenged tibialis anterior muscles from a group of 5 wildtype C57BL/6J mice were also as a control. Total RNA was extracted, QCed and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
