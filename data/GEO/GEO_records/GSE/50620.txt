TITLE
Loss of beta-catenin triggers oxidative stress and impairs hematopoietic regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Accidental or deliberate ionizing radiation exposure is fatal due to widespread hematopoietic destruction. However, little is known about either the course of injury or the definitive molecular pathways that regulate the subsequent regenerative response. We have investigated the spatial and temporal consequences of radiation injury on  the hematopoietic system and show the Wnt signaling pathway is critially important for regeneration.

DESIGN
Sorted KLS34- hematopoietic stem cells from 3 control samples and 3 beta catenin floxed vav-Cre positive  were analyzed.
