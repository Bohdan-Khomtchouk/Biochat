TITLE
RNA Sequencing Analysis of Wild Type and Ezh2 knock out CD8 T cell Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our data represents the first analysis of histone methyltransferase Ezh2 regulated transcriptomes in mouse CD8 T cells.

DESIGN
Na√Øve and in vitro TCR stimulated CD8 T cell mRNA profiles of Pmel-1 wild type (WT) and Ezh2-/- mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina.

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
