TITLE
The Smc5/6 Complex Restricts HBV when Localized to ND10 without Inducing an Innate Immune Response and is Counteracted by the HBV X Protein Shortly after Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq analysis of HBV-infected primary human hepatocyte

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was conducted in two independent primary human hepatocyte (PHH) donors. Duplicate samples for each donor were analyzed on day 13 post-infection, with single samples per donor at other time-points (4 hr, 8 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, day 2, day 3, day 6, day 8, day 10). Cell culture media was changed on days 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10
