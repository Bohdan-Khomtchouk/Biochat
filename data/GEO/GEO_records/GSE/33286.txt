TITLE
Oryza sativa L. cv. Kita-ake: Wild type control vs. OsbZIP39deltaC overexpressed

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Transcription factor encoded by OsbZIP39 gene is regulator of the Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response. The truncated form of OsbZIP39 without the transmembrane domain (OsbZIP39deltaC) is an active form. To identify the potential downstream genes regulated by OsbZIP39, we performed the rice 44k oligo microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 7-day-old rice shoots of the wild type control and the OsbZIP39deltaC overexpression line grown on the MS medium, and subjected to 44k oligo-DNA microarray with 4 biological replicates.
