TITLE
Comparison of overall functional gene structures of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and an oxidation ditch (OD) running parallelly at full-scale

ORGANISM
activated sludge metagenome

SUMMARY
Membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems are typically known different from conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems in operational parameters, while current knowledge of their microbial differentiations is barely sufficient. To this end, the current study was launched to address the differences of the overall functional genes of an oxidation ditch (OD) and an MBR running parallelly at full-scale using a functional gene array-GeoChip 4.2.

DESIGN
Two full-scale wastewater treatment systems applying the processes of oxidation ditch (OD) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) were investigated. They treated identical wastewater at the same scale. 12 mixed-liquor suspended sludge (MLSS) samples collected daily on 12 consecutive days from each system were analyzed by GeoChip 4.2.
