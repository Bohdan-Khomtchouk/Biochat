TITLE
Aerobic transcriptome of Porphyromonas gingivalis

ORGANISM
Porphyromonas gingivalis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of P. gingivalis cells comparing control cells grown in anaerobic conditions with cells grown in the presence of 6% of oxygen

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, anaerobically vs. aerobically grown cells. Biological replicates: 3 independently grown and harvested bacterial cells. Two technical replicates for two experiments.  Four replicates per array.
