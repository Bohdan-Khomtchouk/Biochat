TITLE
Expression data from control, Rb KO and Rb/Myc DKO tissues (villi and crypts)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of Myc corrects abrrant transcription in Rb KO villi, while these genetic manipulation does not lead to major gene expression changes in crypts. We used Affymetrix microarrays to profile the global gene expression changes caused by loss of Rb and Rb/Myc.

DESIGN
Rb and Myc were conditionally ablated in the small intestine of mice and villi or crypts were harvested 5 days after. Total RNA was isolated from control, Rb KO and Rb/Myc DKO groups and profiled.
