SUMMARY
Genome-Wide Screening of Genomic Alterations and  Transcriptional Modulation in Non-Smoking Female Lung Cancer in Taiwan

DESIGN
Sixty-one pairs of cancer and normal lung tissue specimens from non-smoking females were collected at National Taiwan University Hospital and Taichung Veterans General Hospital.   The selection criteria of clinical specimens depend on pathology report, physical examination and cigarette-smoking history.  Surgical lung tissue specimens were immediately snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 Â°C.  Surgical specimens would be further processed for RNA and DNA extraction.  Only those samples passed quality controls were processed for gene expression profiling analysis and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis respectively.
