TITLE
Mechanically stimulated fibroblast from different fetal mouse tissues using Affy MOE430 chip set

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to test the hypothesis that fibroblasts from different tissues are phenotypically distinct from one another, we have subjected tendon, skin and corneal fibroblasts of fetal mouse to mechanical stimulation by fluid flow and analyzed the transcriptional responses of the cells using Affymetrix MOE430 chip set containing two arrays MOE430A and MOE430B. Keywords: cell type comparison, stress response

DESIGN
The experiment is done using Affymetrix MOE430 chip set containing two arrays MOE430A - platform GPL339 and MOE430B - platform MOE340. Three biological replicates for tendon, skin and corneal fibroblasts subjected to mechanical stimulation as well as not stimulated (control) were analyzed yielding 18 samples per chip (36 in total).
