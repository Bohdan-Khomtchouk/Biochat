TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of p53 binding protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor suppressor p53 regulates various role in the cell including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis. Current research achieved to investigate p53 target genes in human osteosarcoma cell line-SaOS2 cell.

DESIGN
Examination of p53 binding protein by transfecting flag-tagged wild type p53 into SaOS2 cells.

PLATFORM
