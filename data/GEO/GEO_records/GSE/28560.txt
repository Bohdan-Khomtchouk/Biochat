TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of a novel mutant resistant to imidacloprid and DDT

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Deep-sequencing analysis of mRNA expression differences between imidacloprid and DDT resistant mutant line and iso31 (w1118) susceptible line have been obtained. A total of 357 transcripts were found to be differently expressed, with 150 upregulated and 207 downregulated genes in the resistant line.

DESIGN
Analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from one resistant mutant and one iso31 (w1118) susceptible (control) sample

PLATFORM
GPL9061 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Drosophila melanogaster)
