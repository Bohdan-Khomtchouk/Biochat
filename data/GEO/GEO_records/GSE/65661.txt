TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression in brat mutant versus w1118 early Drosophila embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
mRNA expression was assessed genome-wide in brat mutant and w1118 early Drosophila embryos, to elucidate the role of BRAT in regulating mRNA stability. Four different time-points were analyzed for each genotype: 0-to-1.5 hours post-egglaying, 1.5-to-3.0 hours post-egglaying, 3.0-to-4.5 hours post-egglaying, and 4.5-to-6.0 hours post-egglaying.

DESIGN
There are a total of 24 samples. This includes 3 biological replicates for each of the following: 1) 0-to-1.5 hour brat mutant embryos, 2) 1.5-to-3.0 hour brat mutant embryos, 3) 3.0-to-4.5 hour brat mutant embryos, 4) 4.5-to-6.0 hour brat mutant embryos, 5) 0-to-1.5 hour w1118 embryos, 6) 1.5-to-3.0 hour w1118 embryos, 7) 3.0-to-4.5 hour w1118 embryos, and 8) 4.5-to-6.0 hour w1118 embryos.
