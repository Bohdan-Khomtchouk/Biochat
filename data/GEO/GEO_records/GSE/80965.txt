TITLE
Increased gene expression in the peridontium of unopposed molars in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The crowns of the right maxillary molars were removed  in 28 days old male Wistar rats (experimental).   Gene expression patterns were examined in the periodontal ligaments (PDLs) of the ipsilateral and contralateral mandibular molars, three and fifteen days later. Rats whith no dental interventions served as controls. We used microarrays to detail gene expression underlying post-emergent tooth eruption and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
The first mandibular molars were extracted and the periodontal ligament tissue was scraped with a scalpel from each root of the molar and RNA extraction and Transcriptome profiling was performed using Affymetrix.
