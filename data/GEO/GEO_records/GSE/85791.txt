TITLE
Germline NLRP1 mutations cause skin inflammatory and cancer susceptibility syndromes via inflammasome activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled the transcriptional changes in N/TERT-1 immortalized keratinocytes after doxycylin induction of gain-of-function mutants of the inflammasome sensor protein  NLRP1.

DESIGN
Stable N-TERT/1 cell lines were generated using lentiviral transduction. Experimental group includes doxycline-treated N/TERT cells expressing NLRP1 mutants A54T, M77T and A66V. Control group includes doxyclin-treated vector-transduced N/TERT cells and two NLRP1 mutant-transduced cell lines that were not treated with doxycycline. All cells were harvested three days after induction. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent.
