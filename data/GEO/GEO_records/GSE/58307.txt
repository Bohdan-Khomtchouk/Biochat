TITLE
Expression profiling of KRas ablation surviving cells and matched Kras expressing spheres in pancreatic tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from KRas expressing tumors, matched Kras expressing tumor spheres, surviving cells and surviving cells after KRas re-expression for 24hs

DESIGN
Data reported here are obtained from 5 independent tumors (from 1 to 5). For each tumor, expression data for the original Tumor (in vivo bulk tumor lesion), the KRas Expressing Spheres derived from the bulk tumor, the matched surviving cells after 8 days of KRas ablation (SCs) and Surviving Cells after 24 hours of KRas re-expression are reported.
