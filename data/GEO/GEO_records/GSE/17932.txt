TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of maize developing earshoot, B73 X Mo17 hybrid

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Maize earshoot is a metabolic sink espcially related to nitrogen metabolism. Studies on the transcriptomic and metabolic changes occuring in earshoot can provide interesting answers about the nitrogen metabolic potential of the maize variety under study. B73 X Mo17 is a model maize hybrid. Developing earshoots from this genotype grown at nitrogen-deficient and nitrogen-sufficient conditions were sampled, processed and analyzed through microarray technology.

DESIGN
B73 X Mo17 hybrid_developing earshoot microarray data: Technical replicates, no biological replicates
