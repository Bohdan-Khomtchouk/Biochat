TITLE
Expression levels of mature miRNAs from Caco2 cell treated with inflammatory cytokines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray to determine the miRNA whose expression was changed at 6 hours after inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL1α, IL1β, or IL6) treatment.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment; Caco2 control vs Caco2 treated with TNFα, IL1α, IL1β,or IL6 for 6 hours
