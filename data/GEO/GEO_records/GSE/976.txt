TITLE
Gene Expression-Based High Throughput Screening: APL Treatment with Candidate Compounds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a general approach to small molecule library screening called GE-HTS (Gene Expression-Based High Throughput Screening) in which a gene expression signature is used as a surrogate for cellular states and applied  it to the identification of compounds inducing the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. In screening 1,739 compounds, we identified 8 that reliably induced the differentiation signature, and furthermore yielded functional evidence of bona fide differentiation. We tested several of these in duplicate replicates in blasts from a patient with APL. Also included in this data set are a collection of 6 primary patient AML cells, 3 normal neutrophils samples, and 3 normal monocyte samples. This data was used to evaluate whole genome effects of the compounds on APL cells in relation to AML versus normal neutrophils and monocytes.
