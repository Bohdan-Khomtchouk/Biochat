TITLE
Epigenetically repressing human cytomegalovirus lytic infection and reactivation from latency in THP-1 model by targeting H3K9 and H3K27 histone demethylases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infects a broad range of the population and establishes life-long latency in the infected individuals. Periodically the latently infected virus can reactivate and becomes a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. Upon reactivation, the repressive chromatin is remodeled to an active form, allowing viral lytic gene transcription, initiated by the expression of viral Immediate Early (IE) genes. During this process, a number of histone modification enzymes, including histone demethylases (HDMs), play important roles in driving IE expression, but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. To get a better understanding of these mechanisms, we profiled this well-established CMV experimental latency-reactivation model based on TPA (12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) induced THP-1 differentiation, which recapitulates many key features of CMV latency and reactivation in vivo, including the important role of viral chromatin in controlling viral IE gene expression.

DESIGN
Transcritome profiling of THP-1 cell lines with or without TPA induction
