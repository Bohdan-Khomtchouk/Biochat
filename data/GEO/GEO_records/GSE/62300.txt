TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of the  DNA methylation landscape at base-pair resolution in human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome bisulphite sequencing of 2 human cancer cell line samples. One cell line harbours a heterozygous mutation in the DNA methyl-transferase DNMT3a, a common alteration observed in AML patients. The main goal is to find the differentially methylated regions (DMR) at genome-wide level between the mutant and a wild-type cell lines to elucidate the effect of the mutation and the implication in leukomogenesis.

DESIGN
Sequencing of bisulfite converted DNA of a wild-type  and a DNMT3a mutant AML cancer cell line.
