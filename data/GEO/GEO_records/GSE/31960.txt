TITLE
Huh7 cells exist as a mixed population of cells with distinct patterns of gene methylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A powerful approach to study innate antiviral response is to compare the difference between wild type Huh7 cells, which do not support robust replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV)2, versus certain subclones of Huh7 cells that are permissive for HCV replication. We generated two permissive cell lines and two independent non-permissive subclone from Huh7 cells. We compared the global methylation pattern of these different cells and find that Huh7 cells exist as a heterogeneous population of cells with distinct patterns of gene methylation.

DESIGN
Comparison of Huh7, HRP1, HRP4, Huh7-pNeo1 and Huh7-pNeo2 cells.
