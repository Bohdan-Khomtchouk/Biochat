TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic profiling at E3-E3.5, E5-E5.5 and E8-E8.5 stages of retina development in pigeon and chicken

ORGANISM
Columba livia

SUMMARY
The macula and fovea located at the optical centre of the retina make primate visual perception unique among mammals. Pigeon retina and the human macula share a number of structural and functional properties that justify introducing the former as a new model system for retina development. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the pigeon and chicken retinas at different embryonic stages was undertaken to uncover how transcriptomic patterns translate into functional differences between the two bird species. The study showed that the pigeonâ€™s genetic programs underlying cell differentiation are postponed until the end of the period of cell proliferation. This allows the pigeon to build a retina that displays the structural and functional traits typical of primate macula and fovea.

DESIGN
Triplicate samples of RNA from E3-E3.5, E5-E5.5 and E8-E8.5 stages of pigeon and chicken developing retinas were profiled by RNAseq
