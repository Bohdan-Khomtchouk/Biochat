TITLE
Human Cytomegalovirus Infection Causes Premature and Abnormal Differentiation of Human Neural Progenitor Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our results suggest that HCMV infection disrupts the self-renewal capacity of NPCs and influences their differentiation. Whole genome expression analysis revealed many changes in cellular gene expression, including downregulation of genes pertinent to the neuronal lineage.

DESIGN
For gene expression analysis, cells were either mock- or virus-infected. Mock-infectedÂ cells were harvested at 12 hpi, virus infected cells were harvested at 4, 12 and 24 hpi. Virus- and mock-infections were performed in duplicate, with each individual sample harvested separately, thereby acting as biological replicates for analysis.
