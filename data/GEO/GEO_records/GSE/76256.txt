TITLE
Grape skin transcriptome to reveal genes related with resveratrol accumulation

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Methods:transcriptomes of the different development stages of Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and Vitis quinquangularis accession Danfeng-2 were analyzed using Illumina Hiseq 2500. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed: TopHat followed by Cufflinks.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of  different development stages of Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and Vitis quinquangularis accession Danfeng-2 were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500.
