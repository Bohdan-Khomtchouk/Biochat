TITLE
Transcriptional response to lactic acid stress in the hybrid yeast Zygosaccharomyces parabailii

ORGANISM
Zygosaccharomyces parabailii

SUMMARY
In this study we used stringent mapping methods and a high-quality genome sequence to study the transcriptional response to lactic acid stress in Zygosaccharomyces parabailii ATCC60483, a natural interspecies hybrid yeast

DESIGN
The RNA seq was performed on bioreactor grown cells either with addition of lactic acid or without. The samples were taken at two timepoints corresponding to exponential growth phase and post diaxulic shift

PLATFORM
GPL24086 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Zygosaccharomyces parabailii)
