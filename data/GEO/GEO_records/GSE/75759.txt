TITLE
Expression data from male cynomolgus macaques exposed to 6 ppm formaldehyde

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
Exogenous formaldehyde disrupts genomic/epigenomic profiles in the rodent nose and white blood cells (WBCs) related to inflammation and immune signaling, although it does not reach the circulating blood. We aimed to compare and contrast alterations in genomic signaling in the nose and circulating blood of non-human primates exposed to formaldehyde. We used microarrays to identify transcripts that were diffentially expressed in response to formaldehyde inhalation exposure.

DESIGN
A total of 14 primates received two consecutive days of 6-hour whole body inhalation exposures consisting of either filtered air (n = 6) or a target of 6 ppm formaldehyde (n = 8). To assess formaldehyde-induced changes in genome-wide gene expression profiles, RNA samples extracted from the nasal epithelium and circulating WBCs were labeled and hybridized to the Affymetrix Cynomolgus Macaque Gene 1.0 ST Array.
