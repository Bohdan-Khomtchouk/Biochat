TITLE
Effect of TUNAR silencing and GSK3 inhibition on human b-cell transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study is to identify the target genes of long noncoding RNA TUNAR in human EndoC-βH1 cells with or without treatment of GSK3 inhibitor.

DESIGN
Human EndoC-βH1 cells were treated with negative siRNA or TUNAR siRNA, and then subjected to GSK3 inhibitor 1-AKP or not. Differentially expressed genes were identified by quantifying transcriptome by RNA-seq.
