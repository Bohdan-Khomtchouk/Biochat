TITLE
A Pathobiological Role of the Insulin Receptor in CLL.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: The chromosomal deletion 11q affects biology and clinical outcome in CLL but del11q-deregulated genes remain incompletely characterized. Results:  We have identified differential expression of the insulin receptor (INSR) in CLL, including high-level INSR expression in the majority of CLL with del11q.  High INSR mRNA expression in 11q CLL (~10-fold higher mean levels than other genomic categories) was confirmed by Q-PCR in 247 CLL cases. INSR protein measurements in 257 CLL cases through FACS, compared with measurements in normal CD19+ B-cells and monocytes, confirmed that a subset of CLL aberrantly expresses high INSR levels.
