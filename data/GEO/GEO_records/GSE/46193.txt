TITLE
Molecular profiles of cognitive aging

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression was measured from the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex harvested from human postmortem samples.

DESIGN
We harvested the dentate gyrus DG from healthy human brains ranging from 33 to 88 years of age. Additionally, from each brain we harvested the entorhinal cortex (EC) as a within-brain control. Using Affymetrix microarray chips we generated gene-expression profiles of each individual tissue samples. DG expression levels were first normalized against the EC, and the normalized DG transcripts were then correlated against age. Submitter cannot locate the CEL files.
