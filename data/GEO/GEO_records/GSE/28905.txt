TITLE
Structural variation among soybean cultivars

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
CGH was used to compare structural variation among four soybean cultivars (Archer, Minsoy, Noir1 and Williams 82).  Four additional hybridizations were performed with these and other accessions (Kingwa, Williams, M92-220, Richland and Essex) to confirm the patterns observed.

DESIGN
Three different soybean cultivars (Archer, Minsoy and Noir1) were hybridized against the common reference genotype Williams 82.  The soybean tiling array consists of 700k probes, spaced at approximately 1.1 kb intervals.  Four additional hybridizations were performed with these and other accessions (Kingwa, Williams, M92-220, Richland and Essex) to confirm the patterns observed.
