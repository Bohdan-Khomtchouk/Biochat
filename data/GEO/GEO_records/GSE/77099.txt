TITLE
Rice bHLH transcription factor RERJ1 dependent wound inducible genes in rice leaves

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) has been known as a signal molecule that is induced by various stresses and mediates plant defense responses. Rice O. sativa inductively produces variety of defensive compounds upon abiotic and biotic stress conditions, such as wounding and insect attack. The bHLH transcription factor RERJ1 has previously been identified as JA-inducible factor whose expression is also rapidly induced by wounding. We identified RERJ1-dependent and wound-inducible genes by comparison with transcriptomes of wound treated wild-type and a Tos17-rerj1 defective mutant rice.

DESIGN
Expression profiling between rice leaves of wild-type and tos17-rerj1 mutant treated by wounding for 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 h was compared using two-color method with two biological replicates.
