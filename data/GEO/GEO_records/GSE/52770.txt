TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of thermal adaptive E. coli (part 2)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Two E. coli genotypes (type_II and type_III) that showing a mutation either within rpoH or upstream of groESL were isolated in the thermal adaptative evolution. Transcriptome analyses of the two genotypes exponentially growing at both regular and high temperatures were performed.

DESIGN
Cells exponentially growing at 37ºC or 45ºC were collected for the transcriptome analysis. Every 3 biological replications were performed.
