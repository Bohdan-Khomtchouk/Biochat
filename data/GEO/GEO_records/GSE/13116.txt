TITLE
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae BHI vs Koromycin

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

SUMMARY
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiologic agent of contagious pleuropneumonia, an economically important disease of commercially reared swine throughout the world. To cause this disease, A. pleuropneumoniae must rapidly overcome porcine pulmonary innate immune defenses.  Effects of koromycin, an antimicrobial agent that acts as an noncompetitive inhibitor of the interaction of NQR with its quinone substrate, on the transcriptome of A. pleuropneumoniae was investigated.

DESIGN
Labelled cDNA synthetised from tester condition (namely wt strain growing in BHI-koromycin) was co-hybridized on the microarray with labelled cDNA from the control condition (wt BHI). Control was labelled with Cy3. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE13006 At least four hybridizations were conducted for each sample combination type. Microarray analysis was carried out using the TM4 Suite of softwares (TIGR) and the SAM algorithm, using a false discovery rate (FDR) value of 0%. For the planktonic and adhesion experiments, Cy5 signal (test) was compared to Cy3 signal (control), except for one dye swap, in order to obtain a list of significant differentially expressed genes.
