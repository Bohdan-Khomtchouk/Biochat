TITLE
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae BHI vs Koromycin

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 5b str. L20

SUMMARY
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiologic agent of contagious pleuropneumonia, an economically important disease of commercially reared swine throughout the world. To cause this disease, A. pleuropneumoniae must rapidly overcome porcine pulmonary innate immune defenses.  Effects of koromycin, an antimicrobial agent that acts as an noncompetitive inhibitor of the interaction of NQR with its quinone substrate, on the transcriptome of A. pleuropneumoniae was investigated.
