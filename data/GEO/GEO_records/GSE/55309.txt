TITLE
PID-1 is a novel factor that operates during 21U RNA biogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Animal germ cells employ small RNA-based mechanisms to recognize and silence DNA that invades their genome. One of these pathways is named the Piwi:piRNA pathway. Biogenesis of piRNAs is poorly understood. In C. elegans, the piRNA (21U-RNA)-binding Argonaute protein PRG-1 is the only known player acting downstream of pre-cursor transcription. From a screen aimed at the isolation of ‘piRNA-induced silencing defective’ mutations we identified, amongst known Piwi-pathway components like MUT-7, RDE-3 and HRDE-1, PID-1 as a novel player. PID-1 is essential for 21U RNA biogenesis and affects an early step in the processing or transport of 21U precursor transcripts.

DESIGN
12 small RNA samples were analyzed as singletons.
