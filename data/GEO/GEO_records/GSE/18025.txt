TITLE
Fibrinogen-reactive T cells transfer disease to naïve mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Splenocytes harvested from mice with FIA were cultured in vitro and stimulated with 0.01 mg/ml fibrinogen for 3 days.  Enriched T cells were transferred into 6-week-old naïve SJL mice, which developed visible signs of arthritis within 2 weeks.  Synovial array profiling of plasma from the arthritic recipient mice demonstrated autoreactive B cell responses against peptides representing native fibrinogen, and further spreading of the responses to target collagen type V, cartilage gp39, and citrullinated vimentin.
