TITLE
Bacillus anthracis' lethal toxin induces broad transcriptional responses in human peripheral monocyte.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Anthrax lethal toxin directly targets human peripheral monocytes and causes multiple aberrant gene responses that would be expected to result in defects in human monocyteâ€™s normal signaling transduction pathways and nction. This study provides further insights into the mechanisms associated with the host immune system collapse during an anthrax infection, and suggests that anthrax LT may have additional targets outside the well-known MAPK pathway.

DESIGN
There were 4 replicates, 1 control and 1 toxin treated from 4 donors, with 8 samples total. key word : Toxin response
