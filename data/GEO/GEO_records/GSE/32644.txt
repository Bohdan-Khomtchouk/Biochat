TITLE
Genome-wide maps of MEF2C and H3K27ac localization in HUVECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MEF2C is one of the substantially expressed transcriptional factors in endothelial cells, but its genomic localization is unknown. This time, we established a new antibody for MEF2C, and performed ChIP-seq to identify MEF2C binding site in whole genome manner.   H3K27Ac binding sites were also detected in the same way.

DESIGN
We used chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) of HUVECs treated with or without pitavastatin for 4hours, we identified MEF2C and H3K27Ac binding regions.HUVECs were used within the first 6 passages.  For MEF2C studies, HUVECs were cultivated in medium EGM2MV containing pitavastatin at a concentration of 1 Î¼M, and same concentration of DMSO was used as a control sample. For H3K27ac, HUVECs were starved for 16 hours and harvested without statin treatment.
