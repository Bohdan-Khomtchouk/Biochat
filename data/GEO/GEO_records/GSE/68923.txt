TITLE
Gene expression in healthy and lesional psoriatic epidermis from human skin biopsies (laser capture microdissection): set 1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray analysis on laser-microdissected epidermis from healthy volunteers and psoriatic patients to identify genes dysregulated in lesional psoriatic epidermis

DESIGN
Epidermis and dermis were obtained from human skin biopsies by laser capture microdissection using Arcturus XT (MDS Analytical Technologies) system, followed by RNA isolation with Arcturus Picopure RNA isolation Kit. 10 ng RNA were amplified with ExpressArt Kit and labeled with One-color microarray-based Gene Expression Analysis Low Input Quick Amp WT Labeling (Agilent Technologies) and hybridized with Human Gene Expression Microarray 8x60K chip (Agilent Technologies). Two sets of samples (3 lesional psoriatic and 2 healthy epidermis samples in set 1 and 3 lesional psoriatic and 3 healthy epidermis samples in set 2, or 3 lesional psoriatic and 2 healthy dermis samples in set 1 and 3 lesional psoriatic and 2 healthy dermis samples in set 2) were processed and normalized separately.
