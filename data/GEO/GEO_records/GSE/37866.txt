TITLE
An improved method of generating total amplified tumor RNA for DC based autologous immunotherapy enhances antigen presentation and leads to more potent immune responses.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate improvements introduced in the RNA amplificatio protocol the RNAs extracted from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were amplified using old protocol and the new protocol. Microarray analysis was conducted to evaluate capture of transcripts in the RNA amplified using the new protocol and old protocol by comparing those to starting total RCC RNA.

DESIGN
Expression of RCC genes was detected in the RNAs amplified using two experimental protocols (Arm2, Arm5) and compared to that of total RNA. The RNA was amplified from three independent donors and technical replicates were conducted on two of the samples.
