TITLE
Transcriptional co-factor Transducin beta-like (TBL) 1 acts as a checkpoint in pancreatic cancer malignancy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer fatalities in Western societies, characterized by high metastatic potential and resistance to chemotherapy. Critical molecular mechanisms of these phenotypical features still remain unknown, thus hampering the development of effective prognostic and therapeutic measures in PDAC.  Here we show that transcriptional co-factor Transducin beta-like (TBL) 1 was over-expressed in both human and murine PDAC. Inactivation of TBL1 in human and mouse pancreatic cancer cells reduced cellular proliferation and enhanced chemosensitivity, correlating with diminished glucose uptake, glycolytic flux, and PI3kinase signaling. TBL1 deficiency both prevented and reversed pancreatic tumor growth in mice, triggering transcriptional PI3kinase inhibition also in vivo. As TBL1 mRNA levels were also found to correlate with overall and disease-free survival in a cohort of human PDAC patients and to predict therapy responsiveness in these subjects, TBL1 expression may serve both as a novel prognostic marker and molecular target in the treatment of human PDAC.

DESIGN
Capan-1 cells were transfected with control-siRNA (#1027292, Qiagen) or siRNA against human TBL1 (SI04329514, Qiagen) and RNA was isolated 24h later
