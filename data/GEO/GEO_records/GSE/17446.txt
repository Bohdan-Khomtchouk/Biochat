TITLE
Differential Expression Studies in Murine Splenic Cells During Prion Infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA microarrays were used to profile gene expression in normal murine splenic cells vs. prion infected splenic cells with the aim of identifying host factors involved in prion propagation and/or useful as biomarkers for early diagnosis.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, prion infected murine splenic cells vs. normal murine splenic cells: 4 infected biological replicates, 2 control biological replicates, 2 technical replicates (dye-swaps) for each competitive hybridization. Samples were run on 4 different arrays: MPB Murine 16K BMAP-MSV printrun 7.1 microarray MPB Murine 16K BMAP-MSV printrun 9.1 microarray MPB Murine 32K Oligo printrun 4.1 microarray Agilent 4x44K Whole Mouse Genome

PLATFORM
