TITLE
Differential Expression Studies in Murine Splenic Cells During Prion Infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA microarrays were used to profile gene expression in normal murine splenic cells vs. prion infected splenic cells with the aim of identifying host factors involved in prion propagation and/or useful as biomarkers for early diagnosis.
