TITLE
Expression data from in vitro HIV-1-infected macrophages responding to phagocytic stimuli

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in human macrophages infected in vitro with HIV-1 and then subjected to phagocytic stimuli; we identified distinct classes of differentially regulated genes during this process

DESIGN
Primary human macrophages from 3 different donors were infected with HIV-1ADA WT or mock-infected for 8 days. They were incubated or not (basal) with IgG-SRBCs (FcR) or Salmonella Typhimurium (4/74 strain) during 1 hour at 37Â°C, then lysed and RNA of each sample was analyzed with microarrays.
