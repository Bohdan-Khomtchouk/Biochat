TITLE
Allele-Specific Non-CG Methylation Marks Domains of Active Chromatin in Mouse Brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined genome-wide, base-resolution, allele-specific methylation and expression in the prefrontal cortex using a mouse model of deterministic X-inactivation, where the paternal allele was always inactivated. Our findings elucidate the role methylation may play in chromatin regulation under X-inactivation and genomic imprinting.

DESIGN
MethylC-seq, RNA-seq from the mouse frontal cortex

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
