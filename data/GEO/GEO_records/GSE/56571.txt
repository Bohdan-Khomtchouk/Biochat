TITLE
Gene expression of mouse intestine treated with azoxymethane and/or St. John's wort

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to examine the effects of dietary supplementation of St Johnâ€™s wort extract on azoxymethane-induced colorectal carcinogenesis in mice. Microarray data showed atttenuation of NF-kB and ERK-mediated pathway in colon epithelium by St. Jone's wort suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effect is a possible cancer-preventing mechanism induced by St. Jone's wort. Gene expression will be compared between mice with the control vs. St. Jone's wort.

DESIGN
Six-condition experiment, CSN vs SSN vs CAN vs SAN vs CAT vs.SAT Biological replicates: 3CSN, 3SSN, 3CAN, 3SAN, 3CAT and 3SAT samples.
