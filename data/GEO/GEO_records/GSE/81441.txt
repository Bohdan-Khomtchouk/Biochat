TITLE
Mutant p53 R270H induces invasion and metastasis of mouse intestinal tumor organoids through gain-of-function mechanism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Apc(D716) mutant mice develop benign intestinal adenoma, while Apc(D716) and p53 R270H compound mutant mice develop invasive adenocarcinoma in the intestine.  We examined expression profile of tumor-derived organoids using Apc(D716),  Apc(D716) p53 Null, Apc(D716) p53 R270H mutant mice by RNA sequencing, and identified mutant p53-induced gene set.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from Apc(D716) p53(+/+) tumor organoids, Apc(D716) p53(flox/flox) tumor organoids, and Apc(D716) p53(M/M) tumor organoids.  For each genotype, two mice were used and organoids were prepared independently.  p53(flox) allele is null mutation, whereas p53(M) allele carrys R270H mutation.  We used Illumina HiSeq 2500, and examined expression profiles.
