TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Human CD34+ cells derived from bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, umbillial cord blood using Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (one-color)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify genes associated with the engraftment potential of human hematopoietic stem cells, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling of G0 and G1 phase CD34+ cells derived from bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood. Samples were collected from healthy adult volunteers after obtaining informed consent according to the guidelines of the Investigational Review Board of Indiana University School of Medicine. CD34+ cells were selected and fractionated into G0 and G1 phases of cell cycle  on a flow cytometer. Purity of sorted cells was further confirmed by qRT-PCR by measuring the relative expression of Ki67. Sorted cells were subjeccted to microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of sorted and confirmed G0 and G1 cells from bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood (total of eighteen samples) were subjected to microarray analysis. To generate distinct and unique sets of data, we did not pool multiple samples from any tissue studied so that each sample or its replicate was from a single donor.
