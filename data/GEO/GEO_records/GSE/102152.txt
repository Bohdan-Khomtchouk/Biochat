TITLE
Identification of anti-salt genes in rice culture

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Salt-water Rice has stronger resistance than common rice under high salt environment. We aim to find anti-salt genes by comparing  the gene expression, which can provide target genes for further function research

DESIGN
Compare the gene exprerssion in rice cultured in sea water and in fresh water

PLATFORM
GPL19290 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Oryza sativa)
