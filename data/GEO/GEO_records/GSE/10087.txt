TITLE
Paired MEK inhibited and control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study used microarray expression analysis to identify global changes in transcript alteration in response to MEK inhibition. Genes under ERK control were identified in a panel of V600E BRAF and RTK-activated tumor cells and xenografts, using short-term inhibition of ERK activity using the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (Pfizer). Keywords: paired treatment and control

DESIGN
Cell lines growing in culture (n=12) and murine xenografts (n=2) were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 or vehicle alone as control. Paired analysis of MEK inhibited to control samples was performed for two groups of tumor cells, V600E BRAF and RTK.
