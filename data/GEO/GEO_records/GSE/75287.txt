TITLE
Genomic distribution of linker histone varinat H1T

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report genome-wide distribution of germ cell-specific linker histone variant H1T in cancer cell line AGS, MDA-MB-231, and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We found that H1T expressed not only testis but also non-germ cells such as cancer cells and pluripotent stem cells and showed the biased distribution at rDNA repeat unit. Moreover, on the rDNA region, H1T regulated the chromatin structure and pre-rRNA expression. This study using ChIP-seq analysis provides genomic distribution of H1T in non-germinal cells.
