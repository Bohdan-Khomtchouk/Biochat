TITLE
Transcriptome analysis reveals a major impact of Tyk2 on the expression of interferon responsive and metabolic genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Peritoneal macrophages of Tyk2-/- and wildtype (wt) mice were compared before and after six hours of LPS treatment. Interferon responsive genes are lower expressed in Tyk2-/- macrophages at the basal level, metabolic genes higher before, but even more after LPS treatment.

DESIGN
cDNA from macrophages from three replicates of three Tyk2-/- and three wt mice before and after six hours of LPS treatment, respectively, was hybridized to a microarray and analyzed.
