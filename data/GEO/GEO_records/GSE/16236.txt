TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of bone marrow cells of MDS patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDSs) are a heterogeneous family of clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and frequently leukemia progression. To exlore how MDS develop into leukemia, we performed the transcriptional profiling of lesional cells and normal lymphoid cells from the MDS patients.

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells from the MDS patients were sorted into blastic, myeloid, erythroid and lymphoid fractions by flow cytometry and then were profiled transcriptionally by Human Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Differentially expressed genes between lesional cells and lymphoid cells were identified by SAM.
