TITLE
The Histone Modification Domain of Paf1 Complex Subunit Rtf1 Promotes H2B Ubiquitylation Through a Direct Interaction with the Ubiquitin Conjugase Rad6

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription by RNA polymerase II is regulated by epigenetic modifications to the chromatin template. The mono-ubiquitylation of H2B is established during transcription elongation and broadly impacts chromatin architecture and gene expression. The Polymerase Associated Factor 1 complex (Paf1C) is required for H2B ubiquitylation through an unknown mechanism. Here, we find that a 66-amino acid histone modification domain (HMD) within the Rtf1 subunit of Paf1C promotes H2B ubiquitylation in cells lacking all Paf1C members and present the crystal structure of this domain. Using site-specific in vivo crosslinking, we show that Rtf1 directly interacts with the ubiquitin conjugase Rad6 through a conserved surface on the HMD. Through ChIP-exo analysis, we observe that enrichment of Paf1C correlates with H2B ubiquitylation, and that the HMD, Rad6 and Bre1 localize to H2B. Finally, we demonstrate that the HMD directly stimulates H2B ubiquitylation in a reconstituted system, arguing that Paf1C functions as a cofactor for Rad6-Bre1 mediated catalysis.
