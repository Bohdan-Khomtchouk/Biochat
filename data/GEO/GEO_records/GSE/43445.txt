TITLE
MicroRNA profiling in primary and metastatic HCC cell lines using PLC8024 and MHCC97H derived cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Goal for this study is to identified miRNA involved in metastasis development using PLC8024 and MHCC97H derived cell lines.

DESIGN
PLC8024 derived cell lines, PLC-PT (Primary Tumor) and PLC-LM (Lung Metastasis), and MHCC97H derived cell lines, MHCC97H-PT and MHCC97H-LM were compared using the Ncode miRNA microarray platform. The experiment were repeat twice with dye-swap.

PLATFORM
GPL16496 Invitrogen Custom NCode Multi-Species miRBase Microarray V2
