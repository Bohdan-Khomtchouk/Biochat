TITLE
Structural genomic variation analysis in patients with bone marrow failure using Illumina Infinium SNP Arrays [Omni1-Quad]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the natural history of bone marrow failure syndromes, we analyzed 124 single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP-A) from a comprehensively characterized cohort of 91 patients who had SNP-A for clinical evaluation of BMFS. 67 samples from 51 patients were genotyped with the Quad610, and 57 samples from 54 patients were genotyped with the Omni1-Quad. This submission includes 55 samples from 54 patients that were genotyped with Omni1-Quad.

DESIGN
Illumina Infinium SNP-A genotyping was performed on DNA extracted from bone marrow aspirates using standard manufacturer's protocol

PLATFORM
GPL8882 Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip
