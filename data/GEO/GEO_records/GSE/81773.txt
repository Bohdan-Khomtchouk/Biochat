TITLE
Quantitative Analysis of ZF4 cells Transcriptomes when Infected with Edwardsiella tarda

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Edwardsiella tarda is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that can infect a wide range of freshwater and marine fish. However, the immune evasion mechanisms of Edwardsiella tarda is not fully understood. We found that Edwardsiella tarda infection generally significantly upregulated and downregulated a lot of immune-related genes of zebrafish ZF4 cells using RNA-seq technology.

DESIGN
Examination of  the different expressed genes of ZF4 cells in response to the Edwardsiella tarda infection.

PLATFORM
