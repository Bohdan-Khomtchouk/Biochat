TITLE
Expression data: Venous malformation-causative TIE2-mutations mediate an AKT-dependent decrease in PDGFB

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptional profiles of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) expressing wild-type vs. VM-causative mutant forms of TIE2/TEK. The effects of the most common Venous Malformation-causative mutations in the endothelial cell tyrosine kinase receptor: R849W and L914F, were tested. 743 genes were differentially expressed across the four groups. The 80 genes distinguishing between L914F and wild-type TIE2-expressing HUVECs were analyzed in greater detail.

DESIGN
3 batches each of: non-transfected, and wild-type TIE2, R849W-TIE2, and L914F-TIE2 overexpressing HUVECs were compared by exon-array profiling.
