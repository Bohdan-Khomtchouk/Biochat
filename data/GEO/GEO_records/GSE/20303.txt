TITLE
ChIP-Seq sequencing of novel interactors of H3K4me3, H3K36me3 and H3K9me3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study describes the epigenetic profiling of the novel interactors of H3K4me3, H3K36me3 or H3K9me3. The interactors were ChIP-Seq profiled by their GFP tag in stably transfected HeLa (Kyoto) cells. The interactors include GATAD1, Sgf29, BAP18, TRRAP, PHF8, N-PAC and LRWD1 (including replicates), as well as an GFP ChIP-Seq profile on non-transfected HeLa cells (negative control). Also included are the profiles of the histone modifications themselves (H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, H3K9/14Ac and H3K79me3)

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq profiling of 8 proteins by their GFP tag in stably transfected cells HeLa (Kyoto) cells, 6 replicas, as well as ChIP-Seq profiling of 6 histone modifications in wt HeLa (Kyoto) cells
