TITLE
Genome-wide microarray analysis of human fibroblasts in response to indomethacin and nimesulide.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Establishment of a transcriptomic profile of human cells treated with genistein with particular emphasis on signature of genes coding for enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis stands for the present study. The hypothesis tested was that indomethacin and nimesulide influence expression of some genes among which are those coding for enzymes required for synthesis of different GAGs being pathologically accumulated in mucopolysaccharidoses. Results provide important information concerning the extent of action of indomethacin and nimesulide at the molecular level in terms of modulation of gene expression by these substances.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Human Dermal Fibroblasts adult (HDFa) and Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II) cell lines subjected to 24 or 48 hours in vitro exposure to 2 or 10 µM indomethacin, 5 or 25 µM nimesulide, or 0.05% DMSO (K).
