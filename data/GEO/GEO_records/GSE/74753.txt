TITLE
miRNA expression in inguinal adipose tissues

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We asked if miRNAs are involved in PRDM16 protein expression. Thus microarray was employed with inguinal adipose tissues from contol, fasted and cold exposure C57BL/6J male mice In this dataset, we include all the miRNA expression data obtained from dissected mouse inguinal adipose tissues from control, fasted and cold exposure mice.
