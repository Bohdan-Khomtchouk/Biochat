TITLE
miRNA expression in inguinal adipose tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We asked if miRNAs are involved in PRDM16 protein expression. Thus microarray was employed with inguinal adipose tissues from contol, fasted and cold exposure C57BL/6J male mice In this dataset, we include all the miRNA expression data obtained from dissected mouse inguinal adipose tissues from control, fasted and cold exposure mice.

DESIGN
Generally, microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Based on previous results, we asked whether miRNAs are involved in the regulation of PRDM16 in ingWAT in response to different physiological stimuli. We therefore performed miRNA microarray analysis using ingWAT from the cold-exposed mice, the fasted mice and the control mice. Given that cold exposure increased the level of PRDM16 protein whereas fasting decreased its expression, miRNAs that have expression patterns opposite to that of PRDM16 were selectedã€‚
