Mouse_embryoid Body_Retinoic acid treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
S6K1 Knockout mice has a lean phenotype and resitant to a High Fat Diet-induced obesity (Um S.H., Nature, 2004). Adipocyte differentiation consists of two step, first, commitment from stem cell to adipocyte progenitors and second, terminal differentiation from adipocyte progenitors to mature adipocyte. We studied S6K1-dependent gene expression regulation in early stage of commitment by employing ES cell(ESC)-Embryoid Bodies(EBs) differentiation model. We established stable ES cell lines infected with either control non-silencing shRNA (shNS) or S6K1 targetting shRNA (shS6K1). Each sample was treated with retinoic acid for 3 days to induce adipogenesis, then gene expression profile was analyzed employing microarrays and up-regulated and down-regulated genes were selected for analysis.

DESIGN
Mouse Embryoid Bodies (approximately 1000 EBs per sample) were treated with retinoic acid (1ÂµM) for 3 days then collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affimetrix microarray. Two biological replicates were each performed for EBs prepared from either shNS ESCs or shS6K1 ESCs.
