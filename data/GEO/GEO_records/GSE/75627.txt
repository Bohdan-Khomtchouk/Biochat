TITLE
CRISPR-Cas9 based screen for p53-bound enhancers that function in oncogene-induced senescence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We exained using RNA-seq the effect of targeting selected p53-bound enhancers on the p53-induced response to oncogenic stress

DESIGN
RNA-seq was applied to examine transcriptional response to oncogenic stress (induced by RASG12V activation) in control and genetically manipulated hTERT-immortalized BJ cells

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
