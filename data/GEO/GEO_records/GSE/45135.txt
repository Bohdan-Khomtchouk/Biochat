TITLE
Gene expression alterations due to defective Fbw7-dependent cyclin E ubiquitination in bone marrow erythroid cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A novel knock-in mouse model was reported (Minella et al., Genes Devel 2008) to have a mixed hyper-proliferative and defective maturation phenotype in the erythroid series. Microarray analyses were performed to identify gene expression alterations resulting from dysregulated cyclin E control.Â 

DESIGN
Analysis of gene expression changes in cyclin E (T74A T393A) knock-in erythroblasts (Ter119-positive, CD71-high) isolated by FACS sorting. Comparison is to cells similarly isolated from littermate controls.
