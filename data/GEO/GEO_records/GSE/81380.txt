TITLE
HDAC inhibitor panobinostat engages host immune defenses to promote the tumoricidal effects of trastuzumab in HER2+ tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Characterisation of the tumor extrinsic (immune-mediated) mechanisms by which panobinostat and trastuzumab can collaboratively promote tumor-associated NK cell infiltration to eradicate trastuzumab-refractory HER2+ tumors

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed on established whole AU565(pv) HER2+ human breast tumors, harvested from SCID mice 2-days post treatment initiation with vehicle (PBS/D5W), panobinostat (15mg/kg/day), trastuzumab (10mg/kg day 1) or both drugs in combination. Each treatment group comprised of 4 mice.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
