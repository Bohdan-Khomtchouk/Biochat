TITLE
Gene expression profile in CD14+ monocytes in patients with SSc or healthy controls (part 2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the role of monocyte in the pathogenesis of SSc, we analyzed gene and protein expression in monocyte from SSc and healthy controls in order to identify the molecules which were associated with pathogenesis of SSc.

DESIGN
After the screeining using gene and protein expression profiles, functional role of the candidate molecules were further analyzed to clarify the role in the pathogenesis of SSc.
