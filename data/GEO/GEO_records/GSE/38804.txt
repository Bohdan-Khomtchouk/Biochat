TITLE
Epigenome analysis of brain between human and chimpanzee

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of brain and liver from human and chimpanzee. The Illumina HumanMethylation27 DNA Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs for each sample. Samples included liver and NeuN-positive/NeuN-negative/unsorted brain in three individuals from each of two species (human and chimpanzee).
