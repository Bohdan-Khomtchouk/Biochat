TITLE
Human ES cells' gene expression difference compared with that of the adult cells including CCD-1079sk and IMR90

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human ES cells had different gene expression level compared with that of the adult cells including CCD-1079sk and IMR90. This difference gave the human ES cells unique characteristics which could then be compared with other species' ES cells or iPS cells like mouse ES cells and Rat iPS cells by the homologue genes comparison to show which species' ES cells or iPS cells were more competitive with the other.

DESIGN
There were three replicates sample of the Human ES cells named 1, 2, 3. And the adult cells were the mixture of CCD-1079sk and IMR90 named mix2. Human ES cells samples were labled with Cy3 and the mix2 were labled with Cy5. The data was process to show the human ES cells' gene expression difference compared with that of mix2.
