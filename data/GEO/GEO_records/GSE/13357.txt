TITLE
Human ES cells' gene expression difference compared with that of the adult cells including CCD-1079sk and IMR90

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human ES cells had different gene expression level compared with that of the adult cells including CCD-1079sk and IMR90. This difference gave the human ES cells unique characteristics which could then be compared with other species' ES cells or iPS cells like mouse ES cells and Rat iPS cells by the homologue genes comparison to show which species' ES cells or iPS cells were more competitive with the other.
