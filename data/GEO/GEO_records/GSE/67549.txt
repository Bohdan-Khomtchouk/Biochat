TITLE
Expression data from nine (9) pancreatic cancer cell lines incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the hypoxic gene expression profile in human pancreatic cancer cells

DESIGN
Pancreatic cancer cells were cultured for 24 hours under normoxic or hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions. RNA from two independent experiments was collected and pooled for microarray hybridization.
