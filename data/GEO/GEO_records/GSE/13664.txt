TITLE
Cycle versus Pregnancy

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
At implantation the endometrium undergoes dramatic modifications necessary for its physical interactions with the trophoblast as well as the development of the conceptus. We aim to identify endometrial factors and pathways essential for a successful implantation in the caruncular [C] and the intercaruncular [IC] areas in cattle. Using a bovine oligo-array, expression profiles were established at day 20 of the estrous cycle or pregnancy (implantation) showing 446 and 1295 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in [C] and [IC] areas respectively. The impact of the conceptus was higher on the immune response function in [C] but more prominent on the regulation of metabolism function in [IC]. Keywords: Fluorescence Microarray

DESIGN
18 intercaruncular samples, 18 caruncular Samples. Comparisons of cycle (d20) and pregnancy (d20).
