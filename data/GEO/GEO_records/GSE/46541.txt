TITLE
ChIP-chip of E. coli K-12 MG1655 with antibody against RNA polymerase subunits, RpoB, RpoD, RpoS,RpoH, RpoN, FliA, and FecI

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
We investigate sigma factor binding regions for each sigma factor under various enviromental and/or genetic conditions. To measure sigma factor binding at a genome scale, we employed a ChIP-chip method to derivative strains of  E. coli K-12 MG1655 wild type and its isogenic rpoS and rpoN knock-out strains under various conditions.

DESIGN
A 45 ChIP-chip study under 4 separate culture conditions.  The high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays used were consisted of 371,034 oligonucleotide probes spaced 25 bp apart (25-bp overlap between two probes) across the E. coli genome.
