TITLE
Identification of JMJD3 target genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose:To indentify downtream effectors of JMJD3, we performed microarray profiling in vector- or JMJD3-expressing A375-LM3 and those in freshly isolated melanoma cells from tumors formed by aforementioned cell lines Results: we identifed 31 genes whose expression increased in WT JMJD3 expression cells  at least by over 1.5-fold.

DESIGN
RNA profiling of JMJD3 expressing A375-LM3 and dissociated cells was analyzed by genome-wide microarray using Illuminabread chip TotalPrep RNA amplification Kit. Biotin labeled cDNA are hybridized with Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 Beadchips using Illumina standard protocol. The beadchips are scanned using Illumina HiScan scanner. The data is analyzed using Illumina GenomeStudio software (Framwork version: v2011.1, Gene Expression module version: 1.9.0).

PLATFORM
