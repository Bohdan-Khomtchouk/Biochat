TITLE
Early gene expression changes in peripheral blood leukocytes with rush immunotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from ficoll gradients of whole blood and immediately processed for total RNA and stored at -80oC until use. Blood was from allergic patients at different timepoints pre or post immunotherapy (RIT). Gene expression was compared for the different timepoints.
