TITLE
Genomic Characterization of Bladder Cancer Cell Lines using CGH Arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic rearrangements involving different chromosome translocation in bladder cancer cell lines and in primary tumor samples

DESIGN
DNA extracted from 3 Bladder Cancer Cell lines (SW1710, JON, RT-4), and 1 bladder cancer (372C) in T3 Tumor stage and Grade 3 primary  sample, were processed, Cy5 labeled and hybridized on Agilent CGH Arrays. As control DNA we used Cy3 labeled probes prepared starting from a pool of female DNA obtained mixing the DNA extracted from 20 healthy donors.
