TITLE
Expression data from PKM1 or PKM2 expressing mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled global gene expression for two separate lines of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and find that deletion of PKM2 and expression of PKM1 does not alter global gene expression profiles. We used microarrays to futher characterize the effects of PKM1 expression compared to PKM2 expression on global gene expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Primary mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Intensity files were RMA normalized using Affymetrix expression console.
