TITLE
Expression differences between inversions and their progenitors in Drosophila melanogaster embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Inversions have a breakpoint within a " neighbourhood " of embryonically expressed genes and the other breakpoint megabases away. The gene expression neighbourhood is therefore intact in the progenitor but disrupted in the inversion.

DESIGN
1 progenitor stock and 1 inversion stock, 4 biological replicates for each, including 2 dye swaps.
