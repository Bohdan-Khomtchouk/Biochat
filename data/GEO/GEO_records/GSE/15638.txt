TITLE
MEF wt versus Med23-/- KO after 20% Serum Stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix MOE430A arrays. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from E11 passaged through crisis. Starved in 0.5% FBS for 16 h then stimulated by 20% serum final concentration for 30 minutes. The purpose was to identify genes affected by the loss of MED23 protein (subunit of the mediator complex). Samples were assayed in duplicate (Set 1 and Set 2) for starved state and serum state cells.

DESIGN
Cells starved in low-serum (0.5%) for 16 h then add final conc. 20% FBS for 30 minutes. Harvest total RNA from duplicate samples. One sample set is kept starved and serves as the baseline. The other set is stimulated. This is done for both wild-type cell and the Med23-/- KO cells. We looked for gene expression fold changes greater than 2 (plus or minus) to find genes affected for serum stimulation by the loss of MED23, looking in detail at immediate early genes like Egr1.
