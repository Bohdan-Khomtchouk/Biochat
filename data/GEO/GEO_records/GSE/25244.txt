TITLE
Patterns of gene expression associated with temporal phases of S. aureus infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To acquire more information regarding the local immune events during the different phases of S. aureus infection, gene profiling using microarray technology was used to identify host genes whose expression is substantively altered in the kidneys during the acute (T2) and persistent phase of infection (T28). Genes associated with the distinct transcript profiles were identified by comparing the relative abundance of transcripts at 2 days (acute) and 28 days (persistent) of infection to their abundance in the kidneys of uninfected control animals (CTL). Keywords: gene expression

DESIGN
identification of host genes whose expression is substantively altered in the kidneys during the acute (T2) and persistent phase of infection (T28) compared to uninfected control (CTL).
