TITLE
Characterization of Drosophila mitochondrial transcripts through high throughput EST data

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila pseudoobscura

SUMMARY
We used high throughput EST sequences to characterize and generate expression profiles for all transcripts encoded in the mitochondrial genome of D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. Mapping of ESTs confirmed previously predicted transcripts and revealed non-canonical transcript structures. Expression of mitochondrial transcripts was not different between the two species, but it was significantly different for males and females. We also detected difference in expression levels among mRNAs from genes located in the same transcriptional unit and among genes interacting in the same protein complexes, NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase complexes, suggesting a complex post-transcriptional regulation to maintain mitochondrial function. Keywords: Transcriptome Analysis

DESIGN
Four samples analysed: D. melanogaster males, D. melanogaster females, D. pseuoobscura males, D. pseudoobscura females The number of reads that mapped to each transcript is proportional to the transcript abundance, so it can be used as a measure of the absolute level of expression of that transcript. The gene expression measure as the absolute EST counts and the expression relative to the library size for each mitochondrial gene in each library is displayed in the supplementary file linked below.
