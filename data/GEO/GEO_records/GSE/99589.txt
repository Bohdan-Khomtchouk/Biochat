TITLE
The Ino80 complex mediates epigenetic centromere propagation via active removal of histone H3

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Centromere is the chromosomal locus at which kinetochore is assembled to direct chromosome segregation. Histone H3 variant CENP-A epigenetically marks active centromeres; however, the mechanism by which CENP-A propagates at the centromere, replacing histone H3, remains poorly understood. Using fission yeast, we find that CENP-ACnp1 chromatin assembly at the centromere requires the Ino80 ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex which removes histone H3-containing nucleosomes from associated chromatin. CENP-ACnp1 chromatin actively recruits the Ino80 complex to centromeres to elicit eviction of histone H3-containing nucleosomes. Artificial targeting of Ino80 subunits to a non-centromeric DNA placed in a native centromere enhances the spreading of CENP-ACnp1 chromatin into the non-centromeric DNA. Based on these results, we propose that CENP-ACnp1 chromatin employs the Ino80 complex to mediate replacement of histone H3 with CENP-ACnp1, and thereby reinforces itself.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq samples of CENP-ACnp1, histone H3, Flag-tagged Ino80 subunits in wild type (wt) and various mutants were prepared using fission yeast.
