TITLE
Single cell RNA Seq data of BMDM from mouse infected with Salmonella [dilution; CEL-Seq2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
The interaction between a pathogen and a host is a highly dynamic process in which both agents activate complex programs. Here, we introduce a single-cell RNA-Seq method (scDual-Seq) that simultaneously captures both host and pathogen transcriptomes and use it to study the process of infection of individual mouse macrophages with the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Among the infected macrophages, we found three subpopulations and we show evidence for a linear progression through these subpopulations, supporting a model in which these three states correspond to consecutive stages of infection.

DESIGN
a dilution series of mouse and salmonella RNA Please note that the samples are identical to GSM2729237-GSM2729241 and the RNA was extracted simultaneously. The only difference between them is the different protocol by which the libraries were made for sequencing (i.e. CEL-Seq2 or scDual-Seq).
