TITLE
Mesothelioma tumor aCGH profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPMs) often show CDKN2A and NF2 inactivation but other highly recurrent mutations have not been described. To identify additional driver genes, we used an integrated genomic analysis of 53 MPM tumor samples to guide a focused sequencing effort that uncovered somatic inactivating mutations in BAP1 in 23% of MPM. The BAP1 nuclear deubiquitinase is known to target histones (together with ASXL1 as a Polycomb repressor subunit) and the HCF1 transcriptional co-factor, and we show that BAP1 knockdown in MPM cell lines affects E2F and Polycomb target genes. These findings implicate transcriptional deregulation in the pathogenesis of MPM.

DESIGN
DNA from 53 malignant pleural mesothelioma tumors was collected and hybridized to aCGH arrays.  Data were analyzed to create gain and loss profiles for each tumor. This submission includes gcNormalized-data.
