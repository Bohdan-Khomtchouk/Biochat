TITLE
Combinatorial effects of microRNA to suppress the myc oncogenic pathway (miRNA data)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA importance in the myc pathway in Burkitt lymphoma.

DESIGN
MicroRNA data from the Agilent human miRNA platform. 12 Burkitt lymphomas were compared with 14 non-tumoral controls (lymph nodes, tonsils and CD19+CD10+ sorted cells). Significantly deregulated miRNAs were computed using the Significant Analysis of Microarray (SAM) analysis from the TM4 pathway and the limma package.
