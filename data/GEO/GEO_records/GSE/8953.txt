TITLE
Investigations of the effects of subMIC antibiotics on the P. aeruginosa transcriptome

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Antibiotics in low concentrations may have an array of effects. We have exposed growing P. aeruginosa cells to different classes of antibiotics in order to investigate this hypothesis. We have used DNA microarrays to investigate the effect of low concentrations of antibiotics (azithromycin, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin) on the gene expression of P. aeruginosa aiming to elucidate general trends. Keywords: Treatment with antibiotics
