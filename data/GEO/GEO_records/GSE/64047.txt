TITLE
mTORC1 regulates microRNA biogenesis in Hela cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mTOR senses nutrient and energy status to regulate cell survival and metabolism in response to environmental changes.  Surprisingly, targeted mutation of Tsc1, a negative regulator of mTORC1, caused a broad reduction in miRNAs due to Drosha degradation.  Conversely, targeted mutation of Raptor, an essential component of mTORC 1, increased miRNA biogenesis.  mTOR activation increased expression of Mdm2, which is hereby identified as the necessary and sufficient ubiquitin E3 ligase for Drosha.  Drosha was induced by nutrient and energy deprivation and conferred resistance to glucose deprivation.  Using a high throughput screen of a miRNA library, we identified 4 miRNAs that were necessary and sufficient to protect cells against glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis.  These miRNA was regulated by glucose through the mTORC1-MDM2- Drosha axis.  Taken together, our data reveal an mTOR-Mdm2-Drosha pathway in mammalian cells that broadly regulates miRNA biogenesis as a response to alteration in cellular environment. Knockdown of DROSHA or TSC1 caused a global decrease in both miRNA and pre-miRNA in Hela stable cell lines.

DESIGN
To determine whether TSC1 regulates miRNA accumulation in human cells, we used shRNAs to silence TSC1 in HeLa cells and then compare the general profile of miRNA and pre-miRNA in Hela cells. We also used shRNAs against DROSHA as a positive control.
