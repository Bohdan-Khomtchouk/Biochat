TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of histone H3K4me3, H3K27Ac and RNA polymerase II (RNApol II) in HuH-7 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The RNA-seq profile of the novel LIN28B variant suggested an alternative transcription initiation (ATI) site approximately 20 kb upstream of LIN28B-WT. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed significant enrichment of histone H3K4me3, H3K27Ac and RNA polymerase II (RNApol II) near the ATI site.

DESIGN
Examination of histone H3K4me3, H3K27Ac and RNA polymerase II (RNApol II) in HuH-7 cells.
