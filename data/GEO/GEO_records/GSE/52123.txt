TITLE
Reinstatement of developmental stage-specific GATA4 enhancers controls the gene expression program in heart disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Through integration of GATA4 genome-wide occupancy and RNA-seq dataset in embryonic conditional knockout heart, we identified a class of the master cardiac regulator GATA4 bound enhancers. With combinatorial assembly of chromatin signatures, we further refined that a unique type of fetal distal GATA4 enhancers enriched for H3K27ac, H3K4me1, but not for H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II, are reinstated in adult hypertrophic heart.

DESIGN
Study Gata4 and histone modifications in E12.5, Adult, Banding and Sham, and to correlate to gene expression and heart function

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
