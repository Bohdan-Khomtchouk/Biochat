TITLE
Deep Sequencing identifies regulated small RNAs in Dugesia japonica

ORGANISM
Dugesia japonica

SUMMARY
We applied Illumina sequencing to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) and piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) in Dugesia japonica. Dugesia were cut up after seven day’s starvation. DJ1 is the whole Dugesia body, DJ2 is the head part, DJ3 is the tail part, DJ4 is the left part and DJ5 is the right part. Total RNA was extracted by Trizol, and preserved in ethanol, stored at -80°C until further use.

DESIGN
5 samples examined：DJ1,DJ2,DJ3,DJ4,DJ5. SRA study (not submitted by GEO): SRP017693
