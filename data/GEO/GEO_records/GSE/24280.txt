TITLE
Transcriptome analysis in Human leprosy patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Leprosy is classified from paucibacillary leprosy (TT and BT) to multibacillary leprosy (BB, BL, and LL). In our study, we focus on selecting or classfying the significant genes to discriminate between paucibacillary and multibacillary group  and the important genes to distinguish between blood and the corresponding tissue in patients.

DESIGN
· Human Adult Normal Skin Sample (Commercial;Cat#1234218); 6 patients of leprosy (Blood and Tissue sample (Pathologic classification: BT); 6 patients of leprosy (Blood and Tissue sample (Pathologic classification: MB)) · In blood sample, BT sample vs MB sample · In tissue sample, Normal Skin sample vs tissue BT sample or tissue MB sample · Single Color Microarray · All experiments are performed one replicate
