TITLE
Murine small intestinal crypt cell line IEC-6: control vs. TGF-beta stimulated

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
microRNA profiling of rat small intestinal crypt cell IEC-6. Comparing control untreated with cells treated with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). TGF-beta stimulated cell differentiation, as observed in the stimulation of intestinal epithelial cell markers (alkaline phophotase, villin, aminopeptidase N, etc.).

DESIGN
Two condition experiment. Control vs TGF-beta treatment. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 treated. Independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array

PLATFORM
GPL7723 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, v.11.0 - hsa, mmu & rno
