TITLE
Gene expression profiles of the aerenchy maformation in maize using laser microdissection

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
To adapt to waterlogging in soil, some gramineous plants, such as maize (Zea mays), form lysigenous aerenchyma in the root cortex. Ethylene, which is accumulated during waterlogging, promotes aerenchyma formation.  Aerencyma is formedonly in cortex in maise root. Therevore, aerenchyma is one of the model of programmed cell death. However, the molecular mechanism of aerenchyma formation is not understood. Therefore we isolated only cortex cells in maize primary root using laser microdissection. And microarray analysis was perforemed to identify the arechyma formation related genes. For  microarray analysis, we designed 4 different experiments. Basal part and apical part of root were used for 1st experiment because arenchyma was formed in basal part of root, but not in apex. In second experiment, basal part of root with 6 hours waterlogged treatment  and without treatment were used. And, as aerenchyma was induced by ethylene,  ethylene and 1-MCP (inhibitor of ethylen perception) were used for experiment3 and 4.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis in 4 kinds of samples (cortex in basal reagion of maize primary root which were treated with waterlogged condition, aerobic condition, ethylene and 1-MCP and cortex in apical reagion of maize primary root which were treated with waterlogged conditio)
