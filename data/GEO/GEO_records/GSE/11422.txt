TITLE
Genes differentially expressed upon CHD8 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CHD8 is a putative chromatin remodeling ATPase of the SNF2 family. We found that depletion of CHD8 impairs cell proliferation. In order to identify CHD8 target genes, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of CHD8-depleted cells. CHD8 was knockdown by doxycyclin-dependent expression of a shRNA that target the CHD8 mRNA. Keywords: CHD8 knockdown analysis
