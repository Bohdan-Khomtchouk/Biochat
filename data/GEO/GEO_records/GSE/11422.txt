TITLE
Genes differentially expressed upon CHD8 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CHD8 is a putative chromatin remodeling ATPase of the SNF2 family. We found that depletion of CHD8 impairs cell proliferation. In order to identify CHD8 target genes, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of CHD8-depleted cells. CHD8 was knockdown by doxycyclin-dependent expression of a shRNA that target the CHD8 mRNA. Keywords: CHD8 knockdown analysis

DESIGN
C33KD2 is a stable cell line where expression of a shRNA, that targets the CHD8 mRNA, is dependent on doxycycline. Addition of doxyclycin provokes a significant reduction in the level of CHD8 protein. Total RNA samples coming from C33KD2 cells cultured for 48 hours either with or without 2 Âµg/ml doxycycline were used to generate complementary RNA labelled with Cy5 with the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies). The reference sample was Stratagene human universal reference and was amplified at the same time as the sample RNA using the same method. Reference samples were labeled using Cy3.
