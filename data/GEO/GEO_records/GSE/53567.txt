TITLE
Enhancers implicate new genes in QT interval below GWAS detection threshold

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our goal is to identify high-confidence candidate genes associated with sub-threshold QT interval loci. We predicted enhancer-promoter targets using two different methods.

DESIGN
1) We used the correlation in activity between enhancers and transcribed genes across 59 human cell lines and tissues to identify significantly correlated enhancer-promoter pairs that represent potential regulatory interactions. 2) We used chromosome conformation capture followed by high-throughput sequencing (4C-seq) to probe physical enhancer-promoter interactions.
