TITLE
RNA-seq of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings expressing the Pseudomonas syringae effector HopBB1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study evaluates the transcriptome of transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing the effector HopBB1 from the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown under short day conditions (9h of light at 21°C - 15h of dark at 18°C) for two weeks. Samples were harvested in the beginning of the light period and used for RNA extraction and Illumina sequencing. Lines Col-0 (3 replicates) and 35S::HopBB1-10 (3 replicates) were used in the experiment. Each replicate corresponds to approximately 30 seedlings grown in the same pot.
