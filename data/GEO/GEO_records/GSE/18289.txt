TITLE
Expression data from Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (antibiotic sensitive) and ATCC 33591 (MRSA)

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
S. aureus ATCC 25923 is performance standard for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. S. aureus ATCC 33591 showed resistance against erytrhromycin, penicillin, and streptomycin. We used microarray to compare RNA expression between sensitive and resistant strain of S. aureus as a preliminary research for MRSA inhibition.

DESIGN
S. aureus strains were cultivated in tryptic soy broth at 37â„ƒ for 18hrs and harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL1339 [S_aureus] Affymetrix S. aureus Genome Array
