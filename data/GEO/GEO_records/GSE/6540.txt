TITLE
Expression data from olfactory epithelium of Lip-C-treated mice compared to Lip-O-treated control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of gene expression in the olfactory epithelium of macrophage depleted mice to study the role of macrophages in regulating neurodegeneration, neuroprotection, and neurogenesis of olfactory sensory neurons Keywords: comparison of gene expression level in sham and 48 hr OBX Lip-O mice versus Lip-C mice

DESIGN
Olfactory epithelium from LIp-C-treated and Lip-O-treated mice was microdissected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We compared levels of gene expression in macrophage-depleted and non-depleted sham and 48 hr OBX mice using a 2x2 ANOVA and pairwise comparisons to identify molecular mechanisms of macrophage-mediated neurodegeneration, neuroprotection, and neurogenesis and to validate the gene expression patterns using real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry
