TITLE
Rapid neurogenesis through transcriptional activation in human stem cell (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Advances in cellular reprogramming and stem cell differentiation now enable ex vivo studies of human neuronal differentiation. However, it remains challenging to elucidate the underlying regulatory programs because differentiation protocols are laborious and often result in low neuron yields. Here, we overexpressed two murine Neurogenin transcription factors in human induced pluripotent stem cells, and obtained neurons with bipolar morphology in four days at greater than 90% purity. The high purity enabled mRNA and microRNA expression profiling during neurogenesis, thus revealing the genetic programs involved in the transition from stem cell to neuron. These profiles were then analyzed to identify the regulatory networks underlying the differentiation of the neurons.

DESIGN
Paired end RNA sequencing of iPS cells (PGP1) at 0, 1, 3, and 4 days post- doxycycline induction of murine NGN1 and NGN2. This was done using an Illumina HiSeq, and reads were aligned to hg19

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
