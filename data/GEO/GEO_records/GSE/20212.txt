TITLE
Comparison of the CcpA and CovR Transcriptomes in Group A Streptococcus

ORGANISM
Streptococcus sp. 'group A'

SUMMARY
The goal of this study were to compare the transcriptoms of CcpA and CovR in group A Streptococcus.  Isogenic mutant strains were created in which CcpA and CovR were inactivated alone and in combination.  The transcriptomes of the four strains (wild-type, CcpA mutant, CovR mutant, and ccpA-covR double mutant) were then compared.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates of each strain were grown to the mid-exponential and stationary phases of growth in THY.  Cells were harvested, RNA isolated, and converted to cDNA.  cDNA was hybridized to a custom-made Affymetrix GeneChip that contains 100% of the ORFs of the wild-type strain MGAS2221.
