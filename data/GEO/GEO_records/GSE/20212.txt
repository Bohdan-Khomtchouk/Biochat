TITLE
Comparison of the CcpA and CovR Transcriptomes in Group A Streptococcus

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
The goal of this study were to compare the transcriptoms of CcpA and CovR in group A Streptococcus.  Isogenic mutant strains were created in which CcpA and CovR were inactivated alone and in combination.  The transcriptomes of the four strains (wild-type, CcpA mutant, CovR mutant, and ccpA-covR double mutant) were then compared.
