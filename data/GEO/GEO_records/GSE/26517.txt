TITLE
Detecting transcription profile associated to mammosphere medium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammosphere medium (Grange et al. Neoplasia 2008;10(12):1433-43) contains epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) that may influence transcript expression in a way not necessarily related to the assembly of mammspheres. To identify the set of genes associated mammosphere cell growth medium we analyzed two prototypic situations in triplicate experiments: TUBO cells (a mouse breast cancer cell line derived by Balb-neuT mice) grown in DMEM under adherent conditions (TDA), TUBO cells grown in Mammosphere medium under adherent conditions (TMA).

DESIGN
Two prototypic situations in triplicate experiments were analysed: TUBO cells (Rovero et al. Gene Ther 2001;8(6):447-52) grown in DMEM under adherent conditions (TDA), TUBO cells grown in Mammosphere medium under adherent conditions (TMA).
