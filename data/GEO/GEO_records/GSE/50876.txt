TITLE
SNP microarry analysis of primary and first recurrent pediatric ependymoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared genomic characteristics of primary and first recurrent pediatric ependymoma to identify sub-group specific differences.

DESIGN
We investigated 11 matched pairs of primary and first recurrent pediatric ependymoma using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 SNP microarray. Seven of these were paired with matched reference blood DNA and analyzed.  Primary samples are denoted by _1; first recurrent samples are denoted by _2; germline DNA is denoted by _G.
