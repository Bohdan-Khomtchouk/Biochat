TITLE
Ror2 gene expression analysis in renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumors express varying gene profiles, dependent on varying genetic events. Here we analyzed a series of RCC tumors for Ror2 expression, in relation to overal gene expression profiles. Keywords: Patient sample study

DESIGN
RNA from 27 RCC tumors was hybridized against the Perou lab RNA standard for gene expression analysis.
