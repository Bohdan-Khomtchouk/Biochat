TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Arabidopsis floral homeotic mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles of inflorescences of the floral homeotic mutants apetala1, apetala2, apetala3, pistillata, and agamous were compared to  wild-type inflorescences using a flower-specific  cDNA array (GSM21001-21015) and a " whole-genome " oligonucleotide array (Operon) (GSM21016-21035). All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
