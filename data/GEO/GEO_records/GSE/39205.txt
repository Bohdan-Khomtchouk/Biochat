TITLE
Gene-expression profiles of PD-L1-affected CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) is known to suppress immune system and to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the function of PD-L1 in peritoneal dissemination. Tumor cell lysis by CTLs was attenuated when PD-L1 on tumor cells was overexpressed and promoted when it was silenced. PD-L1 overexpression also inhibited gathering and degranulation of CTLs. Gene expression profile of mouse CTLs caused by PD-L1-overexpressing ovarian cancer was related to human CTLs exhaustion. In mouse ovarian cancer dissemination models, depleting PD-L1 expression on tumor cells resulted in inhibited tumor growth in the peritoneal cavity and prolonged survival. Restoring immune function by inhibiting immune-suppressive factors such as PD-L1 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for peritoneal dissemination.

DESIGN
Genome-wide transcriptional changes in OT-1 mouse CD8+ T cells that were co-incubated with OVA peptide-loaded ID8 mouse ovarian cancer cell lines. CTLs from 4 mice were devided into 2 groups, and co-incubated with PD-L1-overexpressed ID8 or PD-L1-depleted ID8.
