TITLE
Expression data from laser captured gastric neck cells and zymogenic cell from wild type and MIST1 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MIST1 is a bHLH transcription factor that is necessary for the maturation of gastric zymogenic cells as they differentiate from their precursor mucous neck cells. In this experiment, mucous neck cells and zymogenic cells of normal, adult C57BL/6 and MIST1 knockout mice were laser-capture microdissected in order to determine MIST1-dependent, zymogenic cell specific gene expression.

DESIGN
Stomachs were excised immediately following sacrifice, quickly flushed with room-temperature PBS, inflated by duodenal injection of OCT compound, frozen in Cytocool II, and cut into serial 7-μm-thick cryosections, which were mounted on Superfrost slides, fixed in 70% EtOH, rehydrated in nuclease-free water, and then incubated in Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Griffonia simplicifolia GS-II (diluted 1:500 in nuclease-free water) for 15 min. Sections were washed in nuclease-free water and dehydrated in graded ethanol followed by xylene. ZCs were identified as corpus cells that were basal to GS-II labeling and which did not show the dark silhouettes and characteristic shape of parietal cells following xylene dehydration. Four wild-type mice and 5 Mist1−/− mice were used for dissection (PixCell II LCM apparatus [7.5-μm spot diameter] and CapSure HS LCM caps) to generate two caps per mouse. RNA was purified by PicoPure kit, and RNA integrity was confirmed by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. All RNA from each cap was treated with DNase I and then reverse transcribed using the SuperScript III (Invitrogen) standard protocol (most cDNA syntheses started with 10 ng of total RNA). Biotinylated cRNA probes were hybridized to the GeneChips. Gene chip arrays used in these experiments were Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0ST arrays. Chip quality control and GeneChip to GeneChip comparisons to generate expression profiles were performed using dChip.
