TITLE
Runx3 function in CD8+ splenic T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD8+T cells are immune cells that recognize foreign antigens on infected and tumor cells, leading to cytokine-dependent expansion and activation of cytotoxicity towards the targets.

DESIGN
To identify Runx3 responsive genes, CD8+ T cells were isolated from spleen of WT and Runx3-/- mice . Six samples (3 WT and 3 Runx3-/-)  of freshly isolated CD8+ T cells (resting) were separately obtained from individual mice.
