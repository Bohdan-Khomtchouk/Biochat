TITLE
siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sp3 induces a pro-inflammatory pattern of cytokine production: relevance to MS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and is generally considered to be autoimmune in nature. We previously demonstrated that the transcription factor Sp3 is significantly down-regulated in immune cells from MS patients. The potential role of Sp3 down-regulation in MS pathogenesis is not well understood. The function of endogenous Sp3 was assessed in vitro after siRNA-mediated knockdown of its transcript in Jurkat cells. Sp3 protein levels were reduced an average of 70%. ELISA studies demonstrated decreased endogenous production of IL-10 and TGFβ1 and increased endogenous production of TNFα (p < 0.05 in all assays).  Subsequent microarray analysis demonstrated significantly altered expression of 36 genes (p < 0.001 for each gene) compared with control samples. Analysis showed differential expression (p < 0.005) of 8 gene pathways.  Many of the genes and pathways that were regulated by Sp3 are involved in immune function, specifically with regard to apoptosis, cell-to-cell adhesion, integrin signaling, T-cell differentiation, and cytokine production. This study identifies mechanisms by which Sp3 may regulate immune function and suggests a basis for its potential contribution to MS disease pathogenesis. Keywords: siRNA knockdown; Jurkat T-cells; Multiple Sclerosis

DESIGN
Two Sp3 siRNA knockdown groups (siRNA Sp3 #2: n=3, and #6: n=3) were clustered together into the Treated condition, and the two control groups (siRNA for GAPDH: n=3, and Non-transfected cells: n=3)were assembled to constitute the Control condition.  Thus a total of 12 arrays (6 Controls and 6 treated) were used in this experiment.
