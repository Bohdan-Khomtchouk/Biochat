TITLE
Analysis of early dendritic cell, natural killer cell and B lymphocyte responses to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection by genome-wide expression profiling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DCs) are a complex group of cells which play a critical role in vertebrate immunity. They are subdivided into conventional DC (cDC) subsets (CD11b and CD8alpha in mouse) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Natural killer cells are innate lymphocytes involved in the recognition and killing of abnormal self cells, including virally infected cells or tumor cells. DCs and NK cells are activated very early upon viral infections and regulate one another. However, the global responses of DC and NK cells early after viral infection in vivo and their molecular regulation are not entirely characterized. The goal of this experiment was to use global gene expression profiling to assess the global genetic reprogramming of DC and NK cells during a viral infection in vivo, as compared to B lymphocytes, and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms This study includes data from cell sort purified DCs, NK cells and B cells isolated from the spleen of MCMV-infected mice. 2 independent replicates were made for each cell type except B cells. The control dataset for cells isolated from uninfected control animals has been previously published and is available in the GEO database as GSE9810. The complete dataset representing: (1) the infected Samples and (2) the uninfected control Samples from Series GSE9810 (re-processed using RMA), is linked below as a supplementary file.
