TITLE
Identification of long non coding RNAs associated with self-renewal capacity of rat neural stem cells exposed to sevoflurane

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To identify the differential porfile of long non coding RNAs in neural stem cells exposed to sevoflurane compared with control gas(21% oxygen,5%CO2,),We employed the rat long non-coding RNA array as a discovery platform to identify genes with potential to regulate self-renewal capacity of  rat neural stem cells exposed to sevoflurane.

DESIGN
Sevoflurane exposure induced gene expression in cultrued neural stem cells derived from hippocampus was detected at 6 hours  after exposure to 2.4%sevoflurane or control gas.Two different independent experiments were performed at 6 hours using tow samples of cultrued neural stem cells with exposure to sevoflurane or control gas.

PLATFORM
GPL15690 Arraystar Rat LncRNA microarray (026403)
