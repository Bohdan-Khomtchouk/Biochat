TITLE
Expression data from adult rat subventricular zone cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß1 is a multifunctional cytokine regulating a number of physiological and patho-physiological processes in the adult brain. Its expression is elevated during neurodegeneration, which is associated with reduced levels of neurogenesis. We have postulated that TGF-ß1 might be one of the crucial factors involved in limiting neurogenesis in the diseased brain. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression profile after TGFbeta-1 treatment  and identified distinct classes of up- and downregulated genes. Keywords: control versus TGFbeta1 treated group

DESIGN
Adult rat subventricular zone cells were cultured for 7 days under proliferation conditions. Control cells were exposed to HCl/BSA whereas TGFbeta-1 treated cells received 10 ng/ml TGFbeta-1 dissolved in HCl/BSA 3 times per week. RNA was extracted followed by hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
