TITLE
Genome-wide occupancy profile of Tbx3, Gata4, Nkx2-5 and p300 in adult mouse whole heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The contraction pattern of the heart relies on the activation and conduction of the electrical impulse. Perturbations of cardiac conduction have been associated with congenital and acquired arrhythmias as well as cardiac arrest. The pattern of conduction depends on the regulation of heterogeneous gene expression by key transcription factors and transcriptional enhancers. Here, we assessed the genome-wide occupation of conduction systemâ€“regulating transcription factors TBX3, NKX2-5, and GATA4 and of enhancer-associated coactivator p300 in the mouse heart, uncovering cardiac enhancers throughout the genome.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 cardiac transcription factors and p300 in adult mouse heart
