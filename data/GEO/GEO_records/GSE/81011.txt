TITLE
Expression data from fetal sheep immunocytes

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Study investigating the initiation of systemic inflammatory signaling in fetuses exposed to TLR-4 agonist lipopolysaccharides from E.coli. Microarray was used to determine the inflammatory transcriptome in circulating fetal immunocytes.

DESIGN
Fetal sheep at 92d GA were catheterised prior to intra-amniotic exposure of saline or lipopolysaccharides for 48h prior to euthanasia.
