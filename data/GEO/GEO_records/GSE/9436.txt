TITLE
Response of L. lactis faced to S. cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis

SUMMARY
The response of L. lactis to the presence of S. cerevisiae was analyzed during the exponential growth phase in fermentors in defined growth conditions. Although no growth kinetic difference was observed between the pure and mixed culture of L. lactis, the mRNA level of genes was significantly modified. More particularly, a strong reorientation of pyrimidine metabolism was observed when L. lactis was grown in the mixed culture. Keywords: microbial interaction, time course
