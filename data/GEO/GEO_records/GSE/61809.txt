TITLE
transcriptome and translatome of arabidopsis wt seeds according to dormancy-transcriptomic and translatomic analysis of Arabidopsis seeds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au13-12_polysome - transcriptome and translatome of arabidopsis wt seeds according to dormancy - Identification of transcripts that are differentially abundant (transcriptome) and transcripts that are addressed to translation (translatome) in imbibed Arabidopsis seeds in relation with dormancy. During imbibition of seeds (16h and 24h in darkness at 25°C, dormant and non-dormant seeds), transcriptome analysis is done on total RNA and translatome analysis on polysomal RNA. - At harvest seeds are dormant. They stay dormant if they are stored at -20°C (D) and become non-dormant (ND) if they are stored 3 weeks at +20°C. Arabidopsis dormant seeds do not germinate at 25°C in darkness while non-dormant seeds do. Total RNA and polysomal RNA (polysomal fractions purified on sucrose gradients) were extracted from imbibed seeds for 16h or 24h at 25°C in darkness (3 biological replicates). Transcriptome and translatome are compared for Dormant vs Non-Dormant for 16h and 24 imbibition. In silico comparison will allow to compare transcriptome and translatome for each point and type of seeds and to compare the time points (16 vs 24h) for each type of sample.
