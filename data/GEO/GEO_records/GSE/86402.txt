TITLE
DNA methylation in human DIP2C knockout cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aim: The disco-interacting protein 2 homolog C (DIP2C) gene is an uncharacterized gene found mutated in breast and lung cancers. We want to understand the role of DIP2C in tumor development.   Methods: We engineered human DIP2C knockout cell systems by genome editing, and studied these to identify cellular processes affected by gene knockout. We used the Illumina HumanMethylation 450k beadchip array to identify methylation sites affected by the loss of DIP2C.  Results: Inactivation of DIP2C triggered changes in cell morhpology, growth, gene expression and DNA methylation. Differential methylation at promoters was found inversly correlated with gene expression changes.

DESIGN
We engineered DIP2C knockout RKO colorectal cancer cells by rAAV-mediated gene targeting. Parental RKO cells, two homozygous knockout and two heterozygous knockout cell lines were analyzed using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450k beadchip array to investigate if DNA methylation patterns are altered in knockout cells.
