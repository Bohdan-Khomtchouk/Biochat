TITLE
RNA-seq of 8hr LPS-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild type, Ch25h-deficient, and LXRab knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
25-hydroxycholesterol has been demonstrated to regulate SREBP processing, yet Ch25h-deficient mice have no cholesterol abnormalities.  Using RNA-seq, we find that LPS-stimulated, Ch25h-deficient BMDMs have dysregulated SREBP target genes, demonstrating that 25-hydroxycholesterol is an induced repressor of SREBP during inflammatory settings.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from day 7 M-CSF bone marrow-derived macrophages (wild type, Ch25h-knockout, LXR-double knockout, were generated by deep sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.  Sequence reads passing a quality filter were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using STAR.

PLATFORM
