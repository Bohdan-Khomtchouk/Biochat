TITLE
microRNA expression in LKS hematopoietic progenitors vs. total bone marrow

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Agilent chip was used to measure microRNA expression in the Lin- cKit+ Sca1+ bone marrow compartment and in total bone marrow.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated by miRNeasy (Qiagen) from 1) Lin-cKit+Sca1+ cells, isolated from bone marrow using MACS column purification followed by fluorescent cell sorting, and 2) total Bone Marrow. Agilent microRNA microarray was run on these two samples.

PLATFORM
