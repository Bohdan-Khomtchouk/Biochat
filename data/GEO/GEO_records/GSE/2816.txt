TITLE
cMyb and vMyb in human monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptional activities of c-Myb and its oncogenic variant v-Myb were compared by expressing them in primary human monocytes using recombinant adenovirus vectors. All the samples were compared to cells infected with a control adenovirus expressing only GFP.  The results showed that v-Myb, which differs from c-Myb only by N- and C-terminal deletions and eleven amino acid substitutions, has a qualitatively different transcriptional activity. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
2 replicates of each type were analyzed. Replicates were performed independently, more than a week apart.
