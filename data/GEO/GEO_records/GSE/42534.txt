TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the effects of propranolol on angiosarcoma tumor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of 4 hr and 24 hr propranolol treatment on gene expression of SVR mouse angiosarcoma cells. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that inhibiton of beta adrenergic receptor signaling could ablate the oncogenic properties of angiosarcoma cells. Results provide important information of the response of angiosarcoma cells to ablated beta adrenergic receptor signaling.

DESIGN
The total RNA was obtained from mouse angiosarcoma cells cultured in monolayer at 0, 4, and 24 hrs of 50 micromolar propranolol treatment.  Illumina microarrays were performed to determine the whole genome expression changes following treatment.
