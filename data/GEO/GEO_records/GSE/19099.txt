TITLE
Global gene expression profile of stomach from wild-type and NHE4-knockout mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression levels between wild-type and NHE4-knockout stomach.

DESIGN
6 wild-type and 6 NHE4-knockout stomach RNA samples were compared.  Total RNA was collected from both male and female adult (between 8 and 12 weeks of age) wild-type and NHE4-null mice on a mixed 129 Black Swiss background. With the exception of one, all comparisons were done between wild-type and NHE4-null samples from littermate age- and gender-matched siblings.
