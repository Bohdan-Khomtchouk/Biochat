TITLE
Global Transcript Profiles of Maize Seedling Roots in the Presence and Absence of Nitrate

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
The following study was conducted to better understand the genetic response of maize roots to nitrate availability. To do so, an array was designed and created by the Plant Sciences Institute at Iowa State University. This custom array contained 7,888 informative spots of cDNA obtained from NSF Plant Genome EST projects led by Ginny Walbot and Pat Schnable. RNA was collected from root tissue at two time points: 30 minutes and 24 hours. At each time point, transcript profiles were compared between root tissues treated with 5mM calcium nitrate and controls treated with 5mM calcium sulfate. Keywords: Nutrient response in maize roots

DESIGN
For each comparison, 6 replicates and multiple power settings were considered. Dye-swaps were performed between replicates.
