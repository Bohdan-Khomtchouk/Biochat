TITLE
Expression data from keratinocytes of WT and RASSF9-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice with deficient expression of RASSF9 exhibit intriguing phenotypes of skin-related pathology, including abnormal thickening of the epidermis, dysregulated proliferation of keratinocytes, and alopecia. To delineate the underlying mechanism, we profiled gene expression in keratinocytes of RASSF9-mutant mice to identify targets whose expressions were affected by RASSF9 gene deletion.

DESIGN
Primary keratinocytes from neonatal ICR mice of wildtype control (WT) or homozygous RASSF9 deletion (RASSF9-/-) were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. For WT, a single microarray hybridization was performed. For RASSF9-/-, one hybridization was performed for each of two independent samples.
