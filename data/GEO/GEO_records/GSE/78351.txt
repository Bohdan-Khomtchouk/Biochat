TITLE
small RNA-seq from smooth muscle cell (ENCSR250STJ)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from H9-derived embryonic stem cells that were differentiated down a smooth muscle pathway. They are stranded SE101 length Hi-Seq reads from rRNA-depleted Total RNA < 200 nucleotides in size that was pretreated with Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase prior to cloning.
