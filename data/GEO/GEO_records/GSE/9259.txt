TITLE
PrV/PK15 kinetics_QiagenNRSP8 slides

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To study in vitro the epithelial cells and PrV interactions during infection, we followed PrV and PK15 cells transcriptome modifications during time-course infection (I) and mock-infection (MI). Four time points were studied: 1h, 2h, 4h and 8h post-I and MI. Four replicates of I and MI were analysed. Keywords: Pig, PrV, Pk15 cells, kinetics

DESIGN
32 samples - The hybridization scheme which can be define as dye-switch was chosen. A balanced loop design with two independent loops, each loop containing 2 replicates of PrV infection and MI, was used. In total, 32 slides were used in this experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL1881 Qiagen-NRSP-8 porcine oligo array
