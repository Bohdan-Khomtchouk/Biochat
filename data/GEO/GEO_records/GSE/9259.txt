SUMMARY
To study in vitro the epithelial cells and PrV interactions during infection, we followed PrV and PK15 cells transcriptome modifications during time-course infection (I) and mock-infection (MI). Four time points were studied: 1h, 2h, 4h and 8h post-I and MI. Four replicates of I and MI were analysed. Keywords: Pig, PrV, Pk15 cells, kinetics
