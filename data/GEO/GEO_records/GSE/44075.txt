TITLE
Sperm but not oocyte DNA methylome is inherited by zebrafish early embyros

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
5-methylcytosine is a major epigenetic modification sometimes called " the fifth nucleotide " . However, our knowledge of how offspring inherit the DNA methylome from parents is limited. We generated nine single-base resolution DNA methylomes including zebrafish gametes and early embryos. The oocyte methylome is significantly hypo-methylated compared to sperm. Strikingly, the paternal DNA methylation pattern is maintained throughout early embryogenesis. The maternal DNA methylation pattern is maintained until the 16-cell stage. Then, the oocyte methylome is gradually discarded through cell division, and progressively reprogrammed to a pattern similar to that of the sperm methylome. The passive demethylation rate and the de novo methylation rate are similar in the maternal DNA. By the midblastula stage, the embryo?s methylome is virtually identical to the sperm methylome. Moreover, inheritance of the sperm methylome facilitates the epigenetic regulation of embryogenesis. Therefore, besides DNA sequences, sperm DNA methylome is also inherited in zebrafish early embryos.

DESIGN
hMeDIP-seq is performed in sperm,2-cell,16-cell,1k-cell and a input control sample 4 new samples are added to GSE44075. RNA-seq is performed in sperm, egg,1k-cell, germring samples .hMeDIP-seq is performed in sperm,2-cell,16-cell,1k-cell and a input control sample 10 new samples are added to GSE44075. Bisulfite-seq is performed for nine samples : sperm, egg,16-cell,32-cell,64-cell,128-cell,1k-cell , Germring and testis. TAB-seq is performed for one sample , 32-cell.
