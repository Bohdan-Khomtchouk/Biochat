TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (Progenika oligo array data)

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida KT2440

SUMMARY
We used Progenika oligonucleotide arrays to monitore the gene expression of P. putida after a cold shock from 30째C to 10째C

DESIGN
Culture was grown in minimal medium supplemented with succinate at 30째C. In mid-exp. phase cells were harvested for subsequent RNA extraction (standard condition) and medium was cooled down to 10째C. Two hrs after reaching the temperature, cells were again harvested for RNA extraction. Data from four replicate hybridizations (two dye-swaps) were combined into a single ratio value. Individual normalized signal intensity VALUES for each channel of each array are provided in the FullNormalizedMatrix.txt file available on the Series record.
