TITLE
Rapid Identification of Bacterial Pathogens using a PCR- and Microarray-Based Assay

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; unidentified

SUMMARY
A method based on a modified broad-range PCR and an oligonucleotide microarray for the simultaneous detection and identification of 12 bacterial pathogens at the species level.

DESIGN
The feasibility of this assay in routine diagnostic testing was evaluated using 146 blood culture positive and 40 blood culture negative samples. The processed data are composed of ORGANISM NAME or NEGATIVE answer depending if the pathogen is detected in the sample or not.  See supplementary file linked below.
