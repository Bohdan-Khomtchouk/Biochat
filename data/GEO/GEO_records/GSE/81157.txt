TITLE
Biased Expression of the FOXP3Δ3 Isoform in Aggressive Bladder Cancer Mediates Differentiation and Cisplatin Chemotherapy Resistance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study shows for the first time that the FOXP3Δ3 isoform is preferentially expressed in bladder cancer and induces a more aggressive and luminal isoform is preferentially expressed in bladder cancer and induces a more aggressive and luminal regulation of cancer differentiation and the plasticity amongst cancer subtypes which can be leveraged to optimize therapeutic regimens. These findings also identify a novel molecular marker as a putative companion diagnostic to guide therapy and target to undermine chemotherapy resistance.
