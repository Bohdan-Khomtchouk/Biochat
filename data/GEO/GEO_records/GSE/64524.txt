TITLE
Expression data from pancreatic beta cells isolated from differentially weaned mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis reveals that in pancreatic beta cells weaning increases the expression of genes involved in replication licensing, suggesting a mechanism to increased responsiveness to the mitogenic activity of high glucose.

DESIGN
Î² cells were sorted from dissociated islets of P25 insulin-Cre; Rosa26-LSL-YFP mice (Gannon et al., 2000; Srinivas et al., 2001) that were either suckling or prematurely weaned at P18. YFP+ FACS-sorted cells were subjected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
