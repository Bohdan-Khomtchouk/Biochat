TITLE
Mat-Lylu cell line compared to G cell line

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
we analyzed the gene expression profiles of Mat-Lylu cell lines (in duplicate) compared to G cell lines (in duplicate) using Affymetrix tools and dChip software. The objective was to find metastasis-associated genes in prostate cancer, using this in vitro model. Keywords: cell line comparison

DESIGN
we used Mat_lylu cell line samples (duplicates) as the Experiment group and G cell line samples (duplicates) as control group.
