TITLE
SPIB and BATF provide alternate determinants of IRF4 occupancy in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma linked to disease heterogeneity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq data for the transcription factors (TFs) IRF4, PU.1 and SPIB from the cell lines OCI-LY3, OCI-LY10 and H929, and BATF from the cell lines OCI-Ly3 and OCI-Ly10. In addition ChIP-seq for the TFs IRF4, PU.1 and SPIB from the cell line OCI-LY3 following transfections of scramble/SPIB-siRNA.
