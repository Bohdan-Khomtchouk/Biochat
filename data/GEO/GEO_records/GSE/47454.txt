TITLE
Transcriptome Sequencing (RNA-seq) of Ara-C Resistant Murine AML Cell Lines Identifies Mechanisms of Resistance

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An RNA-seq study of altered gene expression and mutations in Ara-C resistant acute myeloid leukemia murine cell lines.  The analysis of the RNA-seq data led to the identification of a large deletion within the Dck coding sequence of the B117H cell line, which produced an alternatively processed form of Dck mRNA.  The RNA-seq analysis also identified the presence of an insertion mutation in Dck in the B140H cell line.  The RNA-seq analysis also identified a number of significant expression changes which did not appear in a previous microarray analysis (GSE18322), as well as identified other mutations which may be contributing to Ara-C resistance.

DESIGN
Two highly Ara-C resistant cell lines, B117H and B140H were derived from Ara-C sensitive parental cell lines, B117P and B140P.  Variations in gene expression as well identification of acquired mutations between these Ara-C resistant/sensitive sets were studied using various RNA-seq analysis tools.
