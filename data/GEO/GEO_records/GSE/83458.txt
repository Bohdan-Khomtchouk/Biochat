TITLE
The DNA methylation profiles of CD14+ monocytes, dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The methylation profiles of bisulfite-modified DNA of human CD14+ monocytes were compared with derived immature dendritic cells (GM-CSF/IL-4 ), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (GM-CSF/IL-4/PGE-2), EP2 antagonized myeloid-derived suppressor cells (GM-CSF/IL-4/PGE-2/ PF 04418948 5 µM), EP4 antagonized myeloid-derived suppressor cells (GM-CSF/IL-4/PGE-2/ L-161,982 5 µM) and EP2 + EP4 antagonized myeloid-derived suppressor cells (GM-CSF/IL-4/PGE-2/PF 04418948 5 µM /L-161,982 5 µM)  using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA,). This platform allows the interrogation of > 485,000 methylation sites per sample at single-nucleotide resolution, and comprises an average of 17 CpG sites per gene in the 99% of RefSeq genes. 96% of CpG islands are covered, with additional coverage in CpG island shores and the regions flanking them. The samples were hybridized in the array following the manufacturer’s instructions.

DESIGN
Total DNA isolated by standard procedures from CD14+ cells (total monocytes, MOs) corresponding to six sets of samples of monocytes (MOs), derived immature DCs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, EP2 antagonized myeloid-derived suppressor cells, EP4 antagonized myeloid-derived suppressor cells and EP2 + EP4 antagonized myeloid-derived suppressor cells      (DCS and MDSCs).

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
