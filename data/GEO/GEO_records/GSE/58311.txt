TITLE
The expression level of microRNA after knockdown of ATMIN

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To screen the microRNA regulated by ATMIN

DESIGN
Establish stable transfectants of pLKO-sh-ATMIN in HCT116 cells and analyze the miRNA expression level of  by microRNA microarray. HCT116 transfected with pLKO-sh-scr was used as a control experiment.
