TITLE
Perturbation of the Notch pathway in Xenopus laevis embryos

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
The Notch signaling pathway functions in a number of processes during embryologic development, especially the maintenance or aquisition of cell fate. We purturb the Notch signalling pathway in embryonic Xenopus laevis in order to 1) better characterize the downstream targets of Notch signalling, and 2) determine the extent to which early embryos can recover from transient purturbations to critical signalling pathways, if at all.

DESIGN
Xenopus laevis embryos were unilaterally injected at the two cell stage with either GFP, GFP and ICD (Notch intracellular domain, an up-regulator of the Notch pathway), or GFP and DBM (domain-binding mutant, a downregulator of the Notch pathway). At stages 18, 28, and 38, for each injection, pooled total RNA from 10 embryos was extracted. Extraction was performed for three biological replicates for each time/injection condition. cDNA from total RNA was hybridized on Affymetrix Xenopus laevis Genome 2.0 arrays.
