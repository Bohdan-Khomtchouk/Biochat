TITLE
Expression data from LLC-1 tumors extracted from C57Bl/6 mice following gene transfer of p19Arf and IFN-beta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene transfer of both p19Arf and IFN-beta induces increased immunoprotection in mice after intratumoral application Here we performed a microarray analysis to understand this process

DESIGN
Mice were treated by intratumoral application of 10^8 ifu, 5 times, each 48h. Tumors were transduced with Adenovector coding for EGFP as control, for P19Arf, IFN-beta or both P19Arf+IFNbeta
