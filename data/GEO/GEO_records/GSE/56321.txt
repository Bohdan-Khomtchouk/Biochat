SUMMARY
Sirtuins are a family of protein deacetylases, deacylases, and ADP-ribosyltransferases that regulate life span, control the onset of  numerous age-associated diseases, and mediate metabolic homeostasis. We have uncovered a novel role for the mitochondrial  sirtuin SIRT4 in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism during changes in nutrient availability. We show that SIRT4 levels  decrease in the liver during fasting and that SIRT4 null mice display increased expression of hepatic peroxisome proliferator activated  receptor   (PPAR ) target genes associated with fatty acid catabolism. Accordingly, primary hepatocytes from SIRT4  knockout (KO) mice exhibit higher rates of fatty acid oxidation than wild-type hepatocytes, and SIRT4 overexpression decreases  fatty acid oxidation rates. The enhanced fatty acid oxidation observed in SIRT4 KO hepatocytes requires functional SIRT1, demonstrating a clear cross talk between mitochondrial and nuclear sirtuins. Thus, SIRT4 is a new component of mitochondrial signaling in the liver and functions as an important regulator of lipid metabolism.

DESIGN
SIRT4 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) littermates (male; n   6 per genotype; 7- to 8-month-old littermates) were  sacrificed after a 16-h overnight fast. Samples were individually hybridized on Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChips by the Biopolymers Facility (Harvard Medical School).
