TITLE
The profiling of gene expression in pupa stage of Drosophila melanogaster: Wildtype vs. dicer-2 mutant

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To investigate transcriptional effects caused by a severe defect in endo-siRNA production, a gene expression profiling was performed on Drosophila dicer-2 pupae compared to wild-type.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Wildtype pupa vs. dicer-2 mutant pupa. Biological replicates: each 3 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL6385 Agilent-018972 D. melanogaster (FruitFly) Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Feature Number version)
