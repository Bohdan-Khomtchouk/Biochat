TITLE
Evaluation of the physiology of miniature pig fed Shochu distilled water by using mRNA expression profiling.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Shochu distilled water (SDW) was used as a feedstuff for livestock. We have tried to evaluate the physiology of pig during feeding SDW using genomics.

DESIGN
8-9 month old clawn miniature pigs were fed standard dry feed or SDW feeding. SDW feeding composed of standard dry feed: water: SDW= 1:1:1 by the weight ratio.Whole blood gene expression in control and SDW animal was measured at 12 weeks of feeding periods.
