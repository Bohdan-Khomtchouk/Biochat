TITLE
Expression data in CD4 T cells from lungs of PBS or house dust mite treated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD4 T cells are essential mediators of the asthmatic process. We used the clinically relevant allergen house dust mites to induce signs of allergy in mice and performed gene expression arrays specifically on CD4 T cells infiltrating the lung Reference: IL-21-producing CD4+ T cells promote type 2 immunity to house dust mites

DESIGN
Primary CD4+ T cells were isolated from mice sensitised and challenged to either house dust mites or PBS. Purification of CD4 T cells was performed by flow cytometry. RNA was isolated, converted to cDNA and then hybridised on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Arrays
