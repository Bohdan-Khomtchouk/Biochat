TITLE
The impact of chronic temperature elevation on the spleen anti-viral transcriptomic response in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua)

ORGANISM
Gadus morhua

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to investigate the impacts of non-lethal increases in temperature on the anti-viral transcriptomic response of Atlantic cod. Selected genes identified as differentially expressed between samples injected with pIC but held at different temperatures were validated using QPCR.

DESIGN
This was a common reference design. For the common reference each individual sample analyzed in the microarray experiment contributed with equal amounts of RNA to a pool. Sixty individuals were analyzed representing 6 biological replicates from 10 different experimental groups. Two separate control groups were used. Non-injected groups at the final temperatures (i.e. 10°C and 16°C) were used as prior to injection controls. At each time-point and temperatures there was also a sham-injected time matched control (injected with phosphate buffered saline [PBS]). The time points were 6 and 24 hours post-injection. Immunostimulated fish were injected with a weight-based dose of poly (I:C)(2 µg per g of wet body mass).
