TITLE
PCGF6-PRC1 suppresses premature differentiation of embryonic stem cells by silencing germ cell-related genes [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq data of embryonic stem cells to detect Ring1b and Pcgf6 binding sites ChIP-seq of embryonic stem cell H3K9me2 with or without Pcgf6.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq data of embryonic stem cells to detect Ring1b and Pcgf6 binding sites ChIP-seq of  H3K9me2 with or without Pcgf6 using conditional KO mouse embryonic stem cell.
