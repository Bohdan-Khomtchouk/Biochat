TITLE
Functional Roles of Hdac1/2 in lung development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hdac1/2 are important epigenetic factors, yet their functional roles in specific tissues inluding lung is not determined. We used the conditional knockout model of Hdac1/2 to determine their roles in lung development.

DESIGN
To explore the genes that are regulated by Hdac1/2 during lung development, we performed microarray analysis of Shhcre control and Hdac1/2DKO lungs at E11.5 embryos.
