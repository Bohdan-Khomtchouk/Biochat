TITLE
Difference of microRNA expressions between a mouse model of NASH(MCD diet) and normal mouse.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The microRNAs expression was markedly altered with the MCD diet.

DESIGN
Using a custom microarray platform, we analyzed the expression levels of 1135 mouse microRNA probes in liver tissue that were fed MCD diet.

PLATFORM
GPL16362 3D-Gene Mouse miRNA Oligo Chip V17.1.0
