TITLE
p38a-dependent gene expression in keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in wild-type and p38a-knockout keratinocytes were compared. Keratinocytes were isolated from newborn mice, and left unirradiated (0 h) and irradiated (4 h) with ultraviolet-B (UVB). C57BL/6 wild-type mice, and keratinocyte-specific p38a-knockout mice on a C57BL/6 background were used for isolation of primary keratinocytes.

DESIGN
Gene expression in keratinocytes was analyzed 0 and 4 h after UVB irradiation (75 mJ/cm2).
