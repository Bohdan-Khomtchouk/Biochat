TITLE
Brain transcriptomics of honey bee parasitized by Varroa destructor or Nosema ceranae

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
In this study we addressed whether the transcriptome profile in the honey bee brain is similar for two major parasites of honey bee, Varroa destructor and Nosema ceranae. Honey bees parasitized by these two parasites show accelerated behavioral maturation and deficiences in orientation and learning/memory that we hoped to characterized at the transcriptomic level.

DESIGN
honey bee adults infested by Varroa destructor or Nosema ceranae compared to control bees, in duplicate
