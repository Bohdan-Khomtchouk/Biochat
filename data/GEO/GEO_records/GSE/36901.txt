TITLE
Expression data from U87MG cells expressing EGFRvIII

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EGFRvIII is the most common deletion mutant of EGFR in human cancer and its levels are highly correlated with poor prognosis in GBM.  The deletion of exons 2-7 removes most of the extracellular ligand binding domain, so it is unable to bind EGF or other EGFR-binding ligands.  Nevertheless, the mutant receptor is constitutively phosphorylated, and is capable of activating downstream signaling pathways at a low level. To comprehensively identify the downstream signaling consequences of the EGFRvIII, we incorporated phosphoproteomic, transcription profiling and DNase-Seq data from U87MG glioblastoma cells expressing titrated levels of this mutant receptor.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from U87MG cells engineered to expressed different levels of EGFRvIII: medium (U87M; 1.5 million copies of EGFRvIII receptor per cell), high (U87H; 2 million copies per cell), super-high (U87SH; 2.5 million copies per cell), and kinase-dead EGFRvIII (U87DK; 2 million copies of kinase dead EGFRvIII per cell).  RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
