TITLE
miRNA expression profile of 14 mouse tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced 14 mouse tissues' small RNA samples from C57BL/6J mouse and aligned the sequenced reads to miRBase_v16 to profile miRNA expression levels in these 14 tissues.

DESIGN
We collect several tissue samples from 10 C57BL/6J mouse. Use high-throughout sequence technology to profile miRNA expression level in each tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
