TITLE
Identification of gene expression signature of LILRA3 stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the functional role that LILRA3 plays in the immune system, we used a gene expression microarray as a discovery platform to identify genes and pathways regulated by LILRA3

DESIGN
LILRA3 induced gene expression in PBMCs was measured at 24 hours, comparing 1 Âµg/mL LILRA3 to unstimulated control

PLATFORM
GPL13497 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
