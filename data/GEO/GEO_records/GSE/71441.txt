TITLE
Genome-wide tissue gene expression profiling in Juvenile Göttingen Minipigs with customized Agilent microarrays

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Minipigs have favorable biological characteristics for juvenile toxicity studies to assess efficacy and safety of pediatric drug products. To evaluate at the molecular level the expression of drug targets, drug metabolism pathways or general maturation of organ transcriptomes in minipigs, we used Customized Agilent Micoarrays (Design-ID 050244) for genome-wide gene expression profiling on 9 different tissues from male and female juvenile Göttingen minipigs aged 1 week to 24 months. The gene expression results analyzed in this study are further described in Heckel T. et al. (2015) Functional analysis and transcriptional output of the Göttingen minipig genome. under submission

DESIGN
Data of 72 different tissue samples from 9 tissues (cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum, liver, kidney, spleen, bone marrow, testis, ovary) and 4 age groups in female (1 week, 4 weeks, 2 months, 4 months) and 5 age groups in male (1 week, 4 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, 2 years) Goettingen minipigs (Ellegaard) were measured. One tissue was measured in 8 technical replicates. The combination of data of female and male pigs could be seen as a kind of biological replicate for most genes.
