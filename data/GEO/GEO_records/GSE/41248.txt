TITLE
Gene expression profiles in glucokinase activator (GKA)-treated pancreatic islets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the target genes of glucokinase activator (GKA) in islet, GKA-induced gene expression in mouse pancreatic islets was measured at 24 hours after treatment of 30 microM GKA or vehicle.

DESIGN
GKA-induced gene expression in mouse pancreatic islets was measured at 24 hours after treatment of 30 microM GKA or vehicle.
