TITLE
The addition of chromosome 8 leads to characteristic dysregulation of gene expression on all chromosome and transformed-associated phenotypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examain effects of trisomy 8 on gene expression in normal human cells, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling. To study the effects of aneuploidy in normal human cells, we generated cells which are artificially trisomic chromosome 8 (trisomy 8) using human primary fibroblast cells by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (HE35tri8 clones).

DESIGN
Gene expression in trisomy 8 clones (HE35tri8-1, 2 and3) and euploid clones (HE35-1, 2 and 4). Three independent experiments were performed at each clone.
