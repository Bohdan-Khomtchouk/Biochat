TITLE
Carbon nanotubes, but not graphene oxide, trigger chemokine production in primary human macrophages via MyD88 dependent NF-kB Pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The growing medical application of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) necessitates better understanding of their molecular toxicity mechanisms governing immune effects. In the present study, a comprehensive mechanistic in vitro assessment of two carbon-based ENMs, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and graphene oxide (GO), was performed using primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) as a model. HMDM were exposed to SWCNTs and GO at concentrations 10–100 µg/ml for 24 h. Toxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and uptake of ENM by cells was measured. The changes in gene expression profile of HMDM in response to SWCNTs and GO were studied and the key stress response pathways identified. The transcriptomics and pathway enrichment analysis findings were verified by multiplex immunoassay and functional assays.

DESIGN
Primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) as a model were treated with GO (graphene oxide), HCS (hollow carbon spheres) and SWCNT (single-walled carbon nanotubes) at concentrations from 10-100 µg/ml for 6 or 24 hours using 1-3 replicates and samples collected for analysis with the Affymetrix Human Genome U219 array.
