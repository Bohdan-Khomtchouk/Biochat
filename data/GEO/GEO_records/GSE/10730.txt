TITLE
Analysis of Iron Deficiency in Soybean Leaf Tissue

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
This study was designed to identify candidate genes associated with iron efficiency in soybeans.  Two genotypes, Clark (PI548553) and IsoClark (PI547430), were grown in both iron sufficient (100uM Fe(NO3)3) and iron deficient (50uM Fe(NO3)3) hydroponics conditions.  The second trifoliate was harvested for RNA extraction for the microarray experiment.  Candidate genes were identified by comparing gene expression profiles within genotypes between the two iron growth conditions. Keywords: Stress Response

DESIGN
This experiment was designed to compare expression profiles of Clark grown in iron sufficient and deficient iron conditions and of IsoClark grown in the same conditions.  Plants grown in iron sufficient conditions were used as controls and plants grown in iron deficient conditions were considered experimental.  For the Clark genotype, There were two biological replicates of iron deficient plants, and three biological replicates of iron sufficient plants.  The IsoClark genotype had three biological replicates for both iron sufficient and deficient conditions.
