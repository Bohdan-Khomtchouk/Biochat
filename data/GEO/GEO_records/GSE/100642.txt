TITLE
12plex-wheat_2012-05-The wheat grain transcriptome response to high temperature

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
12plex_wheat_2012-05 - 12plex-wheat_2012-05 - The objective is to better understand the adaptive response of the wheat plant to an elevated mean temperature. Besides the morphological and ecophysiological responses, the changes in the expression of genes are investigated. Two genotypes (SxB49 and SxB139) are subjected to two different temperature regimes during the lag-phase of the developing grains. The profiling of the accumulation of gene transcripts throughout 12 developmental stages is carried out using a custom-designed 12x135K Roche NimbleGen gene expression microarray comprising the most recent NCBI wheat contig assembly and annotation (about 45 000 unigenes). This should permit both the identification of differentially expressed genes after heat treatment and the comparison of the behaviours of two wheat genotypes (SxB139 and SxB49).  - The effect of the temperature on the expression of genes along with the effect of genotype

DESIGN
48 dye-swap - genotype comparaison,treated vs untreated comparison

PLATFORM
GPL23639 NimbleGen Triticum aestivum array [110121_Taestivum-HD12; gene-level]
