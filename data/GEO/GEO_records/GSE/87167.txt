TITLE
Long noncoding RNA related-competing endogenous RNAs in retinal pigment epithelial cells induced by clusterin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in regulating gene expression by acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs).

DESIGN
Based on high throughput sequencing data of RPE cells treated by clusterin or not, we first identified differentially expressed mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs. Then, we constructed an lncRNA-mRNA-miRNA network (ceRNA network) based on bioinformatic database miRanda and microRNA (miRNA) targets database miRTarBase.
