TITLE
ChIP-chip of H3K4me1 in Drosophila at different time points of development

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains ChIP-chip data on Agilent 244K dual-color arrays H3K4me1 at 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. Current Dataset: [GSM386042..GSM386050]: ChIP-chip of H3K4Me1 in Drosophila embryos at 4-8 hours of development [GSM386051..GSM386059]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me1 in Drosophila embryos at 12-16 hours of development [GSM386060..GSM386068]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me1 in Drosophila embryos at 16-20 hours of development [GSM386069..GSM386077]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me1 in Drosophila embryos at 20-24 hours of development [GSM418275..GSM418283]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me1 in Drosophila embryos at 8-12 hours of development [GSM442224..GSM442232]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me1 in Drosophila embryos at 0-4 hours of development [GSM442233..GSM442241]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me1 in Drosophila Pupae [GSM442242..GSM442250]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me1 in Drosophila L3 [GSM442251..GSM442259]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me1 in Drosophila L2 [GSM442260..GSM442268]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me1 in Drosophila L1 [GSM442269..GSM442277]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me1 in Drosophila Adult male [GSM442278..GSM442286]: ChIP-chip of H3K4me1 in Drosophila Adulat female For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf
