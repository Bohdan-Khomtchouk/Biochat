TITLE
Similar patterns of additive and non-additive gene expression in maize hybrids with varying levels of heterosis - 70mer

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Expression profiling analyses for 5 maize inbreds and 4 hybrids, chosen to represent diversity in genotypes and heterosis responses, revealed a correlation between genetic diversity and transcriptional variation. This is a companion dataset to an Affymetrix profiling experiment (GEO Series GSE10236). Keywords: Genotype comparison series

DESIGN
Expression profiling was used to study gene expression in aerial tissue from 11-day seedlings of maize. Three biological replicates were performed for nine different genotypes; B37, B73, B84, Mo17, Oh43, B37xB73, B84xB73, Oh43xB73 and Oh43xMo17.
