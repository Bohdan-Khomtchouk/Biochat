TITLE
Spontaneous generation of a novel fetal human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell line available for investigation on phagocytosis and morphogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Primary retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells have a limited capacity to re-establish epithelial morphology and to remain native RPE function in vitro, and all commercially available RPE cell lines have drawbacks of morphology or function; therefore, the establishment of new RPE cell lines with typical characteristics of RPE would be helpful in further understanding of their physiological and pathological mechanism. Here, we firstly report a new spontaneously generated RPE line, fhRPE-13A, from a 13-week aborted foetus. We aimed to investigate its availability as a RPE model. Methods:RNA-seq data were mapped to the human genome assembly hg19. Global transcriptional data were analyzed by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed genes(DEGs) to identify gene expression profiles. The morphology and molecular characteristics were examined by immunofluorescence, transmission electron micrographs, PCR and western blot. Photoreceptor outer segments (POS) phagocytosis assay and transepithelial resistance measurement (TER) were performed to assess phagocytic activity and barrier function, respectively. Results: The fhRPE-13A cells showed typical polygonal morphology and the normal biological processes of RPE, had ability of POS phagocytosis in vitro, and expressed TYR and TYRP1 significantly higher than that in ARPE-19 cells. Conclusions: The fetal human RPE line fhRPE-13A is a valuable system for researching phagocytosis function and morphogenesis of RPE in vitro.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of RPE cell lines and passaged primary RPE at different stage were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2000.
