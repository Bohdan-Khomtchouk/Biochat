TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing  Analysis of Saccharopolyspora erytharea transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Saccharopolyspora erythraea

SUMMARY
We report the high-throughput profiling of saccharopolyspora erythraea life cycle in bioreactors. RNA was harvested at seven time-points from bioreactors, three points immediately before, one during and three following the metabolic switch (as evidenced by biomass cell dry weight). We prepared unstranded RNA libraries and sequenced 363 million reads for a total of 32.7Gb and a mean ~4,000 fold coverage of the genome. Our comprehensive sequencing showed the S.erythraea genome to be prevalently transcribed, with at least 85.8% of genome sequence from either strand being transcribed.

DESIGN
We sequenced a  bioreactor fermentation at seven time points.
