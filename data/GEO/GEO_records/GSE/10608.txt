TITLE
Gene expression data from renal preneoplastic lesions

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to analyse gene expression underlying early tumourigenesis in Eker rats. Distinct classes of up- and downregulated genes were identified in different preneoplasic lesion vs. microdissected normal (healthy) renal tubules. Laser capture microdissected renal basophilic atypical tubule (bAT) and basophilic atypical hyperplasia (bAH) and healthy tissue (HT) of 6-months aristolochic acid (AA)- and ochratoxin A (OTA)-treated and control (C) male Eker rats were isolated for RNA extraction and microarray analysis in order to investigate gene expression profiles induced by AA and OTA as well as to differentiate pathways specific for the bAT to bAH progression. Keywords: gene expression study, preneoplasic lesion vs. microdissected normal renal tubules
