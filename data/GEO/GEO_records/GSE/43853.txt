TITLE
Genes regulated by 4D09 effector from cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii and its host target (14-3-3Ɛ) in Arabidopsis roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips were used to compare the mRNA profiles of root tissues of the transgenic plants overexpressing 4D09 effector gene from the cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii and the wild-type (C24). Also, Arabidopsis Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips were used to compare the mRNA profiles of root tissues of the transgenic plants overexpressing 14-3-3Ɛ gene from Arabidopsis and the wild-type (Col-0).     Wild-type (Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotypes C24 and Col-0 ), and  the transgenic plants overexpressing 4D09 effector gene or overexpressing 14-3-3Ɛ gene from Arabidopsis   were grown in vertical culture dishes on modified Knop’s medium for 2 weeks and then root tissues were collected for RNA extraction.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Tarek Hewezi.
