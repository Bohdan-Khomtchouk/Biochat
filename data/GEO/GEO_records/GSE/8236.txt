TITLE
Wound response of LapA-silenced tomato leaves

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
LapA encodes an acidic leucine aminopeptidase that is wound-inducible and found only in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and a small subset of the Solanaceae.  LapA is expressed in developing flowers, fruit and in foliage after wounding, insect feeding (Manduca sexta), Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato infection, salinity, and water-deficit stress. Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, UC82b plants were transformed  with a chimeric gene containing the CaMV 35S promoter and LapA cDNA in the sense orientation. Kanamycin-resistant plants were screened by RNA and protein blots to  identify plants that did not accumulate and LAP-A protein upon wounding; these plants were designated LapA-silenced (LapA-SI) lines. The LapA-SI plants have an impaired wound response and do not accumulate wound response transcripts (proteinase inhibitors and polyphenol oxidase) to wild-type levels. LAP-A is the first aminopeptidase to be shown to have a regulatory role in plants.   LapA-SI and UC82b plants were germinated on filter paper for 7 days before being planted in soil. Plants were grown in a growth chamber, (16 hour days at 28°C, 8 hour nights at 24°C, 50% humidity) for three weeks. Plants were wounded by crushing each leaflet on each of two lower leaves with pliers. Wounded leaves were collected at 0, 1 and 8 hr (local wounded tissue). Two upper, unwounded leaves were collected from the same plants at the same times (systemically wounded tissue). Five to seven plants were pooled for each time point. The experiment was repeated three times. RNA was extracted using a hot phenol/LiCl protocol and purified and DNase treated using the SV Total RNA Isolation Kit from Promega.
