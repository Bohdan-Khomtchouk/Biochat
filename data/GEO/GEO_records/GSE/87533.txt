TITLE
Small RNA Sequencing of mouse amygdala after knockdown of miR-15a

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are important regulators of gene expression and associated with stress-related psychiatric disorders. We report that exposing mice to chronic stress led to a specific increase in microRNA-15a levels in the amygdala-Ago2 complex, and a concomitant reduction in the levels of its predicted target, FKBP51, which is implicated in stress-related psychiatric disorders. Reciprocally, mice expressing reduced levels of amygdalar microRNA-15a following exposure to chronic stress exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviors. Here, we performed small RNA Sequencing of mouse basolateral amygdala after miR15a knockdown using injection of a miR-15a sponge virus or control sponge virus.

DESIGN
Small RNA Sequencing of basolateral amygdala of 5 mice injected with a miR-15a sponge virus and 5 mice injected with a control sponge virus.
