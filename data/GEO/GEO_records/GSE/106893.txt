TITLE
lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles associated with response to Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from a discovery cohort The discovery cohort includes12 RA patients (6 responders and 6 non-responders) treated with TwHF were detected by Affymetrix EG1.0 array.

DESIGN
Â To identify potential serum lncRNA and mRNA biomarkers, which are predictive of  rheumatoid arthritis patients' response to TwHF.

PLATFORM
GPL5175 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
