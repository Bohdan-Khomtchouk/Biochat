TITLE
EBNA3 proteins regulate EBNA2 binding to distinct RBPJ genomic sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of ChIP Seq to study the Epstein Barr Virus Nuclear Antigen EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA3C, an essential transcriptional regulator involved in the transformation of Resting B Lymphocytes to the immortalized Lymphoblast Cell Lines.

DESIGN
Examination of EBNA3A, EBNA3B and EBNA3C protein genome binding in LCLs.
