TITLE
Effect of demeclocycline on brain tumor initiating cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have determined that demeclocycline reduces the growth of brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs).  Specifically, we sought to obtain insights into the mechanisms by which demeclocycline directly regulates BTIC growth.  Analysis of the array data identified several genes that were altered with demeclocycline treatment that could regulate BTIC growth.  The study provides the mechanistic basis for the regulation of BTIC growth with demeclocycline treatment.

DESIGN
We subjected 3 BTIC lines to microarray analyses to identify genes involved in the regulation of BTIC growth by demeclocycline.  Three BTIC lines (BT012, BT025 and BT048) were treated with 10 ÂµM demeclocycline for 6h.  One (1) control and 1 treatment (demeclocycline treated) sample was generated from each BTIC line.  Thus, a total of 6 RNA samples from 3 BTIC lines were obtained for microarray analysis.
