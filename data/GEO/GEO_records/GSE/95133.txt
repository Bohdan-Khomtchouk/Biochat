TITLE
Genetically distinct parallel pathways in the entopeduncular nucleus for limbic and sensorimotor output of the basal ganglia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report single-cell transcriptional assessment and functional circuit characterization of neuron types within the mouse entopeduncular nucleus (EP)

DESIGN
Transcriptional profilingof EP neurons from P60-70 C57BL/6 male mice; three types were identified, characterized, and incorporated into a synaptic-circuit model of basal ganglia please note that Replicate 2 was lost experimentally and not included, so n=3 replicates total
