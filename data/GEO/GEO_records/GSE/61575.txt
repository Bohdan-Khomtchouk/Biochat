TITLE
Expression data from liver samples overxpressing either the GFP or Phf2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The GFP or Phf2 were overexpressed in the liver of C57Bl6/J mice through adenoviral gene delivery. Mice were studied in the fed state 3 weeks later. We used microarray analysis to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying Phf2 overexpression and identified distinct classes of up and down regulated genes.

DESIGN
RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
