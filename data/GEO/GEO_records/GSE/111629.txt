TITLE
Genome wide DNA methylation study of Parkinson's disease in whole blood samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of whole blood and saliva samples in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and PD-free controls. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles. Samples included 335 PD patients and 237 controls with blood DNA.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 572 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
