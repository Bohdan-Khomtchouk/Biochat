TITLE
Expression data from pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaca2 [control]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
tumor-stroma crosstalk drives pancreatic carcinogenesis we used time-resolved genome-wide transcriptional profiling to analyse changes caused by co-exposure of pancreatic tumor and stellate cells

DESIGN
pancreatic tumor cell line MiaPaca2 was treated with a supernatant of pancreatic stellate cells and harvested hourly at 1-7, and 24 hours post exposure for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
