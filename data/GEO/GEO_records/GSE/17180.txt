TITLE
Identification of KSHV, EBV and cellular miRNA targets in human B-cells using RIP-Chip

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RIP-Chip was performed on DG75-eGFP, DG75-10/12, BCBL-1, BL41, BL41 B95.8 and Jijoye using anti-human Ago2 (11A9) antibodies. Anti-BrdU antibodies were used as controls for DG75-eGFP, DG75-10/12 and BCBL-1. Total RNA was used as control for BL41, BL41 B95.8 and Jijoye. Samples were analyzed on Affymetrix Gene ST 1.0 Arrays (2 independent biological replicates / sample)

DESIGN
KSHV, EBV and cellular miRNA targets were determined by RIP-Chip using monoclonal antibodies to human Ago2

PLATFORM
