TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas families that differ in tolerance of heat shock

ORGANISM
Crassostrea gigas

SUMMARY
ESTs in which transcription levels in oyster gill differed among sampling times after heat shock and between families with high or low survival of heat shock were identified through expression profiling of 1,675 spot pairs Keywords: comparison of families characterized by low or high survival after heat shock

DESIGN
Oyster families were characterized by survival after heat shock, exposed to a sub-lethal heat shock, and gill was collected before and at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h afterwards.  Differences among sampling times and between family types were assessed using a 2-way analysis of variance.  In total, 1,675 ESTs were included in the analysis.
