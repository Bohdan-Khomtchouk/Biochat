TITLE
Active and inactive enhancers co-operate to exert localized and long-range control of gene regulation [ATAC-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that in developing B cells individual enhancers of Igk make up super-enhancer cluster where contacts between its components rely on all constituents. Reduction of interaction frequency in enhancer knock-out cells is associated with deminished transcriptional output of enhancers and Igk locus. Moreover, we find that Igk enhancer MiEk has an effect on levels of CBFb enrichment on Tcrb enhancer, Eb afffecting Tcrb recombination and T cell development.

DESIGN
Examination of expression, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and nuclear organization in developing wild-type and Igk and Tcrb enhancer deficient B and T lymphocytes.
