TITLE
Transcription profiling of barley plants containing variants of Mla1 and Mla6 powdery mildew resistance genes

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
A split-split-plot design with 144 experimental units (3 replications x 4 genotypes x 6 time points x 2 treatment types) was used to profile barley plants containing variants of Mla1 and Mla6 powdery mildew resistance genes in response to inoculation with the Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh) isolates 5874 (AvrMla1, AvrMla6).  Barley leaves were harvested from inoculated and non-inoculated plants at 6 time points (0,8,16,20,24 and 32 hrs) after Bgh inoculation.    ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Rico Caldo.
