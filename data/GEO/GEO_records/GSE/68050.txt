TITLE
Linker histone H1.2 establishes chromatin comapction and gene silencing through recognition of H3K27me3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Linker  histone H1 is a protein component of chromatin and has been linked to chromatin compaction and global gene silencing.It has been sugegsted that H1 plays a significant role, regulating a relatively small number of genes. Here we show that H1.2- a variant of H1 subtype is recruited to chromatin region and is dependent on EZH2-mediated H3K27me3. Therefore a Gene expression array analysis was carried out with H1.2 as well as EZH2 knockout MCF7 cells to confirm the interlationship of H1.2 and EZH2 activity.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from MCF7 cells in which EZH2 and H1.2 genes  have been depleted along with the wild type cells to study the differential regulation of various genes in each case.
