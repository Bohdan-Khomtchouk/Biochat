TITLE
Single-cell DNA methylation analysis of epimutations in mouse liver cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report a single-cell DNA methylation analysis using BS-Seq, which reveals enrichment of demethylating epimutations in gene bodies and repeat regions.

DESIGN
Comparison of single cells vs. a reference cell pool from Mouse liver tissue using an Illumina HiSeq machine.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
