TITLE
Expression data from Col-0 and sp1,spx2 under phosphate starvation stress and recovery after resupplying phosphate

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We performed a transcriptomic analysis of Pi-starvation and recovery after resupplying Pi in Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0) wild type plants and double mutant spx1,spx2. Results show that SPX1 is a Pi-dependent inhibitor of the transcription factor PHR1, a central regulatory protein in the control of transcriptional responses to Pi starvation.

DESIGN
The analysis was performed in wild-type and double spx1,spx2 double mutant plants grown for seven days in complete (+Pi) and Pi-lacking (-Pi) Johnson solid media. Then, plants were transferred to complete medium for 4 hours to analyze the effect of resupplying plants with Pi.
