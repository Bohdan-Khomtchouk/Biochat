TITLE
Persistent Alterations in the imprinted miRNA and snoRNA populations in mouse models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We sought to characterize the persistnet changes in brain miRNAs across multiple mouse models of fetal alcohol exposure We used miRNA expression arrays to characterize and observe the deregulation of brain specific ncRNAs
