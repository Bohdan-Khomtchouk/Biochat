TITLE
Persistent Alterations in the imprinted miRNA and snoRNA populations in mouse models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to characterize the persistnet changes in brain miRNAs across multiple mouse models of fetal alcohol exposure We used miRNA expression arrays to characterize and observe the deregulation of brain specific ncRNAs

DESIGN
Whole brain tissue was harvested from day 70 fetal alcohol exposed males and matched controls for RNA extraction and hybridization to affymetrix miRNA 2.0 arrays. We obtained tissue from four models: Trimiester 1,2, and 3, injections and contious preference drinking.
