TITLE
KRAS induces lung tumorigenesis through microRNAs modulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed microRNAs modulated by KRAS wild type or KRAS mutant (G12D).

DESIGN
H1299 cells were transfected with an empty vector or a KRAS wild type or a KRAS mutant (G12D) plasmid. Total RNA was extracted and the microRNA expression profile analysed by NanoString.

PLATFORM
GPL21799 NanoString nCounter Human miRNA assay v2.1
