TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of two human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines in response to SN1 methylating-agents treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylating agents of SN1 type constitute a widely used class of anticancer drugs, the effect of which on human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been adequately studied. We thus studied the effect of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), a model SN1 methylating agent, on two human NSCLC cell lines: A549 (p53wt) and H157 (p53null). We investigated the mechanism of MNU-induced cell death through a time course gene expression profiling study, 24, 48 and 72h following treatment.

DESIGN
Two human NSCLC cell lines (A549, H157) were treated with MNU or DMSO for 24h, 48h, or 72h. 34 total samples were analyzed.
