TITLE
Mouse gene expression in wild-type Th17 cells and Pten deficient Th17 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse Th17 cells comparing WT Th17 cells with Pten-deficient Th17 cells. Naïve CD4 T cells from each mice were cultured Th17 polarizing condition for 3 days. Goal was to determine the effects of Pten on global gene expression.

DESIGN
Naïve CD4 T cells from WT and Pten KO mice were cultured in Th17 polarizing condition for 3 days, After polarization, total RNA was extracted for affymatrix microarray analysis.
