TITLE
Aag glycosylase and impact on gene expression changes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We are investigating the transcriptional response of mice that are wt or null for Aag in response to alkylating agent MMS We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression response due to MMS exposure in a DNA repair proficient or deficient mouse Keywords: timepoint
