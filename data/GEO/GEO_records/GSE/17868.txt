TITLE
Mutation Mapping of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains

ORGANISM
Streptococcus suis

SUMMARY
Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2), an important zoonotic agent, is notorious for causing contagious porcine diseases and human infection. The two outbreaks in China (in 1998 and in 2005) have caused serious economic losses in the pig industry and posed public health for its new toxin shock symptoms (TSS). However, the molecular mechanism of SS2 pathogenicity is still poorly understood. In order to get insights into pathogenecity of SS2, eighteen SS2 strains of different virulence and sources have been subjected to whole genome comparison by NimbleGen CGS arrays

DESIGN
Comparative genomic analysis of 18 SS2 strains with 05ZYH33 as reference

PLATFORM
GPL9120 IMCAS Streptococcus suis 385K array (MAP01) GPL9121 IMCAS Streptococcus suis 385K array (MAP02)
