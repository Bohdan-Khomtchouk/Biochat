TITLE
Gene expression data from non-infected and M. hyorhinis-infected gastric cancer cell lines using Affymetrix genechip (HuGene-1_0-st)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chronic infection of M. hyorhinis is postulated to be associated with cancer cell migration and invasion. To explore the mechanisms of M. hyorhinis-promoted invasiveness, we performed Affymetrix genechip (HuGene-1_0-st) analysis to examine differential gene expression profiles between non-infected and infected gastric cancer cells. We used microarrays to detail global programme of gene expression and identified distinct classes of upregulated genes after M. hyorhinis infection of gastric cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
noninfected or M. hyorhinis-infected gastric cancer cells were utilized for RNA extraction and  hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
