TITLE
Analysis of a fungus-specific transcription factor family, the Candida albicans zinc cluster proteins, by artificial activation

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The zinc cluster proteins are a family of transcription factors that are unique to the fungal kingdom. In the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, zinc cluster transcription factors control the expression of virulence-associated traits and play key roles in the development of antifungal drug resistance. Gain-of-function mutations in several zinc cluster transcription factors, which result in constitutive overexpression of their target genes, are a frequent cause of azole resistance in clinical C. albicans isolates. We found that zinc cluster proteins can also be artificially activated by C-terminal fusion with the heterologous Gal4 activation domain. We used this strategy to create a comprehensive library of C. albicans strains expressing all 82 zinc cluster transcription factors of this fungus in a potentially hyperactive form. Screening of this library identified regulators of invasive filamentous growth and other phenotypes that are important during an infection. In addition, the approach uncovered several novel mediators of fluconazole resistance, including the multidrug resistance regulator Mrr2, which controls the expression of the major C. albicans multidrug efflux pump CDR1. Artificial activation therefore is a highly useful method to study the role of zinc cluster transcription factors in C. albicans and other fungi of medical, agricultural, and biotechnological importance.

DESIGN
In total, 15 samples are analysed: 3 replicates of 5 different strains. The 3 replicates of SC5314 are the wild type reference.
