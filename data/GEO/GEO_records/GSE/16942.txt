TITLE
A putative network of actin-associated cytoskeletal proteins in glomerular podocytes defined by co-purified mRNAs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of a putative network of actin-associated cytoskeletal proteins in glomerular podocytes defined by co-purified mRNAs. An experimental purification in which a presumed RNA binding protein was used for an RNA immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis (RIP-CHIP).  Total cell extracts were harvested from the conditionally immortalized mouse MPC-5 podocyte cell line 14 days after transfer from 33 to 37 degrees Celsius.  The MPC-5 cell lines were stably expressing the Wilm's Tumor protein (+KTS) isoform carrying a modified TAP tag.  A fraction of each extract (Input samples) was saved and the remaining extract was applied to a sepharose IgG column, washed, and eluates were harvested after addition of TEV protease and elution in microbiospin columns.  Four input and four eluate samples were then used to harvest RNA using Trizol.

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from 4 input samples and 4 eluate samples.  RNAs that were enriched in the eluate samples relative to input samples were further investigated and characterized.  These RNAs were shown to be enriched in the eluates independent of the TAP-tagged protein. Complete data matrices reporting all 46,657 unique probe IDs (i.e., including the 14 control IDs not reported in the Sample data tables) are linked below as supplementary files.
