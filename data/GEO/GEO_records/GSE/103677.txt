TITLE
Expression data from sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in SEF tumors and to identify up- and down- regulated genes compared to tumors previously deposited in GEO

DESIGN
10 samples of SEF tumors were analyzed, in addition to the tumors previously deposited in GEO.
