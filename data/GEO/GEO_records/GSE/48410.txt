TITLE
Determination of Sigma 54 reglons in Bacillus thuringiensis HD73 strain

ORGANISM
Bacillus thuringiensis

SUMMARY
To determine Sigma 54 (SigL) reglons in Bacillus thuringiensis HD73 strain, A sigLmutant, HD(ΔsigL::kan), was constructed with insertion of kanamycin resistance gene cassete. We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify the difference of gene expression between mutant and wild-type strains.

DESIGN
2 ml samples were separately harvested from B. thuringiensis HD73 and HD(ΔsigL::kan) strains grown in Schaeffer’s sporulation medium (SSM) at stages T7 of stationary phase (7 hours after the end of the exponential phase). Three independent repeats were performed for each stain.

PLATFORM
