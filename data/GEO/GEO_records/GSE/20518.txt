TITLE
mRNA expression in islets isolated from wild type and SHPKO mice fed chow or western diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SHP (small heterodimer partner; NR0B2) belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, which regulates numerous developmental and metabolic cellular functions. To study physiological function of SHP, we generated congenic SHP-/- mice on C57Bl/6 background. When the congenic SHP-/- mice were challenged with a western diet (high fat, hgih sucrose, high cholesterol) for 20 weeks, they were resistant to diet induced obesity but severely glucose intolerant compared to wild type control mice. However, their overall peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity was normal when assessed by insulin tolerance test. Next, we examined the glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in isolated islets from these animals. Islets from SHP-/- mice showed strongly impaired GSIS especially fed the western diet, which is believed to be a major factor causing the whole body glucose intolerance in SHP-/- mice. Therefore, we explored gene expression in islets using illumina beadchip array to understand mechanisms underneath the impaired GSIS.

DESIGN
Islets were isolated from C57Bl/6 wild type and C57Bl/6 SHP-/- mice fed chow or western diet. The same amount of total RNA obtained from these islets was pooled from 5-9 mice each group and subjected to illumina beadchip gene expression profiling in triplicates.
