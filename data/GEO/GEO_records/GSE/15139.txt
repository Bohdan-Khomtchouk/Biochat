TITLE
Identification of genes effected by GM-CSF treatment in mature human neutrophils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to compare the transcriptional repertoire of mature human neutrophils before and after GM-CSF treatment by using oligonucleotide microarrays. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is an important pro-inflammatory lipid mediator generated by neutrophils upon activation. Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating  factor (GM-CSF) stimulation is known to enhance agonist-mediated LTB4 production of neutrophils within minutes, a process called “priming”. Here, we  demonstrate that GM-CSF also limits the production of LTB4 by neutrophils via a transcriptional mechanism at later time points. We identified hematopoietic  specific Ras homologous (RhoH)/translocation three four (TTF), which was induced following GM-CSF stimulation in neutrophils, as a key regulator in this  process. Neutrophils derived from RhoH/TTF-deficient (Rhoh-/-) mice demonstrated increased LTB4 production upon activation compared with  normal mouse neutrophils. Moreover, neutrophils from cystic fibrosis patients expressed enhanced levels of RhoH/TTF and generated less LTB4 upon  activation compared with normal human neutrophils. Taken together, these data suggest that RhoH/TTF represents an inducible feedback inhibitor in  neutrophils that is involved in the limitation of innate immune responses.

DESIGN
3 healthy donors' blood were used for each group. Two groups were created. One group ( " untreated " =N ) the RNA were extracted immediately after isolation of blood neutrophil. The second group ( " Neu " ) blood neutrophils were incubated with GM-CSF (50 ng/ml) for 7 hours before RNA extraction.
