TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiles from eggs of different qualities associated with post-ovulatory ageing in rainbow trout

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Egg quality is an important aspect in rainbow trout farming. Post-ovulatory aging is one of the most important factors affecting egg quality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the major regulators in various biological processes and their expression profiles could serve as reliable biomarkers for various pathological and physiological conditions. Egg samples from 32 females on day 1, day 7, and day 14 post-ovulation (D1PO, D7PO and D14PO), which had the fertilization rates of 91.8%, 73.4% and less than 50%, respectively, were collected and small RNAs isolated from these samples were subjected to deep sequencing using the Illumina platform. Six miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between D1PO and D14PO eggs. GO analysis of the target genes of the 6 miRNAs that were down-regulated in D14PO eggs revealed significantly enriched GO terms that are related to stress response, cell death, DNA damage, ATP generation, signal transduction and transcription regulation.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNA populations in eggs of different qualities caused by post-ovulatory aging.
