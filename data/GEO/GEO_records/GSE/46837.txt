TITLE
SOX2 and p63 occupancy in human squamous carcinoma cell lines and embryonic stem cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX2 is a transcription factor essential for pluripotent stem cells, and development and maintenance of squamous epithelium. We previously reported SOX2 an oncogene subject to highly recurrent genomic amplification in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs).  Here we demonstrate in SCCs that SOX2 interacts with another master squamous transcription factor p63, and through ChIP-seq show that genomic occupancy of SOX2 overlaps with that of p63 at a large number of loci and that they cooperatively regulate gene expression including ETV4, which we find essential for SOX2-amplified SCC cell survival. Furthermore, SOX2 binds to distinct genomic loci in SCCs than in embryonic stem cells and the SOX2-p63 coordinate binding is unique to SCC.  In addition, a subset of SOX2 genomic binding sites in SCC that lack p63 co-occupancy are co-occupied by the AP-1 transcriptional complex.  These demonstrate that SOX2’s actions in SCC differ substantially from its role in pluripotency and identify novel SOX2 interactions that will enable deeper characterization of SOX2’s function in SCC.

DESIGN
SOX2 and p63 ChIP-seq from three lung and esophageal squamous carcinoma cell lines with amplification of SOX2 as well as SOX2 ChIP-seq from an ES cells.
