TITLE
A novel BRAT1â€“BRP1 complex recognizes histone acetylation and mediates active DNA demethylation and transcriptional activation in Arabidopsis [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify BRAT1 target loci at the whole-genome level, we performed RNA deep sequencing and examined the transcript levels of transposable elements and genes in the wild type, brat1, nrpe1, and brat1nrpe1.

DESIGN
Compare the mRNA profiles of 10-day old seedlings materials of mutants (brat1, nrpe1, and brat1nrpe1) to wild type by Illumina suquencing.
