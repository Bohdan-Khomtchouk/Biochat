TITLE
Gene expression of pancreatic cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression profiling on replicates of 9 pancreatic cancer cell lines (L3.6pl, BxPC3, CFPAC, SU8686, Panc-1, Hs766T, AsPC1, MIAPaca-2, MPanc 96) and normal HPDE cells was performed to elucidate multi-drug sensitivity/ resistance. Keywords: D microarray (Illumina human 2)
