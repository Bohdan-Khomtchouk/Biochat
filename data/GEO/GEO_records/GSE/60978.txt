TITLE
mRNA and miRNA expression profiles for fresh frozen periampullary adenocarcinomas (pancreatobiliary and intestinal type) and adjacent normal tissues. [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the molecular signatures of mRNAs and miRNAs which can potentially act as a prognostic biomarkers in pancreatobiliary and intestinal types of periampullary adenocarcinomas

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 10 x 20 Âµm sections of  83 fresh frozen tumor samples for  miRNA expression profiling. A total of 51 PDAC, 8 bile duct adenocarcinoma, 8 ampulla of pancreatobiliary tye, 7 ampulla of intestinal type, 9 duodenum sample and 6 adjacent normal samples were used. These samples were analysed by microarray analysis using the 60K agilent platform. The expression profiles was RMA normalized for miRNA expression data. Filtering of controls, unannotated genes and low expressed probes was done.
