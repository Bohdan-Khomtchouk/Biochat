TITLE
Expression data from 7-day-old Arabidopsis emf2 mutant, rescued emf2 mutant harboring 35S::BoEMF2.1, WT Columbia ecotype and WT harboring 35S::BoEMF2.1 named transWT

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis emf2 mutants bypass vegetative development and flowering upon seed germination. We introduced a broccoli BoEMF2.1 gene into emf2 mutants and obtained rescued emf2 plants that harbored 35S::BoEMF2.1. We found that BoEMF2.1 can partially rescue the phenotype of emf2 to that of WT. We used microarrays to study the global program of gene expression and to identify genes misexpressed in the Arabidopsis emf2 mutant that had been rescued by 35S::BoEMF2.1.

DESIGN
7-day-old seedlings of WT, transWT, emf2 and rescued emf2 Arabidopsis were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
