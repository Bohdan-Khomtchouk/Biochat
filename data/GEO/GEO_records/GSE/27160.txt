TITLE
Gene expression analysis during morphogenesis of Human umbilical vein endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles during the differentiation of HUVEC on matrigel were analyzed.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from Human umbilical vein endothelial cell during morphogenesis. HG-U133 plus 2.0 microarray (54675 human genes; Affymetrix Santa Clara, CA, USA) was performed.
