TITLE
Genomic profiling in Down syndrome pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with Down syndrome (DS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have distinct clinical and biological features.  Whereas most DS-ALL cases lack the sentinel cytogenetic lesions that guide risk assignment in childhood ALL, JAK2 mutations and CRLF2 overexpression are highly enriched.  To further characterize the unique biology of DS-ALL, we performed genome-wide profiling of 58 DS-ALL and 35 non-Down syndrome (NDS) ALL cases by DNA copy number, loss of heterozygosity, gene expression, and methylation analyses.  We report novel deletions within the 6p22 histone gene cluster as significantly more frequent in DS-ALL, occurring in 12 DS (24%) and only a single NDS case (3%) (Fisherâ€™s exact p = 0.013).  Homozygous deletions yielded significantly lower histone expression levels, and were associated with higher methylation levels, distinct spatial localization of methylated promoters, and enrichment of highly methylated genes for specific pathways and transcription factor binding motifs.  Gene expression profiling identified CRLF2 overexpression in nearly half DS-ALL cases, and supervised analysis identified an associated 39-gene signature.  However, no expression signature was identified for DS-ALL overall, nor for histone status, suggesting that DS-ALL constitutes several, heterogeneous molecular entities.  Characterization of pathways associated with histone deletions and high CRLF2 expression may identify opportunities for novel targeted interventions.
