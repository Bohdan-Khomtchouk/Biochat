TITLE
Global transcriptome analysis of macrophages during Helicobacter pylori infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Based on preliminary data demonstrating that macrophages are critical regulators of Helicobacter pylori colonization and gastric pathology in mice, we sought to investigate how macrophages may serve as bacterial reservoirs of intracellular H. pylori.

DESIGN
BMDM were isolated from WT and PPARg-/- mice and cultured with M-CSF for 7 days to promote macrophage differentiation. Fully differentiation macrophages were challenged with H. pylori strains SS1 at an MOI of 10 for 15 minutes. Extracellular bacteria was then eliminated by gentamycin treatment. Cells were collected at 0, 60, 120, 240, 360 and 720 minutes post gentamycin treatment to ascertain whole transcriptome differential gene expression during infection.
