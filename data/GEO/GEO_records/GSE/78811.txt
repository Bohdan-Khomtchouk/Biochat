TITLE
lncRNA expression profile identified by microarray in infantile hemangioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infantile hemangioma (IH) was one of the most common vascular tumors during childhood. Long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play great roles in angiogenesis; the involvement of lncRNAs in hemangioma remains unknown. We aim to investigate the differential expression of lncRNA between hemangioma and the adjacent normal tissues, with a view to studying the biological function of lncRNAs and their involvement in the pathogenesis of hemangioma. The differential lncRNAs expression profiles of hemangioma were established by lncRNA microarray. Bioinformatic analyses were applied for further study of these differentially expressed lncRNAs. A total of 2116 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified, among these lncRNAs, 1259 were up-regulated and 857 were down-regulated more than two-fold.

DESIGN
Two-conditioned experiment, hemangioma tissue VS adjacent non-tumor skin tissue. Biological replicates: 3 infantile hemangioma tissue, 3 adjacent non-tumor skin tissue. Three samples of infantile hemangioma were included in the study, and the adjacent nontumor skin tissues were identified as control. One replicate per sample.
