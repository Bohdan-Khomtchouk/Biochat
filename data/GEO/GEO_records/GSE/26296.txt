TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of lung myeloid dendritic cells gene expression from healthy or emphysema subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung myeloid dendritic cells isolated from emphysema but not healthy subjects induce Th1 and Th17 cells differentiation. The goal of this study is to identify the genes differentially expressed by lung myeloid dendritic cells from healthy or emphysema subjects. These genes may play crucial roles in directing Th1 and Th17 cells differentiation.

DESIGN
Total mRNA was extracted from lung myeloid dendritic cells isolated from lungs of three healthy controls and three emphysema patients.
