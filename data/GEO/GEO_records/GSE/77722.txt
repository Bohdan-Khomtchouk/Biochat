TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of pancreas and kidney upon induction of reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled total mRNA of pancreas and kidney tissues of 3 different strains (p53-null; In4a/Arf-null and WT) of reprogrammable mouse lines (they all express OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, C-MYC under the control of a tetracycline promoter, activated by doxycycline)

DESIGN
5 mice of each genotype were treated with doxycycline to induce the expression of the reprogramming factors, they were sacrificed and total mRNA was extracted from pancreas and kidney tissues (we mapped > 24M reads per sample)
