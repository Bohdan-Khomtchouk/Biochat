TITLE
Differentially expressed genes after miRNA or siRNA transfection in human cancer cell lines Panc-1, FaDu and PC3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes by anti cancer treatments (microRNAs or siRNAs) in human cancer, several cell lines (pancreatic cancer,  hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and prostate cancer) were subjected to Agilent whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human cell lines (Panc-1, FaDu and PC3) were treated with miRNAs (miR99a-5p, miR-99a-3p, miR-100-3p, miR-150-5p and miR-150-3p), siRNAs (si-FOXQ1).
