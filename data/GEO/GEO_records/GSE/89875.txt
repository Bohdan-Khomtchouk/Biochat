TITLE
Expression data from budding yeast exposed to simulated asbestos mine drainage

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Investigation of global gene expression changes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain NRRL Y-12632 (ATCC® 18824) grown in media made with asbestos mine tailings-laden water compared to the control grown in media made with double distilled water

DESIGN
Total RNA was recovered from four Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain NRRL Y-12632 (ATCC® 18824) replicates exposed to simulated mine drainage for a 24 hour period and three Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain NRRL Y-12632 (ATCC® 18824) control replicates. Samples were run on Affymetrix Yeast Genome 2.0 Arrays.
