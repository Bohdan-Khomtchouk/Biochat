TITLE
Global analysis of lipid metabolism regulation in Brassica napus developing seeds

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles during seed development and fatty acid (FA) metabolism, as well as the relevant regulation, of Brassica napus were studied through multiple high-throughput genomic approaches. Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) using seed materials obtained a total of 68,718 tags, of which 23,897 were unique and 503 tags were functionally identified, and revealed the transcriptome of approximately 35,000 transcripts in B. napus developing seeds. Further, ~22,000 independent ESTs were obtained by large-scale sequencing using immature embryos at different stages, and 8343 uni-ESTs and 3355 full-length cDNAs were identified respectively, resulting in the systemic identification of B. napus FA biosynthesis-related genes. Gene expression profiles were further studied employing cDNA chip hybridization to reveal the global regulatory network of FA metabolism in developing seeds. Together with the analysis on FA amounts and composition, it was shown that 17-21 days after pollination (DAP) was a crucial stage for transition of seed to sink tissue. High expressions of FA biosynthesis-related genes and transition of FA components are mainly at stages 21 DAP or 21-25 DAP respectively. In addition, compared to Arabidopsis, more critical roles of starch metabolism are detected for B. napus seed FA metabolism and storage components accumulation. Crucial effects of starch metabolism, carbon flux, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP), photosynthesis, and other regulators in FA metabolism were discussed. Keywords: Brassica napus, immature seed, SAGE, EST, cDNA microarray

DESIGN
Brassica napus immature seeds at 5 and 9 days after pollination (DAP) were collected and used to construct SAGE library. Rapeseed embryos at different developmental stages were observed and two cDNA libraries were constructed using materials at 3-9 day after pollination(DAP) or 11-19 DAP. Gene expression profiles during seed development were further detailed studied via cDNA microarray. cDNA inserts of ESTs were PCR amplified and used to generate the glass-based cDNA chips. Immature seeds at different developmental(7, 9, 12, 17, 19, 21, 25, 31DAP) stages were used for hybridization, and the seed of 3 day after pollination was used as control.
