TITLE
Titanium dioxide nanoparticles exposure

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
This project utilized oligonucleotide microarrays to examine gene expression patterns in adult male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to a common nanomaterial, titanium dioxide (TiO2, stearate-coated particles, MT-100TVÂ®).  We exposed adult male fathead minnows for 96 hr to three doses (0,   1, and 10 mg/L nominal) of TiO2 under static renewal conditions. TiO2 is stearate coated, 15 nm particle size.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: high dose, controls (untreated, low dose). Three tissues: liver, gill, brain.  Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 low dose, 4 high dose for gill and liver.  One array for brain control and low dose; and 2 arrays for brain high dose. Contributor: Johnson & Johnson Worldwide Envrionmental
