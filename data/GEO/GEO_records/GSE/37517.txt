TITLE
Expression data from human induced pluripotent stem cell derived NSCs and striatal-like cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded stretch of CAG trinucleotide repeats that results in neuronal dysfunction and death. We made induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from HD patients and controls. Though no obvious effects of the CAG expansion on reprogramming or subsequent neural stem cell (NSC) production were seen, HD-NSCs showed CAG expansion-associated gene expression patterns and, upon differentiation, changes in electrophysiology, metabolism, cell adhesion, and ultimately an increased risk of cell death for both medium and longer CAG repeat expansions, with some deficits greater in cells from longer repeat HD NSCs. The HD180 lines were more vulnerable than control lines to cellular stressors and BDNF withdrawal using a range of assays across consortium laboratories. This HD iPSC collection represents a unique and well-characterized resource to elucidate disease mechanisms in HD and provides a novel human stem cell platform for screening new candidate therapeutics.

DESIGN
8 NSC samples (5 HD, 3 control), of which 3 were run as replicates (2HD, 1 control), and 5 striatal-like samples (3 HD, 2 control) Contributor:  The HD iPS consortium
