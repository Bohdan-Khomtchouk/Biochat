Gene expression data from mouse regulatory T cells

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) is widely used as an immunomodulatory therapy. We have recently demonstrated that IVIg protects against airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) and inflammation in mouse models of allergic airway disease (AAD), associated with induction of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg). Using DEREG (DEpletion of REGulatory T cell) mice, in which endogenous Treg can be ablated with Diphtheria toxin (DTx) treatment, we demonstrate that IVIg generates a de novo population of induced Treg (iTreg) in the absence of endogenous Treg. IVIg-generated iTreg were sufficient for inhibition of ovalbumin-induced AHR in an antigen-driven murine model of AAD. In the absence of endogenous Treg, IVIg failed to confer protection against AHR and airway inflammation. Adoptive transfer of purified IVIg-generated iTreg prior to antigen challenge effectively prevented airway inflammation and AHR in an antigen-specific manner. The goal of this study was to characterize the gene expression profile of a pure population of IVIg-generated induced Treg (iTreg).

DESIGN
Treg were isolated from mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). Animals were treated with IVIg to generate iTreg with or without DTx endogenous Treg pre-depletion. Human serum albumin (HSA) was used as a control protein treatment. RNA was isolated from 4 biological replicates for each condition. 12 samples in total were hybridized to Affymetrix gene expression microarrays. variable: treatment: OVA-HSA-OVA - DTx: BMR133, BMR134, BMR135, BMR136 variable: treatment: OVA-IVIg-OVA - DTx:  BMR137, BMR138, BR139, BMR140 variable: treatment: OVA-IVIg-OVA + DTx: BMR141, BMR142, BMR143, BMR144 repeat: biological replicate: eTreg: BMR133, BMR134, BMR135, BMR136 repeat: biological replicate: e_iTreg: BMR137, BMR138, BR139, BMR140 repeat: biological replicate: IVIg-iTreg: BMR141, BMR142, BMR143, BMR144
