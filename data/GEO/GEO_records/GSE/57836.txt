TITLE
Transcriptomic effects of GLUT2 knock-down in zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) is a key player in the regulation of glucose dynamics in organs central to metabolism, namely the liver, pancreas and intestine In humans, mutations of the GLUT2 gene (Fanconi-Bickel syndrome) cause important defects in glucose homeostasis. Although GLUT2 has been studied in the context of its participation in peripheral and central glucose sensing, to date it is still unclear which role it plays in the brain. In this regard, in order to shed some light on the function of GLUT2 in the vertebrate brain, we have knocked down the functional ortholog of human GLUT2 in zebrafish. Our results show that abrogation of glut2 in vivo leads to defective brain organogenesis coinciding with reduced glucose uptake and increased programmed cell death in the brain region. Interestingly, coinciding with the observed localization of glut2 expression in the hindbrain, glut2 deficiency affected the development of neural progenitor cells expressing the proneural genes atoh1b and ptf1a that are the source of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively. In addition, progenitor cells expressing neurod, a marker for immature and mature granule cells, were not affected by the lack of glut2. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis of glut2 knockdown embryos supports the notion that the lack of glut2 impacts brain development. Overall, the results of this study highlight the physiological relevance of glut2 in glucose uptake and availability during brain development, supporting the important role of glut2 in brain glucose sensing, and demonstrate the usefulness of a novel in vivo model of GLUT2 deficiency.

DESIGN
Control and ATG morphant embryos were harvested at 72 hpf and RNA samples were obtained from pools of 20 embryos per condition and three pooled biological replicates of control and ATG morphants were analyzed.
