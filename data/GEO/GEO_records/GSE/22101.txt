TITLE
Expression of miRNAs in HOZOT, a line of multifunctional Treg cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray analysis to compare miRNA expression profiles of novel type of Treg cell line, termed HOZOT, with those of activated T cells, so called conventional CD4+ T (Tconv) cells.

DESIGN
HOZOT-17, a representative HOZOT cell line, was used for profiling.  Tconv cells were prepared from the same UCB source as HOZOT-17.  CD4+ cells were activated with anti-CD3 antibody plus anti-CD28 antibody (CD3/CD28) and cultured for at least seven days in the presence of IL-2. The chip used for this analysis was a mirVanaTM miRNA Bioarray system.
