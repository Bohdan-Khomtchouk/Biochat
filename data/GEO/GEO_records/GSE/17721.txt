TITLE
Dendritic cell stimulation: 5 ligands, 9 time points

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mouse primary BMDCs were stimulated with  tlr ligands and  gene expression changes were profiled on Affymetrix arrays

DESIGN
BMDC were stimulated with 5 tlr ligands (LPS, pIC ,PAM, CpG, GRD) across 9 time points (.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24  hours). Unstimulated cells were used as controls.
