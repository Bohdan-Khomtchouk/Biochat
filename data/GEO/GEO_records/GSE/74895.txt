TITLE
Effect of SUB1 knockdown on aggressive prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SUB1 is known to be playing critical role in vital cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair and heterochromatization. Expression profiling studies in several cancers show its overexpression. However, its regulation and function in cancer has been less explored. Our study has indicated high expression of SUB1 in aggressive prostate cancer, we also found that the knockdown of SUB1 led to alterations in cell proliferation, invasion and migration. In addition, we found that mir-101, a tumor suppressor microRNA targets and regulates the expression of SUB1
