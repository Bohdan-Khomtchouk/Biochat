TITLE
GSK3B shRNA in Panc-1 xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer line (ATCC) was constructed to stably express control or GSK3B shRNA. Control or GSK3B shRNA expressing Panc-1 cells were implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of 3-5 week old, female, athymic nude mice. Tumors were grown to at least 250mm3. Tumor tissue was microdissected for further analysis.   We compared control shRNA (n=4) to GSK3B shRNA (n=3) Panc-1 xenografts. The array data with simple statistical calculations are also provided in a supplementary Excel workbook, with probe-set annotation that we used at the time (users may want newer annotation).

DESIGN
We compared xenografts of Panc-1 (Human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, grown in mice) stably expressing GSK3B shRNA (n=3) to similar xenografts with control shRNA (n=4).  Xenografts were grown in the flanks of female, athymic nude mice until they reached at least 250mm3. Tumor tissue was microdissected for further analysis. mRNA abundance assays were performed using Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays, with 54675 probe-sets.
