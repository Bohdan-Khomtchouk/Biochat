TITLE
WIN 18,446 2dpp testis culture

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of 2dpp whole testes cultured for 24h in the presence of WIN 18,446, a BDAD compound.  BDADs (Bis-(dichloroacetyl)-diamines) have been shown previously to inhibit spermatogenesis and function as male contraceptives in many species; however, their mechanism of action has yet to be fully described.  Results provide insight into the ability of WIN 18,446 to inhibit retinoic acid synthesis in the murine testis.

DESIGN
Testes were removed from 2dpp 129 mice and cultured for 24h in an organ culture mold in the presence of WIN 18,446.  Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.
