TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Plasmodium PBANKA, PBSLTRiP-KO, PB268-KO parasite infected and uninfected host cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Liver stage of malaria parasite exports SLTRiP and PB268 to the cytosol of parasite infected host cell. To know the host genes perturbed by WT-PBANKA, SLTRiP-KO and PB268-KO parasite growth, we did transcriptomic sequencing of infected host cells.  We did mRNA sequencing of four samples for comparative analysis of WT and PB-knockout parasites infected host cells at 22 hours of post sporozoites infection.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of Plasmodium PBANKA, PBSLTRiP-KO, PB268-KO parasite infected and uninfected HepG2 cells after  22hrs of sporozoites infections  were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx.
