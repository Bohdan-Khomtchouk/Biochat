TITLE
Unraveling the molecular basis of temperature-dependent genetic regulation in Penicillium marneffei

ORGANISM
Talaromyces marneffei PM1

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of transcriptome of Penicillium marneffei PM1 grown at 25°C and 37°C

DESIGN
Penicillium marneffei strain PM1 was pre-cultured at  25°C and 37°C for two weeks on Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar (SDA). Messenger RNAs were then isolated from one-week 25°C and 37°C cultures and sequenced with Illumina by BGI America. Two replicates.
