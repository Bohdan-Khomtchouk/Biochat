TITLE
89 NSCLC patients with gene expression profiles and matching CT imaging data available at TCIA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Lung3 data set consists of 89 NSCLC patients that were treated at MAASTRO Clinic, The Netherlands. For these patients pretreatment CT scans, tumour delineations and gene expression profiles were available. We used this data set to associate imaging features with gene-expression profiles.

DESIGN
89 samples from NSCLC patients. Samples were obtained by biopsies from cancerous tissue. Tumors were classified as Adenocarcinoma, Papillary, NOS; Squamous Cell Carcinoma, NOS; Non-Small Cell; Papillary Type; or Solid Type.
