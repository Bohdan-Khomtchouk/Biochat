SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Yijun Ruan ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track was produced as part of the ENCODE Project. It shows the locations of protein factor mediated chromatin interactions determined by Chromatin Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tag (ChIA-PET) data (Fullwood et al., 2010) extracted from five different human cancer cell lines (K562 (chronic myeloid leukemia), HCT116 (colorectal cancer), HeLa-S3 (cervical cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), and NB4 (promyelocytic)). A chromatin interaction is defined as the association of two regions of the genome that are far apart in terms of genomic distance, but are spatially proximate to each other in the 3-dimensional cellular nucleus. Additionally, ChIA-PET experiments generate transcription factor binding sites. A binding site is defined as a region of the genome that is highly enriched by specific Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) against a transcription factor, which indicates that the transcription factor binds specifically to this region. The protein factors displayed in the track include estrogen receptor alpha (ERa), RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF).
