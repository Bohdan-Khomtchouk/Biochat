TITLE
Differential regulation of the two ferrochelatase paralogues in Shewanella loihica PV-4 in response to environmental stresses

ORGANISM
Shewanella loihica PV-4

SUMMARY
The microarray experiment compare the transcriptome of PV-4 wild type versus the deltahemH1 mutant, a PPIX accumulating strain. Only part of the data is used in the manuscript and we are working on this dataset for future manuscripts

DESIGN
The wild type and deltahemH1 cell were revived and then cultured into late log-phase for collection, when significant PPIX accumulation occurred. Three biological replicates for wild type and deltahemH1
