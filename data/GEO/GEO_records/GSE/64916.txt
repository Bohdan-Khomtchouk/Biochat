TITLE
Gastric carcinoma patients and healthy subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastric cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers and is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Approximately 40% of global gastric cancer cases occur in China, with peritoneal metastasis being the prevalent form of recurrence and metastasis in advanced disease ( > 50%). Currently, there are limited clinical approaches for predicting and treatment of peritoneal metastasis, resulting in a 6- month average survival time. By comprehensive genome analysis will uncover the pathogenesis of peritoneal metastasis. Here we describe a comprehensive whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing analysis of one advanced gastric cancer case, including non-cancerous mucosa, primary cancer and matched peritoneal metastatic cancer. The peripheral blood is used as normal control.
