TITLE
Molecular analysis of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with and without associated serous tubal intra-epithelial carcinoma [miRNA expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Many high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs) of the pelvis are thought to originate in the distal portion of the fallopian tube.  Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) lesions are the putative precursor to HGSC and identifiable in ~50% of advanced stage cases. To better understand the molecular etiology of HGSCs, we report a multi-center integrated genomic analysis of advanced stage tumors with and without STIC lesions and normal tissues. The most significant focal DNA SCNAs were shared between cases with and without STIC lesions. RNA sequence and miRNA data did not identify any clear separation between cases with and without STIC lesions.  HGSCs had molecular profiles more similar to normal fallopian tube epithelium than ovarian surface epithelium or peritoneum. The data suggest that the molecular features of HGSCs with and without associated STIC lesions are mostly shared, indicating a common biologic origin, likely to be the distal fallopian tube among all cases.

DESIGN
In this study, 96 previously untreated high-grade serous carcinoma samples were selected to have half with STIC lesions and half without.  Molecular assays were performed that included RNAseq, microRNA expression, and copy number variation.
