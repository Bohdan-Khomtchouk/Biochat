TITLE
Dynamic transcriptome structure of E. coli K-12 MG1655 across growth

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
High-resolution transcriptional profiling of E. coli across nine timepoints of growth in rich media (LB). Samples collected from lag phase to stationary phase of growth. High-resolution tiling array to detect conditional operon isoforms. Custom Agilent array designed to detect condition-specific transcriptional isoforms. Array designed for E coli K12 MG1655 genome. Tiled using 23bp sliding window. Includes > 10,000 probes surrounding predicted operon break sites at 6 bp resolution.

DESIGN
Nine growth time points in the experiment. Two-color arrays. Each time point compared to mid-exponential phase of growth.
