TITLE
Bowel expression profiles of infants with gastrointestinal conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes differentially expressed in neonatal bowel tissues of different gastrointestinal conditions.

DESIGN
Bowel tissues were collected from infants who underwent surgery treatment for necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP). Infants with other non-inflammatory, congenital intestinal conditions were employed as the Surgical-Control. Differential whole genome microarray analysis was performed.
