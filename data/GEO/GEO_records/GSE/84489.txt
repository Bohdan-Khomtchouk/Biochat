TITLE
mRNA microarray analysis on young adults C.elegans exposed to GO and rGO

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
In order to evaluate the identification of genes and pathways, the global gene expression profiles were assessed in response to GO and rGO on nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. We performed whole genome DNA microarray experiments using age synchronized young adult C. elegans population exposed to GO and rGO for 24h. We used whole genome microarrays to screen for global changed in C. elegans transcription profiles and with subsequent quantitative analysis conducted on selected genes.

DESIGN
Young adults of C.elegans were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL200 [Celegans] Affymetrix C. elegans Genome Array
