TITLE
Altered expression of genes in lncRNA-LBCS, hnRNPK and PTBP1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identify a lncRNA which low expresses and regulates self-renewal of bladder cancer stem cell. So we named it lncRNA-LBCS (low expresses in bladder cancer stem cell). Further study finds that lncRNA-LBCS bind to hnRNPK and PTBP1. To investigate the genes regulated by these, we knockdown lncRNA-LBCS, hnRNPK and PTBP1 by siRNA, respectively, and perform high-throughput sequence. So we identify a series of genes regulated by lncRNA-LBCS, hnRNPK and PTBP1, respectively.

DESIGN
Bladder cancer cell line UM-UC-3 was transfected with the contol siRNA or lncRNA-LBCS, hnRNPK and PTBP1 siRNA for 48h, respectively. The RNA of the transfected cells was extracted and sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform and 100 bp paired-end reads were generated.
