TITLE
Differentially expressed mRNA transcripts in the placenta delivered by preterm versus term spontaneous labour

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that preterm spontaneous labor involves aberrant changes in mRNA expression in the placenta. To test this hypothesis, we interrogated the mRNA levels of > 50,000 genes and transcript variants using gene expression microarray (Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array, Affymetrix) on 5 placentas collected from preterm spontaneous delivery ( < 34 weeks of gestation) and another 5 placentas collected from term spontaneous delivery (38-39 weeks). We have identified 229 and 162 genes that were up- or down-regulated, respectively, for more than 3-fold in the preterm placentas compared to the term placentas (Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, with multiple testing correction by the Benjamini-Hochberg method, adjusted p-value < = 0.05).

DESIGN
Placentas collected from (i) preterm spontaneous delivery ( < 34 weeks of gestation) and (ii) term spontaneous delivery (38-39 weeks of gestation) were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To identify gene expression patterns that are commonly involved in preterm spontaneous labour, we analyzed 5 placentas from each of these 2 groups and tested for any differentially expressed genes by Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test.
