TITLE
Molecular profiling of three tumor subtypes in Ptch medulloblastomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we discovered that medulloblastomas that form in Ptch mice are composed of three different sibtypes depending on the cell of origin and tumor progression. The goal was to identify gene signature that can distinguish the three subtypes

DESIGN
RNA from tumor tissues from the three subtypes were extracted by Trizol and hybridized on Affy St1.0 chips for analysis

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
