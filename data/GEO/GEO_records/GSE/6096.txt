TITLE
Gene Expression Time Courses of CH999 with High or Low Copy Number Plasmids

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
Time courses of Streptomyces CH999/pKOS011-26 and CH999/pKOS011-26* the low and high copy number strains, respectively, to examine gene expression differences between these two strains. Of particular interest were the transcript levels of the activator gene actII-ORF4 and the polyketide synthase gene cluster eryA. Mycelia were grown in 50 mL R5 liquid medium with thiostrepton drug selection at 50 micrograms per mL in a 30 degrees Celsius shaker incubator. mRNA were harvested at the time points indicated. These data show that actII-ORF4 and eryA transcripts were more highly expressed in the high copy number strain than in the low copy number strain. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series. Strain Name Elapsed Time: Hours after inoculation Keywords: time_series_design
