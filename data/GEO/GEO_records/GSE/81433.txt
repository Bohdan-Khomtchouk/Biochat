TITLE
Gene Expression Data from Adult and Embryo Thymic Epithelial Cells (TEC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to understand the genome wide differences in Adult and fetal cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTEC) and medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC)

DESIGN
Embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) wildtype fetal thymi were cultured for 7 days on AIM-V and cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells were sorted from these embryos. We also isolated cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells from 1-2 week old adult mice. RNA was extracted from these samples and hybridized on Affymetrix Mouse Gene microarrays to help understand the genome wide changes in adult and fetal cTEC and mTEC.
