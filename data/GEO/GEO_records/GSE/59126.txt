TITLE
Different Preference of Degradome in Invasion versus Angiogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesized altered expression of Proteases in calls capable of physiological invasion vs angiogenesis. We analyzed trophoblasts isolated from first trimester placenta that are invasive, and placental endothelial cells, that gave a high angiogenic potential. We found different expression levels of most proteases. We found that the expression of proteases differes in cells performing invasion vs cells performing angiogenesis.

DESIGN
Trophoblasts were isolated from first trimester placenta, endothelial cells were isolated from third trimester placenta. A pool of 5 preparations from different cell types was used for each microarray.
