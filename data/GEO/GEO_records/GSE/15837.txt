ORGANISM
Southern bean mosaic virus ; Potato virus X ; Plum pox virus ; Tobacco mosaic virus ; Bean pod mottle virus ; Arabis mosaic virus ; Tomato ringspot virus ; Tobacco ringspot virus ; unidentified ; Zinnia violacea ; Prunus necrotic ringspot virus ; Taraxacum officinale ; Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus

SUMMARY
70mer probes were designed to detect plant viruses infection in genus level. This microarray platform is able to detect 169 plant virus species of 13 virus genera.

DESIGN
Virus sampels were extracted from infected plant hosts. Genomic RNA was extracted and hybridized to the microarray.

PLATFORM
