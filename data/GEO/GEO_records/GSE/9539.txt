TITLE
Global transcriptome changes in HepG2 cells exposed to copper

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our hypothesis is that copper modulates the activity of multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways to affect transcription. We have previously shown that copper activates transcription through both metal- and oxidative stress-responsive signal transduction pathways. Since the global molecular mechanisms underlying copper toxicity have not been well elucidated in humans, we have profiled transcriptome changes in HepG2 cells exposed to 100, 200, 400 and 600 uM copper for 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours using a human oligonucleotide microarray. Differentially expressed genes were identified, and integrated into biological and functional pathways through Gene Ontology analysis. Global gene expression profile was overlaid onto biomolecular interaction networks and signal transduction cascades using pathway mapping and interactome identification. Keywords: copper toxicity, HepG2 cells, copper concentrations: 100, 200, 400 and 600 uM, exposure times: 4, 8, 12, and 24 h, expression profiles of copper-responsive genes
