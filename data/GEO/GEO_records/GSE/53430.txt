TITLE
Expression data from young and old zebrafish brain.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Brains are sexually dimorphic in adult zebrafish. We dissected brains from young and old, adult zebrafish, from both males and females. Brains are not pooled but analyzed as indivual samples.

DESIGN
Four groups of wild-type zebrafish (AB strain) were used for this study: young (7.5-8.5 months old) male and female and old (31-36 months old) male and female. There were three animals per group for a total of 12 animals in the study.
