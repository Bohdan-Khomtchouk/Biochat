TITLE
Potato autopolyploidy

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
A synthetic autopolyploidy plant series O37 was developed from chromosome doublings of a monoploid (12 chromosome) plant derived from a Solanum phureja background. Monoploid (1x), diploid (2xR3 and 2xR5) and tetraploid (4x) plants were used for gene expression profiling. Total RNA was isolated from growing leaflets of six plants of each genotype at 20 day after planting. Total RNA was isolated and amplified from growing root tips of each genotype at 7 days after planting. Keywords: Genotype,  Tissue type,  Biorep, Loop design
