TITLE
Transcript profiling of Arabidopsis albino msh1 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The soybean msh1 RNAi transgenic line show various growth phenotype. We use microarray analysis to characterize gene expression pattern for two of the phenotypes - variegation and stunted growth.

DESIGN
Wild type and Arabidopsis msh1 mutant albino tissues were collected for RNA extration and hybridization on Affymetrix.
