TITLE
Chromosomal deletions linked to p53 loss of heterozygosity promote cancer through p53-independent mechanisms

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of current study is to identify the differentiated gene expression associated with mouse 11B3 deletion, syntenic to human chromosome 17p13.1. We compared four different mouse acute myeloid leukemia cells, freshly isolated from mouse bone marrows with either 11B3fl/p53fl;shNf1;shMll3;Vav1-Cre or p53fl/fl;shNf1;shMll3;Vav1-Cre. The RNA-seq results indicate that genes located on chromosome 11B3 mostly reduce gene expression level in 11B3 deleted leukemia cells.

DESIGN
Examination RNA expression level in 11B3-deleted vs p53-loss only samples.
