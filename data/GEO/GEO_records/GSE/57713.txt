TITLE
Temporal Dynamics of Human Cerebrospinal Fluid Vesicle microRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine whether the microRNA content of CSF vesicles changes throughout life we performed experiments including miRNA microarrays. Hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that the miRNA content of CSF vesicles changes when patients less than 2 years are compared to those older than 70 years of age.

DESIGN
CSF vesicles were fractionated and isolated from patients of different ages, total RNA extracted, and subjected to miRNA microarray analysis
