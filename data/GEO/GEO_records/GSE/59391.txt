TITLE
Deciphering the gene expression response of human immune cells to stimulation with RSV in the context of antibodies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RSV is an important pathogen in young infants, who are largely dependent on innate immunity and the presence of maternal antibodies. However, not much is known about the interaction between the immune system and antibodies. Here, we studied the gene expression of human immune cells (PBMCs) after RSV infection in the presence of antibodies.

DESIGN
After 24h of stimulation of human PBMCs (n=4) with RPMI medium, 10% human serum,10%  antibody depleted human serum in combination with RPMI medium, RSV (MOI 0.2) and inactivated RSV (MOI 0.2), total RNA was isolated and labeled cDNA was generated according to standard Nimblegen gene expression array protocols and hybridized to 12-plex 135K human gene expression arrays for read-out.
