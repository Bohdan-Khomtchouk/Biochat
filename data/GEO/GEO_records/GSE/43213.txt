TITLE
Gene expression analysis of B cell differentiation using B cell blasts and developmentally arrested plasmablasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In vitro generated blasts from B cells deficient in prdm1 were isolated according to whether they were attempting to express Blimp1, reported by a GFP cassette knocked into the prdm1 locus

DESIGN
After four days stimulation with CD40L, IL4 and IL5, cells were FACS sorted into GFP+ and GFP- populations, RNA extracted and gene expression analysed by microarray. Data presented in Peparzak et al, 2013, Fig 3b.
