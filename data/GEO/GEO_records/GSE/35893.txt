TITLE
Transcript profiling of Arabidopsis msh1 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis msh1 mutant show various growth phenotype. We use microarray analysis to characterize gene expression pattern for two of the phenotypes - variegation and stunted growth.

DESIGN
Wild type and msh1 RNAi variegated and stunted tissues were collected for RNA extration and hybridization on Affymetrix.
