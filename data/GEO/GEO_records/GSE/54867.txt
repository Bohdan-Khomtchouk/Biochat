TITLE
Expression of miRNAs in human ex-vivo CD8+ T cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim was to assess miRNA expression in 3 human ex-vivo CD8+ T cell subsets which span from antigen inexperienced  cells (Naïve) to early memory cells (central memory, Tcm) and later stage memory cells (effector memory, Tem) CD8+ T cells  were sorted on a FACS Aria II machine. N = naïve = CD8+, CCR7+, CD45RA+, CD45RO-, Tcm = central memory =  CD8+, CCR7+, CD45RA-, CD45RO-,Tem= effector memory =  CD8+, CCR7-, CD45RA-, CD45RO+

DESIGN
PBMC were isolated from 3 healthy human donors and  sorted by FACS into 3 CD8+ T cell subsets. Total RNA was purified using the miRVANA kit (Ambion)
