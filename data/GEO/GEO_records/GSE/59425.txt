TITLE
The organoid generated from murine small intestine: mCherry-positive vs. mCherry-negative

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The organoids heterogenously expressed mCherry by the lentivirus transduction were dissociated into single cells. A single mCherry- positive and -negative cell were collected and grown up to the organoids, respectivery. The difference of the gene expression profile between  mCherry- positive and -negative organoids was assessd by maicroarray.

DESIGN
mCherry- positive vs. -negative organoids

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
