TITLE
Genome-wide maps of binding sites of Nanog-like and Mxtx2 in blastula stage zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Here, using ChIP-Seq, we examined the targets of Nanog-like and Mxtx2 in blastula stage zebrafish embryos. We found that Nanog-like bind to its known targets like Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog-like. Nanog-like also bound to genes involved in extraembryonic lineage differentiation, like gata3 and krt4 for EVL differentiation, and mxtx2 and slc26a1 for YSL differentiation, mesoderm specification like ntl and tbx3, cell movement like wnt11 and cxcr4b, and signaling genes like ndr1, bmp2b, fgf8a and wnt8a. The binding profile suggests that Nanog-like may play a versatile role involving many developmental processes. We found 11.3% of the genes (1751 out of all annotated 15500 zebrafish genes) and 43.6% of the YSL genes (118 out of 271 genes expressed in the YSL) were bound by Mxtx2, suggesting Mxtx2 bound directly to YSL genes to activate their expression
