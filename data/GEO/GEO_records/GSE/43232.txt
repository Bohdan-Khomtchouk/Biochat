TITLE
Gene expression analysis of F9 cells double knock-down for Sox7 and Sox17

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the expression of F9 cells after knockdown of Sox7 and Sox17 during their primitive endoderm differnetiation induction with retinoic acid. Results provide information on the endodermal gene expression program regulated by Sox7 and Sox17.

DESIGN
Sox7 Sox17 double KD vs. control in F9 cells
