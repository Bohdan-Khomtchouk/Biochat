TITLE
Ro60 iCLIP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autoantibodies target the RNA-binding protein Ro60 in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sj√∂gren's syndrome. However, whether Ro60 and its associated RNAs contribute to disease pathogenesis is unclear. We catalogued the Ro60-associated RNAs in human cell lines.

DESIGN
iCLIP in 2 cell lines (GM12878, K562).

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
