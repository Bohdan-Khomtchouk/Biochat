TITLE
Expression data from control and Setd2 IEC-deficient mice intestine [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We conduct transcriptome comparison of APCmin and APCmin; Setd2IEC-/- mice intestine to gain genomic insights on the biological processes that Setd2 is involved in colon cancer cells. More than 3000 known genes were found changed in the Setd2 depleted cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) show that the prominent altered pathways in the Setd2 depleted cells are related to Wnt signaling pathway and cell stemness.

DESIGN
Intestinal mRNA profiles of 2-month old control (APCmin) and APCmin; Setd2IEC-/- mice were generated by sequencing. Each RNA sample was from 3 littermates RNA mixture.
