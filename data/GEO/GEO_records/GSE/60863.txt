TITLE
Exon-level analysis of 1231 samples originating from 134 Caucasian individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This data set was generated by the UK Brain Expression Consortium and consists of gene expression data generated from post-mortem human brain samples, dissected from 10 brain regions and originating from a large cohort of neurologically and neuropathologically normal individuals. The UK Brain Expression Consortium has generated gene expression data on a large cohort of neurologically and neuropathologically normal individuals in order to better understand gene expression differences across the human brain.

DESIGN
1231 samples are analysed in total and these samples originate from 134 Caucasian individuals. From each individual, up to ten brain regions were sampled and analysed.
