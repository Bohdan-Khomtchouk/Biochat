TITLE
RNASeq comparing Thpok and LRF-deficient Tregs to Control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Thpok is required for intrathymic CD4+ T cell differentiation and, together with its homolog LRF, supports CD4+ T cell helper effector responses, However, it is not known if these factors are needed for the T regulatory arm of MHC-II responses. We inactivated the genes encoding both factors in differentiated Treg cells, to see whether how they are redundantly required to maintain the size and function of the post-thymic Treg pool and for immune homeostasis.

DESIGN
We compared YFP+ LRF and Thpok-deficient Treg cells with two distinct controls: (i) CD25+ YFP– cells (Thpok and LRF-sufficient ‘animal control’ cells, expressing the Foxp3+ allele) obtained from the same female mice as the YFP+ Treg cells, and (ii) YFP+ Treg cells from Foxp3+/ YFP Cre Thpok+/+ Lrf+/+ female mice (‘genetic controls’ which express the Foxp3YFP Cre allele).
