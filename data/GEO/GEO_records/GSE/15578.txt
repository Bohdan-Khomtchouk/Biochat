TITLE
Expression Data from Ovarian Surface Kinome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human kinome is incolved in multiple function in the life cycle of cells, and ther differntial expression in cacner suggests that protein kinases play an important role in tumor progression and proliferation. To delineate pathways that may be important for neoplastic change in women at high risk for ovarian cancer, we compared the expression signature of surface kinases in normal ovarian surface epithelium with ovarian epithelium from patients at high risk, and epithelial ovarian cancer using Affymetrix expresion array HG U133Plus2.
