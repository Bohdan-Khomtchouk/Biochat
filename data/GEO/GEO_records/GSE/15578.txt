TITLE
Expression Data from Ovarian Surface Kinome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human kinome is incolved in multiple function in the life cycle of cells, and ther differntial expression in cacner suggests that protein kinases play an important role in tumor progression and proliferation. To delineate pathways that may be important for neoplastic change in women at high risk for ovarian cancer, we compared the expression signature of surface kinases in normal ovarian surface epithelium with ovarian epithelium from patients at high risk, and epithelial ovarian cancer using Affymetrix expresion array HG U133Plus2.

DESIGN
A total of 18 ovarian samples were collected. The number of samples and subjects for each group were: 5 cancer samples (5 subjects), 6 normal samples (4 patients) and 7 high-risk samples (5 subjects). After the initial inspection, one cancer sample (Sample 9) was excluded from the statistical analysis due to a poor RNA quality.
