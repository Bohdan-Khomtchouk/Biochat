TITLE
Physiological stability of Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 under continuous culture conditions

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705

SUMMARY
A continuous culture of Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 was carried out in a 2.5-l reactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland), equipped with a Biospectra control system (Biospectra AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) and containing 2 l of MRS, added of 0.05% cysteine, inoculated with 2 % (v/v) preculture. The temperature was maintained at 37°C and the pH at 6.0 by addition of 5 M NaOH. The culture was stirred constantly at 250 rpm using two rushton type propellers. Anaerobic conditions were maintained by flushing the headspace of the reactor with CO2. After 8 h in batch mode the culture was run in continuous mode at a dilution rate of 0.1 h-1. Fresh medium was added using a peristaltic pump (Alitea, Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland), and fermented broth harvested with a second peristaltic pump (Alitea, Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) set at a slightly higher flow rate. A stabilization period of 90 h (corresponding to nine reactor volume changes) was operated prior culture monitoring (t=0). Aliquots of 2 ml taken at t=31, 134 and 211 h were centrifuged (4,000 g, 1 min, room temperature) for transcriptomic analysis. Supernatants were discarded and cell pellets snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC until RNA-extraction. Keywords: Time course of Bifidobacterium longum in continuous culture
