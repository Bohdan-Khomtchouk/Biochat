TITLE
GE expression profile of PBMCs in healthy subjects and MS patients after extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake - PART 3 - MS Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of PBMCs in patients with MS following extra virgin olive oil intake. The aim of the present study was to investigate the whole-genome gene and miRNA profiles of after EVOO intake. Results provide the information of changes in PBMCs transcriptome following EVOO intake.

DESIGN
RNA obtained from PBMCs of the same patients before and after extra virgin olive oil intake (paired samples). Comparisons: T0 vs. T1 (paired samples)
