TITLE
TMEM88 knockdown during human embryonic stem cell cardiac differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TMEM88 is indispensable for heart development and acts in the pre-cardiac mesoderm to specify lineage commitment of the cardiovascular progenitor cell through inhibition of Wnt signaling.

DESIGN
2 different lentiviruses expression shRNA targeting different domains of the TMEM88 locus were transduced into undifferentiated hES cells. Cells were puromycin selected then differentiated along the cardiac lineage. Total RNA was taken at day 5 of differentiation when the cardiovascular progenitor cell arises. 1 sample for each shRNA and 2 samples for control shRNA were analyzed by array
