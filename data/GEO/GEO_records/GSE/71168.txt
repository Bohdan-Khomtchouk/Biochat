TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse spleen XCR1+ DC at steady state, 3 hours after polyI:C or 12 hours after STAg i.v. injection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to use global gene expression profiling to compare the global genetic reprogramming of spleen XCR1+ DC upon in vivo stimulation with a viral-type ligand, polyI:C which strongly induces type I interferons, versus with a ligand derived from an intracellular parasite which strongly induces IFN-g.

DESIGN
DC were isolated as previously described (Robbins SH et al. Genome Biol. 2008. PMID: 18218067; Baranek T et al. Cell Host Microbe. 2012. PMID: 23084923), from the spleens of wild-type C57BL/6 mice 12 hours after i.v. injection of 20µg of STAg. DC subsets were sorted by flow cytometry according to the marker combinations described in the “characteristics: phenotype” field for each sample. The data for spleen XCR1+ DC isolated from untreated control animals or from mice that had been injected i.v. with 100µg polyI:C 3 hours before organ harvest have been previously published and are available in the GEO database GSE39556 series. The complete dataset representing: (1) the Samples corresponding to STAg stimulation and (2) the untreated control Samples and the Samples corresponding to polyI:C stimulation from Series GSE39556 (re-processed using RMA), is linked below as a supplementary file.
