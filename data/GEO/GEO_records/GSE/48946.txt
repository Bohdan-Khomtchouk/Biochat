TITLE
Gene expression of non-apoptotic pancreatic acinar cell death with autophagy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 3 (Spink3) is a trypsin inhibitor in the pancreas. Spink3-/- pancreatic acinar cells are dead with excessive autophagy at birth (p0.5). To prove the role of nonapoptotic cell death with autophagy, we generated by transgenic technology the pancreas of Spink3-/-;XKI/+ mice contained both normal and dying acinar cells with autophagy. In this new mouse model, chronic inflammation occurred in the pancreas, indicating that some signals from nonapoptotic dead cell induce chronic inflammation in the pancreas.

DESIGN
All samples were the pancreas at p0.5. Sample 1 and 2 are the pancreas from wild type (Spink3+/+, control) mice. Sample 3 and 4 are the pancreas from Spink3-/-, which all pancreatic acinar cells show induced nonapoptotic cell death with autophagy. Sample 5 and 6 are the pancreas from Spink3-/-XKI/+, about half acinar cells are normal, but other acinar cells show induced nonapoptotic cell death with autophagy.
