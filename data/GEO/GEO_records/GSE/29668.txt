TITLE
A2780 and OVCAR-3 Cells:Control vs. LS-98 treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human ovarian cancer cells comparing control vehicle-treated A2780 and OVCAR-3 (Human ovarian cancer cell lines) cells with A2780 and OVCAR-3 cells treated with 5Î¼M LS-98 for 24 hours.Goal was to determine the effects of LS-98 compound  on the global A2780 and OVCAR-3 cells gene expression.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, control vehicle-treated A2780 and OVCAR-3  vs. LS098 treated-A2780 and OVCAR-3 cells. Biological replicates: 2 replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
