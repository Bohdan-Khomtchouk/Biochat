TITLE
The miRNA expression profiling in Huh7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Botanic drug CA regulated the miRNAs expression in tumor cells. We used microarrays to detail the differentiation miRNAs expression in Huh7 cells treated with CA or not.

DESIGN
The Huh7 cells were untreated, or treated with 25 μM or 50 μM of CA for 24 hrs.
