TITLE
The DPYSL2 gene connects mTOR and schizophrenia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a transcriptome comparison of HEK293 cells modified at the DPYSL2 gene promoter dinucleotide repeat (chr8:26,435,510-26,435,534) by CRISPR/Cas9 to change from the common 11 repeats to the more rare 13 repeats

DESIGN
11/11 repeat HEK 293 cells were modified by CRISPR/Cas 9. Cell were flow sorted by the co-transfected GFP and single cells were expanded. From those we selected 4 modified and 8 unmodified clones for RNA seq. RNA was extracted at 80% confluency

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
