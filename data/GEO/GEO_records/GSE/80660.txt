TITLE
MicroRNA-155 is upregulated in Hoxa9/Meis1 leukemia inducing cells but is dispensable for in vivo transformation and leukemia development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OBJECTIVE: The microRNA miR-155 is upregulated in Hoxa9 and Meis1 leukemia inducing cells (LIC) , and miR-155 accelerates the onset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) together with Hoxa9 but through largely unknown molecular mechanisms. The impact of  miR-155 on accelerated onset of leukemia in the context of Hoxa9 and Meis1 is also unclear. To further resolve this, we performed a gene expression profiling, in the context of Hoxa9 and Meis1 leukemogenesis with miR-155 knocked out. RESULTS: Gene expression profiling of Hoxa9/Meis1 LIC without miR-155 does not delay the onset of AML and the gene expression changes are small

DESIGN
Murine bone marrow cells with or without miR-155 knocked out were transduced with Hoxa9-GFP + Meis1-YFP vectors and harvest for mRNA expression array. Three independent experiments were performed for each of the different conditions included in the study. Cells from were also transplanted into lethally irradiated mice to test for their transforming and leukemic potential.
