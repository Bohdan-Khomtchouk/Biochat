TITLE
Mouse embryonic kidneys (E13.5): mutant (UB HDAC1,2-/-) vs. wild type

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse embryonic kidneys (E13.5) comparing UB HDAC1,2-/- kidneys with wild type kidneys. Studies in our lab showed that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and 2 (HDAC2) perform redundant, yet essential functions in the developing mouse ureteric bud (UB) tissue. Double deletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the UB results in impaired UB branching morphogenesis, followed by severe kidney dysgenesis. The goal of the microarray analysis was to identify the genetic pathways controlled by HDAC1 and 2 in the UB.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: E13.5 mutant kidneys (UB HDAC1,2-/-)  vs. E13.5 wild type kidneys . Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 UB HDAC1,2-/- replicates. Two-color Agilent 4x44k chips with dye-swaps on 2 of 4 arrays.
