TITLE
Characterization of small RNAs and their targets in Lactuca sativa

ORGANISM
Lactuca sativa

SUMMARY
The small RNAs and their targets were characterized in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) genome by deep sequencing the small RNA populations of leaf tissues (cv. Salinas, Cobham and Diana), inoculated with Bremia and mock. The small RNA targets were also validated using PARE/degradome data derived from the same tissues.

DESIGN
We generated integrative maps of small RNA profiles (sRNA) and degradome (PARE) profiles to characterize the miRNAs and their targets from lettuce.
