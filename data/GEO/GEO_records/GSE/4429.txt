TITLE
Analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana gene expression in response to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae ES4326

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In order to protect themselves from pathogens, plants activate a battery of defense pathways, many of which involve changes in gene expression.  We are interested in identifying plant genes that are differentially expressed in response to pathogen exposure, with the ultimate goal of studying the roles of these genes in plant defense. Keywords: disease response
