TITLE
Separated and combined effects of the over-expression of a plant defensin and of a 20 mM Zn treatment on yeast.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The expression of plant defensins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to increase tolerance to Zn of yeast (Mirouze et al., 2006; Shahzad et al., 2013). The present transcriptomic approach has been conducted to uncover the mechanism underlying this phenotype. WT yeast was compared to yeast expressing the AhPFF1.1b plant defensin when grown in both control medium and medium supplemented with 20 mM ZnSO4.

DESIGN
4 conditions with 2 biological replicates compared: control yeast (BY4741) grown on control medium, control yeast grown in the presence of 20 mM ZnSO4, yeast expressing the AhPDF1.1b defensin grown in control medium, yeast expressing the AhPDF1.1b defensin grown in the presence of 20 mM ZnSO4
