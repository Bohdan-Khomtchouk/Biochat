TITLE
MDA-9/Syntenin regulates differentiation and angiogenesis programs in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified MDA-9/Syntenin (8q12) as a key component of HNSCC differentiation and angiogenesis. Robust reduction in the expression of cyclinD1, CDK4, CTNNB1, STAT3 and PI3K were evident in MDA- 9/Syntenein depleted cells, which was reversed following MDA-9/Syntenin overexpression in immortalized oral epithelial cells.

DESIGN
To further elucidate the role of MDA-9/Syntenin in tumor growth and epithelial cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo by sielnicng its expression.
