TITLE
Genome wide expression analysis of the Hypothalamic control of Mammalian Puberty

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of hypothalami from female animals at different juvenil developmental reproductive stages. Results provide insight into the role of the hypothalamus in controlling the onset of puberty.

DESIGN
SD rats were housed (4/cage) in a controlled environment and euthanized at different ages (Early Juvenile: 21 days, Juvenile: 26 days, Late Juvenile: 29 days, Early Proestrus (before ovulation): 29-31 days, Late Proestus (the day of first ovulation): 31 days.  Rats were anesthetized and brains were rapidly removed. The hypothalamus was dissected away from the rest of the brain and flash frozen. Total RNA was isolated from each sample using Qiagen's RNeasy Mini Kit (Valencia, CA). Samples were bioanalyzed on a RNA 6000 Nano chip kit to check for integrity and concentration before sending it to the GMSR-Illumina-Core.
