TITLE
microRNA data from high-fat diet fed mice with and without exercise

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with obesity and lifestyle. Exercise is known to be beneficial for NAFLD treatment. Recent studies have shown the critical involvement of microRNA in NAFLD. However, it is unclear whether exercise could prevent NAFLD via miRNA targeting. We used microarrays to examine microRNA profiles in high-fat diet fed mice with and without exercise in comparison to normal diet fed mice.
