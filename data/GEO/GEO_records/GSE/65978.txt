TITLE
microRNA data from high-fat diet fed mice with and without exercise

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with obesity and lifestyle. Exercise is known to be beneficial for NAFLD treatment. Recent studies have shown the critical involvement of microRNA in NAFLD. However, it is unclear whether exercise could prevent NAFLD via miRNA targeting. We used microarrays to examine microRNA profiles in high-fat diet fed mice with and without exercise in comparison to normal diet fed mice.

DESIGN
Mouse livers from normal diet fed mice (group C, n=5), high-fat diet fed mice without exercise (group HF, n=5), and high-fat diet fed mice with exercise (groupe HE, n=5) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix miRNA 3.0.
