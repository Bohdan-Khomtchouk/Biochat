TITLE
Expression data from mouse  T-cell lymphomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic expression of  TLX1 induces T-cell leukemias in mice. We used microarrays to identify the gene expression signatures associated with TLX1 tumors compared with different genetic models T acute lymphoblastic lymphoma.

DESIGN
RNA extraction from T-cell tumors from mice with different T-cell lymphoma-predisposing genetic backgrouds.
