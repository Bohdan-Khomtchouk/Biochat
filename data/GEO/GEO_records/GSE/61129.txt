TITLE
Exonic variants associated with development of Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Diseases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is one phenotype of asthma, often in the form of a severe and sudden attack. Due to time consuming and laborious oral aspirin challenge (OAC) for diagnosis of AERD, non-invasive biomarkers have been searched. Therefore, we scrutinize AERD-associated exonic SNPs and examine the diagnostic potential of combination of these candidate SNPs to predict AERD

DESIGN
DNA obtained from 164 AERD subjects, 397 subjects with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA), 398 normal controls and 10 null samples were subjected to Exome Chip assay of 240K SNPs. 1023 model (210-1) were generated from combination of the top 10 SNPs selected by p-values. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was calculated for each model. SNP functional Portal and PolyPhen-2 was used to validate the functional significance of the candidate SNPs
