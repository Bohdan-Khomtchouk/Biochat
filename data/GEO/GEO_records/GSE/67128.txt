TITLE
Comparative whole-transcriptomic analysis between normal and AKAP-Lbc-depleted human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have the unique property of immortality, ability to infinitely self-renew and survive in vitro. In contrast to tumor-deribed cells, their immortality are free from any genomic abberations. Instead, they depend on the AKAP-Lbc/Rho signaling cascade. To understand the downstream way, we performed RNA-seq analyses between normal and AKAP-Lbc-depleted hESCs using the doxycyclin-inducible gene silensing strategy.

DESIGN
We use the genetically modified hESCs in which AKAP-13-targeting shRNA is induced by doxycyclin(dox) treatment. To minimize cell loss during treatment, anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-XL is overexpressed. We collected RNA from dox-treated and untreated cells in biological triplicate. We measured gene expression in these 2 sample groups using RNA-seq (illumina HiSeq) .
