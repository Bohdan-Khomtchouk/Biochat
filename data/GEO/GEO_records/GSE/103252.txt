TITLE
U1 snRNP telescripting regulates size-function stratified human genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This project looks into how U1 snRNP inhibition causes a loss of telescripting through premature cleavage and polyadenylation based on the size and function of human genes.

DESIGN
Knockdown of U1 snRNP by antisense morpholino followed by examining transcriptome changes by RNA-seq and RNA pol II profile changes by ChIP-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens) GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
