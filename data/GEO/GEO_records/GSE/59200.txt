TITLE
Cytosine methylation data generated by HELP-tagging from human osteosarcoma biopsy samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children.  Validated markers for disease prognosis available at diagnosis are lacking.  No genome-wide DNA methylation studies linked to clinical outcomes have been reported in osteosarcoma.  To address this, we tested the methylome at over 1.1 million loci in 15 osteosarcoma biopsy samples obtained prior to the initiation of therapy and correlated these molecular data with disease outcomes.  At the tested loci, samples obtained from patients who experienced disease relapse were generally more methylated than those from patients who did not have recurrence.  In samples from patients who went on to have recurrent disease, increased DNA methylation was found at gene bodies, intergenic regions and empirically-annotated candidate enhancers, whereas candidate gene promoters were unusual for a more balanced distribution of increased and decreased DNA methylation.  A locus at the TLR4 gene demonstrates one of strongest associations between DNA methylation and five year event-free survival, with empirical annotation of this locus showing promoter characteristics.  Our data indicate that DNA methylation information has potential to be predictive of outcome in pediatric osteosarcoma, and that both promoters and non-promoter loci are potentially informative in DNA methylation studies.
