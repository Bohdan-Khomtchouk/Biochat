TITLE
Dehydration and Fixed-Carbon Starvation of Brassinosteroid related mutants in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report global gene expression profilies of Brassinosteroid related Arabidopsis mutants in response to dehydration and fixed-carbon starvation stresses by RNA-seq

DESIGN
Arabidopsis plants of listed genotypes were grown for 4 weeks under long day (16 hour light) conditions before being subjected to control, 4 hour dehydration, or 5 day fixed carbon starvation treatments.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
