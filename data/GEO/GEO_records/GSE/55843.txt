TITLE
Loss and dysfunction of Vdelta2+ gammadelta-low T cells is associated with clinical tolerance to malaria

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gammadelta T cells from Ugandan children were tested for their responsiveness to stimulation with malaria parasites.

DESIGN
Independent PBMC samples from children were incubated with Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells for 6 h post-treatment, and Vdelta2+ gammadelta T cells were double sorted by FACS directly into an RNA lysis buffer. RNA was isolated, amplified using 2 rounds of linear amplification, and hybridized to Agilent Human 8x60k microarrays as a single color experiment.
