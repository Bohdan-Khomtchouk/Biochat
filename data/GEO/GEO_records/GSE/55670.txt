TITLE
High intake of dietary sugar enhances bisphenol A (BPA) disruption and reveals ribosome-mediated pathways of toxicity: Chronic Exposure

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Fly strain y[1]; bw[1]; e[4]; ci[1] ey[R] was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center. Flies were reared in incubators at 25°C, 65% of relative humidity, and photoperiod of 12 hours. For gene expression analyses flies were reared in media containing BPA, high sugar, and BPA + high sugar (chronic exposure). After development, newly emerged adult male flies were collected, aged for 48 hours, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. We collected four replicas of each sample and stored tehm at -80°C. Total RNA was extracted from whole flies using TRIzol (Life Technologies). The synthesis of cDNA and its labeling with fluorescent dyes (Cy3 and Cy5) as well as hybridization reactions were carried out using 3DNA protocols and reagents (Genisphere). Slides were scanned using Axon 400B scanner (Axon Instruments) and GenePix Pro 6.0 software. Foreground fluorescence of dye intensities was normalized by the Loess method in Bioconductor / Limma.
