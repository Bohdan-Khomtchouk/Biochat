SUMMARY
Cyclin T1-dependent genes in activated Jurkat cells. HIV-1 is dependent upon cellular co-factors to mediate its replication cycle in CD4+ T cells and macrophages, the two major cell types infected by the virus in vivo.  One critical co-factor is Cyclin T1, a subunit of a general RNA polymerase II elongation factor known as P-TEFb.  Cyclin T1 is targeted directly by the viral Tat protein to activate proviral transcription.  Cyclin T1 is up-regulated when resting CD4+ T cells are activated and during macrophage differentiation or activation, conditions that are also necessary for high levels of HIV-1 replication.  Because Cyclin T1 is a subunit of a transcription factor, the up-regulation of Cyclin T1 in these cells results in the induction of cellular genes, some of which might be HIV-1 co-factors.  Using shRNA depletions of Cyclin T1 and transcriptional profiling, we identified 54 cellular mRNAs that are Cyclin T1-dependent for their induction in activated CD4+ T cells and during macrophage differentiation and activation.  The promoters for these Cyclin T1-dependent genes (CTDGs) are over-represented in two transcription factor binding sites, SREBP1 and ARP1.  Notably, 10 of these CTDGs have been reported to be involved in HIV-1 replication, a significant over-representation of such genes when compared to randomly generated lists of 54 genes (p value < 0.00021).  SiRNA depletions of two CTDGs identified here, CDK11 and Casein kinase1gamma1, suggest that these genes are also involved in HIV-1 replication.  It is therefore likely that the 54 CTDGs identified here include novel HIV-1 co-factors.  The presence of CTDGs in the protein space that was available for HIV-1 to sample during its evolution and acquisition of Tat function may provide an explanation for why CTDGs are enriched in viral co-factors.
