TITLE
LPS induced gene expression in macrophages in the presence of Carbon monoxide

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine RAW 264.7 peritoneal macrophages were treated with 250 ppm Carbon monoxide (CO) for 3 hours prior to the addition of LPS (10 ng/ml) and then for the subsequent 4 hours of the study. Air-treated cells were maintained for the same time without CO. Total RNA was harvested at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after LPS addition. CRNA was produced using standard Affymetrix procedures from 10Âµg of total RNA. The expression values of all probe sets are scaled to a target intensity of 500 by using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 Keywords = macrophage Keywords = inflammation Keywords = endotoxin Keywords = gene expression Keywords: time-course
