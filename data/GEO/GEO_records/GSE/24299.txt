ORGANISM

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3506 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Eric Lai. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: We plan to generate a comprehensive catalog of expressed and functional microRNAs, and generate biological evidence for their regulatory activity. We plan also to delineate the primary transcription units of microRNA genes. Finally, we plan to annotate other classes of non-miRNA expressed small RNAs, as least some of which may define novel classes of small RNA genes. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf
