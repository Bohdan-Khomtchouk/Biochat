TITLE
Expression data of β-subunit of Snf1 kinase in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The conserved Snf1/AMPK (AMP-activated protein Kinase) family is one of the central components in nutrient sensing and regulation of carbon metabolism in eukaryotes. It is also involved in several other processes such as stress resistance, invasive growth and ageing. Snf1 kinase is composed of a catalytic α-subunit Snf1, a regulatory γ-subunit Snf4 and one of three possible β-subunits, Sip1, Sip2 or Gal83. We used a systematic approach to study the role of the three β-subunits by analyzing all 7 possible combinations of β-subunit deletions together with the reference strain.

DESIGN
7 mutant strains together with 1 reference strain grown under glucose-limited condition with three biological replicates for each strain
