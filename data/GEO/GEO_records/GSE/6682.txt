TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana small RNAs sequences identified using high-throughput 454 sequencing technology

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To determine the extent to which the major small RNA pathways functions across the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, small RNA populations from several tissues of wild-type (wt) and mutant plants were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced using high-throughput 454 sequencing technology. Keywords: small RNAs, high-throughput sequencing

DESIGN
Amplicons were prepared by 5' and 3' adaptor ligation and RT-PCR using small RNA fractions from inflorescence tissue (containing stage 1-12 flowers) of wt Col-0 plants, mutants with defects in each DCL gene (dcl1-7, dcl2-1, dcl3-1, dcl4-2), and mutants with defects in each RDR gene for which a function has been established (rdr1-1, rdr2-1, rdr6-15).  Amplicons from whole seedlings (3 day post-germinations) were prepared from Col-0 and rdr6-15 plants. Small RNA preparations from leaf samples of Col-O that were either uninoculated or inoculated by Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (DC3000hrcC) for 1 hr and 3 hr were also sequenced.
