TITLE
Expression data from Streptomyces clavuligerus

ORGANISM
Streptomyces clavuligerus

SUMMARY
To increase production of the important pharmaceutical compounds, both mutagenesis approaches and rational engineering have been extensively applied. Mutagenesis approaches are most popular in industry, but their effects have not yet been studied very well. Here, we used microarrays to compare the transcriptomes of the S. clavuligerus wild type (ATCC 27064) strain and the DS48802 clavulanic acid high-producer strain, which has been obtained by classical strain improvement (mutagenesis).

DESIGN
Streptomyces clavuligerus strains were grown in shake flasks. RNA was extracted after 70h and hybridized to microarrays.
