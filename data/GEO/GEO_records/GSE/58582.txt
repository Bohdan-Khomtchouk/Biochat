TITLE
Identification of AP2-O targets [ChIP-seq I]

ORGANISM
Plasmodium berghei

SUMMARY
Stage-specific transcription is a fundamental biological process in the lifecycle of the Plasmodium parasite. Proteins containing the AP2 DNA-binding domain are responsible for stage-specific transcriptional regulation, and belong to the only known family of transcription factors in Plasmodium parasites. A comprehensive identification of their target genes will advance our understanding of the molecular basis of stage-specific parasite development. In this study, we have used ChIP-seq technology to identify the target genes of the ookinete-specific AP2 transcription factor AP2-O.

DESIGN
GFP-tagged AP2-O was IPed with anti-GFP antibody. Targets of this transcription factor were predicted based on the AP2-O binding sites.
