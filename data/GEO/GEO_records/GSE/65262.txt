TITLE
Expression profiles of allopolyploids and their parents lines during allopolyploidization (Chines Spring and hexaploid)

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
We profiled genome-wide gene expression levels in natural hexaploid. Chinese spring and three accessions were used.

DESIGN
Total RNA of each line was extracted from three biological replicates.

PLATFORM
