TITLE
Gene expression in synovial membranes from patients with early and end-stage osteoarthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis is characterized by degeneration of cartilage and bone in the synovial joints. Recent findings suggest that inflammation may play a role in osteoarthritis, with synovitis being associated with the clinical symptoms of osteoarthritis. Furthermore, we have found that levels of inflammatory complement components are abnormally high in the synovial fluid of individuals with osteoarthritis. To determine whether synovial membranes could be a source of complement and other inflammatory molecules in osteoarthritic joints, we characterized the expression of genes in synovial membranes from patients with early-stage or end-stage osteoarthritis.

DESIGN
Samples of synovial membrane were obtained from the suprapatellar pouch of patients with osteoarthritis who were treated at the Hospital for Special Surgery.  Specifically, samples were from 10 patients with early-stage knee osteoarthritis who were undergoing arthroscopic procedures for degenerative meniscal tears (with documented cartilage degeneration but no full-thickness cartilage loss, Kellgren Lawrence score < /=2), and from 9 patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis ( diffuse full thickness cartilage erosion)  who were undergoing total knee joint replacement. Raw data from microarray analysis of healthy synovial membranes, which were run on the same platform and array as our osteoarthritic samples, were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE12021) and used for comparison. The 19 new Samples of this Series were analyzed (RMA) together with 7 previously submitted healthy individual Samples (GSM175810, GSM175812, GSM176290, GSM176291, GSM176292, GSM176268, GSM176269). The complete RMA data are provided as a supplementary file on the Series record. The GSE12021 reanalyzed data are also provided as a supplementary file on the Series record. GSE32317_12genes.txt includes data from figure 1 of the paper.
