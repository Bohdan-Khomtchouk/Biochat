TITLE
Effect of GPI-PLD on global gene expression in HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A time course of the effect of overexpressing GPI-PLD on global gene expression in HepG2 cells was compared to control virus. Keywords: Expression profiling

DESIGN
This experiment compares the global gene expression in HepG2 cells that were either transduced with an adenovirus expressing GPI-phospholipase D or an adenovirus expressing beta galactosidase as a control.  Treatment was for 6 or 12 hrs.  Four replicates for each condition were used.  10 micrograms of total RNA was assayed per genechip using standard Affymetrix protocols.
