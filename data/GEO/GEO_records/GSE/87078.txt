TITLE
mRNA Next Generation Sequencing of long-lived C. elegans mutants lacking the replication-independent histone variant H3.3

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The aim of this stuy was to investigate the effect of H3.3 deficiency on gene transcription in both a wild-type and a long-lived mutant context in C. elegans.

DESIGN
Next Generation mRNA sequencing was performed on 5 biological replicates of late L4 wild-type, his-72(tm2066); his-71(ok2289), daf-2(e1370), daf-2(e1370); his-72(tm2066); his-71(ok2289), nuo-6(qm200) and nuo-6(qm200); his-72(tm2066); his-71(ok2289).
