TITLE
IFN-γ and IL-4 regulate epigenetic modifiers in macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) or interleukin-4 (IL-4) prime macrophages towards classical (M1) or alternative (M2) activation, respectively. How IFN-γ and IL-4 prime epigenetic responses by altering expression of histone modifying enzymes and how this affects M1/M2 polarization is incompletely understood.

DESIGN
We performed a microarray study of transcripts upregulated by IFN-γ or IL-4 in the presence and absence of the combined KDM6A and B inhibitor GSK-J4
