TITLE
SW480 Signaling Hub Inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In tumor cells, stepwise oncogenic deregulation of signaling cascades induces alterations of cellular morphology and promotes the acquisition of malignant traits. Using a panel of small molecular inhibitors, we established associated gene expression signatures of key signaling hubs.

DESIGN
SW480 cells were grown in DMEM, 10% FCS, and treated for 24h with the following inhibitors or with solvent (DMSO): SU5402 (42uM); U0126 (10uM), SP600125 (20uM), LY294002 (20uM)
