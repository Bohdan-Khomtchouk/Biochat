TITLE
SCGB3A2 suppresses bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis through activation of STAT1 and up-regulation of SMAD7ã€€

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report for the first time that secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2, a novel cytokine-like molecule, predominantly expressed in pulmonary airways epithelium, drastically reduced the severity of lung fibrosis using bleomycin-induced mouse model.

DESIGN
DNA microarrays were performed using RNAs isolated from mouse lungs in two experiments.  In the first experiments, mice were adminitered intravenously SCGB3A2 or PBS once daily for a week, starting on day 14 after BLM administration, and in the second experiments, SCGB3A2 or PBS was administered intravenously for 12 hrs.
