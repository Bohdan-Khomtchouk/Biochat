TITLE
Expression data from human glioma cells U251 or LN-319 with stable expression of GFP control or sh-Circ-SHPRH

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cDNA array of U251 or LN-319 cells stably infected with sh-Circ-SHPRH or control lenti-virus.

DESIGN
To investigate the possible regulatory role of Circ-SHPRH, we did the expression microarray in U251 and LN-319 cell stably infected with sh-Circ-SHPRH or control lenti-virus. Total RNA extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
