TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of small RNAs in Arabidopsis seedlings under salt and cold stresses

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify novel miRNA and NAT-siRNAs that are associated with salt and cold stresses in Arabidopsis, we generated small RNA sequences from Arabidopsis plants under salt and cold stress treatments.

DESIGN
Sequencing of small RNAs in Arabidopsis under salt, and cold stress conditions.

PLATFORM
GPL9062 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Arabidopsis thaliana)
