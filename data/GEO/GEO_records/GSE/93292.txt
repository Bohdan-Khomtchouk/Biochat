TITLE
Gene expression changes after LOC550643 silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential analysis of gene expression in HEK293T cells treated with a pool of siRNA targeting LOC550643, or non-silencing siRNA.

DESIGN
LOC550643 encodes a polypeptide that binds to EDC4, and therefore may regulate RNA decay. This experiment tests whether steady-state gene expression levels are different in HEK293T cells treated with non-silencing siRNA, or with siRNA targeting LOC550643, by performing differential expression analysis of total RNA from both of these samples (triplicates of each).

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
