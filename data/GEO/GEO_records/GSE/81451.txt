TITLE
Gene expression profile of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and ATOH1+ve cells in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Atoh1 is the master transcription factor of intestinal secretory cells. Lineage-tracing model of Atoh1+ve cells showed that the progeny of Atoh1+ve cells can develop into either LGR5+ve or LGR5-ve cells. Present analysis compared the gene expression profile of Atoh1+ve cell-derived LGR5+ve cells and LGR5-ve cells, compared to the resident LGR5+ve cell population of the mouse small intestine.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, compared between 3 groups of cells: LGR5-ve cells of Atoh1+ve cell origin, LGR5+ve cells of Atoh1+ve cell origin and Lgr5+ve cells of other cell origin. Each cell population was collected from the mouse small intestine by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Biological replicates: One for each sorted cell fraction. Cell sorting was performed by using pooled cells prepared from four mice. One replicate per array.
