TITLE
Bleomycin induces molecular changes directly relevant to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis:  A model for “active” disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic profiling of RNA from cultured human fibroblasts of donor samples in the 10-14th passage was carried out to determine expression changes in the fibroblasts of individual with different degrees of pulmonary fibrosis. Donors consisted of individuals with rapid progressing pulmonary fibrosis, slow progressing pulmonary fibrosis, or no fibrosis.

DESIGN
Genomic characterization of cultured human fibroblasts from donor samples was carried out in samples from donors with from 3 groups: rapid progressing pulmonary fibrosis, slow progressing pulmonary fibrosis, and non-fibrotic individuals. Large RNA ( > ~ 200bp) was isolated from fibroblast cultures. Purified total RNA was amplified and labeled using NuGen Ovation kits (NuGEN Technologies, Inc., San Carlos, CA) and RNA from samples was hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 arrays.
