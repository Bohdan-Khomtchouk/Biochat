TITLE
Host transcriptional reprogramming in response to the rice bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzae constitutively expressing the X. oryzae pv. oryzicola TAL2a effector from the high copy vector pKEB31

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-Seq of leaves of Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare 48 hours after inoculation with Â Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99A heterologously expressing the Tal2a effector, the designer TAL effector dT280 which targets a sequence overlapping the predicted Tal2a binding sequence in UCH, or the Tal11b effector. Results provide insight into the genes differentially regulated in a Tal2a- and dT280-specific manner.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare leaves at 48 hours after inoculation. Each leaf was considered a separate biological replicate.
