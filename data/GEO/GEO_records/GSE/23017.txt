TITLE
Characterization of transcription patterns of bacteriophage fRSL1 genes during infection cycle.

ORGANISM
Ralstonia phage phiRSL1

SUMMARY
fRSL1 is a jumbo myovirus stably and lytically infecting the phytopathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum. In this study, we investigate the infection cycle of fRSL1 and provide a genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic view of this phage. Its 231-kbp genome sequence showed many genes lacking detectable homologs in the current databases and was vastly different from previously studied phage genomes. In addition to these orphan proteins, fRSL1 was found to encode several enzymes that are unique among known viruses. These include enzymes for the salvage pathway of NAD+ and for the biosynthetic pathways of lipid, carbohydrate and homospermidine. A chitinase-like protein was found to be a potential lysis enzyme. Our proteomics analysis suggests that fRSL1 virions contain at least 25 distinct proteins. We identified six of them including a tail sheath protein and a topoisomerase IB by N-terminal sequencing. Based on a DNA microarray analysis, we identified two transcription patterns.
