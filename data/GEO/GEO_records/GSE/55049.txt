TITLE
Loss of Tet enzymes compromises proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tet enzymes (Tet1/2/3) catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxy-methylcytosine (5hmC) and are dynamically expressed in various embryonic and adult cell types. While loss of individual Tet enzymes or combined deficiency of Tet1/2 allows for embryogenesis, the effect of complete loss of Tet activity and 5hmC marks in development has not been established. To define the role of Tet enzymes and 5hmC in development we have generated Tet1, Tet2 and Tet3 triple knockout (TKO) mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and examined their developmental potential in vitro and in vivo. Combined deficiency of all three Tet enzymes led to complete depletion of 5hmC and impaired ESC differentiation as seen in poorly differentiated TKO embryoid bodies and teratomas. Consistent with impaired differentiation, TKO ES cells exhibited limited contribution to the chimeric embryos and could not support embryonic development in tetraploid complementation assays. Gene expression profiles and genome wide methylome analyses of TKO embryoid bodies revealed promoter hypermethylation and deregulation of genes implicated in embryonic development and differentiation. These findings suggest a requirement for Tet and 5hmC-mediated DNA demethylation in proper regulation of gene expression during differentiation of embryonic stem cells and development.

DESIGN
Methylation patterns in tissue samples from a series of wt and Tet1/Tet2 DKO embryos, neonates and adults were generated using ethylated DNA immunoprecipitation with antibodies against 5mC (MeDIP) and 5hmC (hMeDIP) followed by deep sequencing.
