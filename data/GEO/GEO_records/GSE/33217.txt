TITLE
Expression profiles of water deficit stress (WDS) regulated genes in rose petals

ORGANISM
Rosa hybrid cultivar

SUMMARY
Water deficit stress (WDS) is a crucial factor that causes the inhibition of petal expansion and abnormal flower opening in rose. The regulatory mechanisms of petal expansion by WDS at transcriptional level were investigated by analysis expression profiles under WDS.

DESIGN
Analysis used total RNA samples of petals taken from flowers treated by WDS comparison to those from control flowers. Transcriptome dynamics during treatment time responsive to WDS.
