TITLE
Microarray analysis of HK-2 cells treated with cisplatin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chemotherapeutic use of cisplatin is limited by its severe side effects. In this study, we demonstrated that cisplatin induces cell death in a proximal tubular cell line by suppressing glycolysis- and tricarboxylic acid (TCA)/mitochondria-related genes. HK-2 cells were cultured to confluence in 100mm dishes. Total RNA was extracted (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA), and the concentration in the samples was measured using a Micro UV-Vis fluorescence spectrophotometer (Malcom, Tokyo, JAPAN). Sample of 10É¥g of Total RNA from HK-2 cells were labeled with biotin (3'IVT Labeling Kit, Affymetrix, USA) and hybridized (GeneAtlas Hybridization, Wash, and Stain Kit for 3' IVT Arrays, Affymetrix). The Microarray platform used was Affymetrix HG U219 Array Strip. The arrays were scanned in a GeneAtlas scanner controlled by GeneAtlas Software (Affymetrix, Sta. Clara, USA). Genes were later filtered according to expression fold change (Affymetrix Expression Console software, Affymetrix)

DESIGN
Using Affymetrix GeneAtlas System, we determined the gene expression profiles of HK-2 cells treated with cisplatin. Two replicates were made for each timepoints (control, 6h and 24h).
