TITLE
MicroRNA-138: A Pro-survival OncomiR for Glioma Stem Cells is Associated with Tumor Recurrence [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the identification of microRNA-138 (miR-138), as a molecular signature of GSCs and demonstrate a vital role for miR-138 to promote growth and survival of bona fide tumor-initiating cells with self-renewal potential. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
Total RNA from GSCs 5 days after transduction with lentivirus expressing anti-miR-138 or scrambled sequence was subjected to microarray analysis

PLATFORM
GPL6884 Illumina HumanWG-6 v3.0 expression beadchip
