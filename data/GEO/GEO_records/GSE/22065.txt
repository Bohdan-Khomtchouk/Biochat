TITLE
Expression data from Merm1/Wbscr22 knock-down tumor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Merm1/Wbscr22 is one of genes in chromosomal region deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome, a multisystem developmental disorder. Wbscr22 contains a nuclear localization signal and an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase fold, but its real function is completely unknown.ã€€In this study, to examine the function, we compared the gene expression profiles between control and Merm1/Wbscr22 knock-downed tumor cells.

DESIGN
Four established cell lines were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays: (1) control LM8 cells, designated as LM8/control, (2) Merm1/Wbscr22 knock-downed LM8 cells, designated as LM8/shRNA, (3) control A375M cells, designated as A375M/control, and (4) Merm1/Wbscr22 knock-downed A375M cells, designated as A375M/shRNA.
