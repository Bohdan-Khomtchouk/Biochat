TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of tissue-specific gene expression by Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes during Toxoplasma gondii infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Ly6Chi monocytes from small intestine lamina propria (SILP) and blood of day 8 Toxoplasma gondii infected mice at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that Ly6Chi monocytes from SILP have altered expression of regulatory factors to blood monocytes. Results provide  important information on the regulatory to effector balance of genes expressed by Ly6Chi monocytes during an acute inflammatory response.

DESIGN
Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes were sorted by FACS from the blood or small intestine lamina propria (SILP) of Toxoplasma gondii infected C57BL/6 mice. Cells were isolated at day 8 after infection and total RNA obtained from sorted populations. Three biological replicates were acquired for both blood and SILP from pooled animals.
