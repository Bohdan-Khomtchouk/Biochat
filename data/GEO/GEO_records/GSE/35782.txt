TITLE
Gene expression data from livers of 3-month-old HNF4alpha knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HNF4alpha is a master regulator of hepatic differentiation. In this study, HNF4alpha was deleted in adult mice using a Cre-LoxP system where Cre recombinase was delivered using an AAV8 virus.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the livers of HNF4alpha-floxed mice (mixed backgournd) treated with either Control Virus or Cre-carrying virus at 3 months of age.
