TITLE
Gene expression response of Populus tremuloides cell suspension cultures to salicyl alcohol feeding

ORGANISM
Populus

SUMMARY
Aspen cell cultures were fed 5 mM salicyl alcohol at the early exponential phase (5 days after subculture). Cells were harvested from fed (SL) or unfed (C) cells after 48 hours.  Gene expression changes were analyzed using a custom 7K aspen EST array.
