TITLE
Testis developmental gene expression in cryptorchid boys at risk of azoospermia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite timely and successful surgery, 32% of patients with bilateral and 10% with unilateral cryptorchidism will develop azoospermia. Cryptorchid boys at risk of azoospermia display a typical testicular histology of impaired mini-puberty at the time of the orchidopexy. During mini-puberty increased gonadotropin and testosterone secretion stimulate transformation of gonocytes into Ad spermatogonia. In azoospermia risk group this transformation is to a great extent impaired. This study aimed to analyze data on whole genome expression signatures of undescended testes at risk of developing azoospermia.
