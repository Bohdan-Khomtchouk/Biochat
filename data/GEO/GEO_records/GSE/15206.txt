TITLE
Identification of differentiation status of human embryonic stem cell cultures.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two stages of culture were tested.  ESC is the pluripotent stage expressing SSEA4 and Oct4 but not SSEA1.  NSC is a neural-committed stage expressing Nestin but not beta-tubulin.  Three cell lines were tested: H1, HSF1, and HSF6.

DESIGN
One sample was assayed from each cell line at each stage of culture. Clustering reveals primary grouping is by stage.
