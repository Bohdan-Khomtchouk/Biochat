TITLE
Distinctive microRNA profiles and target genes of aberrant microRNAs in leukemia chicken infected by subgroup J avian leukosis virus

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Subgroup J avian leukemia is a type of oncology infectious disease caused by Subtype J of avian leukosis virus (ALV-J). It mainly encroaches on bone marrow cells, and metastasizes to liver, kidney, splenic ellipsoids and other organs, leading to myeloid leukosis (ML) and other malignancies, resulting in significant economic losses. microRNA play important roles in oncology infectious diseases. We used miRNA microarray analysis to detail the relationship of aberrant microRNAs and chicken ALV-J leukemia, and to try to find the potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for infections of subtype J of leukemia.
