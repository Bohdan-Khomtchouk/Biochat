TITLE
Distinctive microRNA profiles and target genes of aberrant microRNAs in leukemia chicken infected by subgroup J avian leukosis virus

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Subgroup J avian leukemia is a type of oncology infectious disease caused by Subtype J of avian leukosis virus (ALV-J). It mainly encroaches on bone marrow cells, and metastasizes to liver, kidney, splenic ellipsoids and other organs, leading to myeloid leukosis (ML) and other malignancies, resulting in significant economic losses. microRNA play important roles in oncology infectious diseases. We used miRNA microarray analysis to detail the relationship of aberrant microRNAs and chicken ALV-J leukemia, and to try to find the potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for infections of subtype J of leukemia.

DESIGN
ALV-J-infected and non-infected ten-week-old chicken liver tissues were sampled for the array assay. A1, A2, and A3 are the ALV-J infection group samples, and DA1, DA2, and DA3 are the control samples. 623 mature miRNA sequences were assembled and integrated into the LC miRNA microarray design, and different miRNA expressions were measured on the 7000HT Fast Real-Time PCR system.
