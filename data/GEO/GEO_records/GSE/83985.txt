TITLE
Mouse iPS cells-derived 3D-retinas: Vehicle control- vs. 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-treated 3D-retinas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 3D-retinas differentiated from mouse iPS cells comparing vehicle control- with 4-OHT-treated. 4-OHT is an inverse agonist of estrogen-related receptor beta (ERRβ), a rod-enriched transcription factor responsible for maintenance of rod photoreceptor cells and the treatment induces photoreceptor specific cell death in the 3D-retinas. Goal was to understand the mechanism of 4-OHT-induced degeneration of photoreceptor cells in the 3D-retinas.

DESIGN
4-OHT-induced gene expression in the 3D-retinas was measured at DD 26 when the photoreceptor cells were degenerated.  Two-condition experiment, vehicle control- vs. 5 µM 4-OHT-treated 3D-retinas. Biological replicates: each sample has 24 3D-retinas and 1 replicate.
