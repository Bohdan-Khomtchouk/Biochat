TITLE
Porcine oviductal epithelial cells (OECs) primary in vitro culture

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Recently a lot of experiment were developed based on primary cell culture models, including several species of mammals, organs and tissues. The results from these studies revealed the differences in cells proliferation ability in vitro, which is significantly related to the type of tissue originated cells. In this study, we demonstrated the gene expression profile of long time primary cultured porcine oviductal epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Oviductal epithelial cell (OECs) were obtained from 9 months old crossbred landrace glits. OECs were pooled and harvested 24h, 7days, 15 days and 30 days after begining of culture and submited to RNA isolation and microarray analisys.
