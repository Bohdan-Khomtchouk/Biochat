TITLE
Transcriptomic difference caused by fpk1/2 kinase double deletion

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression was determined using yeast cDNA microarray mRNA were enriched from auxotroph-matched yeast cells; control WT vs fpk1/2âˆ† cells and transcriptomic difference was examined

DESIGN
BY4741 with HIS3 was compared with fpk1::KanMx fpk2::HIS3 cells in the log-phase. mRNA was enriched with mTRAP (Activemotief) from hot-phenol method total RNA fractions and was dual-color labeled with Cy-scribe (Amersham) to seek differentially expressed genes.
