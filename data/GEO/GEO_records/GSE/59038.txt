TITLE
Expanding epigenomics to archived FFPE tissues: An evaluation of DNA repair methodologies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A study to evaluate techniques for repairing DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples by direct comparison of FFPE DNA repair methods prior to analysis on genome-wide methylation array to matched fresh frozen (FF) tissues.

DESIGN
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from three colon adenocarcinoma samples were subjected to different FFPE-oriented DNA repair approaches and sequences, then compared with corresponding fresh frozen tissues. All samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation BeadChip.
