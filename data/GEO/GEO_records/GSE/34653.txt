TITLE
Endogenous hairpins-ir71 targets : Gene profiling of Turnip Crinkle Virus (TCV) siRNA in mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
gnp06-03_microtrac Endogenous hairpins-ir71 targets What are the genes (including miRNA precursors) that are differentially regulated in a set of viral siRNA in diferent mutants? Lines IR71 KO n°3 and Col-0 were grown on soil until bolting, Flower buds were then harvested and RNA extracted with Qiagen RNeasy Plant mini kit. RNA was stored at -20°C.

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - gene knock out

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
