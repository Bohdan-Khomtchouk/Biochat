Expression data from human brain samples

SUMMARY
Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) represents about 15% of all strokes and is associated with high mortality rates. Our aim was to identify the gene expression changes and biological pathways altered in the brain following ICH. Twelve brain samples were obtained from four deceased patients who suffered an ICH including perihematomal tissue (PH) and the corresponding contralateral white (CW) and grey (CG) matter.

DESIGN
Brain samples from 4 deceased patients who had a supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage within the previous 4 days were included in the microarray study. This study group included 2 women and 2 men with a median age of 79 (68-92). On autopsy and during macroscopic exam, perihematomal areas suspected to present edema were identified by an experienced neuropathologist using last available neuroradiology images. Samples from perihematomal areas (PH), contralateral grey matter (CG) and contralateral white matter (CW) were obtained within the first 5 h after death and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ÂºC until RNA isolation.
