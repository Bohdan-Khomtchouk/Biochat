TITLE
Developmental gene regulation by an ancient intercellular communication system in social amoebae

ORGANISM
Polysphondylium pallidum

SUMMARY
In the social amoebae (Dictyostelia) quorum sensing system mediates aggregation of single cells into multicellular aggregates by chemotactic movement towards gradients of diffusible molecules known as acrasins. The acrasin of P. violaceum is the unusual dipeptide N-propionyl-gamma-L-glutamyl-L-ornithine-delta-lactam-ethylester, known as glorin. Phylogenetic analysis has indicated that P. violaceum is more related to the most derived group 4 dictyostelids than to the ancient group 2 polysphondylids such as P. pallidum. Nevertheless it has been reported that P. pallidum cells respond to glorin in chemotaxis assays. This has led to the assumption that glorin-based communication may be the most ancient form of intercellular communication that Dictyostelia invented to organize early steps of multicellular development. In this study we show that glorin mediates rapid changes in gene expression at the transition from vegetative growth to aggregation, apparently without pronounced cross-talk with the cyclic AMP-based communication system that coordinates post-aggregation events in this species. We describe glorin-mediated changes in gene expression in the social amoeba Polysphondylium pallidum at the transition from unicellular growth to multicellular development.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression in growing cells versus cells starving for 2 or 3 hours in the presence or absence of glorin.
