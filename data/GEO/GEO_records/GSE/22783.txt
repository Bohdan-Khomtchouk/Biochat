TITLE
Coupling p53 binding and nucleosome occupancy measurements at p53 binding sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We were interested to explain why p53 binds some high affinity sites in contrast to other high affinity sites that are not bound by p53. p53 binding was measured using p53 ChIP-CHIP and in parallel nucleosome occupancy was measured on these same sites Comparison between p53 binding and nucleosome occupancy at p53 predicted binding sites

DESIGN
ChIP-CHIP of p53 from MCF7EcoR under Basal conditions and MCF7EcoR treated with NCS (Activated) and Mononucleosomal extraction from MCF7sip53, MCF7EcoR under Basal conditions and MCF7EcoR treated with NCS (Activated) Expression analysis of MCF7sip53 and MCF7EcoR treated with NCS (Activated)
