TITLE
Transcriptomics analysis of gene expressions, m6A enrichment levels and ythdf2 binding targets in control and mettl3 or ythdf2 morphants zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from control and mettl3 or ythdf2 morphants zebrafish cells using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent by following the company manual. For all samples the RNA integrity was checked using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. All samples showed a RIN (RNA integrity number) of higher than 9. Approximately 2.5 µg of total RNA was then used for library preparation using a TruSeq™ RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.The libraries were sequenced using HiSeq2500 or HiSeq 3000 (Illumina) in paired-read mode, creating reads with a length of 101 or 151 bp. Sequencing chemistry v2 (Illumina) was used.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expressive levels, m6A enrichment levels, m6A single uncleotide sites and ythdf2 binding targets in normal and mettl3 or ythdf2 morphants zebrafish cells
