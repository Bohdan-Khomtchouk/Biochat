TITLE
Identification and validation of antisense RNAs in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
In this study transcriptional start sites (TSS) of E. coli were determined for several growth conditions

DESIGN
To detect the complement of transcripts expressed from E. coli, we collected two independent biological replicates (B1 and B2 samples) from MG1655 wild type strain grown to exponential (OD 600 ~0.4) or stationary phase (OD 600 ~2.0) in LB medium (samples LB 0.4 and LB 2.0, respectively) as well as grown to exponential phase (OD 600 ~0.4) in M63 minimal glucose medium (sample M63 0.4). For all six samples, total RNA was extracted and subjected to differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) library preparation for primary transcriptome analysis as described previously (Sharma et al., 2010). Specifically, prior to cDNA library construction half of each RNA sample was treated with 5’ terminator exonuclease (+TEX samples), which degrades RNAs containing a 5’-mono-phosphate (5’-P) and, thus, enriching enriches for primary transcripts containing 5’-tri-phosphates (5’-PPP). The other half of each sample was left untreated (-TEX samples) and thus contains both primary transcripts (5’-PPP) and processed RNAs (5’-P).
