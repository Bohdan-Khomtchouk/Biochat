TITLE
The global gene expression profile of superficial zone articular cartilage in P1 wildtype and Prg4 transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the unbiased global gene expression of over-expression of Prg4 in superficial zone articular chondrocytes in mice.  This approach allows us to define novel signaling changes caused by the over-expression of Prg4 in superficial zone articular chondrocytes

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from superficial zone chondrocytes in P1 articular cartilage in hind limbs (n=3) by laser capture microdissection. Same tissue from wild type mice served as control
