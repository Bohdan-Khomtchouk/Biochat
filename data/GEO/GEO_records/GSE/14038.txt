TITLE
Integrative genomic analyses of neurofibromatosis tumors identify SOX9 as biomarker and survival gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding biological pathways critical for common neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) peripheral nerve tumors is essential, as tumor biomarkers, prognostic factors and therapeutics are all lacking.  We used gene expression profiling to define transcriptional changes between primary normal Schwann cells (n = 10), NF1-derived primary benign neurofibroma Schwann cells (n = 22), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cell lines (n = 13), benign neurofibromas (n = 26) and MPNST (n = 6).  Dermal and plexiform neurofibromas were indistinguishable.  A prominent theme in the analysis was aberrant differentiation. Neurofibromas repressed gene programs normally active in Schwann cell precursors and immature Schwann cells.  MPNST signatures strongly differed; genes upregulated in the sarcomas were significantly enriched for genes activated in neural crest cells.  We validated differential expression of 82 genes including the neural crest transcription factor SOX9 and SOX9 predicted targets.  SOX9 immunoreactivity was robust in neurofibroma and MPSNT tissue sections and targeting SOX9 - strongly expressed in NF1-related tumors - caused MPNST cell death. SOX9 is a biomarker of neurofibroma and MPNST, and possibly a therapeutic target in NF1. Keywords: tumor stage
