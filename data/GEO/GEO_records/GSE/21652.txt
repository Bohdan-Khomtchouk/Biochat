TITLE
Expression data for transcriptional engineering mutants capable of L-tyrosine overproduction

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We measured transcriptional changes in four strains â€“ P2, rpoD3, rpoA14, and rpoA27 - in an effort to understand mechanisms by which L-tyrosine production is positively influenced by the presence of mutant rpoA- and rpoD-encoded transcriptional components.

DESIGN
Strains P2, rpoA14, rpoA27, and rpoD3 were grown in 50 ml MOPS minimal medium to an OD600 of approximately 0.4.  Triplicates samples of RNA (on three separate days) were then extracted for hybridization onto Affymetrix microarrays.
