TITLE
Investigation of the physiological functions of PRDM6

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PRDM6 belongs to the PRDM family of transcriptional repressors that all contain a PR domain and Zinc finger domains. Prdm6 has transcriptional repressor activity. Prdm6 may regulate factors that are involved in the differentiation / proliferation of smooth muscle cells, promoting proliferation. PRDM6 knockouts are embryonic lethal around 12.0 dpc knockout embryos eventually develop edema: cardiovascular defect vascularization defect in the yolk sac: dysorganized angiogenesis Keywords: cDNA array, yolk sac, murine embryo E10.5
