TITLE
Search for New Biomarkers for the Monitoring of the Minimal Residual Disease of the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The main goal of the research was to find some new biomarkers for the monitoring of the Minimal Residual Disease in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients. Keywords: Search for new Biomarkers

DESIGN
Lymphocytes from the Periferical Blood Samples of 11 patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia were purified according to lineage defined by the immunofenotype. The total RNA from the 11 samples were processed according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The batch .CEL files generated by GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) were analyzed into R software with the affy module from the Bioconductor consortium. Samples with technical replicates were normalized applying the Quantile Normalization method. Then all the data were globally normalized applying the Loess Normalization Altorithm. Finally the gene expression differences were calculated.
