TITLE
Prognostic classifier based on genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in well differentiated thyroid tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylome analysis of different histological thyroid lesions and clinical features, aiming to better understand the DNA methylation deregulation of TC and to identify a prognostic epigenetic signature in well differentiated thyroid carcinomas.

DESIGN
Whole DNA methylation profile was evaluated in 50 non-neoplastic adjacent tissues, 17 benign lesions, 60 papillary, 8 follicular, 2 HÃ¼rthle cell, 1 poorly differentiated and 3 anaplastic carcinomas. The prognostic classifier was developed and applied in a cross-study validation using a external database (TCGA).
