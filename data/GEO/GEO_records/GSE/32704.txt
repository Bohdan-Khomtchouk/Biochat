TITLE
Transcriptional changes in response to oxidative stress in combination with temperature extremes in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Genome wide expression profiles of 10-day-old seedlings in response to prior exposure with OS followed by heat stress or cold stress as well simultaneous exposure to OS along with HS/CS was done to study the transcriptional changes in response to combination of stresses.

DESIGN
10-day old rice seedlings were used for experiments. Transcript profiling was done in 10-day old rice seedling following oxidative Stress prior to High Temperature Stress (PO_HS) or Low Temperature Stress (PO_CS) and Oxidative Stress during High Temperature Stress (DO_HS)/ during Low temperature stress (DO_CS). Unstressed seedlings were used as control. For each condition, three biological replicates were processed in a similar manner for the microarray analysis.
