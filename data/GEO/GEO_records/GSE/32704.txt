TITLE
Transcriptional changes in response to oxidative stress in combination with temperature extremes in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Genome wide expression profiles of 10-day-old seedlings in response to prior exposure with OS followed by heat stress or cold stress as well simultaneous exposure to OS along with HS/CS was done to study the transcriptional changes in response to combination of stresses.
