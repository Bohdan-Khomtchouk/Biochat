TITLE
Wilms Tumor-1 (WT-1) and its candidate target genes in gliomagenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
WT-1 is a zinc-finger transcription factor with important roles during development. WT-1 is associated with the development of tumors of varied origins. Our lab has previously demonstrated aberrant expression of WT-1 in tumor cells.  Necessity of WT-1 for tumor cell growth- in vitro & in vivo- was also shown.

DESIGN
Human glioma U251 cells were treated with Oligofectamine (CTRL), Oligofectamine + non-targeting siRNA control (SCR) or Oligofectamine+ si-WT1 siRNA (Si). Biological triplicates were run on microarrays.
