TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of Human Breast Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from epithelial tissues of different grades and stages of human breast cancer samples using mirVana kit and RNA integrity number (RIN) was determined in Agilent Bioanalyzer (2100) to assess the suitability for microarray assays. Sixteen samples were individually analyzed using miRCURY™ LNA arrays version 11.0 (Exiqon, Denmark). The LNA array slides were scanned using Agilent G2565BA Microarray Scanner System (Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA) and image analysis was carried out using ImaGene 8.0 software (BioDiscovery, Inc., USA). The quantified signals were background corrected (Normexp with offset value 10 14 and normalized using global Lowess (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing) regression algorithm.

DESIGN
Three condition experiment Grade 2, stage II vs its adjacent normals (AN) and Grade 3, stage III vs it AN, Grade 2 vs Grade 3, Grade 2, stage II 5 biological replicates, Grade 3 stage III 5 biological replicates, AN 3 biological replicates each

PLATFORM
GPL17107 Exiqon miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array - hsa, mmu & rno
