TITLE
Expression data for analysis of genes regulated by EWS/FLI1 protein levels in Ewing sarcoma cell line A673

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profile of Ewing sarcoma cells which have an exchange of the endogenous EWS/FLI1 to either wild-type or a turnover-deficient mutant EWS/FLI1. Most target genes are saturated as only a few target genes are soly driven by increasing protein amount. The effect of a stable EWS/FLI1 mutant on global gene expression was evaluated in A673 Ewing sarcoma cells.

DESIGN
A doxycycline-inducible shRNA construct directed against the 5'UTR of  endogenous EWS/FLI1 was stably transduced into A673 cells and used for silencing.  Further, a doxycycline-inducible overexpression construct was used to simultaneously express either a flag-tag, 3xflag-EWS/FLI1 or 3xflag-EWS/FLI1 K380R. RNA used for expression profiling was isolated from these A673 cells after 24h and 48h doxycycline-induction. Controls cells were uninduced samples from each cell line construct.
