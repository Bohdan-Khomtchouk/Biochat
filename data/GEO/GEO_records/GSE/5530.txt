TITLE
Hydrogen peroxide stress and Zat12 over-expression in Arabidopsis.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In this experiment we tested the transcriptome of transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings (5-day-old) constitutively expressing the zinc-finger protein Zat12 (At5g59820) under the control of the 35S-CaMV promoter (Zat12). The transcriptome of these seedlings was compared to that of wild type seedlings grown under the same conditions (WT) and to that of wild type seedlings grown under the same conditions and subjected to a hydrogen peroxide stress (WT+H2O2). Hydrogen peroxide treatment was performed by applying 20 mM hydrogen peroxide for 1 hour. In parallel to these experiments transgenic plants expressing Zat12 were subjected to a similar hydrogen peroxide stress (Zat12+H2O2). All treatments were performed with similar size and age seedlings grown in liquid culture (MS) and sampled at the same time as described by Davletova et al., 2005.
