TITLE
Ehmt2/G9a controls placental vascular maturation by activating the Notch Pathway

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
G9a mediates a transcriptional switch, and activates the Notch pathway to coordinate endothelial cell and trophoblast proliferation to promote vascular maturation in the placenta.

DESIGN
Examination of global transcriptional profiles in control and mutant placenta labyrinth at 2 developmental stages (E12.5 and 13.5).
