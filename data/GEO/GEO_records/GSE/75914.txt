TITLE
Genome-wide characterization of MED12 occupancy in human CD34+ cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report ChIP-Seq data for MED12 in human CD34+ cells.  Med12 occupies promoter distal regions that regulate specific transcriptional programs required for the homeostasis of the hematopoietic system.

DESIGN
50 milion cells were used to perform ChIP from CD34+ cells with 10 ug of antibody

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
