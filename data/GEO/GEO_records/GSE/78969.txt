TITLE
Lincomycin effect on PIFq-regulated transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
RNA-seq experiment of WT and pifq mutant seedlings grown for 3 days in darkness in presence or absence of Lincomycin.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiles of the wild-type (WT) and pif1pif3pif4pif5 (pifq) quadruple mutant seedlings grown for 3 days in the dark in presence or absence of Lincomycin. Biological triplicate samples were analyzed from libraries constructed using a 3'-capture, 5' to 3' directional method.

PLATFORM
