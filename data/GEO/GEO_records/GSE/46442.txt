TITLE
RNA expression for ethanologenic E coli strains LY180, EMFR9 and EMFR35 in the absence and presence of 5mM and 15 mM furfural for 15 min

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli W

SUMMARY
The data explore the transcriptional response of strains LY180 and EMFR9 to 5 mM furfural under anaerobic fermentation condition The data explore the transcriptional response of strains LY180 and EMFR35 to 15 mM furfural under anaerobic fermentation condition The expression differences of polyamine transporters in LY180 vs EMFR9 and EMFR35 are further described in RD Geddes,X Wang, LP Yomano, EN Miller, H Zheng, KT Shanmugam, and LO Ingram. 2013. Selected Polyamines and Polyamine Transporters Increase Furfural Tolerance (in preparation for submission to Appl Env Microbiol)

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from cultures of LY180, EMFR9 and EMFR35 immediately before and 15 min after addition of furfural (5mM and 15 mM). The Nimblegen TI83333 chip measures expression of 4,237 genes, with 5 replicates, and 18 probes average per gene. The complete dataset comprising 8 samples is linked below as a supplementary file.
