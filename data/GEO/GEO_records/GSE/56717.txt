TITLE
Expression data from human metastatic melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The genetic changes underlying metastatic melanoma need to be deciphered to develop new and effective therapeutics.  Previously, genome-wide microarray analyses of human melanoma identified two reciprocal gene expression programs, that included expression of mRNAs  regulated by either transforming growth factor, beta 1 (TGFB1) pathways or microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)/SRY-box containing gene 10 (SOX10) pathways.  We extend this knowledge to include gene expression analyses of 5 additional human melanoma lines, and show that these lines also fall into either TGFB1 or MITF/SOX10 gene expression groups. These mRNA expression studies were followed up by miRNA expression analyses.

DESIGN
Microarray analyses were performed on 5 metastatic melanoma lines in 3 replicates. Standard Affymetrix protocols were used.
