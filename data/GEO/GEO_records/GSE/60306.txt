TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Atino80-5 mutant in comparison with wild type.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
INO80 is a conserved chromatin remodeler through evolution. We identified a novel ino80 mutant allele, Atino80-5, in Arabidopsis thaliana, and performed the transcriptome analysis of this mutant in comparison with wild type (WT).

DESIGN
12-day-old seedlings of wild-type (WT) and Atino80-5 mutant grown under standard growth condition were used for RNA extraction and microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL12621 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Probe Name version)
