TITLE
Oncogenic potential of RAS isoforms in melanocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the transformation efficiencies of mutant NRAS and KRAS in immortal, non-transformed Ink4a/Arf-deficient melanocytes. NRAS mutation leads to increased cellular proliferation and is potently tumorigenic. In contrast, KRAS mutation does not enhance melanocyte proliferation and is only weakly tumorigenic on its own. While both NRAS and KRAS activate MAPK signaling, only NRAS enhances MYC activity in these cells. Our data suggests that the activity of specific RAS isoforms is context dependent and provides a possible explanation for the prevalence of NRAS mutations in melanoma.In addition, understanding this mechanism will have important implications for cancer therapies targeting RAS pathways. Keywords: RAS isoforms
