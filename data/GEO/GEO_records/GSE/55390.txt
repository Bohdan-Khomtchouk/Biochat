TITLE
Methylome of soil bacterium Gemmatirosa kalamazoonensis KBS708, a member of the rarely cultivated Gemmatimonadetes phylum

ORGANISM
Gemmatirosa kalamazoonesis

SUMMARY
Bacteria belonging to phylum Gemmatimonadetes are found in a wide variety of environments and are particularly abundant in soils.  To date, only two Gemmatimonadetes strains have been characterized.  Here we report the complete genome sequence and methylation pattern of Gemmatirosa kalamazoonensis KBS708 (ATCC BAA-2150; NCCB 100411), the first characterized Gemmatimondetes strain isolated from soil.

DESIGN
Examination of the methylome of Gemmatirosa kalamazoonenis KBS708 using kinetic data from single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the PacBio RS

PLATFORM
GPL18407 PacBio RS (Gemmatimonadetes bacterium KBS708)
