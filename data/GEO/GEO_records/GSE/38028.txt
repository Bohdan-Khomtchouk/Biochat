TITLE
Constitutive activation of the receptor-like kinase NIK impairs translation and confers tolerance to begomovirus infection

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
To generate an efficient defense against begomovirus, we modulated the activity of the immune defense receptor NIK (NSP-Interacting Kinase) in tomato plants; NIK is a virulence target of the begomovirus NSP during infection. Replacing threonine-474 with aspartate (T474D) within the kinase activation loop promoted the constitutive activation of NIK-mediated defenses. This activation resulted in the down-regulation of translation-related genes and the suppression of global translation in T474D-overexpressing tomato lines. We also found that T474D-induced defense-related transcripts were associated with polysomes and immune proteins, which accumulated to detectable levels in T474D leaves. Consistent with these findings, T474D transgenic lines were tolerant to the tomato-infecting begomoviruses ToYSV and ToSRV. We propose that NIK mediates an anti-viral response via translation suppression and immune system induction.

DESIGN
Global variation on gene expression induced by NIK  expression and virus infection using total RNA from mock-inoculated and ToYSV-infected tomato wild-type plants,  mock-inoculated and infected 35S::NIK1-4 overexpressing lines and mock-inoculated and infected 35S::T474D overexpressing lines.
