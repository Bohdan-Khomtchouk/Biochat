TITLE
Frequent silencing of the candidate tumor suppressor TRIM58 by promoter methylation in early stage lung adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a systematic, genome-wide screening of aberrantly methylated CGIs in stage I LADC from NS and S to identify tumor-associated genes commonly dysregulated through aberrant DNA methylation in early stage of LUAC regardless of smoking status. A series of criteria targeting novel genes frequently silenced in LADC tumors and cell lines possibly through hypermethylation were applied to prioritize the selection of top candidates for validation. As the result, we identified TRIM58 for further detailed analyses of methylation status and its relation with gene expression using a larger set of LADC tumors and cell lines.  Our functional analyses demonstrated the growth suppressive effect of restored TRIM58 expression on LADC cell in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this gene exerts TSG.

DESIGN
To investigate the molecular pathways involved by TRIM58-overexpression, the expression levels of mRNAs in TRIM58-stably transfectants were analyzed using microarray
