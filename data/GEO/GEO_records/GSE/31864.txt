TITLE
Epigenome profiling of repressive histone modifications, DNA methylation and gene expression in normal and malignant urothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain a more depth knowledge of repressive epigenetic gene regulation in UCC, we have profiled H3K9m3 and H3K27m3 in normal and malignant urothelial cells. We matched these profiles to those 5-methylcytosine and gene expression. We hypothesized that differences represent pro-carcinogenic events within the urothelium. We identified a panel of genes with cancer specific epigenetic mediated aberrant expression.

DESIGN
Two repressive histone modifications (H3K9m3 and H3K27m3) , cytosine methylation and gene expression were compared between normal human urothelial cell line (NHU) and malignant urothelial cells (EJ and RT112).
