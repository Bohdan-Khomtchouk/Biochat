TITLE
Gene expression profiling of rice embryogenic calli after Agrobacterium infection

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation has been routinely used in rice for more than a decade. However, the transformation efficiency of the indica rice variety is still unsatisfactory and much lower than that of japonica cultivars. Further improvement on the transformation efficiency lies in the genetic manipulation of the plant itself, which requires a better understanding of the underlying process accounting for the susceptibility of plant cells to Agrobacterium infection as well as the identification of plant genes involved in the transformation process. In order to investigate the related genes affecting the transformation efficiency of embryogenic calli of different rice cultivars, we used Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Rice Genome Array to measure the global gene expression profiling just before transformation and at four different time points after transformation (1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h) in both japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare and indica rice cultivar Zhenshan 97.
