TITLE
Agilent 400K aCGH data for 30 human gastric cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number alteration (CNA) is a good signpost to identify cancer related genes. CNAs were analyzed using the Agilent 400K array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in fresh-frozen tumor and matched normal tissues from 30 gastric cancer patients.

DESIGN
Whole genomic CNAs in 30 human gastric cancers were analyzed using the Agilent aCGH-400K arrays. Matched normal tissues were used as the reference.
