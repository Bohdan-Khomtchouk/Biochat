TITLE
Ash1 ChIP-chip data from murine Embyonic Stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ash1 is a Trithorax Group (TrxG) protein with histone methyl transferase activity that  is associated with gene activation.  Here we use ChIP-chip to determine the occupancy of Ash1 at promoters in murine embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
This dataset includes singlet ChIP-chip data targeting Ash1 in murine Embryonic stem cells.

PLATFORM
GPL6691 Agilent-014928 Mouse Promoter tiling array set. Microarray 1 of 2 GPL6692 Agilent-014929 Mouse Promoter tiling array set. Microarray 2 of 2
