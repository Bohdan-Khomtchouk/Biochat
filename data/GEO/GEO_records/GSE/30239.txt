TITLE
Mis-expression of Tramtrack in Drosophila embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We profiled the transcriptome of Drosophila melanogaster embryos in ttk2D50 embryos or after over-expression using btl-GAL4; UAS-ttk, respectively. We further isolated cells that express btl-enh-RFPmoe (Cabernard and Affolter 2005) and FACS sorting, and profiled their transcriptomes in the same genetic backgrounds.

DESIGN
A total of 19 samples were analysed with 2-3 replicates each. For each embryos and sorted cells, the genotypes were: ttk2D50 btl-enh-RFPmoe (mutant; embryos: 2, cells: 2), btl-enh-RFPmoe (mutant control; embryos: 2, cells: 3), btl-GAL4; UAS-ttk, btl-enh-RFPmoe (over-expression; embryos: 3, cells: 2), btl-GAL4; btl-enh-RFPmoe (over-expression control; embryos: 3, cells: 2).
