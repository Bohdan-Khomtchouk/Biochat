TITLE
Response of mammary tissue to high-LET HZE particle (Silicon ions) radiation or low-LET gamma-rays

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mammary tissue irradiated at 10 weeks of age with either 100 cGy sparsely ionizing gamma-rays, or 10 cGy or 30 cGy densely ionizing radiation (350 MeV/amu Si). Mammary tissue was collected 1 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks post-irradiation.

DESIGN
Four radiation treatment groups: sham, 100 cGy sparsely ionizing gamma-rays, 10 cGy or 30 cGy densely ionizing radiation (350 MeV/amu Si).  Three time points post-irradiation (1, 4, and 12 weeks).  Three or four replicates per time point.
