TITLE
Expression data from adult (9 month-old) hearts from GRK2 heterozygous C57BL/6J mice and its wild type littermates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) has emerged as a key regulator of cardiac function and myocardial structure. Cardiac GRK2 is increased in heart failure and ischemia in humans, whereas genetic inhibition of GRK2 is cardioprotective in animal models of these pathologies. However, the mechanistic basis underlying these effects are not fully understood. We have used adult GRK2 hemizygous mice (GRK2+/-) as a model to assess the effects of a sustained systemic inhibition of GRK2 in heart tissue with age. We used microarrays to determine the global programme of gene expression underlying cardioprotection in GRK2 hemizygous mice.

DESIGN
9 month-old mice hearts were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
