TITLE
Apoptosis induction in rat mammary tumor cells by repression of Pla2g4c expression.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Although some phospholipase A2 forms, the initiator of the arachidonic acid cascade, contribute to carcinogenesis of many organs, the phospholipase A2 group IVc (Pla2g4c) remains to be clarified. When Pla2g4c expression in Rat mammary tumor-1 E4 (RMT-1) cells was knocked down by using specific siRNAs, cell counts were found to decrease to 40 % of the number of control and apoptotic cells were increased. Whole transcript profiling revealed the up-regulation of lipocalin 2 and down-regulation of epithelical marker genes.

DESIGN
The expression of Pla2g4c was blocked by transient transfection with Pla2g4c siRNA in RMT-1 cells.
