TITLE
Gene expression from null and doubly null mice for 2 sulfotransferases (HED-GlcNAc6ST and GlcNAc6ST-1) compared to WT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This laboratory works on selectins and their carbohydrate ligands in lymphocyte homing and inflammation. The lab also studies heparin-degrading endosulfatases and their roles in regulating the interactions of growth factors and morphogens with proteoglycans.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles from null and doubly null mice for 2 sulfotransferases (HED-GlcNAc6ST and GlcNAc6ST-1) will be compared to WT mice to find impact on L-selectin ligand formation in lymph nodes. RNA was isolated from the lymph nodes of the 2 types of null mice, 1 type of double null mice, and 1 of wild type mice. 3 duplicates of each strain were analyzed by gene expression profiling. We have null mice and doubly null in two sulfotransferases (HEC-GlcNAc6T and GlcNAc6ST-1) involved in L-selectin ligand formation in lymph nodes. Our functional analysis reveal partial loss (50 and 25%)of lymph node L-selectin ligands in the singly null mice and an 80%loss in the double null mice. We want to identify candidates for the protein scaffolds and underlying posttranslational modifications responsible for the residual L-selectin ligand activity in these mice. We will perform a glycochip analysis with mRNA isolated from lymph nodes of the 3 types of null mice and wild-type mice, all on the C57BL/6 background. Three duplicates from each strain are analyzed, requiring a total of 12 chips. The mice are 8-10 weeks of age and all female.
