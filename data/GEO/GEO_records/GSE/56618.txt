TITLE
ROCK Inhibition extends passage of human embryonic stem cell derived retinal pigmented epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem cell derived retinal pigmented epithelial cells (hESC-RPE) are in clinical trials for the treatment of macular diseases. Currently, these cells take over three months to derive and subsequent months to mature and characterize. After only five to six passages the cells begin to undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and are unsuitable for cellular therapies. We describe a novel passaging protocol and show that inhibition of Rho-associated, coiled coil containing protein kinases (ROCK1 and ROCK2) using Y-27632, allows extended passage of hESC-RPE in serum-free culture with maintenance of the RPE phenotype. After 30 population doublings, hESC-RPE at passage 13 maintain normal karyotype, display typical, polarized epithelial morphology, and continue to express RPE-specific genes. Passage 13 hESC-RPE show protein localization patterns similar to passage 2 cells, and display similar levels of growth factor secretion and phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Microarray analysis from day 2 cells shows several key pathways are altered by ROCK inhibition, including stimulation of the cell cycle and suppression of TGFÎ² and Wnt signaling. These findings describe a means to greatly increase the yield of functional hESC-RPE for use in research and clinical trials.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Control vs Y-27632 treated hESC-RPE passage 5. Biological replicates: 4 control, 4 Y-27632. The experiments were technically carried out as dual channel (eg, Cy3 and Cy5-labeled samples hybridized to the same array) but processed as though they are single channel (Cy3 and Cy5 signals are calculated; Cy3/Cy5 ratios are not calculated). Therefore, there are 4 raw data files for total 8 samples.
