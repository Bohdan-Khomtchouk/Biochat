TITLE
RNA-seq in endometrial stromal tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe the first analysis of gene expression in endometrial stromal tumors by RNA-seq. We demonstrate that undifferentiated uterine sarcomas have a unique gene expression profile that is distinct from other uterine mesenchymal tumors.

DESIGN
Paired-end whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed on 19 endometrial stromal tumors (8 low-, 3 high-grade ESS and 8 UUS).
