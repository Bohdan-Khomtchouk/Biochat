TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of human colonic HT-29 cells under insulin stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compared mRNA expression between control and insulin treated cells. HT29 cells were treated with 100nM Insulin for 24h. The RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays PAHS-30C (SA Biosciences, MD, USA) was designed to analyze 84 genes related to human insulin signaling pathway. The RT-PCR was carried out using an ABI PRISMÂ® 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).The expression of HSD11B2 for the 3 experiments concerned was monitored in parallel by real time PCR which confirming significant downregulation by insulin.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  RNA from 3 separated experiments was collected.
