TITLE
A robust single primate neuroepithelial cell clonal expansion system for neural tube development and disease studies

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Developing a model of primate neural tube (NT) development is important to promote many NT disorder studies in model organisms. Here, we report a robust and stable system to allow for clonal expansion of single monkey neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs) to develop into miniature NT-like structures. Single NESCs can produce functional neurons in vitro, survive and extensively regenerate neuron axons in monkey brain. NT formation and NESC maintenance depend on high metabolism activity and Wnt signaling. NESCs are regionally restricted into a telencephalic fate. Moreover, single NESCs can turn into radial glial progenitors (RGPCs). The transition is accurately regulated by Wnt signaling through regulation of Notch signaling and adhesion molecules. Finally, using the “NESC-TO-NTs” system, we model the functions of folic acid (FA) on NT closure and demonstrate FA can regulate multiple mechanisms to prevent NT defects. Together, our system is ideal for studying NT development and diseases.

DESIGN
compare gene expression profiles in  monkey neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs), newly converted radial glial progenitor cells (RPGCs) from NESCs and  differentiated neurons from NESCs
