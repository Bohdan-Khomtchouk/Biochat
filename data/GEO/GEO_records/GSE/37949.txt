TITLE
Expression data comparing KYSE-140 ESCC cell line CD90+ and CD90- cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify candidate genes involved in enhanced tumorigenicity and metastasis of CD90+ esophageal tumor-initiating cells.

DESIGN
The esophageal squamous carcinoma cell (ESCC) cell line KYSE-140 was sorted into CD90+ and CD90- populations by flow cytometry. Total RNA was analyzed on Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus GeneChip 2.0 arrays.
