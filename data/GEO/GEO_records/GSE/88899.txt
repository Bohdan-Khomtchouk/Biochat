TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of human plasma miRNA from rheumatoid arthritis patients with or without interstitial lung disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from 200Î¼l plasma samples and cDNA was synthesized. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed to evaluate miRNA expression in the plasma pool from 17 RA patients with RA-ILD or the plasma pool from 17 RA patients without ILD using Human miRNome microRNA PCR Panel I+II (Exiqon).

DESIGN
qPCR miRNA expression profiling. Plasma samples from 17 donors were used in control and test.
