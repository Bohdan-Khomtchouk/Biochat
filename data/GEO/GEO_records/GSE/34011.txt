TITLE
Expression data from mouse intestine: BALB/c MTHFR+/+ on control diet vs BALB/c MTHFR+/- on folate deficient diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that low folate diet (control diet with 2mg folate/kg, low folate diet with 0.3mg folate/kg) can induce intestinal tumors in BALB/c mice. We used microarrays to compare  MTHFR+/+ BALB/c mice fed control diet and MTHFR+/- BALB/c mice fed low folate diet.

DESIGN
After weaning, 4 BALB/c Mthfr +/+ mice were fed with a control diet (CD, 2mg folate/kg)  and 4 BALB/c Mthfr +/- mice were fed a low folate diet (FD, 0.3mg folate/kg) for 1 year. Both diets contain succinylsulfanthiozole (1%) to prevent folate synthesis by intestine microbial biota.
