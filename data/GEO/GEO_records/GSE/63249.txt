TITLE
Identification of H3N2 specific antibodies cross-reacting with H7 strains

ORGANISM
Capra hircus ; Influenza A virus

SUMMARY
Binding profile of H3N2 hemagglutinin (HA) reactive antibodies for various H3N2 and H7 HA proteins

DESIGN
The same set of antibodies was printed 24 times on the microarray slide and different HA proteins were probed to assess the reactivity of the antibodies.
