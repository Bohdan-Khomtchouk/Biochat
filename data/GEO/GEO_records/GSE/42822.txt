TITLE
Expression data from breast cancer FNA biopsies from patients ( (USO samples)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor samples were obtained from patients with stage II-III breast cancer before starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy with four cycles of 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) followed by four cycles of docetaxel/capecitabine (TX) on US Oncology clinical trial 02-103. Most patients with HER-2-positive cancer also received trastuzumab (H).

DESIGN
Pre-treatment FNA from primary tumors were obtained and RNA extracted and hybridized to affymetrix microarrays according to manufacturer protocol.
