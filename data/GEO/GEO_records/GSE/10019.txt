TITLE
Identification of RGA downstream genes by using steroid-inducible system

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the transcriptional program controlled by RGA, we took advantage of a functional steroid-inducible RGA proteins system in combination with microarray analysis to identify RGA target genes. Keywords: steroid-inducible system

DESIGN
We firstly compared the transcriptomes in ga1-3rgargl2RGA-GR inflorescence without flowers later than stage 12 induced by dexamesone- relative to mock-treatment, which revealed the differentially expressed genes corresponding to the RGA protein activity induced by dexamesone.As negative controls to exclude unexpected effects of transgenic T-DNA and Dex itself, RNAs derived from nontransgenic plants (ga1-3 rga rgl2) inflorescences treated with Dex were used. Three sets of biological independent replicates were collected.
