TITLE
Identification of RGA downstream genes by using steroid-inducible system

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the transcriptional program controlled by RGA, we took advantage of a functional steroid-inducible RGA proteins system in combination with microarray analysis to identify RGA target genes. Keywords: steroid-inducible system
