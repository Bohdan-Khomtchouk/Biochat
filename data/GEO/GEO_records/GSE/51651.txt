TITLE
Expression data from control and GAPLINC knockdown human gastric cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of comparing control and GAPLINC knocking-down human gastric cancer cell lines. Goal was to determine the different gene expression between control and GAPLINC knocking-down human gastric cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
Control and GAPLINC knocking-down human gastric cancer cell lines were prepared for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
