TITLE
Adaptive differences in gene expression associated with stress tolerance in the soil arthropod Orchesella cincta

ORGANISM
Orchesella cincta

SUMMARY
Field-selected tolerance to heavy metals has been reported for Orchesella cincta (Arthropoda: Collembola) populations occurring at metal-contaminated mining sites. This tolerance is correlated with heritable increase of metal excretion efficiency; less pronounce cadmium induced growth reduction and, over-expression of the metallothionein gene. We applied transcriptomics to determine differential gene expression caused by this abiotic stress in reference and cadmium tolerant populations. Many cDNAs responded to cadmium exposure in a reference population. Significantly fewer clones were cadmium responsive in tolerant animals. Analysis of variance revealed transcripts that interact between cadmium exposure and population. Hierarchical clustering of these clones revealed two major groups. The first one contained cDNAs that were up regulated by cadmium in the reference culture, but non-responsive or down regulated in tolerant animals. This cluster was also characterized by elevated constitutive expression in the tolerant population. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these cDNAs were involved in structural integrity of the cuticle, anti-microbial defense, calcium-channel blocking, neurotransmitter transport, chromatin remodeling and, endoplasmatic vesicle activity. The second group consisted of cDNAs down regulated in reference animals but not responding or slightly up regulated in tolerant animals. Their functions involved carbohydrate metabolic processes, Ca2+ dependent stress signaling, proteolysis and digestion. The reference population showed a strong signature of stress-induced genome-wide perturbation of gene expression, whereas the tolerant animals maintained normal gene expression upon cadmium exposure. We confirmed the micro-evolutionary processes occurring in soil arthropod populations and suggest a major contribution of gene regulation to the evolution of a stress-adapted phenotype.
