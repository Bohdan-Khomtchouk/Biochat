TITLE
Expression data from CACS15-New-Transcript 1(CASC15-NT1 or CANT1) lncRNA overexpressed UM cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The function and mechanism of lncRNA in human uveal melanoma (UM)  is not clearly studied. We used microarrays to identify the downstream target genes of CANT1 lncRNA in UM cells to explain the mechanism of lncRNA in UM tumorigenesis

DESIGN
CANT1 lncRNA was overexpressed in two human uveal melanoma cell lines MUM2B and OCM1 (MUM2B- CANT1 and OCM1- CANT1). The wild type uveal melanoma cell lines MUM2B and OCM1 were used as controls.RNA extraction from the four cell lines was used to be hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Microarray replicates 2 and 3 are also included.
