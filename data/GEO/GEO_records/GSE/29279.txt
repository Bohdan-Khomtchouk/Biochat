TITLE
Effects of ad libitum feeding on canine skeletal muscle gene expression

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle, as a large and insulin sensitive tissue, is an important contributor to metabolic homeostasis and energy expenditure.  Obese dogs exhibit skeletal muscle insulin resistance, but the causes of these changes are unclear.  Thus, we used canine microarrays to analyze gene expression profiles of skeletal muscle tissue collected from obese dogs, after 24 wk of ad libitum feeding.

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle tissue samples were collected from 9 intact female beagles (4 yr-old; 4 control; 5 ad libitum) after 24 wk of ad libitum feeding.
