TITLE
Gene expression analysis during differentiation of EPC to OEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles during the differentiation of EPCs into OECs were analyzed.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from Human cord blood derived- EPC and differentiated OEC from EPC. HG-U133A 2.0 microarray (54675 human genes; Affymetrix Santa Clara, CA, USA) was performed.
