TITLE
Expression data from paracrine senescence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Senescence can be transmitted in a paracrine way from cells undergoing  Oncogene Induced Senescence (OIS) to naïve normal cells. We define this phenomenon as “paracrine senescence” We used microarrays to compare the trancriptome of cells undergoing paracrine senescence to the transcriptome of cells suffering OIS to unveil the common signatures defining both events and the similarities between them

DESIGN
IMR90 cells were co-cultured with IMR90 ER:RAS undergoing OIS or IMR90-Vector control cells using 0.2 μm pore transwell (anopore) to allow communication of soluble factors but physical separation of the two cell populations. The total mRNA of IMR90, IMR90 ER:RAS or IMR90 cells cultured in Transwells together with IMR90 vector or IMR90 ER:RAS cells during 7 days in the presence of 200 nM 4OHT and 0.5 % FBS was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays to compare paracrine senescence to OIS.
