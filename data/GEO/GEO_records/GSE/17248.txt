TITLE
Inflammatory gene expression in response to Francisella tularensis exposure in Balb/c mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Francisella tularensis may enter the body thorugh the lungs and cause fatal infection. In this study the inflammatory response to the virulent strain of Francisella (Schu4) was mapped over a 96h time-course using a custom microarray.

DESIGN
Six groups of 4 mice were exposed to aerosolised Francisella tularensis and a three groups exposed to vehicle only control (media only). Following exposure mice were culled at 4 timepoints (1, 24, 48 and 96h). RNA was extracted and run on the custom array.
