TITLE
Forced Expression of MIST1 in Hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MIST1 over-expression has not been analyzed in a cell type that does not express endogenous MIST1.  Here, we force-express ectopic MIST1 in the hepatocytes of mouse livers.  We extracted mRNA and compared gene expression levels between MIST1-expressing mouse livers to controls.

DESIGN
One mouse from each condition (MIST1-expressing and control) was injected with AAV8-TBG-iCre at 7 weeks. Mouse was subsequently sacrificed 2 weeks later and RNA extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.  Two separate mRNA extracations from separate liver cubes were performed on each mouse
