TITLE
HIV-1 selectively targets gut-homing CCR6+CD4+ T-cells via mTOR-dependent mechanisms.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In an effort to identify mechanisms governing HIV-1 permissiveness in gut-homing Th17 cells, we analyzed the transcriptome of CCR6+ versus CCR6- T-cells exposed to the gut-homing inducer retinoic acid (RA) and performed functional validations in colon biopsies of HIV-infected individuals receiving ART (HIV+ART). Together, our results identify mTOR as a druggable key regulator of HIV permissiveness in gut-homing CCR6+ T-cells.

DESIGN
Total cellular RNA was extracted from Th17-polarized CD4+ T-cells from 6 donors in two experimental conditions (ATRA-stimulated and unstimulated).
