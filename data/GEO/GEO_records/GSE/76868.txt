TITLE
The effects of 24-hour withdrawal from cocaine on nucleus accumbens transcript expression.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to determine how 24-hour  withdrawal from cocaine affects the expression profile of transcripts in the nucleus accumbens using genome-wide RNA-sequencing.  11-week old male C57/BL6 mice were injected mice intraperitoneally (IP) with saline (0.9%) or cocaine (20 mg/kg dissolved in 0.9% saline) for 7-days consecutive days, and 24-hours after the last injection, NAc tissue was dissected.  Mice were housed in group of 5 mice per cage, and all mice in a cage were injected with either saline or cocaine and thus there was no counter-balancing between groups.

DESIGN
The nucleus accumbens from 5 mice (2 hemispheres per mouse) were combined per replicate, with 3 replicates for saline and cocaine in total.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
