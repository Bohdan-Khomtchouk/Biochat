TITLE
Segmentation and intensity estimation for microarray images with saturated pixels

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Images and gpr files were examined using a novel saturation reduction method to determine whether accuracy could be improved by extending dynamic range of saturated pixels

DESIGN
Three immunosignatures from human Valley Fever (Coccidiodes) patients and three immunosignatures from human influenza vaccine recipients were examined to test an algorithm that extends the apparent dynamic range of a fluorescence image.  These images had several saturated spots at 70PMT and 100% laser power.  The program examined the differences between Valley Fever and influenza in terms of standard image processing vs. segmentation and intensity estimation.
