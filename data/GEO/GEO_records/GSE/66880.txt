TITLE
Expression data from gonads of Meioc+/+ and Meioc-/-mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Meiosis is a specialized division that is specifically engaged in germ cells. This program is finely and dichotomically regulated: germ cells enter meiosis at fetal life in ovaries (13.5 dpc) and only at post-natal life in testes (8 dpp). We used microarrays to determine the gene expression modifications in Meioc mutant gonads displaying early meiotic defects.

DESIGN
14.5 dpc ovaries and 8 dpp testes from Meioc+/+ and Meioc-/- mice (NMRI) were dissected and processed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Two pools were analysed for each genotype and each sex. We sought to constitutes pairs (A and B) of wild type and knock-out pools from embryos and pups that were homogenous for developmental stages and from matched littermates. 10 ovaries from 5 embryos composed each pool for females and 4 testes from 4 pups composed each pool for males.
