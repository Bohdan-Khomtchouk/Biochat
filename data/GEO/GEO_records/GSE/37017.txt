TITLE
Exploration of genes expression with a DNA microarray Cancerochip.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our goal was to search for new molecular markers of the mitochondrial implication in the thyroid tumorigenesis. Using a DNA microarray (Cancerochip), we explored a collection of thyroid samples representing 4 classes of thyroid tumors.

DESIGN
45 thyroid tumoral and paired control tissues representing 4 classes (benign follicular tumors [FTA], oncocytic variants of follicular tumors [OT], papillary thyroid carcinomas [PTC] and tumors of uncertain malignancy potential [TUMP]) of thyroid tumors were explored for the expression of 6866 genes.
