TITLE
Comparative transcriptome analysis of TCV-infected wildtype and dcl1-9 mutant Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Belonging to the Carmovirus family, Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that can infect Arabidopsis. Most Arabidopsis ecotypes are highly susceptible to TCV, except for the TCV resistant line Di-17 derived from ecotype Dijon. Previous studies showed that many of the stress related genes have changed significantly after TCV infection. Besides the virus-triggered genes, small RNAs also play critical roles in plant defense by triggering either transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional gene silencing. In this study, TCV-infected wildtype Arabidopsis thaliana and dcl1-9 mutant plants were subjected to transcriptome and small RNA analysis to investigate the role of DCL1 in virus defense network.

DESIGN
4 week old Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 and dcl1-9 homozygous plants were inoculated by TCV. Leaves were collected at 7 dpi for RNA and sRNA extraction.
