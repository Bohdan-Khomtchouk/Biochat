TITLE
Expression data from mouse liver RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Different diets and lipid-lowering treatment influence gene expression profiles in mouse liver We used microarrays to detail the hepatic gene expression profiles and identified distinct classes of changed genes under the different treatments. Keywords: different treatment

DESIGN
Mouse livers were selected after different treatments for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
