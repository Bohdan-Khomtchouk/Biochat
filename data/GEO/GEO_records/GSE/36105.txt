TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for human skin keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from human skin keratinocytes derived from healthy donors, as well as from telomerase immortalised human skin keratinocytes (N/TERT), transduced with mock, EGFP, or EGFP-GLI2DeltaN transgenes to compare chromosomal ploidy status.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from human skin keratinocytes derived from healthy donors, as well as from telomerase immortalised human skin keratinocytes (N/TERT) to compare chromosomal ploidy status
