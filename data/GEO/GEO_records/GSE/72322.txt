TITLE
Identifying molecular mechanisms of neural crest (NC) EMT and cell migration

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Purpose: To identify differntially expressed transcripts in TP-0903 treated embryos that impair cranila NC EMT and cell migration in zebrafish embryos Methods: zebrafish embryos treated at 13 hpf with 5-7uM TP-0903 and DMSO for 1-, 4- and 8-hrs at 28Â°C. 35 embryos were collected for each treatment. Results: TP-0903 increases expression of several retinoic acid target genes including genes from within the retinoid pathway Conclusions: TP-0903 causes a direct increase in RA signaling that impairs cranial NC EMT and cell migration in zebrafihs embryos

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of zebrafish embryos treated with TP-0903 and DMSO were generated by RNA-Seq, in quadruplicates, using Illumina Hi Seq
