TITLE
Microarray analysis of immunity in response to injection of non-specific long dsRNA in kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus

ORGANISM
Marsupenaeus japonicus

SUMMARY
There is continuous interest in the anti-viral immune response of shrimp to prevent bacterial and viral infection. In this study, global expression analysis through microarray was conducted to gain insights about the mechanisms involved in the protection of non-specific double stranded RNA â€“injected shrimps against infectious diseases. Hemocytes were collected from different shrimp groups injected with PBS (Phosphate buffered saline), siGFP and dsGFP at 12 and 24 hour timepoints. Genes were clustered based on expression and treatment to highlight differences in expression related to the type of injection.

DESIGN
Non-specific RNA induced gene expression in shrimp hemocyte was measured at 24 and 48 hours post injection of 3 ug/g of dsGFP, siGFP, or PBS. Four different shrimps were used in each treatment group.
