SUMMARY
ecdysone treated KC167 cells during Heat Shock and at Room Temperature

DESIGN
2-colour microarray desgin using 9 spotted oligonucleotide microarrays printed at the Canadian Drosophila Microarray Centre. Total RNA from Ecdysone treated KC167 cells were compared to Total RNA from an EtOH (the solvent for ecdysone) control sample pool.
