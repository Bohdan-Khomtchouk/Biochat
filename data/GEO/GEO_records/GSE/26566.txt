SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling Background  Cholangiocarcinoma accounts for 5-10% of primary hepatic cancers. The etiology is unclear and patients are often diagnosed without risk factors. Resection is the only curative treatment although patients frequently remain undiagnosed until advanced stage of disease.     Methods  To construct molecular classification of cholangiocarcinoma, we profiled the transcriptomes of 104 freshly-frozen tumors and 59 matched non-cancerous livers obtained from Australia, Europe and the United States. We also performed mutational analysis of KRAS, EGFR and BRAF, and used laser-capture microdissection to obtain independent gene expression profiles for epithelial and stromal compartments in a subset of tumors. The selected target genes were validated by western blotting and immunohistochemistry.     Results  Transcriptomic profiling classified cholangiocarcinoma into two distinct subclasses defined by survival (P < 0.0007) and early recurrence (P < 0.001). Applying leave-one-out cross-validation, we optimized the prognostic classifier to 238 genes which were positively enriched in the epithelial tumor compartment.  A deregulated HER2 network was associated with the epithelial compartment which also showed a frequent overexpression of Ki67, EGFR, MET and pRPS6 whereas inflammatory cytokines were enriched in tumor stroma specifically in patients with poor prognosis. KRAS mutations were found in 24.6% of patients with poor disease outcome.     Conclusion  Our study presents new insights into pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma and stratification of the patients according to survival and recurrence. Identification of a subgroup of patients among the poor prognostic cohort characterized by KRAS mutations and oncogenic-addiction may provide a novel therapeutic opportunity for this treatment-refractory malignancy.
