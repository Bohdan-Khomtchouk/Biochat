TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of calcium-regulated genes in relation to broccoli hypocotyl cell expansion

ORGANISM
Brassica oleracea

SUMMARY
We report the application of RNA-seq to uncover the underlying mechanism of 10 mM calcium chloride spray on broccoli seedlings (Brassica oleracea var. italic) boosted the hypocotyl elongation and delayed the senescence.

DESIGN
Examination of Ca2+ and water spray broccoli microgreens

PLATFORM
GPL16360 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Brassica oleracea)
