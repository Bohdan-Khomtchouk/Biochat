TITLE
Gnotobiotic mouse cecal epithelium; B.thetaiotaomicron-B. longum mono- versus bi-association, PR chow, NMRI

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Laser captured cecal epithelium from gnotobiotic mice colonized with B. thetaiotaomicron or B. longum (mono-association) or B. thetaiotaomicron bi-association with B. longum.   Samples were derived from 10d colonizations of NMRI  mice fed a standard-chow polysaccharide rich (PR) diet. Keywords: Germ-free vs. Mono-associations or Bi-association, in vivo

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from laser captured cecal epithelium of 10 day associated gnotobiotic mice, double amplified, and hybridized to 430 2.0 GeneChips or to GlycoGeneChipsv1.
