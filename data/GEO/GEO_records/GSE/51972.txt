TITLE
Expression data from Rhesus immune cells responding to YFV

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Immune response to infection involves the regulation of numerouse genes in numerous cell types. The number and type of genes that become differentially expressed in response to infection can result in very different pathophysiologic presentations and disease course. Wild type YFV and 17D despite having very few genetic differences result in very different disease outcomes in human and monkey hosts. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression of Rhesus macaque immune cells responding to both wild type and 17D strains of YFV. We identified distinct classes of gene expression as well as marked differences in differential gene expression between responses to 17D and wild type strains of YFV.

DESIGN
Rhesus PBMC were isolated before and on day 3 of either vaccination with 17D or infection with wild type YFV with an n of 3 per group. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
