microRNAs distinguish cytogenetic subgroups in pediatric AML and contribute to complex regulatory networks in AML-relevant pathways

SUMMARY
microRNAs, important regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis, have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia in adulthood AML. However, comprehensive studies in AML of children and adolescents are missing so far. We investigated the miRNA expression profiles of different AML subtypes from 102 pediatric patients in comparison to CD34+ cells from healthy donors and adult AML patients, in order to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. Pediatric samples with core factor binding acute myeloid leukemia and promyelocytic leukemia could be distinguished from each other and MLL rearranged AML subtypes by 9 and 18 miRNAs, respectively. miR-126, -146a, -181a/b, -100, and miR-125b were identified as highest differentially expressed with marked difference of expression between pediatric and adulthood samples of the same cytogenetic subgroup. We next isolated the miRNA targeting complex from t(8;21) and t(15;17) cell line models and comprehensively identified bound miRNAs and targeted mRNAs by a newly devised immunoprecipitation assay followed by rapid microarray detection. Our findings indicate separate binding preferences for the four human Argonaute proteins. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis revealed a concerted action of different Ago proteins in the regulation of AML-relevant pathways, providing an experimental based database of miRNA-mRNA target interaction in Argonaute proteins.
