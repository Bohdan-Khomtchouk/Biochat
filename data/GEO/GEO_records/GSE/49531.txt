TITLE
Gene expression data from lymphoblastoid cell lines from participants in the Genetics of Microangiopathic Brain Injury study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
European-American individuals of the GENOA cohort participating in the “Genetics of Microangiopathic Brain Injury” substudy, which investigates the genetic basis of alteration in brain structure detectable by magnetic resonance imaging. This analysis investigated the association of gene expression with age (at the time of cell transformation).

DESIGN
Participants in this study are drawn from the GENOA study, a population-based study from Rochester, MN
