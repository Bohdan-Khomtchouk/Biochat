TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of three Oenococcus oeni strains in the early response to stress

ORGANISM
Oenococcus oeni

SUMMARY
In this work, three O.oeni strians were inoculated, two of them were of our own collection (3P2 and 2T2) and the other one is the type strain 217T (=ATCC 23279) in WLM-12 to develop MLF in these conditions (Bordas et al, 2015). Basic fermentation characteristics were monitored, such as growth rate and biomass yield, as well as the respective transcriptome. This approach allowed a better understanding of metabolic adaptation and its association with specific genes expression profiles, likewise we were able to identify some biological process directly involved in the fermentation conditions such as pH or ethanol content.

DESIGN
Three Oenococcus oeni were used in this work (3P2, 2T2 and 217T) (Bordas et al. 2015), they were grown in rich medium, when they were in exponencial phase they were inoculated in wine like medium with 12 % v/v ethanol. Samples were taken 1 hour after inoculation and in the initial point of fermentation. Total RNA was analysed using a custom designed expression microarray.
