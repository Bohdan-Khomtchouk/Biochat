TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of three Oenococcus oeni strains in the early response to stress

ORGANISM
Oenococcus oeni PSU-1

SUMMARY
In this work, three O.oeni strians were inoculated, two of them were of our own collection (3P2 and 2T2) and the other one is the type strain 217T (=ATCC 23279) in WLM-12 to develop MLF in these conditions (Bordas et al, 2015). Basic fermentation characteristics were monitored, such as growth rate and biomass yield, as well as the respective transcriptome. This approach allowed a better understanding of metabolic adaptation and its association with specific genes expression profiles, likewise we were able to identify some biological process directly involved in the fermentation conditions such as pH or ethanol content.
