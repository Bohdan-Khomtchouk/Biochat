TITLE
Identification of direct targets of Arabidopsis JAGGED in floral buds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
JAGGED (JAG) is a regulatory gene that controls shoot organ growth in Arabidopsis. To reveal the molecular links between JAG and the cellular activities required for tissue growth, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation-high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq).

DESIGN
To reveal the genome-wide JAG binding sites, we used anti-GFP antibodies to pull down JAG-bound DNA from jag-2 inflorescences complemented with a genomic JAG-GFP fusion (JAG:JAG-GFP) [14]. ChIP-Seq was performed and analyzed in triplicate, with wild-type inflorescences used as epitope-negative controls.
