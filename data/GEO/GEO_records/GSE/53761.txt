TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in ALK5Ctrl and ALK5CA mouse hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Activation of TGF-Î² signaling in ALK5CA mouse induces changes in gene expression, which are involved in brain development, cell death and migration, cell cycle, and neurologic diseases, processes and functions that are in line with the effects on neurogenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from hippocampi of ALK5CA mice compared to those of ALK5Ctrl mice

PLATFORM
GPL17543 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 R2 expression beadchip
