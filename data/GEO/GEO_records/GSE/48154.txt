Protein Array Screening of Myelodysplastic Syndromes II

SUMMARY
In a two-stage study we investigated levels of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity in plasma from Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) post MDS patients (59 and 16 cases respectively) as compared to healthy cohort (34).  In Stage I we utilized high-throughput protein arrays (23 232 total signals, in duplicate) to identify proteins of high-interest.  In Stage II we designed new protein arrays (352 total signals, in duplicate) to further focus on 25 of the proteins from Stage I and expanded to a larger cohort, including both male and female samples (161 MDS and 43 AML patients; 112 healthy controls).   Stage I resulted in 35 proteins displaying increased IgG reactivity in patients as compared to the healthy controls (P < 4.3 x10-07, Bonferroni Corrected P < 0.01).   This protein subset included 14 proteins associated with cancer, 12 with apoptosis, and 3 with the NFAT Regulation canonical pathway.  Using the focused arrays we performed a classification of MDS patients and healthy controls.   Stage II subsequently identified a high-interest focused set of 3 proteins, namely AKT3, FCGR3A and ARL8B displaying aberrant increased reactivity in patient subgroups, in concordance with Stage I.   Autoantibody reactivity against specific proteins provides complementary information to other known molecular signatures for MDS and may enhance our capabilities for detecting and classifying MDS. In the study presented here, MDS patients were classified into Stable, Transforming or AML post MDS (L) classes retrospectively.  The different patients were compared to a healthy cohort to assess increased autoantibody reactivity to specific patients as opposed to healthy groups
