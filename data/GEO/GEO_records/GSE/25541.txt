TITLE
cAMP/PKA signaling balances respiratory activity with mitochondria dependent apoptosis via transcriptional regulation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
This data provides evidence that elevation of cAMP levels has a dramatic effect on the transcriptome of yeast cells, with particular emphasis on mitochondrial function and the promotion of ROS production

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae cells lacking the high affinity phosphodiesterase PDE2or both PDE2 and the PKA subunit TPK3 were grown for 24h in rich media in the presence of 4mM exogensously added cAMP. 8 samples.
