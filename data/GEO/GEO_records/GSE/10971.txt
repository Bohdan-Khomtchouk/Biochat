TITLE
Gene expression data from non-malignant fallopian tube epithelium and high grade serous carcinoma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to identify molecular alterations potentially involved in predisposition to adnexal serous carcinoma (SerCa) in the non-malignant fallopian tube epithelium   (FTE) of BRCA1/2-mutation carriers, given recent evidence implicating the distal FTE as a common source for SerCa. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
We obtained and compared gene expression profiles of laser capture microdissected non-malignant distal FTE from 12 known BRCA1/2-mutation carriers (FTEb) and 12 control women  (FTEn) during the luteal and follicular phase, as well as 13 high grade tubal and ovarian SerCa.
