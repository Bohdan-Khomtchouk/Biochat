TITLE
Role of the Glc7 phosphatase regulatory subunit Ypi1 in progression through mitosis

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Ypi1 is an essential regulator of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Glc7 protein phosphatase. Although lack of Ypi1 results in a dramatic blockage in the G2/M cell cycle transition, with abnormally shaped large buds and short spindles, the molecular bases for this phenotype are still obscure. We report here that depletion of Ypi1 results in stabilization of the Pds1 securin, suggesting the activation of a G2/M checkpoint. Depletion of Ypi1 in cells deleted for MAD1/MAD2 or RAD9 still resulted in G2/M blockage, in spite that these cells lack key components of the spindle assembly and DNA damage checkpoints signaling, respectively. In contrast, deletion of SWE1, which encodes a protein kinase required for the morphogenesis checkpoint signaling, allowed passage through G2/M and recovery of normal cell morphology, although eventually the cells did not survive. Depletion of Ypi1 caused stabilization of the Swe1 kinase, which resulted in persistent phosphorylation of protein kinase Cdc28 at Y19, a landmark for morphogenesis checkpoint activation. In addition, we observed that lack of Ypi1 lead to depletion of the Cdc11 septin, which explain the failure to form properly assembled septin rings at the bud necks. This defect on septin assembly is likely the origin of the activation of the morphogenesis checkpoint.

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed: tetO7-ypi1 conditional mutant cells both, in the presence and in the absence of doxycyline for 2, 4 and 6 h. We compared the expression profile of: 1) tetO7-ypi1 + Dox after 2h vs tetO7-ypi1 – Dox after 2h 2) tetO7-ypi1 + Dox after 4h vs tetO7-ypi1 – Dox after 4h 3) tetO7-ypi1 + Dox after 6h vs tetO7-ypi1 – Dox after 6h A Dye-swap was carried out for each comparison of samples. Total number of chips analyzed: 6.
