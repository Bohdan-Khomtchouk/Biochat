SUMMARY
Genome-wide homozygosity mapping was employed for identification of the locus involved in autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy highly prevalent in a small community.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP array was performed for a pool of three samples from individuals with an autosomal recessive form of muscular dystrophy.
