TITLE
MicroRNA expression signatures of CD14-CD45-EpCAM+ cells in human bone marrow for colorectal cancer liver metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression approach to biodosimetry, we have employed microRNA microarray expression profiling to identify genes with the potential to distinguish liver metastasis related microRNA. Colorectal cancer patients were administered anesthesia and 20 mL BM was taken from the right and left anterior iliac crests before surgery. Mononucleated cells were collected using a standard Ficoll-Hypaque gradient technique. To enrich for EpCAM+ cells, CD14+ cells were removed from the whole bone marrow using auto MACSTM pro (Milteny Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) with anti-CD14 immunomagnetic beads (clone; TÜK4, Milteny Biotec). Next, CD45+ cells were removed by treatment with anti-CD45 immunomagnetic beads (clone; 5B1; Milteny Biotec). The residual CD14−CD45− cells were then incubated with FcR blocking reagent (Milteny Biotec), followed by incubation with anti-EpCAM immunomagnetic beads (clone; HEA-125, Milteny Biotec), and the CD14−CD45−EpCAM+ cells were taken up. Total RNA of these cells we analyzed the microRNA levels of  CD14−CD45−EpCAM+ cells obtained from non-metastasis patients (n = 12) and liver metastasis patients (n = 7).  Ten-microRNA consensus signature was identified that distinguished between CD14−CD45−EpCAM+ cells from liver metastasis patients and  CD14−CD45−EpCAM+ cells from non-liver metastasis patients.

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression of CD14-CD45-EpCAM+ cells in human bone marrow was measured.  RNA of these cells we analyzed the microRNA levels of  CD14−CD45−EpCAM+ cells obtained from non-metastasis patients (n = 12) and liver metastasis patients (n = 7).
