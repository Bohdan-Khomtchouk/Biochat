TITLE
Screening target genes of miR-100 in MGC-803 and SK-BR-3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We tried to find the target genes of miR-100 in MGC-803 and SK-BR-3 cells, thus we uesd specific miR-100 inhibitor to knock down the level of miR-100 in the cells, with this condition, we used this mRNA microarray to find the genes whose amount changed. and they may be the target genes that miR-100 mediated.

DESIGN
Total of four chips, MGC-AMO, MGC-NC, SK-AMO, SK-NC. MGC and SK represents MGC-803 and SK-BR-3 cells respectively.  AMO is the specific miR-100 inhibitor and NC is negative control.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
