TITLE
Master Regulators of oncogenic KRAS response in Pancreatic Cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We derived a transcriptional signature of oncogenic KRAS by using the KF508 murine pancreatic ductal cell line with an inducible Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL) cassette in front of the KRASG12D oncogene to regulate transcription. This dataset allowed us to study the differential expression profile after oncogenic KRAS induction in mouse.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from six sets of mock and cre treated ductal cells using Qiagen RNeasy kit. The RNA was labelled and hybridized. This experiment was carried out on 2 Illumina Mousev2 BeadChips using 24 arrays (1 samples per Bead-Chip).
