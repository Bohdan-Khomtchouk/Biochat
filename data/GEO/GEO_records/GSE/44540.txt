TITLE
Gene expression in hTERT-RPE1 cells with overexpression of MFRP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression was compared between hTERT-RPE1 cells and hTERT-RPE1 cells stably overexpressing mouse MFRP with an N-terminal GFP fusion.

DESIGN
RNA was prepared from hTERT-RPE1 cells overexpressing GFP-MFRP and control cells.  Both conditions were done in triplicate.  Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133Plus2.0 arrays were used to interrogate changes in gene expression.  Image data were quantified with Affymetrix Expression Console Software and normalized with Robust Multichip Analysis. Reference: Joseph Fogerty.  2013.
