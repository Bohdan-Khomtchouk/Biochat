TITLE
Identification of CLF-regulated transcripts using strand-specific RNA-sequencing in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
CURLY LEAF (CLF), the major histone methyltransferase of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), modifies trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and mediates dynamical chromatin repression in Arabidopsis. Here we used strand specific RNA-sequencing to profile Arabidopsis transcriptomes obtained from roots, shoots, flowers and siliques of Col-0 and clf-28 plants. Our analysis identified a large number of CLF-regulatedd transcripts in Arabidopsis.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling in roots, shoots, inflorescences and siliques of WT and clf-28 plants with 3 biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
