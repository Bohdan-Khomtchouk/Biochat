TITLE
Genome wide mapping for TF binding sites for Pol II, JunD, cFos, Max

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-Seq for 5 different transcription factors (Pol II, JunD, cFos, Max and cMyc) as part of the ENCODE project in order to determine sites of allele-specific binding. This was done in the GM12878 cell line which was genotyped as part of the pilot II phase of the 1000 genomes project. There is a matching RNA-Seq experiemnt performed on the same cell line.
