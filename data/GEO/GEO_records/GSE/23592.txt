TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Three Tissues in Chicken with Heat Stress by Affymetrix Microarray

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Heat stress is a very complex physiological process. At present, there are some reports about physiological function and pathological changed on chicken heat stress. We use DNA microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying heat stress and identified distinct classes of differentially expressed (DE) genes during this process.

DESIGN
Chicken were randomly divided into two groups to study the effects of heat stress on gene expression of brain, liver and leg muscle. Twenty-four birds (12 male and 12 female) were allocated to heat stress or post-heat stress group（40±1°C,3h） and control or pre-heat stress group（28±1°C）.
