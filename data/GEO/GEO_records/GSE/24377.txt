TITLE
Gene expression data from liver of rat fed a high-fat diet and high-fructose water without/with Eucommia ulmoides leaves

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To investigate effects of intake of Eucommia ulmoides leaves on hyperlipidemia, we performed gene expression profiling on rat liver by microarray analysis. Microarray analysis revealed that Eucommia ulmoides leaves up-regulated the gene expression involved in alpha-, beta-, and omega-oxidation of fatty acids, mainly relating to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway.

DESIGN
Rats were fed a high-fat diet and high-fructose water without/with orally administration of Eucommia ulmoides leaves for 5 weeks. Livers were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent microarrays.
