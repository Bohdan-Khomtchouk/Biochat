TITLE
ChIP-Seq analysis of PU.1, BATF, and JunB in murine BMDCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify the genome-wide binding sites for IRF4 interaction partners PU.1, BATF, and JunB in dendritic cells. These ChIP-seq data were integrated with gene expression analysis in IRF4-sufficient and -deficient BMDCs in order to assemble an IRF4 gene regulatory network.

DESIGN
Hematopoietic bone marrow progenitors from C57BL/6 mice were differentiated with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 5 days. On day 6, BMDCs were stimulated for 6 hours with 100ng/ml LPS. Fixed chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-PU.1, BATF, and JunB antibodies and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. The sequencing data for the input DNA was previously submitted as GSM999807.
