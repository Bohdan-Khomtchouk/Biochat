TITLE
Gene expression profiles of RPMI8226 cells after knockdown of KDM3A and KLF2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent studies have implicated KDM3A, which catalyzes removal of H3K9 methylation, is associated with tumorigenesis. However, the biological role of KDM3A in multiple myeloma, has not been delineated. Here we identify KDM3A-KLF2-IRF4 axis dependence in multiple myeloma. We demonstrate that knockdown of KDM3A leads to apoptosis and significant growth inhibition in myeloma cells. Mechanistically, KDM3A directly regulates myeloma cell survival factor IRF4 expression through H3K9 demethylation at its promoter. We further show that KDM3A directly regulates KLF2 expression and that knockdown of KLF2 leads to growth inhibition in myeloma cells. The goal of this analysis is to identify genes whose expression changes after shRNA-mediated knockdown of KDM3A and KLF2 using the human U133 plus 2.0 Affymetrix GeneChip in myeloma cell line (RPMI8226).

DESIGN
Two independent experiments were performed: 1. Myeloma cell line (RPMI8226) was transduced with either shRNAs targeting KDM3A (duplicate hairpins) or luciferase (control) in duplicate. The gene expression profiles of KDM3A knockdown cells were compared with that of control cells. A total of 6 RNA samples (4 KDM3A knockdown and 2 control) were analyzed. 2. Myeloma cell line (RPMI8226) was transduced with either shRNAs targeting KLF2 (duplicate hairpins) or luciferase (control) in duplicate. The gene expression profiles of KLF2 knockdown cells were compared with that of control cells.  A total of 6 RNA samples (4 KLF2 knockdown and 2 control) were analyzed.
