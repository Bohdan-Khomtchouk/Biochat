TITLE
Change in expression of genes after retinoic acid treatment of stellate cells: time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated the change in expression of genes after treatment of stellate cells with retinoic acid to understand how the stellate cells can de-differentiate and effect their physiological behaviour in pathological conditions. We then tested the changes in the gene expression in 2D and 3D culture conditions for pancreatic stellate cells and in a pancreatic cancer model. Keywords: gene expression change, time course

DESIGN
We treated a pancreatic stellate cell line on plastic with 1 micromolar all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for timepoints of 30 mins, 4 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours and 168 hours. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Illumina Human microarrays. We looked for target genes regulated by ATRA and evaluated for time course change.
