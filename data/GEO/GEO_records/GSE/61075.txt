TITLE
Whole genome tomato transcriptional response to jasmonic acid treatment and Tetranychus urticae herbivory [def-1]

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, is one of the most significant mite pests in agriculture that can feed on more than 1,100 plant hosts, including model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato, Solanum lycopersicum. In order to refine the involvement of jasmonic acid (JA) in mite-induced responses, we analyzed transcriptional changes in tomato JA signaling mutant defenseless1 (def-1) upon JA treatment and spider mite herbivory. We used microarray to assess global gene expression in Solanum lycopersicum def-1 cv. Castlemart upon jasmonic acid treatment and Tetranychus urticae attack.

DESIGN
1 month old def-1 tomato plants were subjected to Tetranychus urticae attack through application of 100 adult mites on a terminal leaflet of leaf 3 for 24 h or plants were sprayed with 1 mM jasmonic acid solution.
