TITLE
The transcription factor IRF1 and guanylate-binding proteins target activation of the AIM2 inflammasome by Francisella infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inflammasomes are critical for mounting host defense against pathogens. The molecular mechanisms that control activation of the AIM2 inflammasome in response to different cytosolic pathogens remain unclear. Here we found that the transcription factor IRF1 was required for the activation of the AIM2 inflammasome during infection with the Francisella tularensis subspecies novicida (F. novicida), whereas engagement of the AIM2 inflammasome by mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) or transfected double-stranded DNA did not require IRF1. Infection of F. novicida detected by the DNA sensor cGAS and its adaptor STING induced type I interferon-dependent expression of IRF1, which drove the expression of guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs); this led to intracellular killing of bacteria and DNA release. Our results reveal a specific requirement for IRF1 and GBPs in the liberation of DNA for AIM2 sensing depending on the pathogen encountered by the cell.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to explore the gene expression profiles differentially expressed in Francisella-infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from Irf1-/-, Ifnar1-/-, Aim2-/- and wild-type mice.
