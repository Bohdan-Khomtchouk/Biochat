TITLE
2-aminoimidazoles potentiate ß-lactam antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis by reducing ß-lactamase secretion and increasing cell wall permeability

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of 2-aminoimidazoles on M. tuberculosis transcriptional responese.

DESIGN
M. tuberculosis H37Rv was cultured in 7H9 media to an OD600 of 0.4 then treated with 125 µM 2B8 for 2 and 24 h.  Following treatment, RNA was isolated from the bacterial cultures and used for RNA-seq.
