TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional analysis of flagellin induced reprogramming in mouse corneal epithelial cells in response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously showed that pre-exposure of the cornea to TLR5 ligand flagellin induces profound mucosal innate protection against pathogenic microbes by reprogramming gene expression.   To date, there was no genome-wide cDNA array to detect full scale of flagellin mediated reprogramming of gene expression in mucosal surface epithelial cells. Taking advantage of readily accessible, easily procurable epithelial cell population, this study is the first report to use genome-wide cDNA microarray approach to document genes associated with flagellin-induced protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in corneal epithelial cells (CECs).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated mouse corneal epithelial cells of the control (cells scrapped off from the corneas without infection), Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected (6 h post infection) and flagellin pretreated (24 h), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (6 h).
