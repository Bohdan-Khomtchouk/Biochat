TITLE
Structural evidence for Scc4-dependent localization of cohesin loading

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study is to look at differences in genome wide localisation of Scc1 cohesin  between wild type and scc4-m35 in metaphase arrested  cells. Method: Wild-type (AM1145), wild type constructed in the same way as the mutant strain (carrying a HIS3 marker) (AM15540) and scc4-m35 mutant (AM15537)  cells carrying SCC1-6HA were synchronised with a-factor and arrested in mitosis by treatment with nocodazole/benomyl for 2 hr. Samples were harvested, anti-HA ChIP was performed and  input and IP samples were sequenced for the three strains. Results: All 16 centromeres were specifically depleted of Scc1 in the scc4-m35 background. Scc1 depletion extended roughly 10 kilobases to either side of the core centromere but not to chromosome arms
