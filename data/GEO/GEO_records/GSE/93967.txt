TITLE
MicroRNA microarray of mouse in response to atmospheric PM2.5 inhalation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the epigenetic mechanism by which PM2.5 deteriorated synaptic transmission and spatial learning and memory, we determined miRNA expression in hippocampi of mice in absent or present of PM2.5 exposure using GenoExplorer microRNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
MiRNA expression in hippocampi of mice was determined after mice received oropharyngeal aspiration of saline and PM2.5 at 1 and 5 mg/kg every other day for 4 weeks. Three independent experiments were performed with three repliactes in each groups.
