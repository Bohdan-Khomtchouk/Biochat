TITLE
Liver gene expression profiling of lipoprotein lipase heterozygous knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) was predicted as a causal gene for abdominal using a novel statistical method named LCMS (Schadt et al., 2005, Nature Genetics). In order to validate this prediction, we profiled the  liver tissues of lipoprotein lipase heterozygous knockout mice (Lpl+/-) and their littermate wild-type (wt) controls to examine the gene expression signature as well as pathways/networks resulting from the single gene perturbation.
