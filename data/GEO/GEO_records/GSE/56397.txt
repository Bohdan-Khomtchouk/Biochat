TITLE
the nuclear receptor tailless promotes increase of neurogenesis after stroke

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tlx expression is upregulated after stroke, and stroke-induced neurogenesis is blocked when Tlx is inactivated. Tlx overexpression in NSCs leads to massive induction of neurogenesis via stroke,  which leads to an improved motor function recovery.

DESIGN
Four Tlx overexpressing mice, and 5 wild type mice as control. Technique repeat is done for one of the wild type mouse c1 to validate the quality of the data.  Stroke are induced to all the mice  by one side stratum ischemia.
