TITLE
Transcriptome profiling reveals a genomewide role of G-proteins

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Knock out mutants of GPA1 (gpa1-5), GCR1 (gcr1-5) as well as their double mutant (gpa1-5 gcr1-5) were used to obtain genomewide transcriptome profile to deduce genomewide effect of both the subunits alone or in combination. Heterotrimeric G-protein signaling pathways have been implicated in a variety of biological processes in plants. While an impressive range of important plant responses are known to be mediated by G-protein signaling pathways, the genes that respond through these pathways are not yet known completely. More importantly, the role of G-proteins in mediating plant metabolic regulation, which is well established in animal systems, has not received adequate attention. The availability of loss-of-function G_alpha (GPA1) and G-protein coupled receptor (GCR1) mutant(s) as well as their double mutant in Arabidopsis provided an opportunity for a genome-wide microarray analysis in the current study for the first time.

DESIGN
transcriptome profile of mutants gpa1-5, gcr1-5 and double mutant gpa1-5 gcr1-5 were compared to that of the corresponding wild type, ws2. biological duplicates of each sample wa used and hybridized using single color array
