TITLE
Naive and  memory B6.2.16 CD8 T cell(11K  A and B)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Naive B6.2.16 CD8 T cells ( > 85% pure) were isolated from the lymph nodes (LN) of female RAG1-deficient B6.2.16 mice.  B6.2.16 CD8 T cell effectors were generated by culturing splenocytes from female RAG1-deficient B6.2.16 mice with HY peptide for 4 d and adoptively transferred into female RAG1-deficient mice.  After 200 d, memory B6.2.16 CD8 T cells ( > 80% pure) were recovered from the spleens and LNs by magnetic bead sorting. Sample proRNA from na√Øve and memoryB6.2.16 CD8 T cells was isolated using Trizol(r) Reagent and used to make cRNA for hybridization according to Affymetrix protocols. Keywords: other
