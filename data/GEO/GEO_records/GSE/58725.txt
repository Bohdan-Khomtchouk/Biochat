TITLE
Expression data from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and ESC-like cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transplantation of ESCs into living recipients causes teratoma formation which accompanies with several biological reactions in both the transplanted cells and recipient. Co-injection of ESCs with somatic cells that influence donor-recipient homogeneity can affect transcriptional profile of transplanted ESCs. We investigated global gene expression of parental ESCs and ESC-like cells derived from teratomas which were formed by different injection conditions to find transcriptional differences according to donor-recipient homogeneity and somatic cell co-injection.

DESIGN
Parental ESCs or teratoma-derived ESC-like cells from different treatments were retrieved for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
