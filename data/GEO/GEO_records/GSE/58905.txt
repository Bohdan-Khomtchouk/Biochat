TITLE
Gene expression profiling of wild type and CNS2-deficient Treg cells in the resting state

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Resting regulatory T cells (CD4+GFP+CD44lowCD62Lhigh) were sorted from the littermates of male Foxp3gfp and Foxp3Î”CNS2-gfp mice. Poly(A)-tailed RNA were amplified and sequenced on an Ion Torrent platform.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of WT and CNS2KO regulatory T cells in the resting state

PLATFORM
GPL16331 Ion Torrent PGM (Mus musculus)
