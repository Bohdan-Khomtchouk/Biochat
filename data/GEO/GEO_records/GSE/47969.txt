TITLE
Effects of aerobic vs. resistance training on visceral and liver fat stores, liver enzymes, and insulin resistance by HOMA in overweight adults from STRRIDE AT/RT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this work was  to compare the effects of AT, RT, and the full combination (AT/RT) on central ectopic fat, liver enzymes, and fasting insulin resistance [homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)]

DESIGN
Pre-training samples reported in this Series. There are no post training samples - these data are being used as classification data to predict outcome and hence we don't profile post intervention samples. STRRIDE dataset.
