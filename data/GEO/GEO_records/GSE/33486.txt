TITLE
Expression profiling of Notch constitutive activation induced HCC in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is the active form of the Notch receptor. In this mouse model, NICD is inserted in the Rosa26 locus downstream of a loxP-STOP-LoxP (lsl) sequence and therefore NICD expression is dependant on Cre recombinase expression. These mice are crossed with the AFP-Cre strain that expresses Cre in hepatoblasts due to its regulation by the AFP promoter and albumin enhancer. Mice from 6 to 12 months are sacrificed and liver RNA samples from control monotransgenic Rosa26-lsl-NICD and confirmed HCC lesions from bitransgenic AFP-Cre/Rosa26-lsl-NICD (AFP-NICD) are obtained. Exon expression profiling of these samples are submitted.

DESIGN
Four liver samples from monotransgenic mice (control) and five hepatocellular carcinoma samples from bitransgenic mice are analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array platform. Array data was preprocessed and analyzed using GenePattern software and R.
