TITLE
Expression data from T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (TPLL) and normal T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-cell prolymphocytic leukemina (T-PLL) is an agressive lymphoma derived from mature T-cells, which is in most cases characterized by the presence of an inv(14)(q11q32) and a characteristic pattern of secondary chromosomal abberations. We used microarrays to compare the transcriptomes of eight immunomagnetically purified CD3+ normal donor derived peripheral blood cells with five highly purified inv(14)-positive T-PLL blood samples. Keywords: desease state analysis

DESIGN
Purified T-PLL cells and normal T-cells were analyzed on microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes. High-resolution copy number determination using SNP-chip technology and FISH in twelve inv(14)-positive T-PLL showed that differentially expressed genes clustered significantly in regions affectd by recurrent chromosomal imbalances.
