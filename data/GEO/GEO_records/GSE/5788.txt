SUMMARY
T-cell prolymphocytic leukemina (T-PLL) is an agressive lymphoma derived from mature T-cells, which is in most cases characterized by the presence of an inv(14)(q11q32) and a characteristic pattern of secondary chromosomal abberations. We used microarrays to compare the transcriptomes of eight immunomagnetically purified CD3+ normal donor derived peripheral blood cells with five highly purified inv(14)-positive T-PLL blood samples. Keywords: desease state analysis
