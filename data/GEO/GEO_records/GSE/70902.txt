TITLE
Gata.a, Tcf7 and Zic-r.a ChIP-chip analysis in Ciona intestinalis embryo (16-cell stage)

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
DNA binding profiles of three maternal factors (Tcf7, Gata.a and Zic-r.a) in chordate 16-cell stage embryo. 16-cell stage ciona intestinalis embryos were collected from multiple batches and the extracted chromatin was immunoprecipitated by the antibodies which specifically recognize ciona Gata.a, Tcf7 and Zic-r.a, respectively.

DESIGN
Three independent chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (Gata.a, Tcf7 and Zic-r.a)

PLATFORM
GPL8993 Kyoto University Custom Agilent Ciona intestinalis 1M Tiling Array
