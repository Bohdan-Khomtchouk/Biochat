TITLE
Measuring gene expression and RNA editing in Drosophila adapting to divergent microclimatesÂ 

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq to profile gene expression in the heads and whole bodies of 32 isofemale fly lines from two divergent microclimates at 'Evolution Canyon' in Israel (16 fly lines from each microclimate).  We also measured RNA editing levels in the head tissue of these flies.

DESIGN
For each of the 32 isofemale fly lines from 'Evolution Canyon', gene expression profiles of whole bodies and heads, along with RNA editing profiles of heads of 3-5 day old male flies through RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL19132 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
