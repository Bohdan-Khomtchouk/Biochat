TITLE
VHL/HIF2a axis alters transcriptomic profiles in ccRCC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
VHL loss is the most common genetic alteration event in ccRCC. VHL loss stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF2a). We compared the changes in transcriptomics profiles after VHL restoration or HIF2a siRNA knockdown in 786-O cells.

DESIGN
RNA-seq profiles of ccRCC cell line 786-O with and without wild-type VHL restoration, with non-targeting control or pooled siRNA against HIF2a
