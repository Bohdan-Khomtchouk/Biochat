TITLE
Expression profiles in Zbtb20-overexpressed neural precursor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neural precursor cells (NPCs) are multipotent cells that can generate neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the mammalian central nervous system. Although Zbtb20 was expressed in NPCs, its functions in neural development are not fully understood. We performed microarray analysis to examine changes in gene expression between control and Zbtb20-overexpressed NPCs.

DESIGN
NPCs derived from E11.5 mouse forebrains were infected with control or Zbtb20 retrovirus in the presence of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Three days after infection, the virus-infected NPCs were harvested or dissociated and seeded on poly-D-lysine -coated dishes, and subsequently the cells were cultured for 1 day or without  FGF2 and EGF.
