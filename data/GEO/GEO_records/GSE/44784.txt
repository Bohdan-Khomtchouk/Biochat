TITLE
miR-29 affect on DC gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), comparing cells transfected with miR-29a mimic, or miR-29b mimic, or negative control.

DESIGN
3 condition experiment, control versus miR-29a, and control versus miR-29b. 3 biological replicates for each condition and control.
