TITLE
Investigation of the role of PRL-3 in leukemogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the role of PRL-3 in the leukemogenesis, we transfected a control vector (pEGFP) and (human) PRL-3 gene into an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line TF-1, respectively. After drug selection and FACS sorting, we established TF1-pEGFP and TF1-hPRL-3 isogenic cell lines. In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to characterized this pair of isogenic cell lines. Results provided insight into the molecular basis of PRL-3 in contributing the development of AML.

DESIGN
Whole genome microarray comparsion of TF1-pEGFP vs TF1-hPRL-3 cell line
