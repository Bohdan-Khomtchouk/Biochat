TITLE
Transcriptome of human foetal heart for comparison with cardiomyocytes from pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression in the human foetal heart for a comparison with cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells. Human foetal heart samples were collected from the individual chambers of the heart at various stages of development. This provided the opportunity to perform gene expression analysis and identify genes involved in the formation of the heart in each of the four chambers and at different stages of development. The dataset can be used to benchmark human pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) in terms of their maturation state by comparing it to the foetal heart samples. Two commercially available reference RNA sets are included in the analysis in order to characterize future sets of hPSC-CMs.

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed on human foetal heart samples from first and second trimester hearts, separated in atria and ventricles.
