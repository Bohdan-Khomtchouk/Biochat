TITLE
Methylation changes occurring in early postnatal liver development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genomic DNA is isolated from C57BL6/J mice at E17.5 and postnatal d21, and we used MCAM to identify genes undergoing methylation change during late fetal to early postnatal mouse liver development.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, P21 vs. E17.5. Biological replicates: 2 for each condition.
