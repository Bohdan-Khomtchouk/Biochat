TITLE
Genome-wide methylation and expression analysis of two breast cancer cell lines [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To improve our understanding of the relationships between methylation and expression we profiled mRNA expression and single-base resolution methylation levels for two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and T47D. Expression was profiled using RNA-seq.  Methylation was assayed using Methyl-MAPS, which uses methylation-sensitive and -dependent restriction enzyme digests followed by high-throughput sequencing to identify methylation levels at individual CpGs (Edwards et al. 2010, Genome Research).

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was used to generate mRNA expression profiles of MCF7 and T47D cells under standard growth conditions.
