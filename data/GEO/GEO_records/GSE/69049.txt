TITLE
Transferring genomics to the clinic: distinguishing Burkitt and Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (v3)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out for RNA extracted from Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies for  76 patients using the Illumina DASL version 3 platform.  The patients were then classified into BL and DLBCL by moleclar classifier proposed in the article.

DESIGN
The molecular classification result of the replicate samples are used to evaluated the reproducibility of the classifier, and the clinic diagnosis were used to compare the agreement with the classifier
