TITLE
Whole genome expression data from female adult Drosophila melanogaster midguts

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The highly conserved Wnt signaling pathway drives intestinal homeostasis across species. Apc is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling. Loss of function mutations in Apc are found in 80-90% of human colorectal cancers. Importantly, Apc loss is widely known as the key driving event in the disease. We used microarray analysis of adult Drosophila midguts to study the molecular mechanisms regulated upon loss of Apc in the intestine.

DESIGN
Whole midguts from 7 day olfd adult female animals where dissected for RNA isolation and Affymetrix microarray hybridization. Tissues from a wild type strain (w1118) and whole null mutant Apc1 (Apc1Q8, also refered to as Apc1-/-) animals were used in the study.
