TITLE
A cDNA microarray analysis was performed on HepG2 or L-02 cells with either vectors or constructs expressing MEN1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Menin, the product of the MEN1 gene in humans (Men1 in mice), is responsible for the inherited tumor syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). menin interacts with the trithorax group (trxG) proteins (Drosophila) and the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) (humans) histone methyltransferase (HMTase) complex, and it alters histone tail modifications and the transcription of target genes. To explore a potential functional implication of menin in HCC, we stably transfected HepG2 or L-02 cells with either vectors or constructs expressing MEN1. A cDNA microarray analysis was performed on HepG2 or L-02 cells with either vectors or constructs expressing MEN1. To obtain a broader understanding of the molecular network of menin in HCC, the whole genome microarray expression profiling was performed on HepG2 or L-02 cells with either vectors or constructs expressing MEN1.

DESIGN
Comparison of gene expression results from HepG2 or L-02 cells with either vectors or constructs expressing MEN1.
