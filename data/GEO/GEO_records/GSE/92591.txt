TITLE
Functional analysis of CTCF sites associated with cytokine-sensing mammary-specific enhancers in the complex casein locus [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The zinc finger protein CTCF has been invoked in establishing functional boundaries between genes and thereby controlling enhancer activities. However, there is limited genetic evidence to support such a concept. We have now addressed this question in a locus containing five mammary-specific genes controlled by enhancers. We have identified four CTCF binding sites in the casein locus, two at the outside boundaries and two associated with a super-enhancer. Individual deletions of these sites from the mouse genome did not alter expression of the five casein genes and Odam. However, deletion of the border CTCF site separating the Csn1s1 enhancer from non-mammary genes resulted in the activation of Sult1d1 at a distance of more than 95 kb but not the more proximal Sult1e1 gene. Loss of this CTCF site led to de novo interactions between the Csn1s1 enhancer and the Sult1d1 promoter but not with the silent Sult1e1 gene. Our study suggests that most CTCF sites associated with cell-specific enhancers and super-enhancers have no measurable in vivo activity. Only the loss of one CTCF site led to the induction of a juxtaposed active non-target promoter. Our study also demonstrated that cell-specific enhancers are unable to activate juxtaposed silent non-target promoters.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for mutant mice ΔA were done for CTCF, GR, H3K27ac, Pol2, SMC1 and STAT5A in mammary tissue at lactation day 1 (L1). ChIP-seq for ΔC was done for CTCF in mammary tissue at L1.
