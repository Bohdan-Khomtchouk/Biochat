TITLE
Genome-wide changes in DNA methylation in response to physical exercise

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we describe a genome-wide analysis of DNA-methylation in muscle of trained mice. In comparison to sedentary controls 2762 genes exhibited differentially methylated CpGs in their putative promoter regions.  The majority of these genes were related to muscle growth and differentiation and a minor fraction involved in metabolic regulation. These findings suggest that DNA-methylation is involved in the regulation of muscle adaptation to regular exercise training.
