TITLE
Pichia angusta cells glucose- vs methanol-grown

ORGANISM
Ogataea polymorpha NCYC 495 leu1.1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Pichia angusta NCYC 495 leu1.1 cells growing exponentially on mineral medium containing 0.5% glucose versus a shift for 2 hours to mineral medium containing 0.5% methanol.

DESIGN
Two-conditions experiment, 4 individual glucose-grown cultures were shifted at OD660nm 2.3 to fresh mineral medium OD 0.2 containing 0.5% methanol for 2 hours. Transcriptional profiling was performed using total RNA from the glucose-grown cells at the moment of the shift versus cells adapted to methanol for 2 hours.
