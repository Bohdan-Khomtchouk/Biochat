TITLE
Expression data from MX treated Salmonella typhimurium TA100

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
We exposed Salmonella TA100 cells to 3 concentrations of MX that produced a linear concentration-response for mutagenesis with little cell killing.  We measured mutagenesis, survival, and global gene expression.  We used custom-spotted glass slides as our microarray platform and identified genes whose expressions were altered by MX treatment using three methods: (1) a Bayesian t-test, (2) an operon analysis that assumes if one gene in an operon is differentially expressed then all genes in that operon are differentially expressed, and (3) a monotonic-expression response to increasing doses of MX.  The resulting list of genes was analyzed for functional and KEGG pathway representation. Keywords: dose response
