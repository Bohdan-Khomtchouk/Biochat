TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression alterations in Stage III-IV high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients exhibiting clinically defined differences in ascites volume (high volume ascites versus low volume ascites)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to examine gene expression changes in the surgical resections of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients exhibiting clinically distinct levels of ascites volume.  The present studies primary aim was to determine if there is a molecular gene expression  difference between the patients presenting at time of surgery when high volumes ascites cases were compared to those with low volume ascites. The secondary aim was to determine what relevance this difference, if found, has to previously discovered molecular sub-types of high grade serous ovarian cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from snap-frozen stage III-IV high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients presenting with low volume ( < =200 cc) or high volume ( > =1000 cc) ascites volume.

PLATFORM
