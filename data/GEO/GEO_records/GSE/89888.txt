TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of ESR1 mutations in T47D and MCF7 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Transcriptome analysis of ESR1 mutant cells was performed via sequencing total RNA in T47D and MCF7 cell lines containing Y537S and D538G mutations.

DESIGN
Methods: Individual ESR1 WT and mutant T47D and MCF7 clones were hormone deprived in CSS for three days, pooled, and plated in quadruplicates in 6-well plates. The cells were treated with veh or 1nM E2 for 24 hrs, RNA was isolated and subjected to sequencing. Differential expression analysis was performed by DEseq2 and R was used to conduct statistical analysis tests
