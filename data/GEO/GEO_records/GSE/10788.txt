TITLE
Comparison of L. interrogans strains 56601 and IPAV at 37°C

ORGANISM
Leptospira interrogans

SUMMARY
DNA microarray analysis was used to compare the differential gene-expression profiles between Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai type strain 56601 and its corresponding attenuated strain IPAV. A 22 kb genomic island covering a cluster of 34 genes (LA0186 to LA0219) was actively expressed in both strains but concomitantly up-expressed in strain 56601 in contrast to that of IPAV. RT-PCR assays proved that the gene cluster comprised five transcripts. Gene annotation of this cluster revealed characteristics of a putative prophage-like remnant with at least 8 out of 34 CDSs encoding prophage-like proteins, of which, LA0195 is probably a putative prophage CI-like regulator. The transcription initiation activities of putative promoter-regulatory sequences of transcripts I, II and III, all proximal to LA0195, were further analyzed in the Escherichia coli promoter probe vector pKK232-8 by assaying the reporter CAT enzyme activities. The strong promoter activities of both transcripts I and II indicated by the E. coli CAT assay were well correlated with the in vitro sequence-specific binding of the recombinant LA0195 protein to the corresponding promoter probes detected by the electrophoresis mobility shift assay. On the other hand, the promoter activity of transcript III was very low in E. coli and failed to show active binding to LA0195 in vitro. These results suggested that LA0195 is likely involved in the transcription of transcripts I and II. However, the identical complete DNA sequences of this prophage remnant from these two strains strongly suggests that possible regulatory factors or signal transduction systems resided outside of this region within the genome maybe responsible for the differential expression profiling in these two strains.
