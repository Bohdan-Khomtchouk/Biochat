TITLE
HOXB7 mRNA is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and its knockdown induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to determine the role of HOXB7 gene in cell lines derived from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (MIA PaCa-2 e Capan-1), we performed its silencing utilizing the technique of RNA interference (RNAi). Total RNA derived from the inhibition as well as from parental cells was quantified in Bioanalyzer (Agilent,Santa Clara, CA, USA)  and  employed in the Agilent platform (4x44K). Proceeded with the guidelines of the One Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Protocol (Agilent) and with the use of the Agilent Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit. HOXB7 knockdown elicited the modulation of several biological processes, especially in the MIA Paca-2 cell line, such as proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent catabolic process, synthesis of amines and cell cycle. Moreover, it showed induction of apoptosis and reduction in cell proliferation by flow cytometry and MTT assay, respectively.  In this context, HOXB7 represents another component associated with the extensive network of molecules involved in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer and could be a promising target for future biologic therapies.

DESIGN
The procedure was performed in duplicate for both cell lines, which were sorted into treated and untreated with RNAi.
