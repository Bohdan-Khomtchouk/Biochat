TITLE
Expression data from melanosis coli (MC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is still a big debate about the correlation between melanosis coli (MC) and carcinoma. We used HTA2.0 to investigate the expression changes of lncRNAs and mRNAs in human colonic mucosa with or without MC and try to investigate MC from gene aspect, eventually to demonstrate whether there’s a certain correlation between MC and carcinoma. GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (HTA 2.0) microarrays were adopted. The expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNA were tested in five colon tissue biopsy specimen of MC patients and five demographically-matched controls.

DESIGN
This study recruited a total of five MC patients and five coupled matched controls. All specimens were obtained from colonoscopy. The fresh specimens of colon tissues form MC patients and control patients were washed with RNAase free water and put into RNAlater (Qiagen) immediately and frozen in -80°C. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG Pathway analyses of aberrantly expressed mRNAs were performed to identify the related biological functions and pathologic pathways.
