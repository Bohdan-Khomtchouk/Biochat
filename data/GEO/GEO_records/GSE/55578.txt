TITLE
Genome-wide comparative analysis of gene expression in  wild type (WT3) and TRPM7-/- (K09) mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TRPM7 is a ubiquitous ion channel and kinase, a unique ‘chanzyme’, required for proper early embryonic development. In order to assess the effects of TRPM7 activity on cellular gene expression, mouse embryonic stem cells with TRPM7 gene deletion (TRPM7-/- mESC) were established. By using microarray analysis, we identified genes with transcription significantly different in TRPM7-deficient mESC.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from cells using Qiagen RNAeasy Plus mini Kit. Triplicate samples were made for each wild type  clone 3 (WT3) and and TRPM7-/- clone 9 (KO9) mESC
