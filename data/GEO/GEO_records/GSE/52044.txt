TITLE
Expression profiling in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome gene expression profiling of Normal -(HUVEC) Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells The HUVEC gene expression results analyzed in this study are further described in Kustermann S. et al. (2014) A real-time impedance based screening assay for drug induced vascular leakage.

DESIGN
A NimbleGen Homo sapiens Expression Array [100718_HG18_opt_expr] study using total RNA recovered from HUVECs grown until 80% confluency. Each microarray measures the expression level of 23,611 genes using 45,033 probe sets with three 60-mer probes (PM) per probe set. Each probe set is represented once on the array.
