TITLE
Transcriptome changes in IL-10 treated peritoneal macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To try to identify the mechanism of STAT3s indirect action we have used a genomic approach to map the binding sites of STAT3 within the genome and also used RNA-seq technology to map the changes in RNA expression and transcript isoform abundance in response to IL-10.
