TITLE
Gene expression profiles in drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions with cutaneous involvement

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hypersensitivity reactions to medications constitute a growing problem in the clinical practice. In order to study the molecular basis underlying the pathogenesis of non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions to drugs, we characterized the gene expression profiles of PBMCs isolated from patients during the acute phase and upon resolution of the clinical symptoms using a cDNA array technology. Eighty five genes were found to be differentially expressed during the acute phase of drug-induced delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Furthermore, ninety two genes with distinct expression patterns during the acute phase of severe and benign diseases were identified. Keywords: Comparison between disease and healty status
