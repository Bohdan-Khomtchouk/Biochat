TITLE
Nanotopography guides morphology and spatial patterning of induced pluripotent stem cell colonies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of topographic cues in controlling commitment of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that groove-ridge nanostructures induce the elongation of iPSC colonies, guide the orientation of apical actin fibers and direct the polarity of cell division. Elongation of iPSC colonies impacts also on the intrinsic molecular patterning which seems to be orchestrated starting from the rim of the colonies. We followed the hypothesis that nanotopography directly modulates the transcriptional program of iPSC, further to guiding the overall spatial organization of the colonies.  Single iPSC were seeded on flat (PI flat) and nanostructured polyimide (PI 650) and gene expression profiles were analyzed after three days. No significant differences were observed when cells were kept under culture conditions that sustained pluripotency. Then, we analyzed gene expression changes upon two weeks of multi-lineage differentiation. Many genes revealed significant expression changes in the course of differentiation and this was more pronounced on PI flat as compared to PI 650. Comparison of iPSC that were either differentiated on flat or nanostructured biomaterials revealed differential expression of several genes. Noteworthy, among significantly regulated genes, the biggest fold change on PI 650 versus PI flat after differentiation was observed in ANKRD1, which is one of the best readouts of YAP/TAZ activity. Our study suggests that nanotopography impacts on orientation and organization of iPSC colonies and highlight a possible interaction between mechanosensors and mechanotransducers.
