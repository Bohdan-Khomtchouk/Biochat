TITLE
H2O2 effect on mouse embryonic fibroblasts +/- a deletion in the helicase domain of the Werner Syndrome gene homologue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
[original Title] Expression profiling of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with or without a deletion in the helicase domain of the Werner Syndrome gene homologue treated with hydrogen peroxide Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare disorder characterized by the premature onset of a number of age-related diseases. The gene responsible for WS is believed to be involved in different aspects of transcription, replication, and/or DNA repair. In addition to genomic instability, WS cells exhibit oxidative stress. In this report, we have examined the impact of exogenous peroxide on the expression profile of mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking part of the helicase domain of the WRN homologue. This expression profile was compared to hydrogen peroxide treated wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Interestingly, untreated mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a deletion of the helicase domain of Wrn already exhibited down regulation of several biological processes decreased by hydrogen peroxide in wild type cells.

DESIGN
Microarray analyses were performed in duplicate using Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Arrays on WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated or not with H2O2 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking part of the helicase domain of the WRN homologue treatead or not with H2O2.
