TITLE
Comparative Genomic Analysis of PhoP Regulon in S. Typhi and S. Typhimurium

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of three sequenced S. enterica strains: S. Typhimurium LT2, S. Typhi CT18, and S. Typhi Ty2 in PhoP-inducing and non-inducing conditions in vitro, and compared these results to profiles of phoP-/Q- mutants derived from S. Typhimurium LT2 and S. Typhi Ty2.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment:  Each strain above was grown in PhoP-inducing (Low Magnesium concentration) and PhoP non-inducing conditions (High Magnesium concentration) with 1 dye reversal.
