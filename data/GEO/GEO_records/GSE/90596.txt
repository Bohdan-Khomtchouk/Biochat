TITLE
Transcriptome analysis and identification of genes associated with lemon floral transition and flower development during floral inductive water deficits

ORGANISM
Citrus limon

SUMMARY
Water deficit is the key induction factors known to induce flowering in many woody plants, whereas reports on the molecular mechanisms underlying floral induction by water deficit are scarce. Here, we analyzed morphology, cytology and different hormone level of lemon buds during floral inductive water deficits. Higher levels of ABA were observed and the floral buds initiated differentiation by paraffin sections analysis. Total 1,638 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by RNA-sequencing. Some DEGs were related to flowering, while others were associated with hormone biosynthesis or metabolism.

DESIGN
In this experiment, terminal bud and the following five buds (the major node position for flower formation) from flushes were sampled at three stages (stage 1: one week before water deficit, stage 2: one week after the beginning of water deficit, and stage 3: one week after rehabilitation of irrigation).
