TITLE
Long non-coding RNAs in B cells (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using RNA sequencing and de novo transcript assembly, we identified 4516 lncRNAs expressed in 8 different stages of B cell development and activation. Chromatin immuno-precipitation sequencing was used to classify a substantial fraction (38%) of these lncRNAs as enhancer-associated or promoter-associated RNAs (eRNAs or pRNAs).

DESIGN
A catalogue of lncRNAs expressed in eight murine B cell populations

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
