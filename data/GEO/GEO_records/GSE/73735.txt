TITLE
Identification of PARP1 target genes using microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose:To indentify downtream effectors of PARP1, we performed microarray profiling in non-targeting or PARP1 targeting shRNA-expressing H2030-BrM3. Results: we identifed 15 genes whose expression were decreased upon depletion of PARP1 in H2030-BrM3 cells at least by under 1.3-fold.

DESIGN
RNA profiling of PARP1-depleted H2030-BrM3 was analyzed by genome-wide microarray using Illumina bead chip TotalPrep RNA amplification Kit. Biotin labeled cDNA are hybridized with Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 Beadchips using Illumina standard protocol.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
