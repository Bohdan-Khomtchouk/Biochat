TITLE
Integrated  analysis of genome-wide copy number and matched expression data reveals novel genes in esophageal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The incidence of esophageal and junctional adenocarcinoma has increased 6-fold in the west in the last 30 years and 5 year survival remains < 14%. We aimed to characterize genome-wide aberrations in esophageal adenocarcinoma to further understand disease pathogenesis and ultimately identify groups with differential survivals with implications for clinical management. Oligo-array-based high-resolution analysis of copy number changes in 89 fresh frozen esophageal adenocarcinoma resection sections with long-term clinical follow-up data was performed. Good quality array comparative genomic hybridization profiles were obtained from 56/89 of the samples (63%). Our analyses confirmed known genomic aberrations in esophageal adenocarcinoma and identified 3 novel genomic regions with copy number changes. A modified T test with adjusted Bonferroni correction identified 17 genes with significantly different log2 ratios (p < 4x10-7), including 6 novel genes, that characterize a group with a poorer survival.

DESIGN
Total DNA isolated from human tissue sections was used to make fluorescently labeled DNA that was hybridized to Illumina HumanCytoSNP-12 Beadarray. All protocols were carried out following Illumina's standard protocols. After hybridization, raw data were recorded and normalized using Illumina's BeadStudio software v2.0. Matched expression data: GSE25201      GSE19417 D2   MRC/OEA0022CJ5 (GSM482819) D3   MRC/OEA0032CJ5 (GSM482817) D27  MRC/OEA0272CJ1 (GSM482814) D36  MRC/OEA0362CJ3 (GSM482806) D37  MRC/OEA0372AJ0 (GSM482800) D96  MRC/OEA0962BJ0 (GSM482847) D118 MRC/OEA1172CJ1 (GSM482848) D138 MRC/OEA1382CJ0 (GSM482844) D156 MRC/OEA1562CJ2 (GSM482853)
