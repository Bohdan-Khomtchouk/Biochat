TITLE
Expression profiling of Ewing sarcoma cell lines exposed to 5nM Pladienolide B (PlaB) for 24 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes and pathways altered by PlaB, a bacterial natural product that acts as a spliceosome modulator by targeting the SF3b subunit of the spliceosome

DESIGN
SKNMC, TC32, TC71, and RD-ES Ewing sarcoma cell lines were treated with 0.1% (v/v) DMSO vehicle or 5nM PlaB for 24 hours. Three samples in each group were analyzed.
