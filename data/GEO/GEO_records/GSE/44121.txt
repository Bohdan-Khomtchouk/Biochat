TITLE
Association of microRNAs with colon tumor metastases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the expression of microRNAs in primary colon tumors with their paired liver metastases using the Nanostring human microRNA assays version 1 23 microRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between colon primary tumors and their paired metastases

DESIGN
Total mRNA was extracted from flash frozen primary colon tumors and paired metastases. 18 tissues from 9 donors were used for this study.  100 ng of RNA was hybridized to Nanostring Human 0microRNA assays version 1.0.  Data was normalized according to manufacterer's recommendation.  This included background substraction and normalizing to the geometric mean of the highest 75 microRNAs.
