TITLE
Expression microarray with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-treated Caco-2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) treated and untreated Caco-2 cells were compared using an expression microarray.

DESIGN
Total RNA from untreated Caco-2 cells was labeled with Cy3, and total RNA from DAC-treated Caco-2 cells was labeled with Cy5.
