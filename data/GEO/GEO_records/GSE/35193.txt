TITLE
Pulmonary gene expression in C57BL/6 mice intratracheally instilled with Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated pulmonary mRNA profiles of female mice exposed to 0.018, 0.054 and 0.162 mg Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles by single intra-tracheal instillation. We examined responses to these doses 1, 3 and 28 days after exposure, alongside respective controls. This study demonstrates widespread changes in inflammatory and acute phase response genes that persisted to 28 days at the highest exposure dose. Changes relevant to sterol and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways were also observed.

DESIGN
individual total RNA (200 ng) from 6 mice per treatment group (control, 0.018mg, 0.054mg, and 0.162mg) and universal reference total RNA (Stratagene, Mississauga, ON, Canada) was used to synthesize double stranded cDNA.

PLATFORM
