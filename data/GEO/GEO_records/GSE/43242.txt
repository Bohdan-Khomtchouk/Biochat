TITLE
Effect of osteoblast-specific constitutive activation of beta-catenin or deletion of FoxO1 on gene expression in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene expression of mice with osteoblast-specific beta-catenin activation or FoxO1 deactivation are each compared to that of Wt.

DESIGN
A. Wt mice (n=4) B. Osteoblast specific beta-catenin constitutively expressed mice (n=3) C. Osteoblast specific FoxO1 deleted mice  (n=3)
