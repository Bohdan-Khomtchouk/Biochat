TITLE
Derivation, characterization, and neuronal differentiation of integration-free induced pluripotent stem cell lines from Parkinsons disease patients carrying SNCA, LRRK2, PARK2, and GBA mutations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole genome expression in control and patients with Parkinsons disease iPSC lines. The hypothesis tested in present study was that deficient GBA, SNCA, LRRK2 and PARKIN expression can be used for disease modeling by their affects on multiple pathways. These results provide information on relationship between PD genes and mitochondria related gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from patient iPSC line compare to control iPSC line

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
