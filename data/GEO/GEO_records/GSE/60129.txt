TITLE
Progestin-containing Contraceptives Alter Expression of Host Defense-related Genes of the Endometrium and Cervix

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epidemiological studies indicate that progestin-containing contraceptives may increase susceptibility to HIV and other infections; however, underlying mechanisms involving the upper female reproductive tract are undefined. To determine the effects of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on gene expression and physiology of the human endometrial and cervical transformation zone (TZ), microarray analyses were performed on whole tissue biopsies. In endometrium, activated pathways included leukocyte chemotaxis, attachment, and inflammation in DMPA (z > 2.5) and LNG-IUS (z > 3.5) users, and regulation of pattern recognition receptors and other immune mediators. In cervical TZ, progestin treatment altered expression of tissue remodeling and viability genes, but not those of immune functions. Together, these results indicate that progestins influence expression of immune-related genes in endometrium that would be expected to result in the local recruitment of HIV target cells, and thus may increase HIV susceptibility. It is important to consider the upper reproductive tract in the assessment of effects of contraceptives that may influence susceptibility to pathogens, such as HIV.

DESIGN
Cross-sectional study conducted at an academic medical center. Cervical transformation zone and endometrial biopsies were obtained from 3 groups of volunteers: those using no hormonal contraceptives (controls, mid-secretory phase, n=20 cervix, 11 endometrium), DMPA users (150mg, n=15, 8), or LNG-IUS users (n=17, 13). DMPA and LNG-IUS groups had used these contraceptives for at least 6 months.
