TITLE
Intra-amniotic Balloon Inflation Induces an Inflammatory “Pulse” and Labor in Nonhuman Primates

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Uterine stretch is thought to induce preterm labor in women with twin and higher order pregnancies, but the pathophysiology remains unclear. We investigated the pathogenesis of stretch-induced preterm birth for the first time in a pregnant nonhuman primate model.
