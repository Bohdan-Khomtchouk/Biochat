TITLE
Gene expression in GABPα-sufficient and -deficient T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ets family transcription factor GA-binding protein (GABP) regulates gene expression in CD4 and CD8 T cells. We used microarray to examine genes differentially expressed in GABP-sufficient (WT) and GABP-deficient (KO) CD4 and CD8 T cells

DESIGN
Naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were purified from spleen and lymph nodes of Gabpaf/f (WT) and CD4CreGabpaf/f  (KO) mice by FACS sorting. Naive T cells were either subjected to RNA extraction directly  (0-hour), or stimulated with α-CD3/28 and IL-2 for 18 hours before RNA extraction (18-hour).
