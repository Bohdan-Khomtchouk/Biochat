TITLE
A chromatin code for alternative splicing involving a putative association between CTCF and HP1Î± proteins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alternative splicing is primarily controlled by the activity of splicing factors and by the elongation of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Recent experiments have suggested a new complex network of splicing regulation involving chromatin, transcription and multiple protein factors. In particular, the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), the Argonaute protein AGO1, and members of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family have been implicated in the regulation of splicing associated to chromatin and the elongation of RNAPII. These results raise the question of whether these proteins may associate at the chromatin level to modulate alternative splicing.

DESIGN
RNA extraction from MCF-7 and MCF-10A cell lines. Splicing changes between these two cell lines were measured using a splice junction array (Affymetrix HJAY).
