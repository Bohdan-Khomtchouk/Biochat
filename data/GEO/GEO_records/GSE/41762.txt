TITLE
Expression data from human pancreatic islets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A gene co-expression network analysis has been conducted to identify T2D-associated gene modules. Donors 1-48 were used for the initial analysis and donors 49-80 for the replication and were normalized separately in this study

DESIGN
Islets from cadaver donors (57 non-diabetic and 20 diabetic) were provided by the Nordic Islet Transplantation Programme (www.nordicislets.org), Uppsala University. The microarrays were performed using GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST whole transcript according to Affymetrix standard protocol.
