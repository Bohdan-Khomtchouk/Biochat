TITLE
Phytophthora infestans Ago1 binds miRNA and sRNAs from effector genes and transposable elements (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Phytophthora infestans

SUMMARY
The plant pathogen Phytophthora infestans encodes four distinct Ago proteins. To identify the sRNA repertoire associated with each PiAgo protein, Ago-sRNA co-immunoprecipitation and sRNA sequencing were carried out. 20-22 nucleotide (nt) sRNAs were identified as the main interaction partners of PiAgo1 and high enrichment of 24-26 nt sRNAs was seen in the PiAgo4-bound sample. The majority of PiAgo-associated sRNAs derived from transposable elements (TEs). The frequencies and sizes of TE-derived sRNAs in the different PiAgo libraries suggested diversified roles of the PiAgo proteins in control of different TE classes. We further provide evidence for involvement of PiAgo1 in the P. infestans miRNA pathway. Protein-coding genes are likely to be regulated by the shared action of PiAgo1 and PiAgo5, as demonstrated by analysis of differential expression. An abundance of sRNAs from genes encoding host cell death-inducing CRN effectors was bound to PiAgo1, implicating this protein in regulation of the expanded CRN gene family. These findings highlight the different roles played by Ago proteins in an economically important plant pathogenic oomyce
