TITLE
Overexpression of BglJ and LeuO in Escherichia coli K12

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The only target locus of transcription factor BglJ known to date is the bgl operon, and activation of bgl by BglJ requires RcsB. Transcription factor LeuO is involved in stress responses and known as antagonist of H-NS. To identifiy novel targets of BglJ, we overexpressed BglJ in Escherichia coli K12 and measured differential gene expression by performing DNA microarray analysis. Moreover, to analyze whether all targets of BglJ require RcsB, we overexpressed BglJ in an rcsB deletion background. In addition, we overexpressed LeuO to identifiy targets of LeuO.
