TITLE
Microarray analysis to identify differential molecular signatures in subjects with stable coronary artery disease on standard dosage regimens versus healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study, we used a top-down approach using microarray analysis to evaluate the novel molecular signatures that differentiate between subjects with stable coronary artery disease and normal healthy controls and which remain unresponsive to the standard therapies currently in clinical practice . Micro-array analysis revealed that inspite of concerted treatment efforts 513 genes were differentially expressed in our patient group vs healthy controls.

DESIGN
To access the effect of ongoing therapies on stable CAD patients and to obtain gene signatures from these patients. We selected 4 angiographically proven stable CAD patients who were on medications for more than 3 months or more from Group-1 (n=100) and compared the data with 2 normal age and sex-matched healthy Controls (n=50) belonging to the same ethnic origin and socio-economic status. RNA extraction and hybridization was done using Affymetrix microarrays.
