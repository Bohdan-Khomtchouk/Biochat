TITLE
Influence of green light on the transcriptome of Pseudomonas cichorii JBC1

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas cichorii JBC1

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas cichorii JBC1 was cultured in LB media till it reached exponential phase and the bacterial cells were collected and resuspended in minimal media and treated under green light and dark condition for 12 hours at 30Â°C. After treatment, the RNA from each sample was collected and sequenced.

DESIGN
The experiment was conducted with 3 replicates under two different light conditions and the sample from the 3 replicates were pooled together and sequenced

PLATFORM
GPL22374 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Pseudomonas cichorii JBC1)
