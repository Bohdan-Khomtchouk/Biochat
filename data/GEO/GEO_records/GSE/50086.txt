TITLE
The global gene expression pattern by YDR374C deletion

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Ydr374c is the only protein that has the YTH domain in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The YTH domain was identified by comparing all known protein sequences with the YT521-B splicing factor, and it is found only in eukaryotes. Recently, it has been reported that the YTH domain conveys RNA-binding ability to a new class of proteins. However, the roles of most YTH family members lacking common sequence motifs outside the YTH domain are unknown. Therefore, to investigate the function of Ydr374c, microarray analysis was performed using the wild-type and YDR374C deletion strains.

DESIGN
For the microarray analysis, wild-type and YDR374C deletion strains were cultured in SD medium and harvested at the mid-exponential phase (OD600=0.7), and total RNA was extracted.
