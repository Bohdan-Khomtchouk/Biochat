TITLE
Expression data from mutant SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of spinal cord from SOD1(G93A) mice and age matched controls at ages 28, 42, 56, 70,98,112, and 126 days of age. We used microarrays to determine differential gene expression throughout disease progression in the spinal cord of mutant SOD1(G93A) model of ALS.

DESIGN
Samples were collected from male B6SJL SOD1(G93A) and age matched controls. 3 samples were collected representing each genotype and age group for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
