TITLE
Regenerating zebrafish fin fold vs. uncut control

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Teleost fish have the remarkable ability to regenerate their body parts including heart, spinal cord, and the caudal fin, while many higher vertebrates including us humans have only a limited ability. To facilitate molecular and genetic approaches for regeneration, we previously established an assay using the fin fold of early stage larvae, which regenerate their caudal fin folds as in adult regeneration. Here, we performed transcriptional profiling of regenerating larval fin folds and identified genes with differential expression during regeneration. Gene expression profiling of zebrafish larval fin-fold regeneration was performed by comparing amputated fin fold and uncut control. Keywords: Stress response, injury response.
