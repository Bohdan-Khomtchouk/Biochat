TITLE
Salmonella wild type and mutant baeR in LB and tungstate

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 wild type and deleted of the response regulator encoding gene baeR grown to OD600=1 in LB alone or in LB supplemented with 20mM of Sodium Tungstate. The goal is to determine Salmonella response to tungstate and to define the BaeR regulated genes in this conditions.

DESIGN
4 differents conditions tested, the reference on each hybridisation is the chromosomique DNA of the wild type strain. 3 replicates for the wild type on LB, 3 replicates for the baeR on LB, 3 replicates for the wild type on LB+ tungstate and 5 replicates for baeR on LB+tungstate.
