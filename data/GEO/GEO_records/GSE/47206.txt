TITLE
Gene Expression data from 56 lung cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Highlighting the gene expression characteristics of a large panel of lung cancer cell lines. Microarrays were used to explore and detail the global gene expression profile of 56 lung cancer cell lines

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured and recorded on HG-U133A chips in a large panel of lung cancer cell lines under ATCC recommended growth conditions

PLATFORM
GPL3921 [HT_HG-U133A] Affymetrix HT Human Genome U133A Array
