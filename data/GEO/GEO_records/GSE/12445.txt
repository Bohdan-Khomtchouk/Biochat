TITLE
Expression data from melanoma cell lines 224 and BL transfected with siRNA-NRASQ61R

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling for global characterization of gene expression alterations that resulted from treatment of melanoma cells with siRNA specifically targeting NRASQ61R

DESIGN
BL or 224 cells transfected with siRNA against either mutant NRASQ61R (siMut10 and siMut12) or scrambled control (siSC). Untransfected cells (T0) from Day 0 were used as the baseline control for cells transfected with both siMut and siSC
