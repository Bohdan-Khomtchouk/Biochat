TITLE
Neurospora crassa wild-type cells (WT, FGSC 2489) undergoing a time-course treatment with staurosporine

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
Staurosporine induces programmed cell death in a series of organisms. Here, we analyse gene expression of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa following exposure to staurosporine for different time periods.

DESIGN
Cells incubated for 15, 30, 60 and 120 min in the presence (S) or absence (C) of staurosporine were compared; Cy3 and Cy5 dye swap

PLATFORM
GPL13956 Glasslab Neurospora crassa 10k V1
