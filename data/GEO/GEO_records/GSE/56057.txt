TITLE
M. smegmatis response to deletion of Crp1 and overexpression of Crp2

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of M. smegmatis and  Dcrp1 grown in flasks on Hartmans de Bont medium supplemented with 10 mM glycerol. Transcriptional profiling of M.smegmatis HLA102 harboring tetracycline inducible vector pMind containing the Crp2 and M. smegmatis harboring pMind grown in flasks on Hartmans de Bont medium supplemented with 10 mM glycerol

DESIGN
Comparing transcriptional response of wild-type compared with the deletion of crp1 gene (Msmeg_0539). Biological replicates: 4 independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array. Comparing transcriptional response of strain HLA102 to conditional expression of Crp2 (Msmeg_6189) compared with the wild-type with empty vector pMind. Biological replicates: 4 independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL18444 Mycobacterium smegmatis version 4
