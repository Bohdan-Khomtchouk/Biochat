TITLE
Clostridium botulinum whole genome expression profile after heat shock in continous culture

ORGANISM
Clostridium botulinum A str. ATCC 3502

SUMMARY
Clostridium botulinum ATCC 3502 was grown in continuous culture at 39°C, subjected to heat shock at 45°C, and then continuously grown at 45°C. The goal was to determine the impact of stressful temperature to the whole genome expression profile and identify stress adaptation mechanisms.
