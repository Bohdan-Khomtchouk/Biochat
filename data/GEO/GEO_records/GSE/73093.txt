TITLE
Clostridium botulinum whole genome expression profile after heat shock in continous culture

ORGANISM
Clostridium botulinum

SUMMARY
Clostridium botulinum ATCC 3502 was grown in continuous culture at 39°C, subjected to heat shock at 45°C, and then continuously grown at 45°C. The goal was to determine the impact of stressful temperature to the whole genome expression profile and identify stress adaptation mechanisms.

DESIGN
Time series (control,0min,10min,1h,18h,42h, adapt) with two biological replicates and two technical replicates in dye-swaps. Common reference hybridization design.

PLATFORM
GPL11441 Agilent 16K botuarray
