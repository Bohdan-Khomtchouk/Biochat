TITLE
Gene Expression Changes during embryo and seed maturation, quiescence and germination in soybean

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular events underlying seed maturation, quiescence and germination, we performed transcriptome analysis of soybean (Glycine max) embryos at four seed developmental stages (cotyledon, early, mid and late maturation), mature dry seeds, and seedlings, eight days after seed sowing.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling was performed on embryos at 4 stages of development, dry seeds and seedlings.  Three biological replicates were collected for each developmental stage.
