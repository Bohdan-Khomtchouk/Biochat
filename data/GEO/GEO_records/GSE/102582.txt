TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of human erythroblast cells knocking down NCOA4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Knocking down NCOA4 disrupted Thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist,GC-1, mediated terminal human erythroblast differentiation. Therefore, we conducted RNA-seq to profile the transcriptome changes in NCOA4 knocked down human erythroblasts.. Methods: Human CD34+ cells were transduced by lentiviruses encoding shRNAs targeting either LacZ (control) or NCOA4 atï€ day 1 of culture. At day 14, cells were switched to terminal differentiation medium. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we have identified an ensemble of genes whose expression are discrupted by NCOA4 knockdown. Conclusions: There is a significant correlation between the degree of GC-1-mediated gene activation and the degree of NCOA4 knockdown-mediated gene repression.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiles of human erythroblasts transduced with LacZ(control) or NCOA4 shRNA were generated by Illumina HiSeq sequencer in duplicates
