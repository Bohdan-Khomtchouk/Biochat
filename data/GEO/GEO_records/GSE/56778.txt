Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kr√ºppel-like factors (KLFs) are a group of master regulators of gene expression conserved from flies to human.  However, scant information is available on either the mechanisms or functional impact of the coupling of KLF proteins to chromatin remodeling machines, a deterministic step in transcriptional regulation.  In the current study, we use genome-wide analyses of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-on-Chip) and Affymetrix-based expression profiling to gain insight into how the KLF11, a human transcription factor involved in tumor suppression and metabolic diseases, works by coupling to three co-factor groups: the Sin3-histone deacetylase system, WD40-domain containing proteins, and the HP1-histone methyltransferase system. We utilized genome-wide expression analysis of wild type KLF11 and three mutants that disrupt KLF11-chromatin machinery interactions to examine the relationship of the transcription factor and chromatin systems in the regulation of gene networks.

DESIGN
Panc1 epithelial cells were plated at a density of 1x10^6 cells/100mm dish and transduced with empty vector, KLF11, KLF11-A347S, KLF11-486, or KLF11-EAPP adenovirus at an MOI of 150.  RNA was prepared as previously described from pooled biological triplicates.
