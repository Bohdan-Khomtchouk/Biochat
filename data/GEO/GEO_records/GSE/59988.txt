TITLE
The human placenta exhibits dichotomised DNA methylation pattern compared to homogenous somatic tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to compare genome-wide methylation patterns of human placenta with blood neutrophils, a homogenous somatic tissue

DESIGN
Here we generated single-nucleotide resolution DNA methylation maps of human placenta using Reduced Representation Bisulphite Sequencing (RRBS) and compared their methylation pattern with neutrophils.
