TITLE
Gene expression in reprogramming MEF fractions FACS-sorted by Oct4, Klf4 and EpCAM expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
After 8 days of OKSM induction via doxycycline, Nanog-Neo secondary MEFs (Wernig et al. Nature Biotechnology 2008) were FACS sorted by KLF4, Oct4, and EpCAM expression. Four major subsets of MEFs have been sorted and analysed for gene expression.

DESIGN
4 cell types
