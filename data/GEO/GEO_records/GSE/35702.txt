TITLE
Photoinduction of the Vibrio campbellii Type III Secretion System

ORGANISM
Vibrio campbellii ATCC BAA-1116

SUMMARY
Although many members of the genus Vibrio are known to inhabit the marine photic zone, an understanding of the influence of light on the molecular physiology of Vibrio spp. has largely been neglected. To begin to characterize the photophysiology of one such Vibrio sp. (Vibrio campbellii ATCC strain BAA-1116) we used microarray-based expression profiling to compare the transcriptomes of illuminated versus dark cell cultures. Specficially, we compared the transcriptomes of wild type V. campbellii (STR) cells that were cultured in M9 minimal salts medium plus glucose under two conditions: (i) after 24 hours of continuous dark and (ii) after a 12 hour dark:12 hour light cycle (white light illumination at 54 µmol photons s-1 m-2). The results revealed a large photostimulon (differential expression of ~20% of the V. campbellii genome; adjusted p value < 0.0001) that surprisingly included ~75% of the type III secretion system (T3SS) genes which were found to be 1.6 – 5.4X more abundant in illuminated cultures. These findings, which were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and quantitative membrane proteomics, strongly suggest that the photostimulon of strain BAA-1116 includes the T3SS.

DESIGN
Five biological replicates of V. campbellii BAA-1116 (STR) were grown to log phase (200 rpm, 30°C, 25 mL M9 minimal salts medium plus glucose in 125 mL baffled Erlenmeyer flasks) under continuous dark for 24 hours or under a 12 hour dark:12 hour light cycle (white light illumination at 54 µmol photons s-1 m-2) and total RNA was extracted from 1.0E+9 cells. Messenger RNA was isolated from the total RNA extracts treated with DNase, labeled with biotin, fragmented and hybridized to V. campbellii BAA-1116 whole genome microarrays (520694F, Affymetrix).
