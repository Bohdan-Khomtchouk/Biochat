TITLE
Genome-wide maps of DNA cytosine methylation state in during normal differentiation commitment in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and in Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein1 (Satb1) - deficient HSC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our data show Satb1 deficiency leads to alterations in DNA cytosine methylation and a commitment-primed epigenetic state in HSCs.

DESIGN
Examination of DNA cytosine methylation in wild type HSC and differentiation-committed progenitors as well as in wild type HSC and HSC lacking Satb1 (n=2 each).

PLATFORM
