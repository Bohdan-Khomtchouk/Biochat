TITLE
Three human cell types respond to multi-walled carbon nanotubes and titanium dioxide nanobelts with cell-specific transcriptomic and proteomic expression [Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify key biological pathways that define toxicity or biocompatibility after nanoparticle exposure, three human cell types were exposed in vitro to two high aspect ratio nanoparticles for 1 hr or 24 hr and collected for global transcriptomics. Transcriptional responses were measured by global microarray analysis of cells in culture.

DESIGN
Groups (N=3 biological replicates) of Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells exposed to 0, 10 or 100 ug/ml MWCNT or TiO2-NB nanoparticles for 1 or 24 hr.
