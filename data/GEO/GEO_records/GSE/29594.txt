TITLE
The effect of Crem absence on gene expression in mouse liver.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CREM (cAMP responsive element modulator) together with CREB and ATF-1 belong to the CREB family of transcriptional factors, that respond to cyclic AMP signaling and bind to cAMP responsive element (CRE) sites in promoters of selected genes. CREM can produce isoforms that have either activating or repressing functions, depending on the transcription of specific exons. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from wild-type (WT) and Crem knock-out (KO) mouse liver. Several comparisons were made. KO < WT at 0h, KO < WT at 12 h, 0h < 12h in WT and 0h < 12h in KO.

DESIGN
4 condition experiment: 2 strains (WT, Crem-/-), 2 time points (0h and 12h). 5 biological replications per condition.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
