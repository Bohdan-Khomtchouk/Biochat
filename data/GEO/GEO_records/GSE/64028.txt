TITLE
Expression data from healthy human PB B cell subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human PB B cell subsets are functionally distinct and may derive from different developmental pathways, reflected by their differential gene expression profiles. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying germinal center transition and functional propensities of individual subsets according to surface receptor and cell adhesion molecule expression.

DESIGN
Human PB B cell subsets were sort-purified, RNA was extracted and processed. Data were vsn-normalized, corrected for batch-effects (ComBat) and analysed with GeneSpring GX7.
