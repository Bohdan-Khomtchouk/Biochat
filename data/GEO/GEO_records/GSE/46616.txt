TITLE
Expression data from OsEBS-transgenic rice B10201 and B10301 and control Guichao2

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In rice (Oryza sativa L.), the number of panicles, spikelets per panicle and grain weight are important components of grain yield. These characteristics are controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and are derived from variation inherent in crops.The identification of different yield related QTLs facilitates an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cereal crop yield, and may have utility in improving grain yield in cereal crops.  an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cereal crop yield, and may have utility  in improving grain yield in cereal crops. In the present study, We cloned and characterized a large-panicle QTL, and confirmed that the newly identified gene OsEBS (enhancing biomass and spikelet number) increased plant height, leaf size and spikelet number per panicle, leading to an average of 37.62% increase in total grain yield per plant. trait loci (QTLs) and are derived from variation inherent in crops.
