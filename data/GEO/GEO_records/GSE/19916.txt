TITLE
MicroRNAs mediate rapamycin resistance in a myogenic tumor cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of cell proliferation. Inhibitors of mTOR are being evaluated as anti-tumor agents. Given the emerging role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumorgenesis we hypothesized that miRNAs could play important roles in the response of tumors to mTOR inhibitors. Rapamycin resistant myogenic cells developed by long-term rapamycin treatment showed extensive reprogramming of miRNAs expression, characterized by up-regulation of the mir-17~92 and related clusters and down-regulation of tumor-suppressor miRNAs. Antagonists of oncogenic miRNA families and mimics of tumor suppressor miRNAs (let-7) restored rapamycin sensitivity in resistant tumor cells. This study identified miRNAs as new downstream components of the mTOR-signaling pathway, which may determine the response of tumors to mTOR inhibitors.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from rapamycin sensitive (RS) cells (BC3H1, mouse brain tumor cell line with myogenic properties, ATCC)  cultured in Dulbecco’s modified essential medium (DMEM) media supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). Rapamycin resistant cells (RR1) were developed by culturing BC3H1 cells in the presence of 1 uM rapamycin for 6 months. Three samples in quadruplicate 1)RS cells treated with DMSO for 24 h(BC3H1, reference), 2) RS cells treated for 24 h with 100 nM rapamycin (BC3H1+R), 3) RR1 cells consantly treated with 1uM Rapamycion (RR1+R). For each experiment, 1 μM of total RNA was labeled with Hy3TM dye and a reference RNA pool (consisting of a mixture of equal amounts of total RNA from BC3H1, BC3H1+R and RR1+R cells) was labeled with Hy5TM dye using the miRCURYTM Labeling Kit. The samples were hybridized to Exiqon miRCURYTM LNA Arrays (V10.0).
