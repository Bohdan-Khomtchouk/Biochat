TITLE
RNA-seq of Tumor Initiating Cells (TICs) from Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LSCC) lines reveals PRKCI dependent Hedgehog (HH) Signalling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis was performed on TICs and the parental counterparts of 4 LSCC cell lines. In addition, PRKCI knock down (KD) variants of these cells were sequenced. Subsequent analysis revealed that activation of HH signaling, a known driver of the TIC phenotype, is dependent on PRKCI expression.

DESIGN
Examination of TICS, parental cells, parental PRKCI KD cells, and TIC PRKCI KD cells

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
