TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Escherichia coli under deoxynivalenol and nivalenol conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We constructed E. coli transcriptome under deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV) condition from Fusarium spp. To identify differentially expressed genes in mycotoxin condition, we compared mycotoxin (DON and NIV) transcriptome to acetonitrile (ACN) transcriptome as the solvent of myxotoxin. As a result, 435-929 transcripts were identified from all conditions, respectively.

DESIGN
Two deoxynivalenol (0.2 ppm and 2 ppm), two nivalenol (0.2 ppm and 2 ppm) and one acetonitrile (control) RNA-seq data in E. coli

PLATFORM
GPL14548 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Escherichia coli)
