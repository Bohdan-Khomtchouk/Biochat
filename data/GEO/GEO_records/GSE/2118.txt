SUMMARY
The DNA damage response network modulates a wide array of signaling pathways, including DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, apoptotic pathways and numerous stress signals. The ATM protein kinase, functionally missing in patients with the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), is a master regulator of this network when the inducing DNA lesions are double strand breaks. The ATM gene is also frequently mutated in sporadic cancers of lymphoid origin. Here, we applied a functional genomics approach that combines gene expression profiling and computational promoter analysis to obtain global dissection of the transcriptional response to ionizing radiation (IR) in murine lymphoid tissue. Cluster analysis revealed six major expression patterns in the data. Prominent among them was a gene cluster that contained dozens of genes whose response to irradiation was Atm-dependent. Computational analysis identified significant enrichment of the binding site signatures of the transcription factors NF-kB and p53 among promoters of these genes, pointing to the major role of these two transcription factors in mediating the Atm-dependent transcriptional response in the irradiated lymphoid tissue. Examination of the response showed that pro- and anti-apoptotic signals were simultaneously induced, with the pro-apoptotic pathway mediated by p53, and the pro-survival pathway by NF-kB. These findings further elucidate the molecular network induced by IR and have implications for cancer management as they suggest that a combined treatment that restores the p53-mediated apoptotic arm while blocking the NF-kB-mediated pro-survival arm could be most successful in increasing the radiosensitivity of lymphoid tumors.
