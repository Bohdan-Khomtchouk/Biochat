TITLE
Sex biased gene expression in 17 weeks old chicken (ovary, testes)

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Sex chromosomes are characterized by a non-random content of genes with preferential expression in one sex. The mechanisms which are responsible for this phenomenon are, however, largely unresolved. To elucidate selective forces shaping the Z chromosome gene content in chicken, we analyzed microarray data from adult and embryonic gonads (the latter already available in GEO Series GSE8693).

DESIGN
Total RNA from gonads of 8 males and 8 females was used for hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Chicken Genome Arrays. Prior to hybridization the samples were combined in equal quantities into 4 pools (4 testes/ovary samples in each pool), 2 of them representing testis and 2 ovary. All four GeneChips met Affymetrix quality control criteria. Furthermore, all chips were checked by methods based on probe level robust linear model fitting provided by " affyPLM " package (Bolstad, 2007). None of the chips showed any signs of abnormality.
