TITLE
Expression data from STAG2 deficient and proficient human cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have discovered frequent genetic inactivation of the STAG2 gene in diverse human cancers including glioblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and melanoma.  STAG2 encodes a subunit of the sister chromatid cohesion complex called the " cohesin complex " that is responsible for the cohesion of sister chromatids following DNA replication and is cleaved at the metaphase to anaphase transition to enable chromosome segregation into daughter cells.  Interestingly, the cohesin complex has also been implicated as a regulator of chromatin architecture and transcription.  To determine the functional significance of STAG2 inactivation in cancer pathogenesis, we used somatic cell gene targeting to correct the endogenous mutations of STAG2 in two aneuploid human glioblastoma cell lines, H4 and 42MGBA.  Similarly, somatic cell gene targeting was also used to introduce a nonsense mutation into codon 6 of the endogenous wild-type allele of STAG2 in HCT116 cells, a near-diploid human colorectal cancer cell line with stable karyotype.  Expression profiling of these three paired sets of STAG2-proficient and deficient cells demonstrated that STAG2 does not play a global role in transcriptional regulation nor does it recurrently modulate the expression of specific tumor-promoting or suppressing genes. For further details, see Solomon et al., Mutational inactivation of STAG2 causes aneuploidy in human cancer.

DESIGN
RNA was prepared from subconfluent asynchronously proliferating cells using TRIZOL and purified by RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen).  Hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays was used to generate gene expression profiles of STAG2-deficient and proficient H4, 42MGBA, and HCT116 cells.
