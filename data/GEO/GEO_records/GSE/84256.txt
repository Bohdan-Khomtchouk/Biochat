TITLE
Fat cells regenerate from myofibroblasts during wound healing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report transcriptomes of myofibroblasts from mouse skin wounds. Myofibroblasts were FACS sorted as Zombie-neg;tdTomato-hi cells from Sm22-Cre;TdTomato mice. We identified and analyzed 4,120 differentially expressed transcripts across four post-wounding time points, day 12, day 15, day 21 and day 26.

DESIGN
Examination of FACS sorted wound myofibroblasts from four consecutive post-wounding time points

PLATFORM
