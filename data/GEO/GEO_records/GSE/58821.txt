TITLE
High-Affinity Sites Form an Interaction Network to Facilitate Spreading of the MSL Complex across the X Chromosome in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Hi-C analysis of two Drosophila male cell lines, combined with 4C-seq of frequent long-range contacts between HAS.

DESIGN
We carried out Hi-C experiments in the male Drosophila melanogaster cell lines S2 and clone8, both in biological duplicates. Analyses were complemented by 4C-seq and S2 and female Kc cells and with DNA FISH.
