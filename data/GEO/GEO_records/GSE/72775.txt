TITLE
DNA methylation profiles of human blood samples from Hispanics and Caucasians

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to profile n=335 whole blood samples. The main goal of the study was to measure the epigenetic age (also known as DNA methylation age) of Hispanics and Caucasians from the USA. To measure DNA methylation age, we used the epigenetic clock software described in Horvath S (n=2013) DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types. Genome Biology.2013, 14:R115. DOI: 10.1186/10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115 PMID: 24138928.

DESIGN
We analyzed whole blood samples from 289 Caucasians and 46 Hispanics.
