TITLE
Identification of genes whose expressions are affected by hedgehog RNAi in spider embryos

ORGANISM
Parasteatoda tepidariorum

SUMMARY
In the spider Achaearanea tepidariorum, Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a key role in the formation of the two major embryonic axes. Analyses of expression patterns of the spider hh homolog, At-hh, suggested that Hh signaling might be involved in the subsequent segmentation process also. In this microarray experiment, we attempted to identify candidate genes whose expressions are regulated by Hh signaling during early phases of spider segmentation.

DESIGN
The objective of this experiment was a screen for genes whose expressions might be affected by parental RNA interference (pRNAi) against At-hh in spider embryos. Oligonucleotide probes were designed based on accumulated A. tepidariorum EST sequences and embedded in custom microarrays (12K x2). Total RNA was extracted from late stage 5 embryos derived from a mated female before and after injection of dsRNA targeted for At-hh. Gene expression levels were compared between the untreated (normal) and the At-hh pRNAi-treated samples. Probes for At-hh and a homolog of Drosophila orthodenticle, At-otd, served as positive controls to validate this experiment.
