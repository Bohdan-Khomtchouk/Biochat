TITLE
Recurrent breakpoint genes in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study our aim was to document recurrent DNA copy number aberration associated breakpoints in primary tumors of colorectal cancer patients that ultimately received systemic treatment in the context of metastatic disease. Such data can be used to catalogue copy number aberration associated breakpoints and thereby affected genes. To this end, high quality arrayCGH data set of clinically well annotated colorectal cancer specimens was generated using FFPE tumor samples from patients from two phase III clinical trials, namely CAIRO and CAIRO2.

DESIGN
arrayCGH data of colorectal cancers of patients from 2 clinical trials. 108 patients were treated with capecitabine first line, 110 patients were treated with capecitabine and irinotecan first line and 134 patients were treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab.
