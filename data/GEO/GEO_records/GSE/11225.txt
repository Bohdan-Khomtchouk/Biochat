TITLE
Array-comparative genomic hybridization by using DualChipÂ® human cancer 1.1 arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumors often harbor several genetic aberrations at both RNA and DNA level. Integration of expression data with copy number changes represents a powerful strategy to investigate genes involved in tumorigenesis. Here we describe a fluorescent array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization protocol to be used on a commercial microarray platform optimized to detect cancer-related gene expression. This method will be valuable to use a single low-density array platform monitoring gene expression and copy number assessment in parallel. Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization, neuroblastoma
