TITLE
Role of P. gingivalis SerB in Gingival Epithelial Cell Cytoskeletal Remodeling and Cytokine Productions.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of oral keratinocytes was utilized to define the biological role of P. gingivalis SerB. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying infection with an isogenic mutant in SerB, and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: infection state
