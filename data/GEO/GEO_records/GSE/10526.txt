TITLE
Role of P. gingivalis SerB in Gingival Epithelial Cell Cytoskeletal Remodeling and Cytokine Productions.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of oral keratinocytes was utilized to define the biological role of P. gingivalis SerB. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying infection with an isogenic mutant in SerB, and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: infection state

DESIGN
Gingival epithelial HIGK cells were infected with either the oral pathogen P. gingivalis (Pg) or an isogenic mutant for SerB in the same parental strain in order to gain a better understanding on the role of SerB. These samples were hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. SerB was found to be a multifunctional invasin and modulin of P. gingivalis and associated with broadly based regulation of the epithelial cell transcriptome.
