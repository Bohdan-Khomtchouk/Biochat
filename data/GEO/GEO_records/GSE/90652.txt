TITLE
The transcriptome comparison between wildtype Hb9-GFP and Satb1-/-Hb9-GFP retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to define genes differentially expressed between P6 Hb9-GFP and Satb1-/-Hb9-GFP cells, which were dissociated and FACS sorted from mice retinae.

DESIGN
Mice retinae from P6 Hb9-GFP and Satb1-/-Hb9-GFP were dissected, GFP labeled RGCs were purified by flow cytometry. Five biological replicates, origniating from different litters, were collected for each genotype. RNA was extracted from ~1000 sorted cells and cDNA was synthesized and amplified using Nugen Ovation RNAseq kit. Libraries were prepared using Nugen Ultralow System V2 kit.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
