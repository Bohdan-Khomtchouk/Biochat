TITLE
The miRNA miR-139-5p is a regulator of metastatic pathways in breast cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome Identification of  direct targets of miR-139-5p using biotinylated pull-downs found that this miRNA has roles in breast cancer invasion and migration.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were transfected with biotinylated miR-139-5p. The miRNAs and target mRNA were pulled down with streptavidin and compared to the input control.
