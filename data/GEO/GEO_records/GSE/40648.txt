TITLE
Effect of simulated microgravity on E. coli K12 MG1655 growth and gene expression

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
This study demonstrates simulated microgravity effects on E. coli K 12 MG1655 when grown on LB medium supplemented with glycerol. The results imply that E. coli readily reprograms itself to combat the multiple stresses imposed due to microgravity. Under these conditions it survives by upregulating oxidative stress protecting genes and simultaneously down regulating the membrane transporters and synthases to maintain cell homeostasis.

DESIGN
In this study, a clinostat that mimics microgravity conditions was used to investigate the effects of microgravity on E. coli grown in LB medium supplemented with glycerol to monitor the effects on growth and global gene expression using Affymetrix DNA microarrays.
