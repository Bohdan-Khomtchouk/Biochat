TITLE
Comparative genomic, transcriptomic and secretomic profilings of Penicillium oxalicum HP7-1 and its cellulase and xylanase hyper-producing mutant EU2106, and identification of two novel regulators for cellulase and xylanase gene expression

ORGANISM
Penicillium oxalicum

SUMMARY
In this study,comparative genomic, transcriptomic and secretomic profilings of Penicillium oxalicum HP7-1 and its cellulase and xylanase hyper-producing mutant EU2106 were employed to screen for novel regulators for cellulase and xylanase gene expression.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of P. oxalicum wild-type strain HP7-1 and its mutant EU2106 were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000

PLATFORM
GPL20250 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Penicillium oxalicum)
