TITLE
SRiD- A facile DNA barcode generation and management system for high throughput screening

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
20 random DNA barcodes were designed in silico and transfected into PC3 cells. Barcodes were sequenced using Illumina-Miseq technology to find the sequence and their respective copy numbers. Current file contains the raw data of these DNA barcodes in fastq format

DESIGN
Validating an algorithm called SRiD that generates random DNA barcodes that do not match a genome of interest, in this case human genome. 20 DNA barcodes were used for this validation.

PLATFORM
GPL17769 Illumina MiSeq (synthetic construct)
