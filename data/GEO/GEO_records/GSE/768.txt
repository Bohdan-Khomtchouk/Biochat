TITLE
Neural stem and neuroblastoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Both in situ synthesized long oligo arrays from Agilent Technologies and short oligo arrays from Affymetrix were used to meausre differential gene expression in RNA samples generated from (1) human neural stem cells treated with vehicle (EtOH, 0.01%) and tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ, 20µM) for 24h, and (2) neuroblastoma cells treated with vehicle (EtOH, 0.01%) and tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ, 10µM) for 24h. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
