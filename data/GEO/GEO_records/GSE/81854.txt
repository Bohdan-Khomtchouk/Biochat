TITLE
Grape seed extracts-mediated lipid mobility in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) reduce triglycerides in the nematode C. elegans. Lipase was strongly inhibited in vitro accompanied by the reduction of total triglyceride storage capacity in vivo; Lipophilic staining was also attenuated in wild type worms and high-fat mutants exposed to OPCs. Apart from biochemical analyses, lipid metabolism was also genetically regulated, emphasizing the necessity to study underlying regulation mechanisms in intact animals. To gain a deeper insight into the potential gene targets of purified oligomeric proanthocyanidin trimer gallate (pOPC7), a binary microarray assay was carried out with wild type N2 populations continuously exposed to a bacterial diet with or without pOPC7.

DESIGN
The global transcriptome was compared in wild type N2 raised in the presence or absence of oligomeric proanthocyanidin trimer gallate (pOPC7) extracted from Vitis vinifera grape seeds at the concentration of 2 Âµg/mL for 48 hours (L1 to L4 stage).
