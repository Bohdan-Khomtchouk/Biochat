TITLE
Transcriptome outcome of oligodendrocyte precursor cells following VCAM1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome outcome of rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which were knocked down with short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) for vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1)

DESIGN
Toray 3D-Gene microarray technique was used for transcriptome analysis of VCAM1- or control luciferase shRNA-knocked down, rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells
