TITLE
Dicer knockout mouse subcutaneous preadipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dicer is required for miRNA processing and RNA interference. Here we knocked out Dicer in SV40 T antigen immortalized subcutaneous preadipocytes isolated from Dicer flox mice by transducing these cells with adenoviruses harboring Cre recombinase. Control cells were transduced with adenovirus harboring GFP. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression profile of Dicer knockout preadipocytes.

DESIGN
Four days after adenovirus infection, cells were harvested for RNA isolation and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. At this point, Dicer knockout was confirmed by several methods.
