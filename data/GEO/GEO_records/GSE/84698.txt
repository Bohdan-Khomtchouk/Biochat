TITLE
Next generation sequencing of antibody heavy chain genes that bind to the hapten NP in sorted memory cells and long-lived plasma cells isolated from mice immunized orally with NP-CT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that there are differences in V gene usage in memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells after oral immunization. The hapten NP was conjugated to cholera toxin (CT) to create NP-CT, an antigen that is highly immunogenic after oral immunization. The NP hapten induces immune responses dominated by the 1-72 (VH186.2) heavy chain V region. The relationship between NP binding IgA antibody genes from memory B cells from spleen, MLN and PeyerÂ´s patches and long-lived plasma cells from lamina propria and bone marrow that persisted 6-12 months after an oral immunization in three C57BL/6 mice with NP-CT was investigated. Extensive clonal overlap im clones was observed between long-lived memory cells from lamina propria and bone marrow, but very limited overlap was found between memory cells and plasma cells. The data suggest that memory and plasma cells formed through temporarily or anatomically separate processes.

DESIGN
RNA was prepared from memory cells and long-lived plasma cells from C57BL/6 mice that had been orally immunized with NP-CT 6-12 months before analysis
