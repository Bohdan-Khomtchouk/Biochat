TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of hair follicle stem cells in the presence and absence of Regulatory T-cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study were to identify Pathways that Tregs utilize in the skin to maintain tissue homesostasis in the context of hair follcile cycling. Methods: Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), in the presence and absence of Tregs, were induced into cycle through a model of depilation induced anagen. HFSCs were then purified by cell sorting at day 4 post depilation based on cell surface marker expression (CD45 negative, MHC Class II negative, Sca-1 negative, EpCAM negative, CD34 Positive, Integrin alpha6 High) to generate mRNA transcription profiles. Results: Transcriptional profiling revealed a significant reduction in proliferation/differentiation associated genes expressed in HFSCs isolated from Treg depleted mice Conclusion: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of Treg modulation of tissue stem cell behaviour

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of HFSC isolated from 7-10 week old WT and Foxp3-DTR mice at 4 days post depilation of dorsal skin.

PLATFORM
