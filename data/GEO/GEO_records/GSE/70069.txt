TITLE
Canonical Wnt signalling regulates nuclear export of Setdb1 during skeletal muscle terminal differentiation [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The histone 3 lysine 9 methyltransferase Setdb1 is essential for both stem cell pluripotency and terminal differentiation of different cell types. To shed light on Setdb1 roles in these mutually exclusive processes, we used mouse skeletal myoblasts as a model of terminal differentiation. Ex vivo studies on isolated single myofibres showed that Setdb1 is required for muscle adult stem cells expansion following activation. In vitro studies in skeletal myoblasts confirmed that Setdb1 suppresses terminal myoblast differentiation. Genomic binding  analyses showed a release of Setdb1 from the promoter of selected target genes upon myoblast terminal differentiation, concomitant to a nuclear export of Setdb1 to the cytoplasm. Both genomic release and cytoplasmic Setdb1 relocalisation during differentiation were dependent on canonical Wnt signalling. Together, our findings revealed Wnt-dependent subcellular relocalisation of Setdb1 as a novel mechanism regulating Setdb1 functions and adult myogenesis.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of knockdown of Setdb1 in myoblast cells (C2C12).
