TITLE
Inhibition of ERG Activity in Patient Derived Prostate Cancer Xenografts using the Small Molecule Inhibitor YK-4-279

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ERG activity was blocked using YK-4-279 in three subcutaneously implanted ERG+ (LuCaP 23.1, 86.2, and 35) and one ERG- (LuCaP 96) PDX.  Tumor volume (TV), body weight (BW), serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), and overall survival (OS) were compared to vehicle treated controls.  Changes in gene expression were assessed by RNASeq and tissue microarrays were constructed to assess necrosis, proliferation, apoptosis, microvessel density, and ERG expression.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing of tumors from from 16 animals (2 control, 2 treated from each of four patient derived xenograft lines) using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
