TITLE
Small RNA profiles from human genic regions suggest biogenic mechanisms and identify new Argonaute-associated species

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Efforts to catalogue eukaryotic transcripts have uncovered a set of species derived from the termini and exon/intron boundaries of protein-coding loci. The biogenesis pathways of these small RNAs (sRNAs) are largely unknown, but a mechanism depending on backtracking of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) has been suggested. Moreover, the functional relevance, if any, of these sRNAs remains elusive. By sequencing 12-100nt transcripts from cells depleted of major RNA degradation enzymes as well as RNAs associated with the effector-proteins Argonaute (AGO) 1/2, we provide mechanistic models for sRNA production and utilization. We suggest that neither splice site associated (SSa)- nor transcription start site associated (TSSa)-RNAs arise from RNAPII backtracking. Instead SSa-RNAs are largely degradation products of mRNA splicing intermediates, while TSSa-RNAs likely derive from nascent RNA protected by stalled RNAPII against nucleolysis. We also reveal new AGO1/2-associated RNAs, including such derived from 3'ends of introns (5'tailed miRtrons) and from mRNA 3'UTRs. Interestingly, both appear to draw from non-canonical microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathways.
