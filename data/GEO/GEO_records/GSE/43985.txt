TITLE
The Estrogen receptor alpha regulated NEAT1 long non-coding RNA promotes prostate cancer progression [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate glands predominantly exhibit androgen dependence, but increasing evidence suggests that estrogen receptor signaling is involved in its development and pathogenesis. By integrating ChIP sequencing for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) with transcriptome sequencing data from prostate cancer samples, we found ERα to significantly influence the noncoding transcriptome in prostate cancer. We identified one such long noncoding  RNA, NEAT1, to play an important role in prostate cancer progression through direct regulation of transcription of its target genes. NEAT1, in an ERα dependent manner, promotes prostate tumorigenesis by interacting with and modulating chromatin state at promoters of prostate cancer specific signature genes. NEAT1 expression is positively correlated with PSMA in prostate adenocarcinoma and with B3GAT1 in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. This study identifies NEAT1 as a novel biomarker or therapeutic target in prostate cancer and also suggests that co-targeting ERα and androgen receptor (AR) may be effective for a subset of patients with advanced prostate cancer and with NEAT1 overexpression.
