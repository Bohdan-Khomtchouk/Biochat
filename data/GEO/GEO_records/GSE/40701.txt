TITLE
Gene expression changes following knockdown of Kdm2b on mESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to study the effects of Kdm2b binding at CpG islands, Kdm2b was knocked down in mouse embryonic stem cells using shRNA and gene expression profiled using Affymetrix arrays Depletion of KDM2B affects the gene expression of a subset of polycomb targets

DESIGN
RNA from 4 samples stably expressing shKdm2b and 4 samples stably expressing a control shRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
