TITLE
HCT116 cells isogenic for p53 expression upon treatment with actinomycin D and nutlin-3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HCT116 wild type cells express p53. The isogenic HCT116 p53KO cells have the p53 gene knocked out. Cells were treated for 16 hours. Dosages for actinomycin D treatment was 1 nM, 10 nM, and 100 nM. Dosage for nutlin-3 was 4 uM. Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
Measuring the gene expression profile of the isogenic cell lines when the cells were treated with 2 different drugs at different concentrations
