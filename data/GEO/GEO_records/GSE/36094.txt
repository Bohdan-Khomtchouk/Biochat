SUMMARY
Comparison of the gene expression profiles of a recombinant protein producing Hek 293 cell line (referred to as producer) and its non-producing parental cell line Hek293F (referred to as non-producer). The parental cell line was obtained from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA. The producer was transfected with a heavy chain variable region fused to the Fc region of a human IgG (dAb-Fc). The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the process of recombinant protein production in Hek293 cells and to identify targets for the engineering of an improved host cell line.

DESIGN
Duplicate samples for RNA extraction were taken at four time points (approximately 30, 43, 51 and 67 hours after inoculation of the bioreactor) during the exponential phase of batch bioreactor cultures. Only one of these technical duplicates was analysed. Three bioreactor cultures were performed for each cell line representing three biological replicates resulting in 12 (3 x 4)  samples per cell line.
