TITLE
Gene expression analysis of cMyc-deficient CD8 T cells retrovirally overexpressing cMyc or AP4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine functional overlap between cMyc and AP4 in CD8+ T cell priming, we retrovirally expressed cMyc or AP4 in cMyc-deficient CD8+ T cells and examined gene expression after activation.

DESIGN
Naive CD8+ T cells from Myc conditional knockout mice with a tamoxifen inducible Cre transgene were retrovirally transduced with Myc or AP4 followed by a treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen in the presence of IL-7 for 2 days. RNA was harvested 48 hours after restimulation of transduced cells with anti-CD3 antibody and gene expression was compared by microarray. CD8+ T cells from littermate wildtype mice that were transduced with an empty retrovirus were used as control.
