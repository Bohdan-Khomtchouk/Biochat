TITLE
Effect of obacunone on Salmonella Typhimurium transcriptome

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2

SUMMARY
Obacunone is a limonoids present in Citrus species. We previously reported that obacunone was inhibitory to the cell-cell signaling in Vibrio harveyi and Escherichia coli O157:H7. In the present work we evaluated the effect of obacunone on the food borne pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 using cDNA microarray. The results demonstrate that obacunone exerts an antivirulence effect on S. Typhimurium LT2 by repressing SPI1 and SPI2. Furthermore, the effect of obacunone seems to be dependent upon EnvZ.

DESIGN
One condition experiment, obacunone treated versus DMSO treated. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 treatment, hybridized in dye-swapped design

PLATFORM
GPL15437 JCVI/PFGRC Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 genome microarray version 4
