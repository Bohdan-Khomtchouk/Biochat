TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in MyD88-Knockdown-Hydra vulgaris (AEP)

ORGANISM
Hydra vulgaris

SUMMARY
Analysis of MyD88 as a putative mediator in host-microbe-interactions

DESIGN
MyD88-Hairpin was micro-injected in Hydra AEP embryos. The resulting Hatchling D3 showed a patchy distribution of the transgene observed by GFP. By asexual reproduction via budding and constant selection for the marker gene GFP the transgene could be driven into different cell ines. Therefore two different cultures were established. Polyps that showed no GFP-Signal anymore (control) and Polyps with both, endodermal and ectodermal transgenic cell-lines (knockdown).
