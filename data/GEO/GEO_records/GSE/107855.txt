TITLE
Global gene expression profile of reprogrammed osteosarcoma cell lines, iG-292 and iSaos-2.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To establish a genomewide gene expression profile of OS-derived induced pluripotent stem cell lines (OS-iPSC): iG-292 and iSaos-2, against the parental cell lines, G-292 and Saos-2. OS cell lines were first reprogrammed into pluripotent state by retroviral transduction of OSKM. Six OS-iPSC clones and four parental OS cell lines were subjected to mRNA microarray analysis (Affymetrix Human PrimeView Chip).

DESIGN
Six OS-iPSC clones were relatively compared with four parental OS cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
