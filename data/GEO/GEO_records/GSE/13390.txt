TITLE
lar-Transcriptomic analysis of the localized acquired resistance (LAR) phenomenon in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
tri38-lar - lar - Analyse the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana plants developing localized acquired resistance (LAR) and a hypersensitive response (HR). The goal is to identify genes inducing LAR and/or HR. Plants were treated either with PstDC3000 (avrRpm1)or MgCl2 (control plants). The samples were studied at 3 points of the infection kinetics of the LAR phenomenon: 6h, 24h and 48h. Keywords: normal vs disease comparison

DESIGN
3 dye-swaps - CATMA arrays 12 biological repetitions were pooled for this experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
