TITLE
Identification of microRNA targets in Arabidopsis by transcriptome profiling of wild-type and ago1-36 mutant plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to establish the global gene expression profiles of Arabidopsis wild type and ago1-36 mutant plants, and identify novel potential miRNA targets.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed using Arabidopsis wild type and ago1-36 mutant seedlings.
