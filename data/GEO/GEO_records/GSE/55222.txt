TITLE
Targets of ALTERED PHLOEM DEVELOPMENT (APL)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We profiled transcripts from sorted phloem cells of wild-type and apl mutants to identify the genes regulated by APL in phloem. We profiled transcripts from sorted phloem cells of wild-type and apl mutants to identify the genes regulated by APL in phloem.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates for control WT and apl mutants were used in thes study. Root tissue was protoplasted and sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Total RNA was extracted from GFP+ protoplasts.
