TITLE
DNA methylation data from non-immortalized lymphocyte samples from participants of the AGES Reykjavik Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation was studied to identify regions with extreme inter-individual variability, half of which show stability within-person, and some of which show covariation with body mass index consistently and are located in or near genes previously implicated in regulating body weight or diabetes.

DESIGN
We isolated genomic DNA from non-immortalized lymphocyte samples from participants of the AGES Reykjavik Study and hybridized it to custom-designed NimbleGen microarrays (CHARM arrays).

PLATFORM
