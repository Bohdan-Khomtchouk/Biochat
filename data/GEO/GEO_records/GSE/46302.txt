TITLE
In Vivo RNA Interference Screening Identifies a Leukemia-Specific Dependence on Integrin Beta 3 Signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used an in vivo short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening approach to identify genes that are essential for MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found that Integrin Beta 3 (Itgb3) is essential for murine leukemia cells in vivo, and for human leukemia cells in xenotransplantation studies.  In leukemia cells, Itgb3 knockdown impaired homing, downregulated LSC transcriptional programs, and induced differentiation via the intracellular kinase, Syk.  In contrast, loss of Itgb3 in normal HSPCs did not affect engraftment, reconstitution, or differentiation.  Finally, we confirmed that Itgb3 is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis and required for leukemogenesis using an Itgb3 knockout mouse model.  Our results establish the significance of the Itgb3 signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target in AML. R940406 (R406, the active metabolite of fostamatinib) was supplied by Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE, USA. R406 was resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at −80°C. .   HL-60, U937 and KG-1 cell  lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. MOLM-14 cell lines were provided by Dr. Scott Amstrong (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston MA, USA.)  All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

DESIGN
MOLM-14, U937, HL-60  and KG-1 cells were grown in 4mM R406 for 24 hours
