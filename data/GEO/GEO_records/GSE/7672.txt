TITLE
Maize endosperm vp1 mutant response to water deficit

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
The goal of this work was to identify transcripts in maize endosperm that are regulated by water stress and the transcription factor Vp1 Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Plants were grown from F1 hybrid seed produced from inbreds W22 and ACR5855, where both inbred parents contributed mutant vp1-R alleles.  Florets were fertilized with pollen from either homozygous vp1 pollen, thus creating vp1/vp1/vp1 mutant endosperms, or Vp1 pollen, thus creating Vp1/vp1/vp1 endosperms.  Water stress treatment was imposed by withholding irrigation at 5 days after pollination; endosperms were sampled at 10 d after pollination.  The study had 2 X 2 factorial design with two genotypes and two watering treatments; there were 6 biological replicates.
