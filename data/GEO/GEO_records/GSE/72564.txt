TITLE
miRNA expression in RA and OA human fibroblast-like synoviocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Homo sapiens microRNAs (miRNAs) are invovolved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes and have been linked to many conditions in humans, including rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we used high throughput expression analysis to assess the overall miRNA expression level in FLS isolated from RA patients in comparison with miRNA expressed in FLS from osteoarthritic (OA) patients.

DESIGN
FLS isolated from synovial biopsies from 4 RA and 4 OA patients were cultivated for 4 passages. Cells were lysed and RNA purified (Trizol). Then miRNA expression was performed using the Qiagen  Human miRNome miScript miRNA PCR Array (V16.0, 384-well) profiling the expression of the 1066 most abundantly expressed and best characterized miRNA sequences in the human miRNA genome (miRNome) as annotated in miRBase Release 16 (www.mirbase.org).
