TITLE
Expression data from RH30 vector and RH30 IκBα SR cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Classical NF-κB activity can be inhibited by overexpression of the IκBα super repressor (SR). To determine the role of NF-κB in rhabdomyosarcoma cells, we overexpressed the IκBα SR in RH30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells. IκBα SR was overexpressed in RH30 cells. RH30 vector cells were used as control group.

DESIGN
Triplicates of each group were cultured. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol extractions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Analysis used Affymetrix Human Transcriptome 2.0 Array
