TITLE
siRNA-mediated knockdown of MITF and PAX3 in metastatic melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factors PAX3 and MITF are required for the development of the neural crest and melanocyte lineage, and both proteins play important roles in melanoma cell growth and survival.  PAX3 transcriptionally activates MITF expression during neural crest development, but the relationship between these transcription factors during melanocyte development and in melanoma cells is currently poorly understood. This study aimed to further our understanding of the interaction between transcriptional networks controlled by PAX3 and MITF by assessing the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of PAX3 and MITF in metastatic melanoma cell lines. The goals of this study were to determine (i) if PAX3 is required for maintaining expression of MITF in melanoma and melanocyte cell lines; (ii) whether PAX3 and MITF independently, or redundantly, influence growth and survival in melanoma cell lines; and (iii) to investigate the respective roles of PAX3 and MITF expression in melanoma cell differentiation. Microarrays were used to measure global changes in transcript expression in response to siRNA-mediated knockdown of PAX3 or MITF compared to non-targeting controls in two metastatic melanoma cells lines.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from two different metastatic melanoma cell lines 30 hours after one of four different treaments: (i) transfection with siRNA targeting PAX3; or (ii)   transfection with siRNA targeting MITF; or (iii) or transfection with siRNA targeting luciferase (non-targeting negative control); or (iv) treatment with media only (control). Therefore, eight samples were used for gene expression profiling by using GeneChip arrays, with one replicate per cell line per treatment.
