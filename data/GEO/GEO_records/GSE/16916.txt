TITLE
The maize leaf transcriptome

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
We have generated over 80 million 32 nt reads generated from RNA samples isolated from the tip and base of a developing Mo17 leaf.  A comparision of these data with the maize AGP resulted in the confirmation of approximately 88% of the maize filtered gene set Keywords: Transcriptome analysis

DESIGN
Examination of two different RNA samples from two different segments of a developing 3rd leaf

PLATFORM
GPL9361 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Zea mays)
