TITLE
Liver Macrophage Infiltration and Inflammation are associated with Antiviral Responses During SIV Infection in Macaques that is Only Partly Reduced during cART

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Non-AIDS- related conditions have become increasingly more prevalent in those infected with HIV, with liver disease being one of the most predominant complications. Using the macaque simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model, we identified upregulation of numerous inflammatory pathways in the liver, which only partially resolved in cART (combination antiretroviral therapy) treated macaques.

DESIGN
11 adults (4 uninfected, 5 SIV-infected, 2 SIV-infected + cART treatment) and 20 infants (7 uninfected, 9 SIV-infected, 4 SIV-infected + cART treatment). We performed microarray analysis on liver samples collected from each animal during necropsy.
