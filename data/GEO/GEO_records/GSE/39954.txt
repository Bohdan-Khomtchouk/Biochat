TITLE
A human genome-wide screen for regulators of clathrin-coated vesicle formation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is essential for a wide range of cellular functions. We used a multi- step siRNA-based screening strategy to identify novel regulators of the first step of clathrin- mediated endocytosis, formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) at the plasma membrane. A primary genome-wide screen identified 334 hits that caused accumulation of CCV cargo on the cell surface. A secondary screen identified 92 hits that inhibited cargo uptake and/or altered the morphology of clathrin-coated structures. The hits include components of four functional complexes: coat proteins, V-ATPase subunits, spliceosome-associated proteins, and acetyltransferase subunits. Electron microscopy revealed that V-ATPase depletion caused the cell to form aberrant non-constricted clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane. The V- ATPase knockdown phenotype was rescued by addition of exogenous cholesterol, indicating that the knockdown blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis by preventing cholesterol from recycling from endosomes back to the plasma membrane. The microarray analysis was performed to test whether the siRNA targets are expressed in the cell lines used in the screen.

DESIGN
For the microarray analysis of gene expression, the two cell lines used in the study were analyzed in duplicate: HeLa-YXXΦ and HeLa-FXNPXY (Hela-M cells expressing a CD8-YXXΦ and CD8-FXNPXY constructs respectively). YXXΦ and FXNPXY are motifs for clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
