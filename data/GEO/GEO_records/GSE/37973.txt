TITLE
Discovery of the genes controlled by the second messenger cyclic di-GMP in Mycobacterium tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra

SUMMARY
Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a ubiquitous second messenger that regulates many biological processes in bacteria. The genome in Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes a single copy of the diguanylate cyclase gene (dgc) responsible for c-di-GMP synthesis. To determine the role of c-di-GMP signaling in M. tuberculosis, the mutant strain of Î”dgc was generated in the virulent H37Rv strain. We used whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify the genes controlled by c-di-GMP in M. tuberculosis, providing molecular proof for the phenotypes modulated by the signaling.
