TITLE
Discovery of the genes controlled by the second messenger cyclic di-GMP in Mycobacterium tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a ubiquitous second messenger that regulates many biological processes in bacteria. The genome in Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes a single copy of the diguanylate cyclase gene (dgc) responsible for c-di-GMP synthesis. To determine the role of c-di-GMP signaling in M. tuberculosis, the mutant strain of Δdgc was generated in the virulent H37Rv strain. We used whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify the genes controlled by c-di-GMP in M. tuberculosis, providing molecular proof for the phenotypes modulated by the signaling.

DESIGN
Wild-type H37Rv and Δdgc cultures were analyzed under aerobic conditions or in an in vitro dormancy model. Bacteria were collected at OD600 =1.3 for the aerobic cultures and upon the beginning of anaerobiosis for the cultures in the dormancy model. One culture for each experiment was assayed except for Δdgc under anaerobiosis (2 independent cultures).
