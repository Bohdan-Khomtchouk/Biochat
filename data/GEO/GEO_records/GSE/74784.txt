TITLE
Gene expression of fly testes with Med22 knock down

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The effect of Med22, spermatocyte arrest (sa) and always early (aly) loss of function on the gene expression in spermatocytes was assessed by microarray. Title: Recruitment of Mediator complex by cell type and stage-specific factors required for tissue-specific TAF dependent gene activation in an adult stem cell lineage

DESIGN
RNA was obtained from whole testes of flies with following mutations: 1)bam-gal4: UAS-Med22RNAi (VDRC#104581). Three biological replicates were included. Experiments were performed at 25C.
