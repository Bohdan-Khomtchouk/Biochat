TITLE
Expression data from tumors generated from genome-engineered mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations are found in 30–40% of human colorectal cancers (CRC). However, specific therapeutics against KRAS-mutated CRC have not been established. We have previously reported mouse models for colon cancer with and without Kras mutations (CDX2P-G22Cre;Apcflox/flox; KrasG12D and CDX2P-G22Cre;Apcflox/flox mice, respectively). Herein, we aimed to identify candidate genes as novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers for KRAS-mutated CRC by comparing the gene expression profiles of these two mouse models.

DESIGN
At an age of 6–8 weeks, 3 tumours were harvested from each of the two mouse models and gene expression profiles were generated using microarrays  (GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)
