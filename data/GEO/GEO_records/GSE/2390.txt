TITLE
Postnatal Development of Mouse Cochlear Nucleus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Developmental differences in gene expression in the postnatal mouse cochlear nucleus was analyzed at two or three ages using two different array platforms, the Affymetrix Mouse 430A GeneChip or the NIA 15K mouse cDNA microarray.  These ages, P7, P14, and P21 parallel a critical period of neuron survival dependent on input from the auditory nerve. Keywords: parallel sample
