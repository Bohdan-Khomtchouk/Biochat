TITLE
Expression data from 5 paired of gastric cancer tissues and gastric normal tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from gastric cancer tissues and gastric normal tissues to determine the differentially expressed genes in gastric cancer tissues

DESIGN
10 tissues (5 paired of gastric cancer vs.normal tissues) were analysed. We generated the following pairwise comparisons:C1 VS.N1;C2 VS.N2;C3 VS.N3;C4 VS.N4;C5 VS.N5; genes with a fold-change â‰¥2 were selected
