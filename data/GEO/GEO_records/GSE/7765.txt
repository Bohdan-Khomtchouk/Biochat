TITLE
Dioxin-induced gene expression changes in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF7 cells were treated with DMSO or 100 nM Dioxin for 16 hr.  Gene expression changes were quantified by microarray analyses. Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
HU133A and B arrays were used to quantify differences in RNA after treatment with 100 nM dioxin for 16 h.  The experiment was repeated 3 times.
