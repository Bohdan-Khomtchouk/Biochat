TITLE
RNA expression analysis of pancreatic cancer and non-malignant pancreas cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide expression profiling of 20 PDAC cell lines and an immortalized non-malignant pancreatic duct cell line (HPDE) to facilitate identification of novel tumor suppressor genes using an integrative genomics approach Genome wide expression profiling of 20 PDAC cell lines and an immortalized non-malignant pancreatic duct cell line (HPDE) to facilitate identification of novel tumor suppressor genes using an integrative genomics approach

DESIGN
RNA from the 21 samples was converted to Cy3 labeled cRNA and hybridized to the array; arrays were processed with GenePix software and median array normalization was performed

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
