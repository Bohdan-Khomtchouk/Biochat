TITLE
The differentially expressed genes identified in the microarray analysis using myb5 and wild-type (Col) seeds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The MYB gene family encodes transcription factors with a diverse range of functions in Arabidopsis. This study demonstrated that MYB5, which is expressed in trichomes and seeds, plays a central role in trichome and seed development. A microarray analysis of myb5 seeds identified other members of the MYB5 regulatory network.

DESIGN
Four wild-type biological replicates and three myb5 biological replicates were used for microarray analysis.
