TITLE
Polycomb Binding Protein

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We have identified a gene encoding apolycomb-chromo domain binding protein. Complete knockout of these plants do not lead to a phenotype, but a reduction of gene expression in RNAi line produces a defined phenotype. This argues in favour of a compensation mechanism that is switched on once the concentration of the gene reaches a control level.The aim of the experiment is to search for such compensatory factors that are up-regulated in the knockout line.
