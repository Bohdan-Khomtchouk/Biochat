TITLE
MicroRNAs as Regulators of the Immune Response during Allograft Rejection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate the post-transcriptional expression of target genes. In addition to being involved in many biologic processes including development, cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, microRNAs are important regulators in innate and adaptive immune responses. Distinct sets of expressed miRNAs are found in different cell types and tissues and aberrant expression of microRNAs is associated with many disease states. MicroRNA expression was examined in a model of heterotopic heart transplantation by microarray analyses and a unique profile was detected in rejecting allogeneic transplants (BALB/C to C57BL/6) as compared to syngeneic transplants (C57BL/6 to C57BL/6). The microRNA miR-182 was significantly increased in rejecting cardiac allografts and in mononuclear cells that infiltrate the grafts. Forkhead Box (FOX) proteins are a family of important transcription factors and FOXO1 is a target of miR-182. As miR-182 increases after transplant, there is a concomitant post-transcriptional decrease in FOXO1 expression in heart allografts that is localized to both the cardiomyocytes and CD3+ T cells. The microRNA miR-182 is significantly increased in both PBMC and plasma during graft rejection suggesting potential as a biomarker of graft status. Our results identify microRNAs that may regulate alloimmune responses and graft outcomes.

DESIGN
In total 14 microRNA microarrays data. For heart graft: each sample column corresponds to the expression profile of 3 pooled syngeneic or 3 pooled allogeneic heart grafts or 3 pooled normal heart.  For graft infiltrating lymphocytes (GILs): each sample column corresponds to the expression profile of 3 pooled syngeneic or 3 pooled allogeneic GILs or 3 pooled normal PBMC.
