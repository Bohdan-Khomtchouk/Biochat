TITLE
cis-regulatory landscape in ccRCC [tissue]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
VHL loss is the most common genetic alteration event in ccRCC, but its effect on epigenetic landscape has not been elucidated previously. By performing histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3) from ccRCC cell lines, we describe the genome-wide cis-regulatory landscapes of VHL-deficient ccRCC tumors. We show that ccRCCs exhibit a pervasive gain of enhancers around hypoxic and metabolic transcriptional targets.

DESIGN
Histone ChIP-Seq in primary normal-tumor tissue pairs of ccRCC
