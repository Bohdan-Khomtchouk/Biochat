TITLE
Expression data from rat tumors formed by 9L.EV or 9L.EGFRvIII cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of rat tumor xenografts revealed genes that are upregulated in tumors expressing EGFRvIII

DESIGN
12 rats received intracranial injections of 9L cells expressing EGFRvIII or an empty vector control.  Three weeks after implantation and subsequent growth, tumors were aseptically removed, processed for RNA extraction, and analyzed for gene expression profiling using the RatRef12 Illumina chip array.  We compared the average expression of all the transcripts between EGFRvIII-expressing and empty vector control tumors.
