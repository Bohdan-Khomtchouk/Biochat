TITLE
Precocious Interleukin 21 expression in na誰ve mice defines a novel stage of T-follicular helper cell development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To define early forming IL21-expressing CD4+ T cells at the transcriptional level, we performed RNAseq on FACS-purified splenic CD4+ T cells from na誰ve 4 wk old IL21-VFP reporter mice based on the following criteria: na誰ve ICOSlo/- VFP- (N); activated ICOShi VFP- cells not expressing IL21 (ACT); and activated IL21-expressing cells ICOShi VFP+ cells (ACT IL21)

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of FACS-purified VFP-ICOS-, VFP-ICOS+, and VFP+ICOS+ CD4+ cell pools from na誰ve 4 wk old IL21-VFP reporter mice were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina MiSeq

PLATFORM
GPL16417 Illumina MiSeq (Mus musculus)
