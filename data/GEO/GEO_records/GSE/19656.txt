TITLE
Streptococcus mutans UA159 vs. spx mutant strains

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans ; Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling to investigate the regulatory roles of SpxA and SpxB of S. mutans.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from four replicate samples of each strain of interest (spxA mutant, spxB mutant, spxAB double-mutant, UA159 wild type) and labeled with Cy3.  For each replicate, labeled RNA was hybridized to slides along with Cy5-labeled reference RNA, extracted from S. mutans UA159 cells grown to mid-log.

PLATFORM
GPL5911 JCVI PFGRC Streptococcus mutans 10K v2.1 array designed primarily based on strain UA159
