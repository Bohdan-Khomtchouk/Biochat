TITLE
Gene expression changes in response to carmustine treatment in glioma cells with acquired carmustine resistance versus parent cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three glioma cell lines (A172CR, SW1088CR, and U87CR) developed resistance to carmustine by prolonged sublethal exposure to 11 cycles of increasing carmustine exposure. The gene expression of parent versus resistant cell lines was compared upon exposure to carmustine. DMSO (vehicle) treatment was used as a control.

DESIGN
After 1 hour of exposure to either carmustine or DMSO, the gene expression profile of resistant versus parent cell lines was quantified. Indirect pairwise comparison between resistant versus parent cell line upon exposure to either carmustine or DMSO was performed in pair of dye swap experiments.
