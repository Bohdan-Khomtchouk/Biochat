TITLE
Comparative Time Course Profiles of Phthalate Stereoisomers in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression level in a mouse tumorigenic phthalate, DEHP vs non-tumorigenic DNOP.  The hypothesis tested in the present study was to identify early key event thresholds related to tumor outcomes in a two-year carcinogenicity bioassay.  Our results highlight marked differences in the toxicity profiles of structurally similar phthalates and demonstrate quantitative relationships between early bioindicators and later tumor outcomes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from liver samples subjected to 30wk exposures of cont, DEHP, DNOP.  Samples processed with Illumina Mouse WG 8-v 2.0 beadarrays.  Gene profiles generated for the compounds support observed key events in mode-of-action for these phthalates.

PLATFORM
GPL15097 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip (ILMN_GENE)
