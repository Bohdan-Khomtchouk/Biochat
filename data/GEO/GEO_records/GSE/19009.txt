TITLE
microRNA expression in salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive cotton cultivars under normal and salt-stressed conditions

ORGANISM
Viridiplantae

SUMMARY
To detect salt-tolerance-related miRNAs, comparative analysis of miRNA expression profiles was performed between the salt-tolerant and -sensitive cotton cultivars in control and salt-stressed conditions (treated with 300 mM NaCl for 24 h) using microRNA microarray
