TITLE
RNA-Seq Analysis of Tetranychus cinnabarinus in Response to scopoletin

ORGANISM
Tetranychus cinnabarinus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was employed to analyze the transcriptome changes in T. cinnabarinus treated with scopoletin or solvent. A total of 104, 783, 164 clean sequence reads were generated from the sequencing with more than 90% of the reads were successfully mapped to the reference sequence. The RNA-seq identified 70 and 102 differentially expressed genes between scopoletin and solvent treated mites at 24 h and 48 h post treatment, respectively. GO enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed genes from 24 h post treatment were categorized into 31 GO functional groups and differentially expressed genes from 48 h post treatment were categorized into 29 GO functional groups. The cellular process under the category of biological process was dominant throughout the GO classification at both time points. Overall our results revealed the global transcriptional changes in T. cinnabarinus upon scopoletin treatment and will enable the further identification of the targets of scopoletin on mite.

DESIGN
In this study, RNA-seq was employed to analyze the transcriptome changes in T. cinnabarinus treated with scopoletin or solvent treatment 24h and 48h.
