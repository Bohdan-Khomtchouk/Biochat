TITLE
Lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) transfected with the KSHV microRNA cluster

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kaposi sarcoma is the most common cancer in AIDS patients and is typified by red skin lesions. The disease is caused by the KSHV virus (HHV8) and is recognisable by its distinctive red skin lesions. The lesions are KSHV-infected spindle cells, most commonly the lymphatic endothelial and blood vessel endothelial cells (LEC and BEC), plus surrounding stroma. The KSHV virus expresses multiple microRNA in a single cluster. Here we test the effects of this KSHV microRNA cluster in LEC cells using Affymetrix hgu133plus2 chips.

DESIGN
There are n=3 of: 1. LEC control with empty vector pSIN-MCS (LEC), 2. LEC transfected with the same vector containing the KSHV microRNA cluster.
