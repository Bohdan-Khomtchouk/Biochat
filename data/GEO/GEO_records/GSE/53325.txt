TITLE
Salivary microRNAs May Be A Valuable Biomarker To Detect Resectable Pancreatic Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Early surgery is vital in the treatment of highly fatal pancreatic cancer (PC). But there is no valuable and non-invasive biomarker to screen PC currently. Studies showed many salivary molecules can detect several systemic diseases. We aimed to investigate whether salivary microRNAs (miRNAs) can act as a biomarker to detect resectable PC.

DESIGN
By Agilent microarray salivary miRNAs were profiled from saliva samples from 8 patients with resectable PC and 8 healthy controls. Candidate biomarkers discovered from the profile were subjected to validation by qPCR.
