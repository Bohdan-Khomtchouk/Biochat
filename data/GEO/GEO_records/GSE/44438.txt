TITLE
H3K27me3 in human bladder transitional cell carcinoma cell line CL1207

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data for the human bladder transitional cell carcinoma cell line CL1207 were generated in order to detect regions of regional epigenetic silencing in this cell line and test the performance of several peak calling tools: CCAT (Xu et al., 2010) and HMCan (Ashoor et al., " HMCan – a tool to detect chromatin modifications in cancer samples using ChIP-seq data " , submitted).

DESIGN
The human bladder cancer cell line CL1207 was derived from a muscle-invasive bladder cancer (De Boer et al., 1997). 5x105 cells were immunoprecipitated per ChIP assay with 4 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against trimethyl histone H3 lysine 27 (Upstate Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and  Dynabeads® Protein A (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) in dilution buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris–HCl at pH 8.0, and protease inhibitors. Six ChIP assays in the same experimental conditions were necessary to perform one ChIP-Seq experiment, so the total of 3x106 cells for each of the duplicates.
