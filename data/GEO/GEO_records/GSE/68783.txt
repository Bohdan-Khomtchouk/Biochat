TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of Nup98HoxA9- and Crm1-binding sites in ES cell lines.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used ChIP-seq to examine the genome-wide binding of Nup98-HoxA9 and Crm1 in ES cells. Our analysis revealed that Nup98-HoxA9 is highly and preferentially targeted to specific chromatin sites, particularly near Hox cluster regions where the export factor Crm1 is originally prebound.

DESIGN
chromatin immunoprecipitation

PLATFORM
GPL18480 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Mus musculus)
