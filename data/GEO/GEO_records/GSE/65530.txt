TITLE
Bulk RNA-seq analysis of the macrophage response to Salmonella enterica subsp. Typhimurium (SL1344) exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A time course of the macrophage response to Salmonella exposure analyzing the effects of input cell number as a control for single cell studies

DESIGN
Mouse macrophages were exposed to Salmonella enterica for different lengths of time.  Libraries were constructed using either approximately 500,00 macrophages lysed directly on a tissue culture dish (bulk) or using only 150 cells isolated using FACS (sorted).  All libraries were constructed in duplicate (bulk) or triplicate (sorted).  All replicates are biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
