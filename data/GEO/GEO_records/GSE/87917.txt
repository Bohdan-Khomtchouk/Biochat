TITLE
Analysis of eH3.3 occupancy in a ATRX loss-of-function line [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of H3.3 position and abundance in the presence and absence of a functionnal ATRX protein: we wanted to analyse how the absence of the  Arabidopsis putative ATRX chaperone would impact the abundance and the distribution of H3.3 variant at a genome-wide level.

DESIGN
2 replicates for WT, 2 replicates for mutant, Input control: in vitro grown 2.5 week-old seedlings were harvested and formaldehyde fixed. ChIP was performed according to Veluchamy et al., 2016 [PMID: 27410265] with Anti-FLAGÂ® M2 Magnetic beads (Sigma)

PLATFORM
GPL9062 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Arabidopsis thaliana)
