TITLE
RNAseq analysis of FACs sorted E-cadherin+,  Kit+ and K5-venus+ cells from E15 K5-venus mouse submandibular salivary glands

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used embryonic day 15 submandibular salivary glands from K5-Venus mice, which were produced using the bovine-K5 promoter driving Venus expression, N=3 separate experiments

DESIGN
Anti-E-cadherin APC (FAB7481A, R & D Systems) and anti-Kit PE (BD Biosciences) were also used to FACs sort the cells.  Total RNA was extracted from epithelial cells sorted by FACS analysis and RNAseq performed by Cofactor Genomics (www.cofactorgenomics.com). Single-ended reads (50 nt in length) were produced using Illumina sequencer (Illumina).

PLATFORM
