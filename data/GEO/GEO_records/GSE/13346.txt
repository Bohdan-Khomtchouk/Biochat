TITLE
Comparative analysis of transcripts associated with all-stage resistance to stripe rust in wheat

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is a destructive disease of wheat worldwide. Genetic resistance is the preferred method for controlling stripe rust, of which two major types are race-specific and race non-specific resistance. Race-specific resistance includes the qualitatively inherited all-stage resistance, controlled by single major resistance (R) genes. Conversely, adult-plant resistance is race non-specific, inherited quantitatively, and is durable. Previously, we characterized the gene expression signatures involved in Yr5-controlled all-stage resistance and Yr39-controlled adult-plant resistance using the Affymetrix Wheat GeneChip. For this study, we designed and constructed custom oligonucleotide microarrays containing probes for the 116 and 207 transcripts that we had found important for the Yr5 and Yr39 resistance responses, respectively. We used this custom microarray to profile the resistance responses of eight wheat genotypes with all-stage resistance (Yr1, Yr5, Yr7, Yr8, Yr9, Yr10, Yr15, and Yr17). The aim of this analysis was to identify common and unique gene expression signatures involved in race-specific resistance accross genotypes, which were used to infer information regarding the general pathways involved in all-stage resistance.
