TITLE
The transcription and translation landscapes during human cytomegalovirus infection reveal novel host-pathogen interactions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
During its long infection cycle, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) extensively manipulates cellular gene expression to maintain conditions favorable for viral propagation. In order to reveal the signature of cellular genes that are manipulated by HCMV, we measured RNA abundance and rate of protein production through the course of HCMV infection. We characterized changes for most expressed cellular genes and although much of the regulation was transcriptional we uncover diverse and dynamic translational regulation for subsets of host genes, revealing unappreciated coordination in translational control that suggests common regulators

DESIGN
Ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq along HCMV infection
