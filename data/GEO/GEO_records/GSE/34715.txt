TITLE
Gene expression profiling after induction of WTX in HEK293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
WTX encodes a tumor suppressor, frequently inactivated in Wilms tumor, with both plasma membrane and nuclear localization. WTX has been implicated in beta-catenin turnover, but its effect on nuclear proteins is unknown. We report an interaction between WTX and p53, derived from the unexpected observation of WTX, p53 and E1B 55K colocalization within the characteristic cytoplasmic body of adenovirus-transformed kidney cells. In other cells without adenovirus expression, the C-terminal domain of WTX binds to the DNA binding domain of p53, enhances its binding to CBP, and increases CBP/p300-mediated acetylation of p53 at Lys 382. WTX knockdown accelerates CBP/p300 protein turnover and attenuates this modification of p53. In p53-reconstitution experiments, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and p53-target gene expression are suppressed by depletion of WTX. Together, these results suggest that WTX modulates p53 function, in part through regulation of its activator CBP/p300.

DESIGN
Affymetrix microarray gene expression profiling was performed to identify differentially expressed genes following overexpression of WTX in HEK293 clones after 12 hour induction of WTX
