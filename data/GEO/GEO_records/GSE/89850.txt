TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of  nf-ycQ in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We generated 18 Gb of high-quality sequencing data (~3 Gb per sample) and catalogued the expression profiles of 27,416 annotated Arabidopsis thaliana genes in each sample. The analysis showed differences of transcriptomes between wild-type Col and Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y) C1,3,4,9 loss of function mutant nf-yc quadruple (nf-ycQ) seedlings treated with 2 days red light. We identified numerous differentially expressed genes that exhibited distinct expression patterns. These genes have known or potential roles in growth and development of Arabidopsis thaliana. Therefore, they are appealing candidates for further investigation of the gene expression and associated regulatory mechanisms related to NF-YCs in light signaling pathway.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis profiles of wild-type Col and T-DNA knockout mutant of nf-ycQ seedlings treated with 2 days red light were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
