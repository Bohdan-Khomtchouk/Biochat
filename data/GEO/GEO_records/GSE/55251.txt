TITLE
Expression profile of stromal cells in the lymph node

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue structure of the lymph node (LN) is supported by the network of stromal cells of mesenchymal origin, which is suggested to contribute to various immunological processes. In order to identify stromal cell–derived factors that regulate immune function, we performed gene expression profiling of stromal cells freshly isolated from collagenase digested mouse LNs, cultured stromal cell lines, and embryonic fibroblasts as a mesenchymal control.

DESIGN
Total RNAs extracted from the CD45-CD31-podoplanin+VCAM-1+ stromal cell fraction was sorted from enzymatically digested mouse LNs, cultured stromal cell lines stimulated with or without lymphotoxin (LTβR agonistic antibody), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were used for microarray analysis to assess relative gene expression.
