TITLE
Candida albicans_NSC319726 treated_vs._control transcriptome data

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
We investigated the antifungal mechanism of action (MOA) of compound NSC319726 against C. albicans SC5314. We used transcriptome analysis of wild type C. albicans treated or not with compound. Exponentially growing cells were treated for 60 min with 4 μg/ml of NSC319726.

DESIGN
Exponentially growing cells were treated for 60 min with 4 μg/ml of NSC319726. The total RNAs were extracted from treated and control cells, then used to synthesize cDNA for microarray assays with Agilent DesignID 037557 that contains 6101 genes in duplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL24227 Agilent-037557 C. albicans 12K (111122 Georgetown David on C Albicans) [ORF version]
