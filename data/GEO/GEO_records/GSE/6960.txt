TITLE
Synthesis and Anticancer Properties of Water-Soluble Zinc Ionophores 1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have shown that water solubilized versions of a zinc ionophore increase intracellular concentrations of free zinc and have antiproliferative activity in exponential phase A549 lung cancer cultures. The gene expression profiles of A549 lung cancer cultures treated with the lead compound PCI-5002 reveal the activation of stress response pathways.  Medium supplementation with zinc (25 Î¼M) led to activation of additional oxidative stress response as well as apoptotic pathways.  We propose that the pharmacologic delivery of zinc to tumors using water solubilized ionophores is a potential approach to cancer therapy. Keywords: Dose response
