TITLE
Identification of Novel Therapeutic Targets in Microdissected Clear Cell Ovarian Cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the gene signature accounting for the distinct clinical outcomes in ovarian clear cell cancer patients Clear cell ovarian cancer is an epithelial ovarian cancer histotype that is less responsive to chemotherapy and carries poorer prognosis than serous and endometrioid histotypes. Despite this, patients with these tumors are treated in a similar fashion as all other ovarian cancers. Previous genomic analysis has suggested that clear cell cancers represent a unique tumor subtype. Here we generated the first whole genomic expression profiling using epithelial component of clear cell ovarian cancers and normal ovarian surface specimens isolated by laser capture microdissection. Arrays analyzed using BRB ArrayTools and PathwayStudio software was used to identify the signaling pathways.
