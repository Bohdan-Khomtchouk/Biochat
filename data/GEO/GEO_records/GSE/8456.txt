TITLE
Transcriptional response of wild type ABA-treated Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The transcriptional profile of wild-type Col-0 Arabidopsis seedling 4 hr after treatment with ABA was compared with mock-treated controls. Keywords: aba_treatment

DESIGN
Wild-type Col-0 Arabidopsis seedlings were grown axenically on vertically-oriented square tissue culture plates under 24 hr light on standard MS media for 14 days.  Treatments were applied by pouring a solution of either 100 uM ABA (in solution of MS basal salts + 0.1% Tween 20) or mock solution over seedlings until all tissue was submerged. The seedlings remained submerged in the solution for 5 minutes, the solution was poured off, and then plates were returned to the growth chamber for 4 hr before collection and processing for microarrays.  Two biological replicates per treatment (each containing 20-24 seedling shoots, separated from roots) were hybridized to microarrays.
