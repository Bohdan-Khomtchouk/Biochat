TITLE
Evolutionary conservation of phototransduction and clock gene expression in the cave beetle Ptomaphagus hirtus (Coleoptera, Leiodidae)

ORGANISM
Ptomaphagus hirtus

SUMMARY
Caves are populated with a diverse fauna of highly adapted species that tend to exhibit a consistent suite of both regressive and constructive trait modifications. Because molecular studies of cave adaptation have largely concentrated on vertebrate models, our ability to recognize universalities in the genetic trajectories underlying cave adaptation remains limited. We have initiated efforts to elucidate the molecular evolution of the flightless small carrion beetle Ptomaphagus hirtus (Ptomaphagus hirtus), which represents one of the highly endemic signature inhabitants of the Mammoth Cave system of Kentucky. Ptomaphagus hirtus has been considered blind despite the presence of lateral eye rudiments. However, analysis of the Ptomaphagus hirtus adult head transcriptome by deep RNA sequencing reveals the conservation and expression of all essential insect phototransduction genes including a single long wavelength-sensitive opsin. Consistent with the preservation of visual ability, Ptomaphagus hirtus expresses all core members of the clock gene network and exhibits a similar degree of negative phototaxis as does a closely related flight-active species in light-dark choice assays. The structural reduction of the peripheral Ptomaphagus hirtus visual system is reflected by the lack of five eye pigmentation specific genes in the head transcriptome. Taken together our data suggest that wavelength contingent and probably also spatial vision have been lost in Ptomaphagus hirtus, while irradiance vision and contingent behavioral modules have remained preserved. We predict that the adaptive state of Ptomaphagus hirtus is representative for a large number of microphthalmic species adapted to the twilight zone of caves and other subterranean habitats
