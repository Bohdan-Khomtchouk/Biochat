TITLE
The FLS (Fatty liver Shionogi) mouse, liver with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison between livers of FLS mice and livers of DS (DD shionogi) mice We used FLS mice as model animals of human NASH, while DS mice as control animals. FLS mice develops NASH spontaneously. DS mouse strain is a sister strain of the FLS mouse strain.

DESIGN
We compared RNA from pooled livers of three FLS mice and three DS mice at 19 weeks. NASH in livers from FLS mice was confirmied pathologically while simple steatosis of DS mouse livers confirmed.
