TITLE
NGS and Transcriptome Analyses using AZ customized microarray on Leaf Abscission zone in Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Plants

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
To extend our previous knowledge from our gene expression studies on Leaf Abscission zone using Affymetrix microarray chip we have employed whole transcriptome analysis by NGS as a discovery platform to identify and add the transcripts to pre-existing database. We designed the Customized AZ Microarray chip with the transcripts obtained from NGS (includes novel transcripts), pre existing Agilent probes, and some additional transcripts from previous databases. The leaf AZ tissue was sampled at five time points (0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h), following leaf deblading and ethylene (10ppm) treated for 24h and analyzed for their gene expression profiles using the customized AZ microarray.

DESIGN
Solanum lycopersicum Custom Microarray 4x180K Array designed by Genotypic Technology Private  Limited. (AMADID:043310)
