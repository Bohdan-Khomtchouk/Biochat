TITLE
Regulatory T cell (T reg)  function in HIV exposed seronegative (ESN) individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T reg frequency, activation and function was studied in ESN individuals. Between the subjects with a HIV-specific T cell response, we identified two groups, one, where the T regs were able to suppress T cell proliferation and one where they lacked this capability. Sorted T regs from this two groups were analysed for their expression pattern.

DESIGN
Nineteen samples with CD4+ T cell response were identified, in 11 of which Tregs were unable to suppress. Due to a low number of sorted cells, samples were run only one time.
