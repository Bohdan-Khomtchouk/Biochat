TITLE
MiR-374a Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Metastasis of Breast Cancer (miRNA dataset)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment is designed to screen miRNAs that are deregulated during breast cancer metastasis. Comparatively analyzing miRNAs in parental MDA-MB-435 cells and cells obtained from its lung metastases, 23 miRNAs expressed differentially, among which 12 were elevated and 11 were down-regulated.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from parental MDA-MB-435 cells and cells obtained from its lung metastases after 30 days inoculation. Two biological replications for each treatment.
