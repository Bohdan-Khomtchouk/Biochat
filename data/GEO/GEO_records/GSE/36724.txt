TITLE
Expression data from hepatocyte specific Klf6 knockout mice vs. control on high fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dysregulated glucose homeostasis and lipid accumulation characterize non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but underlying mechanisms are obscure. We report here that Kr端ppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), a ubiquitous transcription factor that promotes adipocyte differentiation, also provokes the metabolic abnormalities of NAFLD. Mice with either hepatocyte-specific knockdown of KLF6 (DeltaHepKlf6) or global KLF6 heterozygosity (Klf6 +/-) have reduced body fat content and improved glucose and insulin tolerance. Mice with KLF6 depletion, compared to wild type mice, are protected from high fat diet-induced steatosis.

DESIGN
Three mice with a hepatocyte-specific knockdown of KLF6 (DeltaHepKlf6) on high fat diet and 3 littermate controls on the same diet were sacrificed after 8 weeks of  diet. Liver tissue was preserved in RNAlater速 (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA was isolated from liver tissue and homogenized in TRIzol速 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). In order to identify potential KLF6 targets that contributed to changes in glucose- and lipid-metabolism, we performed an Affymetrix Exon1 S.T. Genearray速 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
