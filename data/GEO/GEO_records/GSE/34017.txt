TITLE
Light and rhythmic regulation of gene expression in pineal gland of the chicken

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Light is the primary environmental cue in resetting the phase of circadian pacemaker in vertebrates. In birds, the effect of light is partly mediated by modulating the levels of circadian genes in the pineal gland. To further elucidate the mechanism by which light resets the circadian clock, we studied gene expression in the chicken pineal gland under acutely extended light period.

DESIGN
Three paradigms of treatments were used in this study. For each paradigm, chicks were assigned at random to control treatment (control groups) or light treatment (light groups). All birds in control groups were given 12 h light and 12 h dark period (LD 12:12). Light-on time is referred to as Zeitgeber Time 0 (ZT0). In paradigm 1, birds in the light group (n =25 for each of the groups in each paradigm) were acclimated to LD 12:12 for one week in the same light scheme as were the control birds, then exposed to light for 2 h during the subjective late night (ZT22 to ZT24) on the last day. All birds (including the controls) were sacrificed at ZT0. Pineal glands were dissected and 5-6 pineal glands were pooled for the preparation of one RNA sample. In paradigm 2, birds in the light group were acclimated as in paradigm 1 for one week, then exposed to light for 2 h during the early subjective night (ZT12 to ZT14) on the last day. All birds (including controls) were sacrificed at ZT14. The pineal glands were also pooled as before. In paradigm 3, birds in the light group (n = 25) were kept in LD 15:9 cycle all the time, and all birds (including controls) were sacrificed at ZT14. Similarly, 5-6 pineal glands in the same treatment were pooled.
