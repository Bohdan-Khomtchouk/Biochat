TITLE
Genome wide binding sites of the Arabidopsis B3 domain protein FUSCA3

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
FUSCA3 (FUS3) is a B3 domain transcription factor that is a member of the LEAFY COTYLEDON (LEC) group of genes. The LEC genes encode proteins that also include LEC2, a B3 domain factor related to FUS3, and LEC1, a CCAAT box binding factor. LEC1, LEC2 and FUS3 are essential for plant embryo development. We report ChIP-chip experiments using the Affymetrix tiling array to globally map binding sites for FUS3. Fangfang Wang and Sharyn E. Perry (2013) Plant Physiology preview

DESIGN
FUSCA3 was expressed by the native promoter and included a C-terminal 10x-c-myc tag. This transgene was able to rescue the fus3-3 mutant. A second transgene (35S:AGL15) was present to allow establishment of stable somatic embryo cultures. ChIP was performed using anti-c-myc antibody (Myc-Tag (9B11) Mouse mAb; Cell Signaling 2276S) on tissue expressing FUS3-myc (three biological replicates) and on three controls of tissue expressing FUS3 (no epitope tag).
