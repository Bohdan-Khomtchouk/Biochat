TITLE
Correction of a Genetic Disease by CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Gene Editing in Mouse Spermatogonial Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing technology to rescue a mutant gene in mouse spermatogenic stem cell(SSC). To evaluate the whole gemome off-target ratio and check the impact on imprinting methylation level by this gene editing method, We built libraries of WGBS from both mutant SSCs and rescued SSCs. We analyzed these data using bioinformatics .All the 12 imprinting locus the WGBS data coverd showed no difference between the two samples(sample name WGBS_**), with expected methylation patterns at each locus.

DESIGN
3 WGBS libraries from 2 SSC cell sample

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
