TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Wnt+ and Wnt- effector CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wnt signal transduction during an immune response is involved in the establishment of functional CD8 T cell memory P14 ConductinLacZ CD8 T cells (CD45.2) were transferred in CD45.1+.2+ recipient mice. The day after, recipients were infected with 200pfu LCMV WE. At day 8 after infection, cells from spleen and lymph nodes were harvested, magnetically enriched for CD8 T cells, loaded with the beta-galactosidase substrate (FDG) and sorted as 7AAD-negative CD45.- negative, beta-galactosidase positive versus negative cells.

DESIGN
P14 CD8 T cells were sorted at day 8 after LCMV infection according to LacZ activity for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
