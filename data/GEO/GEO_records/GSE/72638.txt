TITLE
MvaT family proteins encoded on IncP-7 plasmid pCAR1 and the host chromosome regulate host transcriptome cooperatively but differently (pCAR1)

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas

SUMMARY
MvaT proteins are recognized as a member of H-NS family proteins in pseudomonads. IncP-7 conjugative plasmid pCAR1, which was originally found in Pseudomonas resinovorans, carries an mvaT homologous gene, pmr. In Pseudomonas putida KT2440 bearing pCAR1, it was previously reported that pmr and chromosomally-encoded homologous genes, turA and turB, are majorly transcribed, and that Pmr interacts with TurA and TurB in vitro (Yun et al. J. Bacteriol. 192:4720-4731, 2010). In the present study, we clarified how the three MvaT proteins regulate the transcriptome of P. putida KT2440(pCAR1). Modified ChIP-chip analyses suggested that the binding sites of Pmr, TurA, and TurB in P. putida KT2440(pCAR1) genome were almost identical; nevertheless, transcriptome analyses using deletion mutants of each MvaT protein gene at the log and early-stationary growth phases clearly suggested that their regulons were different with one another. Especially, significant dissimilarity of regulons was found between Pmr and other two proteins. Transcriptions of the larger number of genes were affected by Pmr deletion at the early-stationary phase than at the log phase, suggesting that Pmr minimizes the pCAR1 effects on host fitness more effectively at the early-stationary phase. On the other hand, similarity found between the regulons of TurA and TurB implied that they may have complementary roles as global transcriptional regulators in response to the plasmid carriage.
