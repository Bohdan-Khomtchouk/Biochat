TITLE
Prediction of biomarkers for coping styles according to the Mainz Coping Inventory

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
According to the Mainz Coping Inventory (MCI) (Krohne & Egloff, 1999)  people use four main strategies for coping (i.e. Non-defensive, Repressing, High-Anxious and Sensitizing). To bridge the gap between psychology and genetics, the Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA) was used to analyze blood plasma of healthy male individuals with differing MCI coping styles to gain miRNA profiles associated with the MCI assessment and to predict biomarkers for the MCI coping modes.

DESIGN
Plasma Samples of 20 healthy male humans with different coping strategies according to the MCI were (either pooled or as standalone samples) analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA). Written informed consent was obtained from every participant. Ethics approval was provided by the ethics commitee at the Karl-Franzens-University (Graz, Austria): GZ. 39/3/63 ex 2011/12.
