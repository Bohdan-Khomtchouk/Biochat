TITLE
Functional characterization of open chromatin in bidirectional promoters of rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Bidirectional gene pairs tend to be highly coregulated and function in similar biological   processes in eukaryotic genomes. Structural features and functional consequences of BDPs   have received considerable attention among diverse species. However, the underlying   mechanisms responsible for bidirectional transcription and coexpression of BDPs remain poorly   understood in plants. In this study, we integrated DNase-seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and   nucleosome positioning data and investigated the effect of DHSs on transcription of rice BDPs.   We found that the physical localization of DHSs can affect the expression of the corresponding   genes, closer to TSS, higher expression level of genes. Most importantly, we observed that   distribution of DHS plays a significant role in regulation of transcription and coexpression of   gene pairs, which is possibly mediated by orchestrating the positioning of histone marks and   canonical nucleosomes around BPDs. Our results demonstrate that the combined actions of   chromatin structures with DHSs, which contain functional cis-elements for interaction with   transcriptional machinery, may play an important role in regulation of bidirectional   transcription or coexpression in rice BDPs. Our findings may help to enhance the understanding   of DHSs in regulation of bidirectional gene pairs.
