TITLE
Heat stress in 7 Solanaceae species, replicate 1 and 2

ORGANISM
Capsicum annuum ; Solanum lycopersicum ; Nicotiana tabacum ; Nicotiana benthamiana ; Petunia x hybrida ; Solanum melongena ; Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Seven different Solanaceae species, Potato (Solanum tuberosum), Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), Eggplant (Solanum melongena), Pepper (Capsicum annuum), Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), Petunia and Nicotiana benthamiana were subjected to heat stress. Plants were grown for 4-6 weeks at 25 C after which heat stress was initiated by exposing the plants to 35 C for 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 hours. Control samples were isolated from plants just before initiating the heat stress. RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy. Keywords: Direct comparison
