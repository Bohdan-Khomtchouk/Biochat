TITLE
Transcriptional gene silencing mediated by interplay of MOM1 and Pol V

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In plants, multiple levels of epigenetic control suppress transposon movement and permit somatic as well as transgenerational transmission of gene expression patterns. A variety of factors are involved that establish and/or maintain epigenetic marks, such as covalent modification of DNA and histones. Alteration of epigenetic marks leads to the enhancement or release of transcriptional gene silencing (TGS). TGS regulator MOM1 is special in this respect since it silences transcription by an unknown mechanism operating without obvious changes in epigenetic marks. We have isolated an enhancer of the mom1 mutation that points towards regulatory interplay between MOM1 and the plant-specific RNA Polymerase V (Pol V). Pol V transcribes heterochromatic loci and silences them. Although its biochemical properties have been studied; it is still not clear how Pol V is targeted to heterochromatin. We now provide evidence that Pol V is required for MOM1-mediated suppression of transcription at a subset of its chromosomal targets. Thus, Pol V interacts with MOM1 in the control of gene silencing. Interestingly, functional relationships between mutations in MOM1 and Pol V genes range from enhancement to independence or even suppression at different target loci.
