TITLE
Microarray analysis of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis grown at lowest growth temperature

ORGANISM
Thermococcus kodakarensis

SUMMARY
A hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis can grow in a wide range of temperatures from 60°C to 93°C, optimally at 85°C. To screen the genes that being specifically expressed at lowest growth temperature, 60°C, we investigated the transcriptional profilings of T. kodakarensis grown at 60˚C by comparing with those grown at 85°C.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, KU216 grown at optimal growth temperature, 85°C vs. KU216 grown at lowest growth temperature, 60°C. Technical replicates: 2 KU216 grown at 60°C, independently measured. One replicate per array.
