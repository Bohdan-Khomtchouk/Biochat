TITLE
Regeneration occurs in the CNS of CAST/Ei mice as a consequence of enhanced Activin signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We screened nine genetically diverse inbred mouse strains for differences in axonal growth of adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons on CNS myelin.  Naïve DRG neurite outgrowth on myelin was very limited, but preconditioning the neurons by a prior sciatic nerve crush increased axonal growth substantially across all strains, with by far the greatest change in neurons from CAST/Ei mice.  Three independent in vivo CNS injury models revealed greater capacity for CNS axonal regeneration in CAST/Ei than C57BL/6 mice.  Full-genome expression profiling of naïve and pre-conditioned DRGs across all strains revealed Activin-βA (Inhba) as the transcript whose expression most closely correlated with axonal growth on myelin.  In vitro and in vivo gain- and loss-of-function experiments confirmed that Activin promotes axonal growth in the CNS.  Substantial regeneration is possible, therefore, in the injured mammalian CNS when Activin signaling is intrinsically high, as in CAST/Ei or when extrinsically modulated in other strains.

DESIGN
9 strains, 4 replicates per strain, 2 conditions (naïve and axotomy) = 72 samples. 2 samples were excluded because technical outliers (AJ_AX5D_1 and AJ_NAIVE_4 excluded from the normalized data but included in the raw data)
