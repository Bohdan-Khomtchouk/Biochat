TITLE
Expression profile of Chicken Early Yolksac Endodermal Tissues

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
A major role of yolk sac endoderm is the uptake of lipids and other constituents from the yolk and transfer of these components into the embryonic circulation. The molecular basis of the initial step of this regionalization has largely remained unclear. Using chick as a model system, we generated high-quality transcriptomic datasets of different stages of the yolksac endoderm and analyzed their molecular heterogeneity.

DESIGN
Two independent samples of total RNA were isolated from yolk sac endodermal tissues on embryonic day 1, 2, 3, and 4.  5 Î¼g of RNA from each sample (total of 8 samples) were used to screen Affymetrix Chicken Genome Array without an amplification step.
