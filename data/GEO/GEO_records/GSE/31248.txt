TITLE
Transcription profiling of Basmati T-DNA insertional mutant lines

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to look for the changes at the transcriptome level caused by the same T-DNA cassette in three mutants of Basmati 370 with different phenotypes. The comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes was conducted individually and collectively for all three mutants.

DESIGN
RNA from Basmati mutants OsPE, Osoc and Ossl grown under optimal conditions were analyzed in two different biological replications (A and B) making total six samples.

PLATFORM
GPL2025 [Rice] Affymetrix Rice Genome Array
