TITLE
Caloric restriction affects small RNA expression in mouse hepatic mitochondria

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial post-transcriptional regulators that extensively affect protein synthesis. Emerging evidence suggests the presence of miRNAs in mitochondria and important regulatory roles of miRNAs in mitochondrial translation. To investigate whether miRNAs are involved in the CR-induced mitochondrial translational changes, we used small RNA sequencing to profile miRNA expression in whole liver tissue as well as in liver mitochondria. The sequencing results revealed that the number of miRNAs identified in mitochondria was comparable to that found in the whole tissue.

DESIGN
We used small RNA sequencing to profile miRNA expression in ad libitum vs. calorie-restricted mouse liver tissue and in liver mitochondria.
