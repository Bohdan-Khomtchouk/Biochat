TITLE
CONTROL OF GROWTH AND GUT MATURATION BY HoxD GENES AND THE ASSOCIATED LncRNA Haglr

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this work we have analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of E9 mouse embryos. We show that Hoxd1 and Haglr transcripts are absent after targeted deletion of the CpG: 114 island.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis of trunk from the anterior limit of the forelimb bud to the tailbud, aiming to exclude all extra-embryonic, head, cervical and heart  tissues. Individuals 443 (wt) and 445 (Del(CpG114) homozygous), were siblings from the same dam, while biological replicates 456 (wt) and 455 (Del(CpG114) homozygous) were siblings from another dam.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
