TITLE
Differential gene expression profiles between SUM149 cells transfected with control siRNA and SUM149 cells transfected with siRNA targeting tarzarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) as a potential tumorigenic gene in IBC. To investigate the underlying mechanism by which TIG1 promotes tumor growth and invasiveness of IBC cells, we first sought to identify TIG1 functional partners by using DNA microarray analysis to compare gene expression profiles between SUM149 cells transfected with control siRNA and SUM149 cells transfected with siRNA targeting TIG1. We identified receptor tyrosine kinase Axl as a functional partner of TIG1.

DESIGN
SUM149 cells transiently transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting TIG1 were used. Total RNA was extracted and purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The integrity of the obtained RNA was assessed using an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The Affymetrix HGU133 plus platform was used for hybridization, staining, and imaging of the arrays by following the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression analysis was performed in triplicate.
