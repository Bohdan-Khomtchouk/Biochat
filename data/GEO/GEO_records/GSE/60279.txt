TITLE
Bradyrhizobium japonicum_Bacteroids vs. Bacteria grown in HM-Arabinose

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110

SUMMARY
A transcriptomic analysis of bacteroids isolated from soybean plants inoculated with B. japonicum USDA 110, relative to cells cultured in HM-arabinose medium was performed and the results combined with two other transcriptomic analyses to form a reiterated pool of transcripts that define genes essential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

DESIGN
Four independent biological replicates for bacteroids and free-living cells. Total of 8 arrays including dye swap.

PLATFORM
GPL5341 USDA Bradyrhizobium japonicum 8.5K (BJ_USDA110_Oligo_Array)
