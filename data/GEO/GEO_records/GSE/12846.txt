TITLE
Gene expression profiles of lymphatic endothelial cells after knockdown of Prox1 and/or NR2F2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of primary lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) isolated from human foreskin were analyzed after siRNA-mediated knockdown of control (firefly luciferase), Prox1, NR2F2 or Prox1/NR2F2 for 48 hours.

DESIGN
Passage five human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were cultured on fibronectin (10 μg/ml)-coated plates in a complete media (EBM, 20% FBS supplemented with 10 μg/ml hydrocortisone acetate, 25 ug/ml cAMP and antibiotics). LECs were harvested and electorporated with siRNA duplexes for 48 hours with siRNA duplexes against either firefly luciferase(control), Prox1, NR2F2 or Prox1/NR2F2. Total RNA was purified using Tri-reagent and was subjected to microarray analysis.
