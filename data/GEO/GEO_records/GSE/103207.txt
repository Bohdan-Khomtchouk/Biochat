TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of mRNAs and lncRNAs expression in chciken ALV-J-infected primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and uninfected control.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to investigate the differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs between ALV-J infected MDM and uninfected MDM in chickens by Illumina deep sequencing. Methods:  Total RNA from two ALV-J-infected MDM (designated: J3h_1, J3h_2, J36h_1 and J36h_2) and two uninfected MDM samples (designated:  NC3h_1, NC3h_2, NC36h_1 and NC36h_2) was isolated by TRIzol following the manufacturerâ€™s instruction at 3 h post infection (hpi) and 36 hpi. RNA samples were subjected to Illumina deep sequencing by Illumina Hiseq 2000. Results:Compared to the uninfected control, a total of 1568 and 550 up-regulated genes were identified in chicken MDM at 3 hpi and 36 hpi respectively, and 1227 and 397 down-regulated genes were identified at 3 hpi and 36 hpi, respectively.128 and 30 DE lncRNAs were identified in MDM at 3 hpi and 36 hpi, respectively. Conclusions: Strong immune response induced by ALV-J infection in MDM at 3 hpi. Many genes, lncRNAs  involved in immune response such as PRRs signaling pathway and Jak-STAT signaling pathway at 3 hpi. Specifically, 78 ISGs expression significantly increased in ALV-J-infected MDM at 3 hpi. We speculated that host innate immune response could inhibit ALV-J replication in chicken MDM. These results provide valuable insights into the game of host antiviral immune response and ALV-J infection.

DESIGN
Chicken mRNAs and lncRNAs profiles of ALV-J infected MDM and uninfected MDM were generated by deep sequencing, using  Illumina Hiseq 2000.
