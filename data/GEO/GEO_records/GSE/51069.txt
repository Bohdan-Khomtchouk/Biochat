TITLE
The 3′-tag digital gene expression library construction and Illumina sequencing analysis of Wild Type and SPL-/- ovules with placenta Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To elucidate the molecular basis underlying early female reproductive development, Here, we used high-throughput tag-sequencing analysis to identify genes preferentially expressed in female meiocytes (FMs) by comparing gene expression profiles from wild type ovules undergoing megasporogenesis with those from the lacking megasporogenesis spl mutant ovules. A total of 862 genes were identified as FMs with levels that are consistently reduced in spl ovules in two biological replicates. Genes involved in biogenesis, metabolism, transporter activity and DNA binding were over-represented in female meiocytes, suggesting that female meiocytes are synthetically and metabolically more active.

DESIGN
Total mRNA profiles of stage 10-11 old ﬂoral buds wild type (WT) and SPL-/- ovules with placenta were generated by deep sequencing, Repeat twice, using Illumina adaptor 2 (GEX adapter 2).
