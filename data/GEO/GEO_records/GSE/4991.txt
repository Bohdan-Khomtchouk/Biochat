TITLE
Gene expression of disseminated neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comprehensive expression profiling of disseminated neuroblastoma with favorable and unfavorable outcome using SAGE. Results provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of spontaneous regression and progression of metastatic neuroblastoma and may be used for improving risk estimation of patients with disseminated neuroblastoma. Keywords: gene expression SAGE-based, neuroblastoma, primary tumor, disseminated disease
