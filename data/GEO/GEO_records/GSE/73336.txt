TITLE
Transplantation of gastric organoid-derived spasmolytic polypeptide/TFF2-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) cell lineage promotes ulcer repair in the aged stomach

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background & Aims: Spasmolytic polypeptide/TFF2-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) is known to emerge following parietal cell loss and during Helicobacter pylori infection, however its role in gastric ulcer repair is unknown. Therefore, we sought to investigate if SPEM plays a role in epithelial regeneration. Methods: Acetic acid ulcers were induced in young (2-3 months) C57BL/6 mice to determine the quality of ulcer repair.  Gastric tissue was collected and analyzed to determine the expression of SPEM within the regenerating epithelium.  As a comparison to native tissue the expression of SPEM was also identified within cultured gastric mouse-derived organoids. Results:  Wound healing in the mice coincided with the emergence of SPEM expressing CD44v within the ulcerated region.  The emergence of SPEM was also observed in cultured gastric organoids.  Conclusions: These data demonstrate the SPEM may play a role in epithelial regeneration. Conclusions: These data demonstrate the SPEM may play a role in epithelial regeneration.

DESIGN
4 samples were used for ulcerated and uninjured tissue.  1 sample was used for intact tissue and organoid-derived RNA. The 'Ulcerated' samples represent C57BL/6 mice with ulcers and the 'Uninjured' samples represent the healthy controls (for " ulcerated " samples). The " Intact stomach tissue " and " Gastric organoids " samples are other types of samples that compared separately. " Gastric organoids " in this comparison are derived from " Intact stomach tissue " .
