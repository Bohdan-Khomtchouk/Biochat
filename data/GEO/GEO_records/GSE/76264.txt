TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Bone Marrow FoxP3+ Treg cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of Bone Marrow FoxP3+ Treg cells. Glatman Zaretsky et al. revealed an unexpected role for Tregs in plasma cell biology. Here we determined the gene-expression profile of this new subset of FoxP3+ Treg cell, which express high levels of Treg effector molecules, similar to other non-lymphoid tissue Tregs.

DESIGN
Gene-profiling of BM Tregs. Bone marrow Treg cells (30k) (gfp+CD25hiCD4+TCRβ+) (dump negative: CD19-CD8α-TCRγδ-CD11b-CD11c-NK1.1-Gr-1-Ter-119-) were triple-sorted from pools of two to three reporter mice (C57BL/6 Foxp3-IRES-gfp, 9 week-old males) into trizol per ImmGen SOP. RNA was amplified, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Expression Analysis)

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
