TITLE
Gene expression signatures for ELF4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate how ELF4 confers anti-growth activity, gene expression profiles were compared between wildtype-  and mutant-expressing T3M-1 Cl-10 cells with the use of DNA microarrays.

DESIGN
T3M-1 Cl-10 cells were infected with a mock retrovirus or virus generated from pMXS-ires-EGFP expressing ELF4 or ELF4(L211M), and EGFP?positive fractions were purified with a cell sorter. Thus gene expression profiling of purely mock/ELF4/ELF4(L211M)-expressing cells was performed with SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8Ã—60K v2 Microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL17077 Agilent-039494 SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray 039381 (Probe Name version)
