The sclera maintains and protects the eye ball, which receives visual inputs. The aim of this study is to identify characteristics of the human sclera as one of the connective tissues derived from the neural crest and mesoderm. We have here demonstrated microarray data of cultured human scleral cells. Keywords: sclera, cartilage

DESIGN
Affymetrix human U133 plus 2.0 array was used to transcriptionally profile to compare sclera cells and others.
