TITLE
Essential role of the transcription factors E2A and E2-2 in germinal center B cell and plasma cell development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E2A is an essential regulator of early B-cell development. Here we demonstrated that E2A together with E2-2 controlled germinal-center B-cell and plasma cell development. As shown by identification of regulated E2A,E2-2 targets in activated B-cells, these E-proteins directly activated genes with important functions in germinal-center B-cells and plasma cells by inducing or maintaining DNase I hypersensitive sites. Through controlling multiple enhancers in the Igh 3’ regulatory region and Aicda locus, E-proteins regulated class switching by inducing both Igh germline transcription and AID expression. By regulating 3’ Igk enhancers and a distal element at the Prdm1 (Blimp1) locus, E-proteins contributed to Igk, Igh and Prdm1 activation in plasmablasts. These data identified E2A and E2-2 as central regulators of B-cell immunity.
