TITLE
NK cell response to IL2 in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we analyzed the transcriptional response to IL2 in NK cells in vitro.

DESIGN
Splenic NK cells were isolated by negative selection from 6wk old male C57BL/6 mice. These were directly cultured with IL2 (250U/ml) for 8hrs in vitro. Cells were then transferred directly into TriZol. RNA was prepared in Trizol for gene expression profiling by  Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. The samples in this series are re-analyzed samples from GSE84562.
