TITLE
Expression data from early stage CRC patients' tumors [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
This study was conducted in order to identify biomarkers for a prognostic gene expression signature for metastases in early stage CRC.

DESIGN
Expression profiles from 100 metastasis negative and 50 metastasis positive early stage CRC tumors were obtained.
