TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of dominant follicle development in the equine ovary

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
The Objective of this study was to establish global gene expression profiles associated with different stages of dominant follicle development  in the horse.  This was done by collecting ovaries at different stages of an ovulatory follicular wave, when the dominant follicle reached 22 mm (early dominant, ED), 33 mm (late dominant, LD) and 34 h after an i.v. injection of crude equine gonadotropins (CEG; 15 mg i.v.) when the largest follicle reached > 33 mm (preovulatory stage, PO). RNA was then separately collected  from granulosa cells and theca-rich follicular wall fractions and was hybridized to the Agilent Horse Gene Expression Microarray.  Gene expression was compared between ED and LD and between LD and PO stages within each of granulosa cells and theca walls. Significantly larger numbers of genes were differentially expressed in granulosa cells than in theca walls throughout development, and between LD and PO follicles than between ED and LF follicles. The most salient features were the downregulation of cell cycle genes in granulosa cells during both the ED-LD and LD-PO transitions and the upregulation of genes associated with inflammation, immunity, extracellular matrix remodelling and protection aganints toxic insult in both GCs and TCs, particularly during the LD-PO transition.

DESIGN
Five to nine biological replicates per cell type and developmental stage (total of 34 samples) were used in a single dye experiment. Samples were distributed among slides so that each experimental groupeach was represented at least once in each slide.  For each gene, mean normalized intensities (n= 5 biological replicates/group) were compared between follicle stages (ED-LD and LD-PO) within each cell type (GC and TC).
