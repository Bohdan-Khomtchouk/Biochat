TITLE
Genome-wide map of SET1A occupancy in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify SET1A genome-wide occupancy and further unveil its role in transcriptional regulation in mouse ES cells, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high sequencing (ChIP-seq).We established a stable ES cell line expressing 2X Flag tagged SET1A and performed ChIP with anti-Flag M2 beads, followed by deep sequencing. We found that the SET1A peaks show an outstanding enrichment in promoter region. Importantly, these SET1A binding loci revealed a clear co-localization with OCT4, and high H3K4me3 level, which is consistent with its interaction with OCT4 and intrinsic H3K4 methylase activity.

DESIGN
