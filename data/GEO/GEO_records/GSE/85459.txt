TITLE
Gene expression profile altered by orthodontic tooth movement during healing of surgical alveolar defect

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
An OTM-related healing model was established where a maxillary second premolar was protracted into the critical-sized defect for 6 weeks (Group DT6). As controls, natural healing models without OTM were set at 2 weeks (Group D2) and at 6 weeks (Group D6) after surgery. Total RNAs were extracted from dissected regenerated tissues and additionally from sound alveolar bone as a baseline (Group C). mRNA profiling was performed using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted either from the regenerated tissue in the defect and adjacent alveolar bone surrounding the root of the maxillary second premolar (Groups D2, D6, and DT6) or from the sound alveolar bone tissue around the maxillary premolar roots (Group C) to perform DNA microarray analysis.
