Utility of HM450 BeadArray on Mouse Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina Infinium Human Methylation (HM) BeadChips are a widely used platform for measuring genome-scale DNA methylation, particularly in relation to epigenetic GWAS (EWAS) studies. The methylation profile of human samples can be assessed accurately and reproducibly using the HM27 BeadChip (27,578 CpG sites) or its successor, the HM450 BeadChip (485,577 CpG sites). To date no mouse equivalent has been developed greatly hindering the application of this methodology to the wide range of valuable murine models of disease and development in existence. We found 1,308 and 13,715 probes from HM27 and HM450 BeadChip uniquely matched the reference mouse genome (mm9) respectively. We demonstrate reproducible measurements of DNA methylation at these probes in a range of mouse tissue samples and in a murine cell line model of acute myeloid leukaemia. In the absence of a mouse counterpart, the Infinium HumanMethylation BeadChip arrays have utility in carrying out methylation profiling in non-human species.
