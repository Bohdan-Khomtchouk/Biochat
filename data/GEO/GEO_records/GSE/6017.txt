TITLE
Molecular Characterization of the Human and Mouse Parotid Gland

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of 4 human parotid gland samples were comapred with 4 mouse parotid gland samples. Keywords: Comparative Gene Expression

DESIGN
Human and mouse parotid gland gene expression was screened using custom-designed targeted cDNA containing probes for 198 genes which encode for ion/water transporter (75 genes) and receptor/regulatory (101 genes) proteins potentially involved in the fluid secretion mechanism, as well as 11 secretory protein genes and 11 control genes

PLATFORM
GPL4391 salivary gland secretion
