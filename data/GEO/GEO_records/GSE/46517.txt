TITLE
Human melanoma samples comparing nevi and primary and metastatic melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to identify genes and gene signatures which correlate with progression by sampling human melanomas from nevi, primary, and metastatic tumors. The large number of samples also permits analysis within groups.

DESIGN
Human melanoma samples were isolated from historical frozen patient specimens. RNA was extracted and run on the human Affymetrix U133A microarray chip.
