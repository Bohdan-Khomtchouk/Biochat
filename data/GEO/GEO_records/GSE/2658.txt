TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles of Multiple Myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples in this series are pre-treatment bone marrow aspirates from multiple myeloma patients. Keywords = Multiple Myeloma, Bone Marrow, Pre-Treatment Keywords: other

DESIGN
Samples in this series are: 1. CD-138-selected plasma cells from bone marrow of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma subsequently treated with high dose therapy and stem cell transplants termed Total Therapy 2 (pre-treatment TT2) 2. CD-138-selected plasma cells from bone marrow of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma subsequently treated with Total Therapy 3 (pre treatment TT3). Overall Design: Gene expression signatures were used to: 1) develop unsupervised hierarchical cluster classes; 2) establish links with outcome following stem cell transplantation CEL files are available upon request via a Materials Transfer Agreement. Please contact Dr. John Shaughnessy  for details.
