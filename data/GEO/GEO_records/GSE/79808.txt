TITLE
Acetylation enhances TET2 function in protecting against abnormal DNA methylation during oxidative stress [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A2780 cells with genetic TET2 knockout, generated by CRISPR. The aim was to identify genes affected by TET2 KO. Three individual KO clones were profiled. Control cells were cells that infected with control sgRNA.

DESIGN
A2780 cells were infected with either Control or LentiCRISPR virus against TET2 genes for 2 days, followed by puromycin selection. Single clones were selected and validated after ~8 weeks selection in puromycin. Expression profiles of three TET2 KO clones were compared against those of two control clones prepared in parallel.
