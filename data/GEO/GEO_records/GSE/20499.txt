TITLE
Expression data of human decidual NK cells from gravid uteri and NK cells from cycling endometrium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human NK cells from the decidua basalis of gravid uteri (dNK) and from  cycling endometrium  (eNK) of women undergoing hysterectomy were isolated and compared by gene expression profiling using  Affymetrix  microarrays with probes representing ~47,400 transcripts. Substantial differences indicate that these two types of NK cells represent distinct subsets.

DESIGN
Freshly isolated NK cells were obtained by FACS sorting. 4 dNK and 5 eNK samples were obtained form independent donors. dNK cells were isolated from the decidua basalis of first trimester placentas and sorted  as CD3-, CD16-, CD56+ cells. eNK cells  were  obtained from non-affected regions  of cycling endometrium   of donor women undergoing   hysterectomy and were sorted as CD45+, CD56+, CD3-  cells . The preliminary patient diagnoses included genital prolapse, fibroids, cervical dysplasia, or menorrhagia. All cycling endometrium  samples were from the secretory phase  of the cycle with exception of sample eNK_S6 that was from the  proliferative phase.
