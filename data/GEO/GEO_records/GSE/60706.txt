TITLE
Knockdown of NAT12/NAA30 decreases glioblastoma stem cell growth and tumorigenicity by regulating hypoxia response, p-MTOR (Ser2448) and p53 pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene knockdown of NAT12/NAA30 led to decreased proliferation, sphere forming ability and mitochondrial hypoxia tolerance in the GSC T65 culture. Intracranial transplantation of these cells into SCID mice showed that the decreased NAT12/NAA30 expression correlated with the prolonged animal survival and reduced tumor size

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from GSC cultures featuring NAT12/NAA30 gene knock-down (shRNA) was compared to total RNA from non-silencing control GSC cultures (NS-shRNA).
