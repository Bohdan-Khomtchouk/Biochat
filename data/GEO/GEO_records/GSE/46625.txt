TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Escherichia coli K12  strain JM109 harboring pUCA1501

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
A1501 aroA is a gene derived from Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501, encoding a class II glyphosate-tolerant EPSP synthase. To understand the effect of class II EPSP synthase to E. coli under glyphosate shock, we constructed the class II EPSP synthase-expressing plasmid pUC-A1501. And pUC18 is the empty vector used as a control.

DESIGN
RNA extracted from cells of E. coli K-12 JM109 cells with pUCA1501 till OD600 to achieve 0.4, or cells with pUC18 when their OD600 achieved 0.4.
