TITLE
Prostaglandin F2Î± -induced changes in transcriptome of bovine mid cycle versus early corpus luteum

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Despite much investigation, mechanisms conferring stage specific responsiveness of the corpus luteum (CL) to prostaglandin F2 (PG) are unknown. The objective of this study was to identify PG- induced changes in transcriptome of bovine CL specific to d 11 ( PG responsive) but not d 4 (PG refractory) CL associated with luteolysis. CL were collected from heifers at 0, 4 and 24 h following PG injection on d 4 and 11 of the estrous cycle (n = 5 animals/treatment) and isolated RNA labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Genome Arrays.   At 4 and 24 h post PG respectively, 221 (d 4) and 661 (d 11) and 248 (d 4) and 1419 (d 11) regulated genes were identified.

DESIGN
Thirty Angus crossbred heifers were assigned to one of six treatments (n = 5 per treatment) in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangment, using a completely random design.Corpora lutea were collected at 0 (control), 4 or 24 h following injection of saline (control) or PG on d 4 or d 11 of the estrous cycle.  Total RNA was isolated from luteal tissue. The isolated RNA was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Genome Arrays.
