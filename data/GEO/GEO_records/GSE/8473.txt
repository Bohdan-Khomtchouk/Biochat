TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Candida albicans wild-type CAI-4 strans treated by Hst5

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to study the transcriptional profiling of Candida albicans wild-type CAI-4 strains and corresponding Histatin 5 treated strains. Since Histatin 5 will kill Candida albicans, the focus will be on how many and which genes are significantly affected with the treatment of Histatin 5. Currently, we only conducted the microarray experiments at one concentration of Histatin 5 and one time point of treatment. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Direct balanced design (without reference sample) Four samples/arrays were used  in the experiment, which includes 2 dye swap replicates and 2 duplicate experiments. The details are CAI-4-Cy5 < - > Hst5_CAI-4-Cy3 CAI-4-Cy5 < - > Hst5_CAI-4-Cy3 CAI-4-Cy3 < - > Hst5_CAI-4-Cy5 CAI-4-Cy3 < - > Hst5_CAI-4-Cy5 CAI-4 is wild-type strain Hst5_CAI-4 is CAI-4 treated with Histatin 5 for 1hr. under specific conditions.
