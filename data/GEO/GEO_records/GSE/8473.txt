TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Candida albicans wild-type CAI-4 strans treated by Hst5

ORGANISM
Candida albicans SC5314

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to study the transcriptional profiling of Candida albicans wild-type CAI-4 strains and corresponding Histatin 5 treated strains. Since Histatin 5 will kill Candida albicans, the focus will be on how many and which genes are significantly affected with the treatment of Histatin 5. Currently, we only conducted the microarray experiments at one concentration of Histatin 5 and one time point of treatment. Keywords: cell type comparison
