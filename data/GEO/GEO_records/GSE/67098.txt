TITLE
Expression data from epidermal samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of epidermal samples obtained from sun-exposed and sun-protected body sites from younger ( < 35 years old) and older ( > 60 years old) individuals. The Affymetrix U133A plus 2.0 array  was used to obtain gene expression data. Samples included 4 younger sun exposed epidermal samples, 4 older sun exposed epidermal samples, 3 younger sun protected epidermal samples, 5 older sun protected epidermal samples.

DESIGN
To determine how gene expression relates to identified methylation changes with aging and sun-exposure, RNA was extracted from dispase separated epidermal samples and analyzed using Affymetrix U133A plus 2.0 arrays.
