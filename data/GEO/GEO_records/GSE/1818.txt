TITLE
Testicular germ cell tumors and their histological subgroups

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal, premalignant and various histological subtypes of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) tissues were hybridized against Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene) onto Agilent 60mer oligo microarrays (GEO accession no GPL885). In vitro time series of two TGCT cell lines, NTERA2 and 2102Ep, treated with retinoic acid for 0, 3, and 7 days were also included. The data set (30 hybridizations) is particularly useful for comparisons between various histological subtypes of TGCT versus each other or versus normal testis.
