TITLE
Expression data from Xenopus laevis embryonic epidermis depleted for Jnk signalling

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
St. 14 embryos were incubated in 100mM of a Jnk inhibitor (SP600125)-0,1x MBS until stage 24. Embryonic epidermis was isolated and stored immediately in chilled (4Â°C) Trizol.  We sought to uncover all the putative targets of Jnk expresssed in the embryonic epidermis whole embryonic skin was isolated and immediately stored in chilled trizol

DESIGN
Xenopus embryos skins were isolated at stage 24 of early development for Trizol RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Each sample contains 20 whole embryonic skins

PLATFORM
GPL10756 [X_laevis_2] Affymetrix Xenopus laevis Genome 2.0 Array
