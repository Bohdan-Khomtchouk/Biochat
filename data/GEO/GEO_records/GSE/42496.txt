TITLE
RNA sequencing of stripe rust infected wheat leaves and isolated haustoria

ORGANISM
Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici 08/21

SUMMARY
The fungus Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (PST) is the causal pathogen of stripe rust in wheat. New highly virulent PST races appeared at the beginning of this century and spread rapidly causing significant yield losses in wheat production worldwide. Race PST-08/21 was isolated in the UK in 2008 Yr1, Yr2, Yr3, Yr4, Yr6, Yr9, Yr17, Yr27, Yr32, YrRob, YrSol. We applied the RNAseq approach to refine the gene prediction in de novo assembled PST 08/21 contigs and to determine which genes are expressed during wheat infections.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from a pool of stripe rust infected wheat leaves and from two biological replicates of haustoria isolates.
