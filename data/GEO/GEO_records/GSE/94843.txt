TITLE
RNA-sequencing of murine norovirus (MNV) infection and loxoribine (Lox) stimulation in RAW264.7 macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to generate a comprehensive analysis of changes in the transcriptome following MNV infection. Furthermore, we aimed to perform a differential gene expression analysis between MNV infection and loxoribine (tlr7 agonist) treatment to delineate features of the host modified directly by the MNV as opposed to indirect changes induced through IFN signalling.

DESIGN
Transcript expression profiles of RAW264.7 cells mock infected, infected with MNV (MOI 5) or treated with loxoribine (1 mM) for 12 hrs were generated using Illumina NextSeq500.
