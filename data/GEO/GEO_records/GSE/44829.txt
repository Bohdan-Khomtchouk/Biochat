TITLE
Genome-wide  gene expression analysis of undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (mES),  neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (CMp) and adult mouse cardiomyocytes (CMa)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide  gene expression analysis at different stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation (undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells, neonatal mouse  cardiomyocytes and adult mouse cardiomyocytes). Results provide important information on the differential expressed genes between undifferentiated mouse embrionic stem cells (mES) and  mouse cardiomyocytes (CM) and also between cardiomyocytes from neonatal (CMp) and adult stages (CMa). This dataset allowed us to compare the expression profile of mES, CMp and CMa with the epigenetic profile of histone methylation generated with ChIP-seq experiments.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from biological triplicate of undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (mES), neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (CMp) and adult mouse cardiomyocytes (CMa)
