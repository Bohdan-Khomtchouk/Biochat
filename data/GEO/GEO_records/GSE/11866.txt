TITLE
Bortezomib inhibits mTOR pathway in multiple myeloma cells via induced expression of REDD1.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The combination of bortezomib and dexamethasone should become the reference induction treatment for multiple myeloma patients younger than 65 years. Pharmacogenomic profiles of genes involved in response to treatment may help to understand resistance. We performed gene expression profiling in 9 myeloma cell lines, incubated or not with bortezomib and dexamethasone for 6 hours. Supervised analysis identified significantly up regulated genes involved in stress responses. We focused on REDD1 a gene known to be rapidly induced by a wide variety of stress conditions and DNA damages. REDD1 expression was early and highly induced after bortezomib exposure. REDD1 induction was associated with the dephosphorylation of  P70 S6 ribosomal kinase (P70S6K), a key substrate of mTOR. These effects were dependent upon cell line. REDD1 was overexpressed within two hours in bortezomib resistant cell lines in association with a cell size decrease. In sensitive cell lines, neither REDD1 induction nor morphological changes occurred. RNA interference mediated inhibition of REDD1 induction abrogates P70S6K dephosphorylation, early transitory cell size reduction and enhances sensitivity to bortezomib - dexamethasone. Our results suggest that mTOR regulation could be a resistance mechanism mediated by REDD1 expression in myeloma cells.
