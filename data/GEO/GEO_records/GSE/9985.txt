TITLE
sua5D expression profiles

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To decipher the function of SUA5, we compare the expression profiles of sua5D and wildtype BY4742.  We also compared the expression profile changed during the passage of sua5D strain. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Sua5 disruptioin strains were obtained by tetrad dissection of a sua5D/SUA5 diploid strain.  The spores were restreaked on YPD plate for 12 times. Each restreaking is suggested to 25 generaions. The first restreaking, 12th restreaking and wildtype strains were compared. Four indepedent clones (First restreaking), three independent clones (12th restreaking), and three independent clones (wildtype control) were used.
