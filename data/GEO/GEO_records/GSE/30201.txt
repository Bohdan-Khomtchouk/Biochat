TITLE
Expression data of ribosomal proteins from sorted hematopoietic stems cells from patients with low risk MDS.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A role for reduced ribosomal protein gene dosage in both DBA and 5q- MDS suggests that other forms of MDS might also involve altered expression of ribosomal protein genes. We used microarrays to interrogate the expression of ribosomal proteins from purified hematopoietic stems cells from patients with low risk myelodysplastic syndrome and age-matched healthy controls.

DESIGN
Hematopoietic stem cells were sorted from 8 patients with low risk myelodysplastic syndrome and 11 age-matched healthy controls, and total RNA was  hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
