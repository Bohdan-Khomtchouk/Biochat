TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in influenza A infected human macrophages treated with VX-787

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in macrophages infected with influenza A virus or Mock and treated with the VX-787 to investigate the effects VX-787 have on transcriptional response in human macrophages.

DESIGN
Human macrophages were infected with influenza A/WSN/1933(H1N1) or A/Udorn/307/72(H3N2) viruses, or non-infected (Mock). 10nM VX-787 was treated to WSN, Udorn or Mock infected cells, repectively.
