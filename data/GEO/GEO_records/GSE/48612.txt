TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in jnk1-/-jnk2-/- immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts compared to wildtype counterparts co-cultivated with differentiating keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of JNK-dependent fibroblast-derived soluble factors at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that loss of c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1 and 2, JNK1 and JNK2, in MEFs causes a strong alteration of the gene expression program coding for soluble factors, which promote an efficient keratinocyte differentiation. Results provide important information of the repertoire of fibroblast transcripts encoding secreted proteins, which is severely disarranged upon loss of JNK activity under the in vitro co-culture conditions applied.

DESIGN
In vitro transwell co-culture experiments were performed using jnk1-/-jnk2-/- or wildtype immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and differentiating primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) over a time course of 6 days. Every second day, fibroblast-loaded inserts were changed resulting in 3 triads (triads 1, 2, and 3). Total RNA was obtained from jnk1-/-jnk2-/- and wildtype immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prior to co-cultivation (day 0) and of each triad 1, 2, or 3.
