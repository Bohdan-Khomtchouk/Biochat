TITLE
H3K36 mutations promote sarcomagenesis through genome-wide remodeling of H3K36 and H3K27 methylation [H31_ChIP-Rx]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to understand the genome-wide alterations in chromatin landscapy induced by a histone mutation (H3.3 K36M) derived from chondroblastomas

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different histone post-translational modifications in 2 cell types using drosophila chromatin as normalization control

PLATFORM
GPL21227 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Drosophila melanogaster; Mus musculus)
