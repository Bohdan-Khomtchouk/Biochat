TITLE
Over expression of mRNA for multiple genes including insulin in the PLN of NOD is associated with Islet Autoimmunity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify genes implicated in the early steps of the autoimmune process, prior to inflammation in type 1 diabetes. Early Insulin AutoAntibodies (E-IAA) have been used as subphenotypic marker to select individual animals as type 1 diabetes prone and to compare gene expression patterns with insulin autoantibody negative NOD. Variation of gene expression patterns in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) issued from E-IAA positive and negative mice have been analyzed by DNA microarrays

DESIGN
PLN were used from 5 weeks old NOD mice positive for Insulin Autoantibodies and compared with animals negative for Insulin AutoAntibodies
