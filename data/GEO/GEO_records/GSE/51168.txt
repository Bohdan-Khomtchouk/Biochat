TITLE
Time course gene expression profile of YPD medium grown Candida albicans mss11 mutant

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Candida albicans is an important fungal pathogen in humans. Several virulence factors of C. albicans have been reported, including a morphological transition from yeast to filamentous forms (hyphae and pseudohyphae). Mss11 is a transcriptional activator required for hyphal formation. To reveal the potential target genes of Mss11, DNA microarray analysis was performed to compare wild type and mss11-deleted mutant.

DESIGN
24 arrays was generated from same experiment. Wild type and mss11 mutant cells were incubated in 30 ËšC YPD medium, and were collected at different time points for RNA extraction. The differential expression of wild type and mutant at each time points was performed by 12 arrays including dye swap. The time course gene expression profile of both strain was performed by another 12 arrays.
