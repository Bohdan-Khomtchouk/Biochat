TITLE
Tet1 is a tumor suppressor of hematopoietic maligancy [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of Tet1 expression causes global 5mC and 5hmC changes in stem and progenitor cells in mice and causes enhanced Pro-B cell self-renewal, increased DNA damage and B-lymphomageneis. In this study we performed microarray analysis of total LSK cells from WT and Tet1 KO mice. These results revealed that genes regulated byTet1 in LSKs included Histones, DNA repair enzymes and B-lineage specific factors.

DESIGN
LSK cells were purified from the bone marrow of 6-month old WT and Tet1 KO mice . RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Microarray profiling of LSK cells in WT and Tet1 KO mice.
