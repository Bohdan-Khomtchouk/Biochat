TITLE
Transcriptomics of siCTRL, siNSUN2 and ALYREF-RIP HeLa cells, and multiple mouse tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from siCTRL, siNSUN2 and ALYREF-RIP HeLa cells, and multiple mouse tissues using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent by following the company manual. Approximately 2.5 µg of total RNA was then used for library preparation using a TruSeq™ RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.The libraries were sequenced using HiSeq3000 (Illumina) or HiSeq2500 in paired-read mode, creating reads with a length of 101 or 125 bp. Sequencing chemistry v2 or v4 (Illumina) was used.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expressive levels in siCTRL, siNSUN2 and ALYREF-RIP HeLa cells, and multiple mouse tissues
