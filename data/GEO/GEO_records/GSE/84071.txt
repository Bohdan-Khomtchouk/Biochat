TITLE
ChIP-on-chip from MDA-MB-231 cells with PHF1, CUL4B and PRMT5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It has been reported that PHF1, CUL4B and PRMT5 all play important roles in epigenetic regulation. We reported that PHF1, CRL4B and PRMT5 may act as a complex in transcriptional regulation and have a vital effect in breast cancer progression. So we performed ChIP-on-chip assays to find unique promoters co-targeted by PHF1, CUL4B and PRMT5. PHF1, CUL4B and PRMT5 have a predominant cooperation, at least in MDA-MB-231 cells.

DESIGN
comparison of PHF1, CUL4B and PRMT5 target genes
