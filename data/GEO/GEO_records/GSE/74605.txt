TITLE
Spatiotemporal characterization of the cellular and molecular contributors to liver fibrosis in a murine hepatotoxic-injury model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The interplay between the inflammatory infiltrate and tissue resident cell populations (e.g. epithelial cells, fibroblasts and macrophages) invokes fibrogenesis. However, the temporal and mechanistic contributions of these cell populations to fibrosis remain poorly defined. To address this issue, liver inflammation, ductular reaction (DR) and fibrosis were induced in C57BL/6 mice by thioacetamide (TAA) administration for up to 12 weeks. TAA treatment induced two phases of liver fibrosis.  A rapid peri-central inflammatory infiltrate enriched in F4/80+ monocytes co-localized with SMA+ myofibroblasts resulted in early collagen deposition, marking the start of an initial fibrotic phase (1-6 weeks).  An expansion of bone marrow derived macrophages proceeded a second phase, characterized by accelerated progression of fibrosis ( > 6 weeks) followed the migration of the DR from the portal tracts to the centrilobular site of injury, in association an increase in DR/macrophage interactions. Although CCL2 mRNA was rapidly induced in response to TAA, CCL2 deficiency only partially abrogated fibrosis. In contrast, CSF-1R blockade diminished CCR2neg (Ly6Clo) monocytes, attenuated the DR and significantly reduced fibrosis, illustrating the critical role of CSF-1 dependent monocyte/macrophage differentiation and linking the two phases of injury. We demonstrate that in response to liver injury, CSF-1 drives early monocyte mediated myofibroblast activation and collagen deposition, subsequent macrophage differentiation and their association with the advancing DR, the formation of fibrotic septa and the progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis.
