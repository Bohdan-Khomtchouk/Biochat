TITLE
Differential miRNA expression profiling of A549 cells infected with influenza A virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further understand the roles of miRNA during influenza A virus infection, we performed miRNA profiling in human alveolar adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549 cells, infected with influenza A virus A/Beijing/501/2009(H1N1) and A/goose/Jilin/hb/2003(H5N1).

DESIGN
A549 cells were either mock-infected or infected with influenza virus H1N1 or H5N1 at a MOI of 5. Total RNAs were isolated at 8 and 24 h post-infection and analysed for miRNA expression profiles. Each group was run in triplicate.
