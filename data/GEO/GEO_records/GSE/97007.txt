TITLE
Investigation of the Molecular Action of Actinorhodin

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Actinorhodin is a blue-pigmented, redox-active pigmented secondary metabolite that is produced by the bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. Although actinorhodin has been used as a model compound for studying secondary metabolism, its mechanism is not well understood. In this work, we have conducted a comprehensive chemical genetic investigation of actinorhodinâ€™s antibacterial effect on target organisms.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiles of actinorhodin-, H2O2-, and dioxane-treated Staphylococcus aureus were generated in duplicate using Illumina MiSeq platform.
