TITLE
Comparative DNA methylome analysis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma, uterine papillary serous carcinoma, and normal endometrium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Classically, there are two types of endometrial cancer, endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC), or Type I; and uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC), or Type II. These two types of cancers exhibit distinct DNA methylation levels in promoters of many genes. In EAC, many tumor suppressor genes were silenced due to DNA hypermethylation at their promoter region. However, promoters of many of these genes remained unmethylated in UPSC. Here, we described complete DNA methylome maps of endometrioid adenocarcinoma, uterine papillary serous carcinoma, and normal endometrium, by applying a combined strategy of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing (MRE-seq).

DESIGN
We took a complementary and orthogonal approach to identify DNA methylation changes unique to the two endometrial cancer subtypes in an unbiased fashion. We generated complete DNA methylome maps for endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC, three samples), uterine papillary serous carcinomas (UPSC, three samples), and normal endometrium (pooled samples) by integrating data from methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing (MRE-seq).
