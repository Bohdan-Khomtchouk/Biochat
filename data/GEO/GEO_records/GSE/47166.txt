TITLE
Expression data from adult Drosophila females [normoxia and IH]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
High-fat diet (HFD) in normoxia causes a worsened phenotype in adult female flies compared to regular diet (RD). Intermittent hypoxia (IH) causes an opposite phenotype both when flies are on RD in IH compared to normoxia and even more dramatically when on HFD in IH compared to HFD in normoxia. We used microarrays to examine the transcriptional changes occurring both on a HFD compared to RD in normoxia, and when IH is introduced.

DESIGN
Adult female Drosophila were collected at d3-5 and placed on RD or HFD and in normoxia or IH for 1 week. Following this week, flies were immediately frozen on dry ice, RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
