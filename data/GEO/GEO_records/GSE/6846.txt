TITLE
Gene Expression and Biological Processes Influenced By Deletion of Stat3 in pulmonary Alveolar Type II Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Deletion of Stat3 induced genes influencing protein metabolism, transport, chemotaxis and apoptosis and decreased the expression of genes mediating lipid synthesis and metabolism. Srebf1 and 2, key regulators of fatty acid and steroid biosynthesis, were decreased in Stat3D/D mice. Stat3 influenced both pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways, regulating and maintaining the balance between a subset of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes that determine cell death or survival. Akt, a known target of Stat3, participates in many Stat3 mediated pathways including Jak-Stat signaling, apoptosis, the MAPK signaling, cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. Deletion of Stat3 from type II epithelial cells altered the expression of genes regulating diverse cellular processes, including cell growth and apoptosis, lipid biosynthesis and metabolism. Stat3 regulates cell formation through a complex regulatory network that likely enhances alveolar epithelial cell survival and surfactant/lipid synthesis, necessary for the protection of the lung during injury. Keywords: genotype comparison

DESIGN
To better understand the roles and molecular mechanisms by which Stat3 influences gene expression in lung, the effect of cell-selective deletion of Stat3 (Stat3D/D) on genome wide mRNA expression profiles was determined in murine type II alveolar epithelial cells.  Differentially expressed genes were identified from Affymetrix Murine GeneChips analysis and subjected to gene ontology classification promoter analysis, pathway mapping and literature mining.
