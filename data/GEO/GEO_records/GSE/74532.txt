ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) for our hybrid cells. All two analyzed hybrid ES cell liness were chromosomally stable.

DESIGN
Two hybrid ES cell lines were conducted to aCGH analyses. Two CGH array platforms were used.
