TITLE
Human Adult Sorted Live Cell Erythroblasts transduced with Sigma shRNA Clone TRCN0000162889 targeting SLC25A39 with puromycin selection RNAseq.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Erythroblasts cultured from mobilized CD34+ cells from six healthy adult human donors were used to generate an erythroblast transcriptome transduced with Sigma shRNA Clone TRCN0000162889 targeting SLC25A39 gene. Cellular maturation was maintained including enucleation.  On culture day 14 total RNA was isolated (see PMID: 23798711 for details). These RNA-Seq profiles were generated after flow cytometric sorting (live cell gating of culture Day 14 erythroblasts according to forward and side scatter). Preliminary screening data demonstrated a robust increase in fetal hemoglobin that may be due to off-target effects from this shRNA clone. See Series GSE94147 for Empty Vector Control dataset.

DESIGN
Human CD34+ cells from health donor transduced with lentivirus expressing Sigma shRNA Clone TRCN0000162889 to knockdown SLC25A39 gene expression in serum free culture.  RNA extracted from sorted live cell gate on Day 14 using Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit.  1ug of RNA was used for library construction and Ribo depletion with globin subtraction.
