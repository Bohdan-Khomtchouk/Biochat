TITLE
Gene expression data of primary lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the clinical features in patients with lung cancer and identified genes differentially expressed between non-tumorous tissue and cancer  tissue of lung. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
A total of 100 surgical specimens of lung cancer tissues (63 adenocarcinomas, 22 squamous cell carcinomas, 10 large cell carcinomas, 3 small cell carcinomas, and 2 others) and corresponding non-tumor lung tissues were obtained from 37 female and 63 male patients who had consecutively undergone potentially curative resection at Chiba University Hospital. RNA was isolated from these specimens and gene expression profiles were analyzed using the AceGene Human Oligo Chip 30K Subset A.  For gene expression analysis of primary resected lung adenocarcinoma, we applied the expression data of 52 cases consisting of 32 adenocarcinoma and 20 non-adenocarcinoma cases. For gene expression analysis of primary resected lung squamous cell carcinoma, we applied the expression data of 52 cases consisting of 12 squamous cell carcinoma and 40 non-squamous cell carcinoma cases. For gene expression analysis of lymph node metastasis, we applied the expression data of 27 lung adenocarcinoma cases consisting of 12 lymph node-positive and 15 lymph node-negative cases.  For gene expression analysis of postoperative tumor recurrence, we applied the expression data of 40 lung adenocarcinoma cases consisting of 17 postoperative tumor recurrence, and 23 postoperative non-tumor recurrence cases.
