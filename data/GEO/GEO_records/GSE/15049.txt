TITLE
The cytokinin type-B response regulator PtRR13 is a negative regulator of adventitious root development in Populus

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
Adventitious root formation at the base of plant cuttings is an innate de novo organogenesis process that allows massive vegetative propagation of many economically and ecologically important species. The early molecular events following shoot excision are not well understood. Using whole-genome microarrays, we detected significant transcriptome remodeling during 48 hours following shoot removal in Populus softwood cuttings in the absence of exogenous auxin, with 27% and 36% of the gene models showing differential abundance between 0 and 6 hours, and 6 and 24 hours, respectively. During these two time intervals, gene networks involved in protein turnover, protein phosphorylation, molecular transport and translation were among the most significantly regulated. Transgenic lines expressing a constitutively active form of the Populus type-B response regulator PtRR13 (Î”DDKPtRR13) have a delayed rooting phenotype and cause misregulation of COV1, a negative regulator of vascularization; PDR9, an auxin efflux transporter; two AP2/ERF genes with sequence similarity to TINY1. Cytokinin action appeared to disrupt root development 24 hours after shoot excision, when root founder cells are hypothesized to be sensitive to the negative effects of cytokinin. Our results suggest that PtRR13 acts downstream of cytokinin to repress adventitious root formation in intact plants, and that reduced cytokinin signaling after shoot excision enables coordinated expression of ethylene, auxin and vascularization pathways leading to adventitious root development.
