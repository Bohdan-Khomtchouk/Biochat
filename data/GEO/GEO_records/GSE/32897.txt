TITLE
Chromosomal aberrations in ETV6/RUNX1 positive cases using high-resolution 244K oligo-based array-CGH

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of chromosomal deletion and duplications in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(12;21). This study was performed to correlate clinical parameters with chromosomal aberrations by array-CGH and to identify other potential novel cancer genes involved in leukaemia. In brief, PALL-6 was a Malay male diagnosed with B-ALL, had undergone a remission but late relapse and passed away. He was assessed under medium risk. PALL-7 is a Malay male and has a medium risk assessment, and is currently in remission. PALL-8 is a Malay female and has a medium risk assessment, and is currently in remission. PALL-9 is a Chinese male and has a high risk assessment, and is currently in remission. PALL-10 is a Malay male and has a standard risk assessment, had a relapse but is currently in remission. PALL-11 was a Malay male and had a medium risk assessment, but died during transplant.

DESIGN
array-CGH was carried out on 11 cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(12;21) diagnosed by molecular and FISH techniques. Commercial male and female genomic DNA were used as the references.
