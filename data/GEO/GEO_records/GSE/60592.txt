TITLE
RNA-seq characterization of an infection of Mycobacterium smegmatis by a cluster A4 mycobacteriophage

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis ; Mycobacterium phage Kampy

SUMMARY
We present transcriptomic analysis of an infection by a cluster A4 mycobacteriophage of its host, Mycobacterium smegmatis, at six time points (n = 2). Viral transcription is detectable 5 minutes into infection, and viral mRNA makes up the vast majority of all transcription by 30 minutes. Kampy, like many phages, has a genome organized into two arms bearing early- and late-phase genes. We identify two transcriptional start sites (TSSâ€™s) consistent with an early promoter driving expression of half of the genome, along with a second, late-stage promoter that becomes active around 30 minutes after the start of infection.

DESIGN
One timepoint before and five timepoints during infection were analyzed using an Ion Torrent PGM. Two biological replicates were sequenced for each timepoint.
