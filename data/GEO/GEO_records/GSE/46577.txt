TITLE
Interactions between Jag1 and Ddr1 in mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray gene expression experiments to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways in Jag1 conditional/null livers reveal up-regulation of many genes related to fibrosis and ECM interactions.

DESIGN
3 Jag1 conditional/null mutant mice versus 3 littermate wildtype control mice.
