TITLE
caArray_geral-00143: An estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer subset characterized by a hormonally regulated transcriptional program and response to androgen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clinical heterogeneity of esrtrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative [ER(-)/PR(-)] breast cancer (BC) suggests biological heterogeneity.  We performed gene expression analysis of primary BCs and BC cell lines to identify the underlying biology of ER(-)/PR(-) disease, define subsets, and identify potential therapeutic targets.
