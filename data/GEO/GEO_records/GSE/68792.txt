TITLE
Transcriptome profiling reveals that feeding live zooplankton to larval Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) influences suites of genes involved in oxidation-reduction, mitosis, and selenium homeostasis.

ORGANISM
Gadus morhua

SUMMARY
In this study, microarrays were used to investigate the larval cod transcriptome response to zooplankton supplementation in the diet.

DESIGN
The experiment consisted of three different feeding regimes/diets as follows: Treatment 1 (6 replicate tanks): rotifers/Artemia with Ori-Green (Skretting, USA) enrichment (RA) 3 feedings per day (9 am, 3 pm and 9 pm), with rotifers fed until the fish reached  ~ 9 mm [~ 30 days post-hatch (dph)].  Treatment 2 (4 replicate tanks): rotifers with Ori-Green enrichment, supplemented with 5-10% wild caught zooplankton (RA-Zoo: zooplankton were > 90% copepods) from 2 dph until 30 dph. Treatment 3 (6 replicate tanks): Rotifers/Artemia with Ori-Green enrichment 4 days per week and Rotifers/Artemia with protein hydrolysate (RA-PH) enrichment 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday),with rotifers fed until the fish reached ~ 9 mm. Whole larvae from each feeding regimes/diets were sampled when fish in particular treatment reached an average length of   ~ 9 mm. Individual DNAse-treated, column-purified total RNA samples from 8 fish per group (9 mm RA, 9 mm RA-PH and 9 mm RA-Zoo larvae) were used for microarray analysis using the Atlantic cod 20K oligonucleotide microarray platform (Booman et al. 2011) and a common reference experimental design.  On each array, RNA from an individual fish was hybridized together with a common reference RNA. All test samples were labeled with Cy5. The common reference was labeled with Cy3.
