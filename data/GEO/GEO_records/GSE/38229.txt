TITLE
aCGH was used to identify the overall genomic imbalances of SCC of the vulva in 14 patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The imbalances scored by arrayCGH mapped to different chromosomes with losses being more common than gains. Frequent losses of large chromosomal segments were scored from 3p and 8p whereas same-sized gains were frequent from 3q and 8q. This is the first study of vulvar tumors using arrayCGH, and some frequent imbalances could be defined precisely.

DESIGN
14 patients we analyzed without replicates against a commercial common reference.
