TITLE
Array CGH of Drosophila compound chromosomes on heterochromatin custom array.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Mapping the Drosophila melanogaster centromeric heterochromatin by CGH analysis of embryos lacking specific chromosomes or chromosome arms.

DESIGN
Nine chromosome or chromosome arm deletions were tested: embryos lacking the entire second chromosome (2En-), 2L (2L-), 2R (2R-), the entire third chromosome (3En-), 3L (3L-), 3R (3R-), the entire fourth chromosome (4En-), the X chromosome (X-), or both X and Y chromosomes (XY-). Control: Blastoderm stage wild type Oregon R embryos. For each experiment 100-150 embryos of the appropriate genotype were collected. DNA from randomly staged 0-8 hr wild type Oregon R embryos was used as reference for all experiments. Embryos with no X chromosome were obtained by crossing attached-X/Y females (C(1)DX, y f) to X/Y males. Embryos with no X and Y chromosomes were obtained by crossing attached-X/Y females (C(1)RM, y2suwawa) to attached-XY males (YSX YL, In(1)EN, y B). The compound II chromosomes RM(2L); RM(2R)=C(2)v and the compound III chromosomes RM(3L); RM(3R)=C(3)se were used to generate 2L- and 2R-, and 3L- and 3R- embryos, respectively. The compound II C(2)EN and compound III C(3)EN st1 cu1es stocks were used to generate embryos deficient for the entire second and third chromosome, respectively. The compound IV C(4)RM, ci1eyR/0 were used to generate embryos deficient for the fourth chromosome. Embryos deficient for chromosome 4 were identified by their defects in denticle belt patterning during late embryogenesis, whereas embryos deficient for other chromosome/chromosome arm were recognized based on their specific phenotypic defects during early embryonic development. All embryos were collected at room temperature.
