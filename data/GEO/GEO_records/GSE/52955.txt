TITLE
DNA Methylation Dynamics in Urological Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and tumoral urological tissues (Prostate, Kidney and Bladder). The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in urological fresh frozzen tissue samples. Samples included morphologically normal samples of each tissue and tumor samples. Kidney: 6 normal and 17 tumor samples; Bladder: 5 normal and 25 tumor samples; Prostate: 5 Normal and 25 tumor samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 83 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.
