TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in cultured eutopic and ectopic endometrial stromal cells (methylation)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profiles of genome-wide DNA methylation were investigated in isolated endometrial stromal cells from eutopic and ectopic endometrium. DNA methylation profiles were quite different between eutopic ESC and ectopic ESC, whereas no clear dfference were recognized between eutpic ESC with and without endometriosis.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from three cultured endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) from eutopic endometria without endometriosis, three ESCs with endometriosis and three ESCs from chocolate cysts were hybridised to the Illumina infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip.

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
