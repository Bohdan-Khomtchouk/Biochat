TITLE
WhiB6 regulation of ESX-1 gene expression is controlled by a negative feedback loop in Mycobacterium marinum

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium marinum

SUMMARY
WhiB6 is a transcription factor that regulates expression of genes encoding ESX-1 substrates. We found that in the absence of the genes encoding conserved membrane components of the ESX-1 system, the expression of the whiB6 gene and genes encoding ESX-1 substrates were reduced.

DESIGN
Comparison of M. marinum transcriptional profiles in WT M. marinum, an ochre mutant in the eccCb1 gene, a whiB6 deletion mutant and complemented strains.

PLATFORM
GPL21992 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mycobacterium marinum)
