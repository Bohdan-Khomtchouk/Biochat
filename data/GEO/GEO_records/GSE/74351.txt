TITLE
P300 ChIP-Seq analysis of PC3 cells treated with MnTE-2-PyP or not 24 hours prior to irradiation of 20 Gy.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify how MnTE-2-PyP affects p300 association to chromatin genome-wide, we performed a p300 chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay followed by Next Generation Sequencing on PC3 cells treated with or without MnTE-2-PyP one hour post-irradiation (Figure 3A). Based on the called peaks near genes, we predicted that HIF-1Î²and CREB transcription factors were associating DNA less in the presence of MnTE-2-PyP.

DESIGN
DNA was ChIP-Fixed from Pc3 cells treated with 20 Gy radiation and with and without T2E drug. There are 2 biological replicates of PC3 untreated cells and 3 biological replicates of PC3 cells treated with MnTE-2-PyP. There are two corresponding input samples for the biological replicates.

PLATFORM
