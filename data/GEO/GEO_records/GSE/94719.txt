TITLE
Novel surrogate markers for reflux esophagitis using exosomal microRNAs in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
There is no useful biomarker for reflux esophagitis. The aim of this study is to establish novel diagnosis marker for RE by using miRNA.

DESIGN
In this study, acid reflux esophagitis was induced in rats. Rats were killed day 21 (chronic phase) after induction of RE. Shapm operation rats were used as control. Exosomes were extracted from serum, and the expression patterns of serum miRNAs during the RE chronic phase were analyzed via microarray.
