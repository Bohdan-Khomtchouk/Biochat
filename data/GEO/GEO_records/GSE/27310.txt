TITLE
Slf1p and Sro9p affinity isolations

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To identify RNAs specifically associated with Slf1p and Sro9p, cells expressing TAP-tagged Slf1, Sro9 or Fpr1 (negative control) were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic complete medium and harvested by centrifugation. RNA affinity isolations were essentially performed as described (Gerber et al. 2004 PLoS Biol.). In brief, TAP-tagged protein were captured from cell extracts with IgG coupled agarose beads (Sigma) and released by incubation with a site-specific protease (AcTEV, Sigma). from the extract (input) and from the affinity isolates was purified with the RNeasy Mini/ Micro Kit (Qiagen). RNAs were reverse transcribed using a mixture of oligo-dT and random nonamer oligos in the presence of amino-allyl dUTP/dNTP mixture. cDNAs were fluorescently labeled and hybridized on yeast oligo microarrays over night at 42 degrees in formamide-based hybridization buffer.

DESIGN
Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments
