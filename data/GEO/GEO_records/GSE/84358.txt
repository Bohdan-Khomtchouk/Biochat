TITLE
RNA-seq of ASXL2 shRNA KD in SKNO-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) of Asxl2 knockdowned SKNO-1 cells to control SKNO-1 cells. We found substantial number of genes are differentially expressed in Asxl2 knockdowned cells.

DESIGN
SKNO-1 mRNA profiles of ASXL2 knockdowned and control cells were generated by deep sequencing, two differrent shRNA for ASXL2, in triplicate.
