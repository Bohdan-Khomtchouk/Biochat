TITLE
RNAseq analysis of the serotype M1 group A Streptococcus strain MGAS2221

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
We recovered RNA from exponential and stationary phase cell cultures of MGAS2221 and utilized two distinct methods to remove rRNA from our samples, the RiboZero kit from Epicenter, and the terminator- 5--Phosphate-Dependent Exonuclease (TEX).  This gave us 4 distinct RNAs with which we performed RNAseq analysis.  Both rRNA removal methods worked well, with only a small percentage of the final total read counts being derived from rRNA sequences.

DESIGN
A single group A Streptococcus strain was investigated.

PLATFORM
