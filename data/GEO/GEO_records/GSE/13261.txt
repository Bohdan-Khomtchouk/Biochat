TITLE
Direct comparison of HES2 ESC overexpressing CD30 variant with HES2 overexpressing GFP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HES2 ESC were infected with a lentivirus construct containing either CD30 (TNFRSF8) extracellular deficient variant or GFP, using the ViraPower™ Promoterless Lentiviral Gateway® Kits (Invitrogen).  HES2 cells were recovered and grown for 19 passages.  HES2 were commonly grown on Mouse Embryonic Feeder cells in the presence of KSOR media. Before collection of RNA, ES cells were FACs sorted with antibodies to GCMT-2 and CD9 to separate ES cells from differentiated cells and mouse feeders.  The experiment was repeated in triplicate.  The final aim was to deduce the effect of overexpressing the variant form of CD30 on gene expression in HES2 cells.

DESIGN
Three consecutive passages of HES2 cells over-expressing either CD30V or GFP were grown and subject to FACs sorting, collection and microarray.  A total of 6 samples, (3 replicates of these 2 populations) were used in the experiment.
