TITLE
Gene expression of LNCaP cells grown in androgen deprived conditions in the presence of 10nM insulin and/or 1nM R1881.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of LNCaP cell molecular differences and their response to insulin compared to control or R1881. Insulin differentially regulated genes, as did R1881, though the treatments had a very different profile, with some overlaps. These results provide insights into the effect of insulin on cancer related pathways in an androgen deprived setting.

DESIGN
4 treatment groups with biological replicates - EtOH (Control), Insulin 10nM+EtOH, R1881 1nM, R1881+ Insulin
