TITLE
Williams-Beuren syndrome: typical deletions versus atypical deletions of the 7q11.23 region

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have performed comparative transcriptome profile from lymphoblastoid cell lines from four Williams-Beuren syndrome patients and two patients with partial deletions of the region. The goal was to find deregulated genes specifically in WBS versus atypical deletions, and to determine the biological pathways affected in WBS patients.

DESIGN
6 samples were hybridized twice each: once labeled with Cy5 and once labeled with Cy3 (dye-swap). Each sample was hybridized against a pool of five controls of the same gender.
