TITLE
Analysis of genome rearrangements in S. cerevisiae strains with low levels of DNA polymerase alpha

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The arrays in this series were used to analyze chromosome rearrangements resulting from the repair of double-strand breaks at fragile site 2 (FS2) on S. cerevisiae chromosome III.  This site is broken under conditions of low DNA polymerase alpha, as described in Lemoine et al., Cell vol. 120, pp. 587-598 (2005).  Here, we have investigated the effect of mutations in Mre11p, Sae2p and Rad52p on the repair of these breaks.

DESIGN
In all arrays, total genomic DNA from the experimental strain is labeled with Cy5 and is competitively hybridized to the array with Cy3-labeled total genomic DNA from MS71, an isogenic reference strain.

PLATFORM
