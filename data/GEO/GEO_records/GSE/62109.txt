TITLE
miRNA expression data from CD73-positive Rods, Müler glia and E 17.5 Retinal Progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During retinal development, progenitor cells give rise to six different types of neurons, and one glial cell. This process requires the expression of genes that confer specific functions and identity to each cell. Previous works have reported the miRNAs expression profile in retina, but is still necessary to further define individual retinal cell populations profiles. We isolated postmitotic mice CD73-positive Rods,  Müller glial cells and Retinal Progenitors Cells (E17.5); we then analyzed their miRNA profile expression by microarrays.

DESIGN
Using wild type mice we FACS-isolated postmitotic CD73-positive Rods (posnatal day 5). We isolated primary Müller glia cultures from postnatal day 8 mice and retinal progenitors cells from E17.5 mouse embryos; we then sent the samples to the gene expression unit at Instituto de Medicina Genomica (INMEGEN), to analyze their miRNA profile expression by microarrays.
