TITLE
Molecular Characterization of Basal-like and Non-Basal-like Triple-Negative Breast Cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Triple-negative (TN) and Basal-like (BL) breast cancer definitions have been used interchangeably to identify breast cancers that lack expression of the hormonal receptors (HR) and overexpression and/or amplification of HER2. However, both classifications when compared to each other, show substantial discordance rates. Here, we molecularly characterize TN tumors, and Basal-like tumors, and compare and contrast the results in terms of common patterns and distinct patterns for each.  In total, when testing 412 TN and 473 Basal-like tumors, 21.4% and 31.5% were identified as non-Basal-like and non-TN, respectively. TN tumors identified as Luminal or HER2-enriched showed undistinguishable overall gene expression profiles when compared versus Luminal or HER2-enriched tumors that were not TN. Similar findings were observed within Basal-like tumors regardless of the TN status. Interestingly, most TN tumors identified as HER2-enriched showed low HER2 expression and lack of HER2 amplification despite the similar overall gene expression profiles to HER2-E tumors that were not TN. Lastly, additional genomic classifications are examined within TN and Basal-like cancers, most of which are largely concordant with tumor intrinsic subtype. These results suggest that future clinical trials focused on TN disease should consider stratifying patients based on Basal-like versus non-Basal-like gene expression profiles as this appears to be the main biological difference seen within TN breast cancer patients.
