TITLE
Expression profiling of IL6 and Myc TG mouse plasmacytoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify differentially expressed genes in mouse IL6 and Myc double TG plasmacytoma, total RNAs from mouse plasmacytoma generated from IL6 + Myc TG mice were applied to NIAID mouse gene expression arrays. The transcriptome in IL6+ Myc TG mouse PCT was compared to transcriptome in IL6 TG mouse PCT

DESIGN
Eleven set of IL6+Myc TG PCTs and ten set of IL6 TG PCTs were used. Total RNAs from each mouse labelled with Cy3, and reference RNAs labeled with Cy5 were hybridzed to spotted oligomicroarray.
