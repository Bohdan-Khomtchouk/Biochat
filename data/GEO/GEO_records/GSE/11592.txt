TITLE
Mammary gene expression profile of goats receiving high or low forage diets supplemented or not with lipids

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Animal nutrition considerably affects milk composition that influences its nutritional quality. Milk component synthesis and secretion by the mammary gland involve the expression of a large number of genes whose nutritional regulation remains poorly defined. In this study, 16 lactating goats received 4 experimental diets differing in either forage to concentrate ratio (high forage, HF, or low forage, LF) supplemented, or not, with lipids (whole rapeseeds, RS, or sunflower oil, SO) in a 4 x 4 Latin Square design. To investigate the pathways regulated by nutrition, we examined the effect of these diets on the expression of approximately 8400 genes in caprine mammary gland using a bovine oligonucleotide microarray.
