TITLE
miR-139-5p induced gene expression alteration in glioma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate gene expression alteration following miR-139-5p transfection in glioma cells. We find a significant downregulation of two transcriptional factors, E2F3 and HoxA9.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from U87, LN229 and U251 glioma cells transfected with miR-139-5p or miRNA negative control.
