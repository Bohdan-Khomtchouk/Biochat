TITLE
Gene expression in hepatocytes isolated from diet-induced obesity mice treated with anti-VLA-4 blocking antibody.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression pattern of hepatocytes isolated from lean and diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Genes increased > 2-fold in DIO mice were further filtered based on > 2-fold change between hepatic gene expression from DIO mice treated with anti-VLA-4 and those with IgG

DESIGN
Six-week-old male wild-type C57BL/6 mice were fed a standard or high-fat diet for 16 weeks. After 10 weeks of high-fat diet feeding, mice were treated intraperitoneally with anti-VLA-4 blocking antibody or control IgG twice a week for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks of treatment, Hepatcoytes were isolated by collagenage digestion of livers from overnight fasted mice.
