TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles of 4 CRC PDX models treated by RSPO3 antagonist.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RSPO is a WNT pathway activator and functions as a potent regulator of stem cell growth in colon. RSPO family members were produced by several human tumors representing multiple tumor types including ovarian, pancreatic, colon, breast and lung cancer.  Specific monoclonal antibody antagonists of RSPO family members were developed. In human patient-derived tumor xenograft models, anti-RSPO treatment markedly inhibited tumor growth either as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore, blockade of RSPO signaling reduced the tumorigenicity of cancer cells based on serial transplantation studies. In order to assess the impact of RSPO3 inhibition and gain insight in the anti-RSPO3 treatment mechanism of action, the global gene expression profiles of 4 human colorectal cancer patient derived models (PDX) were performed using Affymetrix microarray for the xenografts treated by the anti-RSPO3 antibody.

DESIGN
4 CRC PDX models were treated by control anbodies, anti-RSPO3 antibodies, or anti-RSPO3 antibodies combined with standard-of-care. 4 weeks after the treatment, tumors were harvesed for the microarray analysis
