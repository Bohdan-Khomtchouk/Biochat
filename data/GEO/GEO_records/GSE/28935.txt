SUMMARY
Dr. Wong's laboratory is interested in examining if and how the absence of prion protein expression could affect the cellular glycosylation enzymes during development.

DESIGN
Prion protein is a glycoprotein and changes in glycosylation on the protein have been implicated in the pathogenic process. Our objective is to examine if and how the absence of prion protein expression could affect the cellular glycosylation enzymes during development. To do this, we proposed to compare and contrast the expression profile of the glycosylation enzymes in control and prion protein knockout mouse brain at the age of 2 and 82 weeks (n=3). RNA preparations from control and prion protein knockout mice brain of age ~2 and 82 weeks were sent to the Microarray Core (E).  The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to GLYCOv3 microarrays.
