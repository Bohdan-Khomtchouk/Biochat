TITLE
Tie-2 expressing monocytes (TEM) expression data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TEM differentiated in vitro were exposed to treatments  increasing or decreasing their proangiogenic activity. We used microarrays to identify the genes differentially expressed among the treatments and associated to changes in TEM proangiogenic and protumoral functions.

DESIGN
TEM were exposed  2 hours to the treatments, washed, kept for 30h in culture and used for RNA extraction.
