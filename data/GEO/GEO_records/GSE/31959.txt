TITLE
MicroRNAs expression in 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg3-induced anti-angiogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The angio-suppressive effect of 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3-R) has been previously demonstrated, and microRNAs (miRNAs) are a vital group of small non-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional modulator of gene expression. Thus, using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as model, we compared the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced cells with the profile of the cell co-treated with VEGF and Rg3-R. Among the screened 553 human miRNAs, 6 up-regulated (miR-520h, miR-487b, miR-197, miR-524*, miR-342 and miR-219) and 3 down-regulated (miR-23a, miR-489 and miR-377) miRNAs were detected in Rg3-R treated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced HUVECs compared to VEGF alone. Real time RT-PCR was subsequently performed to verify the miRNA microarray result.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment: VEGF-induced HUVEC and VEGF-induced HUVEC treated with Rg3-R. Three independent microarray experiments, with triplicate per microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL8991 NcodeTM Multi-Species miRNA Microarray V2
