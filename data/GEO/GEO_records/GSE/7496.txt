TITLE
Transcription profiling of rat colonic mucosa at different time points following Salmonella infection

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Salmonella enteritidis is suggested to translocate in the small intestine. Previously we identified that prebiotics, fermented in the colon, increased Salmonella translocation in rats, suggesting involvement of the colon in translocation. Effects of Salmonella on colonic gene expression in vivo are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize time dependent Salmonella induced changes of colonic mucosal gene expression in rats using whole genome microarrays. Rats were orally infected with Salmonella enteritidis to mimic a foodbore infection and colonic gene expression was determined at day 1, 3 and 6 post-infection (n=8 per timepoint). Agilent rat whole genome microarray (G4131A Agilent Technologies) were used. Results indicate that colon is clearly a target tissue for Salmonella considering the abundant changes in mucosal gene expression observed. Keywords: Time point infection study, colon mucosa, Rat
