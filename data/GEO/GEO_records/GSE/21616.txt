TITLE
Array CGH with DNA extracted from Candida albicans strains 3153A and its derivative Sor55, which is monosomic for chromosome 5

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Goal of this experiment was to confirm the proposed monosomy condition of chromsome 5 genes in the mutant Sor55

DESIGN
Different batches of total DNA were prepared from the parental strain 3153A and its derivative Sor55. Hybridization included different combinations of two independent batches of DNA from 3153A or Sor55, as well as one dye-swap. Parental/mutant ratio data was analyzed.
