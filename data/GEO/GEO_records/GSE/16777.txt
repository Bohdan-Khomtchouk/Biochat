TITLE
Discrimination of Tumorigenic Triazole Conazoles from Phenobarbital by Transcriptional Analyses of Mouse Liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to apply transcriptional analyses to hepatic tissues from mice exposed to PB, propiconazole (Pro) or triadimefon (Tri) at tumorigenic exposure levels to reveal similarities and differences in response among these treatments.The goal of this study was to apply transcriptional analyses to hepatic tissues from mice exposed to PB, propiconazole (Pro) or triadimefon (Tri) at tumorigenic exposure levels to reveal similarities and differences in response among these treatments.

DESIGN
Briefly, male CD-1 mice received propiconazole (2500 ppm), tridimefon (1800 ppm), or phenobarbital (850 ppm) in the feed or, control feed for periods of 4 and 30 days. This resulted in an average daily intake of 349.6 ± 46.7 of propiconazole, 257.1 ± 33.5  of tridimefon or 97.2 ± 5.9 mg/kg/day of phenobarbital.
