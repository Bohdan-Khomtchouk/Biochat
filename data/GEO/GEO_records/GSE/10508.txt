TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of HTLV-1 Tax-transformed T cell line Tesi in absence and presence of Tax

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Tesi system allows analysis of HTLV-1 Tax's impact on the transcriptome of a human CD4+ T-cell which is not derived from leukemia but directly from normal human lymphocytes. By comparing cells with and without Tax, one can specifically filter for celluar genes that are either activated or repressed in the presence of Tax. Keywords: cell type comparison, Tax
