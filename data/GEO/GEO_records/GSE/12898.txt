TITLE
Technical Analysis of Fundulus heteroclitus cDNA Microarrays, experiment B

ORGANISM
Fundulus heteroclitus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the relationship between the amount of mRNA and the fluorescent signal from the microarray hybridizations. In addition, we measured expression for differences in RNA labeling and for the day on which RNA is prepared. Keywords: Gene expression

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, number of rounds of RNA amplification and the day on which it was prepared.  Four replicates per gene per array.
