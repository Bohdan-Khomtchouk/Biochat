TITLE
Gene expression profiling in left cardiac ventricles of C57Bl/6J and C57Bl/6N male mice treated for 48 h with angiotensin II 500 ng/kg/min.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of angiotensin II effect on left ventricle at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that angiotensin II treatment may affect gene expression in left ventricle in a strain specific manner. Results provide important information about which genes respond to angiotensin II in C57Bl/6N male mice compared to their C57Bl/6J counterparts.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated left ventricles from C57Bl/6J and C57Bl/6N mice subjected to 48 hours of angiotensin II infusion, via osmotic mini-pumps (500ng/kg/h) implanted sub-cutaneously, compared to sham operated controls.
