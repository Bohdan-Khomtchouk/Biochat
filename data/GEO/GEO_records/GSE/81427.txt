TITLE
Acetylation enhances TET2 function in protecting against abnormal DNA methylation during oxidative stress [A2780 TET2KD damage 3h - methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of A2780 cells 1) infected with control virus, no H2O2 (Scr_mock), 2) infected with control virus with H2O2 treatment (30 min plus 2.5 h resting) (Scr_H2O2), 3) infected with shTET2 virus, no H2O2 (shTET2_mock), and 4) infected with shTET2 virus, with H2O2 treatment  (30 min plus 2.5 h resting) (shTET2_H2O2, two biological replicates). The Illuminaâ€™s Infinium Human Methylation450 Beadchip Kit (WG-314-1001) was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs.
