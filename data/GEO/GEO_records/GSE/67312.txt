TITLE
Patient-derived primary xenografts in the preclinical development of novel targeted therapies for bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: While molecular targeted therapy has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers, little progress has been made in the development of novel therapies for muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Here we report on the establishment and characterization of patient-derived primary MIBC xenografts

DESIGN
Tumor fragments derived from 7 patients with MIBC were grafted under the renal capsule of NOD-SCID mice and subsequently transplanted to further mice over multiple generations. Patient tumor and xenograft tissue were processed for analysis of , gene expression by microarray, and expression of select potential target pathways by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
