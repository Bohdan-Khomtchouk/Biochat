TITLE
Patient-derived primary xenografts in the preclinical development of novel targeted therapies for bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: While molecular targeted therapy has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers, little progress has been made in the development of novel therapies for muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Here we report on the establishment and characterization of patient-derived primary MIBC xenografts
