TITLE
C. elegans heat stress time course

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We sought to study the effect of heat stress on gene expression in C. elegans.  We cultured CF512 animals to adulthood at 25C (at which they are sterile).  We then induced heat stress by switching the culture temperature to 30C. Keywords: time-course
