TITLE
Gene expression profile of NPTr cells infected with swine H1N1/2009 influenza A virus

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In order to identify the swine genes which play roles in the regulation of swine influenza A virus replication, the gene microarray was performed to explore the systematical host response to the swine H1N1/2009 influenza A virus infection in porcine cells.

DESIGN
Two pools of total RNA were extracted from the swine H1N1/2009 influenza A virus infected or uninfected NPTr cells and hybrided on Affymetrix  Porcine genome array Array.

PLATFORM
GPL3533 [Porcine] Affymetrix Porcine Genome Array
