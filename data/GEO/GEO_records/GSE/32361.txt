TITLE
Gene expression biomarkers provide sensitive indicators of in planta nitrogen status in Maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
We have characterized the transcriptional response in Maize under limiting and sufficient nitrogen conditions, and have identified a set of genes whose expression profiles can quantitatively assess the response of plants to those conditions.

DESIGN
Four lines, three timepoints, multiple treatments, and three biological replicates for a total of 90 samples. Genotypes : Four Monsanto proprietary Zea mays lines were used, designated Line1, Line2, Line3 and Line4 N02: (Limiting Nitrogen) grown for 28 days to V6 stage with 2mM ammonium nitrate N20: (Sufficient Nitrogen) grown for 21 days to V6 stage with 20mM ammonium nitrate N02T20: (Limiting Nitrogen Supplemented) grown for 28 days to V6 with 2mM ammonium nitrate followed by application of 20mM ammonium nitrate applied at 8AM (and sampled at 10AM, 11PM on the same day, and 10AM the following day) Sampling Times: Day1@10AM, Day1@11PM. Another sample was taken at Day2@10AM (the following day) for Line4 and for all the Nitrogen Supplemented (N02T20) samples of all lines. Development Stage: V6 stage (21 days for sufficient nitrogen treatment and 28 days for limiting nitrogen treatment.  Planting was staggered so all sampling was done on the same days.) Plants were grown in green house.  Leaf tissue from 4 plants were combined to form each replicate.
