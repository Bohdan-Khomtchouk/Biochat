TITLE
A novel BRAT1–BRP1 complex recognizes histone acetylation and mediates active DNA demethylation and transcriptional activation in Arabidopsis [BS-Seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Active DNA demethylation is an important epigenetic phenomenon in many eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ROS1, a 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase, is responsible for active DNA demethylation via a base excision repair process. Here, we found that Bromodomain and ATPase domain-containing protein 1 (BRAT1) associates with BRP1 (BRAT1 Partner 1) and forms a tight BRAT1–BRP1 complex required for DNA demethylation. To identify hypermethylated loci at the whole-genome level in brat1, brp1, and ros1, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing.

DESIGN
Compare the DNA methylation profiles of 10-day old seedlings materials of mutants (brat1, brp1, and ros1) to wild type by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing.
