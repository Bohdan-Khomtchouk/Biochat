TITLE
ChIP-chip of histone variants and modifications in S. pombe WT and various mutants

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip of histone variants and modifications in A. thaliana WT and various mutants

DESIGN
In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, H2AZ, H3, H3 acetylated, H3K36me3, H3K4me3 as well as RNAPII (along with associated DNA sequences) were immunoprecipitated. The ChIPs were performed in duplicate from WT cells as well as in few mutants as described below. The extracted DNA was hybridized to a DNA microarray containing an average of 4 probes per kilobase across the whole yeast genome. The combined datasets are available in the supplemental files of the related publication.

PLATFORM
GPL16218 Agilent-015424 S. pombe Whole Genome ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 4x44K (Feature Number version - A_86_Pnnnn probes)
