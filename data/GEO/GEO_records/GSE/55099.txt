TITLE
microRNA expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cell in patients with type 1 diabetes  compared with normal controls.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a common autoimmune disease mediated by autoimmune attack against pancreatic b cells. It has been reported that dys-regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including T1D. This study sought to identify T1D associated miRNAs in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC).

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear of newly diagnosed type1 diabetes patients and normal controls were purified by LymphoprepTm gradient purification according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) for futher microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL8786 [miRNA-1] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-1 Array
