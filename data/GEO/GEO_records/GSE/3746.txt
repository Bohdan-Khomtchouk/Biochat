Circadian skeletal muscle_wt and Clock mutants

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
One hundred ninety wildtype male C57BL/6J mice age 7-10 weeks were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and entrained to a 12:12 light:dark cycle for 2 weeks. Mice were placed in light-tight boxes on a 12:12 LD cycle for 4 weeks, then released into constant darkness. Starting 30 hours after entry into DD (CT18), the left leg muscle from 5 wildtype mice, and the right leg muscle from the same wildtype mice were collected every 4 hours for 48 hours, for a total of 12 timepoints.  Total RNA from each side (left or right) were separately pooled to make a single sample for amplification and hybridization.  Therefore, duplicate arrays (from left and right side) were performed at each time point. At timepoints 34 through 58 hours in DD, tissues from age-matched male C57BL/6J Clock/Clock homozygous mutant mice that had been treated with the same light entrainment protocol as the wildtype were collected. Tissues were collected from 5 Clock/Clock mutants at each timepoint except for 34 and 46 hours after the onset of DD, when tissues from 10 Clock/Clock mice were collected. As for the wildtype mice, right and left sides were collected, prepared, amplified, and hybridized in separate pools. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the optic nerves were severed in complete darkness; brain dissection was performed using illumination from an infrared viewer (FJW Industries, Palatine, IL). SCNs were dissected out, pooled at a density of 5 per tube in 100 ?l RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX), frozen on dry ice, and stored at â€“80?C until use. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
duplicates consisted of pools from independent mice
