TITLE
The role of aquaporin-3 (AQP3) in functions of alveolar macrophage (AM) during ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the gene expression profiles of AMs using microarray analysis between AMs from wild-type (WT) and AQP3-deficient (AQP3-/-) mice before and after OVA challenge

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from AMs of WT and AQP3-/- mice before and after OVA challenge. We prepared 4-6 mice for each group and pooled their samples.

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
