TITLE
Dual RNA-seq of parasite and host reveals gene expression dynamics during filarial worm-mosquito interactions

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
Parasite biology, by its very nature, cannot be understood without integrating it with that of the host, nor can the host response be adequately explained without considering the activity of the parasite. However, due to experimental limitations, molecular studies of parasite-host systems have been predominantly one-sided investigations focusing on either of the partners. Here we conduct a joint dual RNA-seq time course analysis of filarial parasite and host mosquito to better understand the parasite processes underlying development in, and interaction with, the host tissue from the establishment of infection to the emergence of infective-stage larva. Using the Brugia malayi-Aedes aegypti system, we report the parasite gene transcription dynamics, which exhibit a highly ordered developmental program consisting of a series of cyclical and state-transitioning temporal patterns.  And, we contextualize these parasite data in relation to the concurrent dynamics of the host transcriptome. Comparative analyses using uninfected tissues and different host strains reveal the influence of parasite development on the host gene transcription as well as the influence of host environment on the parasite gene transcription. Furthermore, we critically evaluate the life-cycle transcriptome of B. malayi by comparing developmental stages in the mosquito relative to those in the mammalian host, providing insight into gene expression changes underpinning the mosquito-borne parasitic lifestyle of this heteroxenous parasite.

DESIGN
Time-course mRNA profiles of filarial parasite Brugia malayi and host mosqutio Aedes aegypti were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx.
