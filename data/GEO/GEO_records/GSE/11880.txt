TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in Df(2R)ED3921 (hmgd/z deficiency) and Df(2R)ED50000 (hmgd deficiency) strains

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We analysed the effect of the deficiency Df(2R)ED3921 and Df(2R)ED50000 on gene expression in embryos (stage 0-11), and wing imaginal discs and brains from 3rd instar larvae. Df(2R)ED3921 and Df(2R)ED50000 were described in Ragab et al. (2005) Genetics 172:1069-1078 2005.
