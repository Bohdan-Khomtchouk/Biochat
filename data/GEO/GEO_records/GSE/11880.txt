TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in Df(2R)ED3921 (hmgd/z deficiency) and Df(2R)ED50000 (hmgd deficiency) strains

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We analysed the effect of the deficiency Df(2R)ED3921 and Df(2R)ED50000 on gene expression in embryos (stage 0-11), and wing imaginal discs and brains from 3rd instar larvae. Df(2R)ED3921 and Df(2R)ED50000 were described in Ragab et al. (2005) Genetics 172:1069-1078 2005.

DESIGN
RNA from Df(2R)ED3921 and Df(2R)ED50000 embryos was compared to a pool of RNA extracted from wild-type embryos at the same stage. For each genotype, 4 independent biological replicates were performed (2 of these dyes swapped with respect to the other two). The same experimental protocol and genotypes were used for the analysis in dissected wing imaginal discs and brains from 3rd instar larvae.
