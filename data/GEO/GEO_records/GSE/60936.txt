TITLE
Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Plants capture solar energy and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through photosynthesis, which is the primary component of crop yield, and needs to be increased considerably to meet the growing global demand for food. Environmental stresses, which are increasing with climate change, adversely affect photosynthetic carbon metabolism (PCM) and limit yield of cereals such as rice (Oryza sativa) that feeds half the world. To study the regulation of photosynthesis, we developed a rice gene regulatory network and identified a transcription factor HYR (HIGHER YIELD RICE) associated to PCM, which on expression in rice enhances photosynthesis under multiple environmental conditions, determining a morpho-physiological program leading to higher grain yield (GY) under normal, drought and high temperature stress conditions. We show HYR is a master regulator, directly activating photosynthesis genes, cascades of transcription factors and other downstream genes involved in PCM and yield stability under drought and high temperature environmental stress conditions. To assess the role of increased HYR expression in rice, whole-genome microarrays were used to generate gene expression profiles of rice cultivar Nipponbare transformed with an overexpression construct of the HYR gene (Loc_Os03g02650) under control of the CaMV 35S promoter, along with control wild-type (WT) lines.

DESIGN
Two biological replicate samples each from the HYR and WT-control lines were profiled using rice whole-genome microarrays.
