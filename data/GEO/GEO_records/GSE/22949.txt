TITLE
Cannabinoid Receptor 1 Dependent Effects of Isopropoyl dodeycl fluorophosphonate on Hepatic Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We tested the effects of isopropoyl dodecyl fluorophosphonate (IDFP) (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a pharmacological inhibitor of endocannabinoid degradation, on hepatic gene expression in mice. To determine if increased cannabinoid receptor 1 signaling is responsible for IDFP induced effects a subset of mice were pretreated with the cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist (AM251) (10 mg/kg, i.p.).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from liver of mice treated with DMSO (n=6), IDFP (n=8), or AM251/IDFP (n=5) (all 10 mg/kg i.p.) for 4 hours.
