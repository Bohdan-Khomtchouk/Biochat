TITLE
Identifying DEK-dependent transcriptional signatures in HPV+ and HPV- head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the first RNA-Seq experiments profiling the effects of DEK loss in HNSCC. Our data also incorporates HPV+ and HPV- tumors to idenfity HPV-dependent and -independent gene signatures.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq of DEK-dependent gene signatures in HNSCC cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
