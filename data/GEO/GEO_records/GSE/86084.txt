TITLE
Polycomb-mediated axial patterning requires nucleosome compaction [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We determined the genome-wide binding profiles of wild type and compaction mutant CBX2 (denoted as 'KRA') in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) by ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
CBX2 ChIP in two mESC lines.
