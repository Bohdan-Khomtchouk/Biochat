TITLE
An In Vitro Versus In Vivo Toxicogenomics Investigation of Pre-natal Exposures to Tobacco Smoke [Epiairway]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lab-grown human bronchial epithelium model (Epiairway) was exposed to cigarette smoke or filtered air. RNA was harvested from the Epiairway tissue and underwent transcriptomic analysis.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Cigarette smoke vs. filtered air. 4 biological replicates for each condition of lab-grown human bronchial epithelium model (Epiairway).
