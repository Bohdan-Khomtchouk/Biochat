TITLE
Blastocyst Formation

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In this study we aimed to examine the effect of alternative in vivo and in vitro culture conditions during the time of blastocyst formation on the transcriptome profile of bovine blastocysts.

DESIGN
Two different blastocyst groups were produced. The first group (Vitro_morula) was matured, fertilized and cultured in vitro until morula stage then transferred to synchronized recipients and blastocysts were collected at day 7 by uterine flushing. The second group (Vivo_morula) was matured, fertilized and cultured in vivo until morula stage then flushed out and cultured in vitro until day 7. Complete in vitro (IVP) and in vivo blastocysts were produced and used as controls.
