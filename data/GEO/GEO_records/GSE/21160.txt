TITLE
microRNA changes during pDC activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify microRNA changes during plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC) activation, we stimulated human primary PDCs with 10ug/ml R837 (Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA) for 4 hours.

DESIGN
Purified human pDCs were divided into two parts: one was cultured with medium alone, another was cultured with R837. 4 hours later, cells were collected and total RNA was extracted for the TaqManÂ® Human MicroRNA Arrays. The experiment was duplicated (sample1 and sample2).
