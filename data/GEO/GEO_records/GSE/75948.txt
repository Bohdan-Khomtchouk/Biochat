TITLE
Genome-wide maps of SIX1, SIX2, and active loci in human fetal kidneys generated from ChIP-seq data.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SIX2 is expressed by the self-renewing nephron progenitors in the human fetal kidney. We have also discovered that SIX1 is expressed in nephron progenitor population of the human fetal kidney, which is in contrast to the mouse. We performed ChIP-seq  of SIX1 and SIX2 in order to identify the target genes of each factor and compare the role that each factor plays in transcriptional regulation of the nephron progenitors. We additionally performed ChIP-seq for p300 and H3K27ac in order to identify active loci and complement the transcription factor data.

DESIGN
Microdissection techniques were used to isolate cells from the renal cortex of the human fetal kidney at 16-17 weeks of gestation.  Specific antibodies for SIX, SIX2, p300 & H3K27ac were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation, and the recovered DNA subjected to high-throughput sequencing.
