TITLE
Development of gene expression profile for a seasonal variation study in a natural population of Riba-Roja, in the Ebro River, Spain

ORGANISM
Dreissena polymorpha

SUMMARY
To analyze the impact of seasonal and environmental variations on the physiology and metabolism of zebramussel, we use a custom microarray developed in our laboratory, using 4057 publicly availabe DNA sequences from Dreissena and other realted genera. Transcriptome profiles were analyszed using half-body samples captured in  Riba Roja (low Ebro River), a location considered relatively free of chemical pollution, at three different stages of the vital cycle. The results showed a clear separation on transcriptome profiles between samples collected in February and June (pre- and spawning, respectively) and samples collected during gonad resorption (September). A total of 753 transcripts changed significantly their mRNA levels during these three months (ANOVA p < 0.01, fc Â±1.5). These changes could be considered as response to variations of temperature, reproductive stages, as well as food availability. Genes involved in oxidative stress were overrepresented in September, whereas genes related to reproductive functions were overrrepresented in the spawning and pre-spawning period.

DESIGN
For each season (February: pre-spawning; June: Spawning; September: gonad resorption) it was used 2 biological replicates using the half body as a target tissue to analyze .
