TITLE
Molecular phenotyping of a test compound (small-molecule neurotransmitter receptor antagonist) in primary human hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of 917 pathway repoter genes were determined by AmpliSeq-RNA in primary human hepatocytes treated with Diclofenac and a test compound 3 hours after treatment.

DESIGN
Vehicle control, diclofenac, and three doses of the test compound (small-molecule neurotransmitter receptor antagonist) were applied to three primary cell lines, with three biological replicates in each group. In some treatment groups read-outs were only available for two samples. All together 41 samples were profiled.
