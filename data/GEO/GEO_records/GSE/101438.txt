TITLE
Expression profiling of human ILCreg cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of global gene expression levels of human ILCreg cells

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling using sorted human ILCreg cells. For human ILCregs, lymphocytes were isolated from human normal intestinal tissues from resected small intestines and Lin-CD45+ cells were then enriched by MACS (Lin=CD2, CD3, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD56, CD235a). Enriched cells were stained with Lineage cocktail, anti-CD45, and anti-CD127 antibodies followed by intracellular staining of IL-10. Lin-CD45+CD127+IL-10+ cells were isolated and subjected to RNA extraction.
