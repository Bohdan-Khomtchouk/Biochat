TITLE
Caffeine-regulated transcripts in mouse hearts are p27-dependent

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Overall question: How does caffeine administration for 10 days with the drinking water change the transcriptome of the heart? Are these changes dependent on the protein p27? Results: 242 of the 245 transcripts  differentially regulated after caffeine administration in wildtype animals are p27 dependent, since they are not changed in p27-deficient littermates. Among the most highly enriched gene ontology (GO) categories for biological processes are GO-terms describing pathways, which take place in the mitochondria.

DESIGN
Hearts from 4 groups of mice (wt, p27 -/-, wt with caffeine in drinking water for 10 days, p27 -/- with caffeine in drinking water for 10 days), 3 animals per group (one p27-/- untreated control sample had to be disclosed from statistical analysis after failing hybridization QC)
