TITLE
Exon Level Expression Profiling: a Novel Unbiased Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of the effect of RECTAS on fibroblast cells derived from a familial dysautonomia patient.

DESIGN
We analyzed fibroblast derived from FD patient (3 control (treated with 0.1% DMSO) and 3 treated (treated with 2 ÂµM RECTAS)) using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No techinical replicates were performed.

PLATFORM
