TITLE
[E-MTAB-612] GENCODE PCR-Seq Batch I

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As part of the ENCODE consortium the GENCODE project is producing a reference gene set through manual and automated gene prediction. Selected transcript models are verified experimentally by RT-PCR amplification followed by sequencing. This is the RNASeq part of batch I, based on annotation from July 2008 (without pseudogenes).
