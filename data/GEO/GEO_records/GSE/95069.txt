TITLE
Differential expression analysis of haploid, diploid, and tetraploid yeast experimentally evolved in raffinose medium

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Haploid, diploid, and tetraploid yeast were experimentally evolved in 2% raffinose medium. After 250 generations, we assessed the gene expression alterations in 2 evolved haploids, 2 evolved diploids, and 4 evolved tetraploids relative to the diploid ancestor.

DESIGN
mRNA gene expression profiles of 2 evolved haploid, 2 evolved diploid, and 4 evolved tetraploid clones were compared to the expression profile of the diploid ancestral strain in 2% raffinose medium.
