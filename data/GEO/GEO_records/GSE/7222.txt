TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of quercetin bioactivity in cultured rat cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Despite extensive studies, the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the development and progression of heart failure have not yet been fully elucidated. Recent experimental and clinical studies have suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major pathological role.   Quercetin, a major flavonoid present in the human diet, has been studied widely and its biological properties are consistent with its protective role in the cardiovascular system. However, it remains unknown whether the cardioprotective effects of quercetin may also occur through the modulation of genes involved in cell survival. This study was therefore designed to examine the gene expression profiling of cultured rat primary cardiomyocytes supplemented with quercetin using DNA-microarrays and relating these data to functional effects. Keywords: nutritional intervention, dose response
