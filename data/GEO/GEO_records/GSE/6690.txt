TITLE
ANA-1 macrophages infected with Chlamydia pneumoniae

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment is an additional experiment to GSE6688. Mouse macrophages (ANA-1 cells) were infected in vitro with C. pneumoniae with a M.O.I. of 10. Twenty two genes were significantly upregulated. Examples of the most upregulated genes in mouse macrophages after C. pneumoniae infection are serum amyloid A3 (saa3), a protein that is mainly produced by activated macrophages during tissue injury or inflammation, MIP-2 (cxcl2) and irg1. Expression levels of all genes induced by C. pneumoniae in macrophages in vitro correlated with the results obtained from infected lungs from wild type mice (GSE6688), suggesting that this cell type participates in host defense in vivo against C. pneumoniae. Keywords: Chlamydia pneumoniae, ANA-1 macrophages, in vitro, infection

DESIGN
ANA-1 macrophages were infected with Chlamydia pneumoniae or left untreated. After 8h total RNA was extracted. Two biological replicates were performed resulting in 4 arrays in total
