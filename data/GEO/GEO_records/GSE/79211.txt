SUMMARY
Adjacent CpG sites in mammalian genomes tend to be co-methylated due to the processivity of enzymes responsible for adding or removing the methyl group. Yet discordant methylation patterns have also be observed, and found to be related to stochastic or uncoordinated molecular processes. Here we focused on a systematic search and investigation of regions in the human genome that exhibit highly coordinated methylation.   By examining the co-methylation patterns of multiple adjacent CpG sites, termed methylation haplotypes, in single bisulfite sequencing reads, we applied a greedy-searching strategy to defined blocks of tightly coupled CpG sites, called Methylation Haplotype Blocks (MHBs), based on 53 sets of whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data, including 43 published sets from human adult tissues, ESC and in vitro differentiated cell lines, as well as 10 sets from human adult tissues generated in this study. The MHBs were then further validated with 101 sets of RRBS ENCODE data, and 637 sets of Illumina 450k methylation array data from TCGA tumor and normal samples. Globally, MHBs are enriched in but only partially overlap with several well-known genomic features, including CpG islands, promoters, enhancers and VMRs.  To perform quantitative analysis of the MHBs, we defined a metric called Methylation Haplotype Load (MHL), which is covered both average methylation level and methylation complexity and therefore more informative than average methylation level or Shannon entropy. Using a feature selection strategy, we identified a set of tissue-specific MHBs that cluster by developmental germ-layers. Interestingly, examination of these MHBs revealed two distinct mechanisms for fate commitment during development: epigenetic silencing of pluripotent genes, such as NANOG, for mesoderm induction; and epigenetic induction (or de-suppression) of lineage-specific factors for ectoderm commitment.
