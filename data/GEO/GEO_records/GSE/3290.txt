TITLE
Expression profiling in perinatal Ductus Arteriosus (DA) and Aorta (Ao).

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Compared the gene expression profiles of two contiguous vessels pre and post - birth, namely the Ductus Arteriosus (DA), committed to become a fibrous ligament, and the Aorta (Ao), which conversely takes on a permanent activity.  The effect of artificially enhanced O2 tension was analyzed in DA in the pre-birth condition. Keywords: Comparison gene expression

DESIGN
5 experimental conditions: 1)	DA of 19 days post coitum (dpc) fetuses  (DA19) 2)	DA of 19 dpc fetuses from dams kept at 100% O2  for three hours prior to cesarian section  (DA 19 O2) 3)	DA of 3 hrs newborn rats (DA3) 4)	Ao of 19 dpc fetuses (Ao19) 5)	 Ao of 3 hrs newborn rats (Ao3) 5 total hybridizations Hybridization design: Multiple comparisons among pre-birth DA, post-birth DA, pre-birth Ao and post-birth Ao to identify specific markers for each of these conditions; triple comparison between  artificially oxygenated pre-birth DA and post-birth DA using normal prebirth-DA as reference sample; comparison between pre-birth DA and post-birth DA (supplementary data, table 2); Comparison between pre-birth Ao and post-birth Ao
