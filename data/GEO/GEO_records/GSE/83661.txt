TITLE
Perturbation of epigenetic processes by doxorubicin in the mouse testes: microRNA analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
microRNA profiling of mouse testis comparing treatment with doxorubicin to vehicle only control (published in Toxicology Research, DOI: 10.1039/C6TX00078A)

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, doxorubicin vs control at 3 time points (1wk, 4wk and 7 wk following treatment). Biological replicates: 12 control, 12 doxorubicin (implementing a dye swap design of n=6 forward and n=6 reverse). One replicate per dual colour array (total of 36 arrays).

PLATFORM
GPL22076 MRC Toxicology Unit-Mus musculus-miRCURY LNA f version 8.0 of miRBase (Exiqon)
