TITLE
ChIPseq and RNAseq of ER mutant breast cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed several extensive phenotypic, genomic, and transcriptomic analyses in an effort to discern the biological differences between normal breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer cells with a mutation in the ESR1 Ligand Binding Domain.

DESIGN
ER ChIP-seq and mRNA-seq of Several MCF7 and T47D Cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
