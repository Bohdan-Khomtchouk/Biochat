TITLE
miRNA profiling of Adenosine treated Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studies of miRNA profiling in early and late endothelial progenitor cells treated or not by cardioprotective nucleoside adenosine.

DESIGN
Early outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells were obtained by adhesion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers. Late endothelial progenitor cells were obtained by purification of CD34+ peripheral blood cells and were cultured and amplified in endothelial-specific medium containing growth factors. Both cell types were treated by adenosine (10micromol/L) for 6 hours. Total RNA was extracted using mirVana Kit and quantified by Nanodrop. RNA was labeled and hybridized using Agilent miRNA Complete Labeling and Hyb Kit. 3 to 4 arrays per sample were hybridized and scanned with the Genepix 4000B Scanner (Molecular Devices). Six independent experiments were performed.
