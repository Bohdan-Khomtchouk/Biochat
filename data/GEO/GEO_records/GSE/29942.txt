TITLE
Changes in glycogene expression during maturation of dendritic cells

ORGANISM
unidentified

SUMMARY
To investigate the expression of glycosyltransferases in dendritic cells and the changes in expression associated with maturation.

DESIGN
RNA preparations from monocytes (Mo), immature dendritic cells (iDC) and mature dendritic cells (mDC), from different healthy human donors were sent to both Microarray Core (E) and Core(C).  The RNA was put on an RNeasy Column, amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the Glycov3 microarrays.  Data was sent to Dr. van Kooyk's lab for analysis.
