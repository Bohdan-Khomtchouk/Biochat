TITLE
Ldb1-nucleated transcription complexes function as primary mediators of erythroid gene activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used ChIP-Seq to map Ldb1, Scl and Gata1 binding sites in mouse total bone marrow cells. Together with functional studies comparing gene expression in Murine Erythroleukemia (MEL) cells expressing Ldb1 shRNA or control shRNA  and bioinformatics analysis, we systematically determined the transcriptional program controlled by Ldb1 complexes in erythropoiesis. This represents the ChIP-Seq component of the study only

DESIGN
To evaluate the role of Ldb1complexes in erythroid gene activation

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
