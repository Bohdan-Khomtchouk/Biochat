TITLE
The porcine microRNA transcriptome response to porcine cytomegalovirus infection

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV; genus Cytomegalovirus, subfamily Betaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae) is an immunosuppressive virus that mainly inhibits the immune function of T lymphocytes and macrophages, which has caused great distress to the farming industry. In this study, we obtained the miRNA expression profiles of PCMV-infected and control porcine macrophages, PCMV-infected and control porcine tissues via high-throughput sequencing. The comprehensive analysis of miRNA profiles showed that 306 miRNA database annotated and 295 novel pig-encoded miRNAs were detected.  Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the target genes of miRNAs in PCMV infected porcine macrophages showed that the differentially expressed miRNAs are mainly involved in immune and metabolic process.   This is the first report of the miRNA transcriptome in PCMV infected porcine macrophages and PCMV infected tissues and the analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanism during PCMV infection. Further research into the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during immunosuppressive viral infections will contribute to the treatment and prevention of immunosuppressive viruses.
