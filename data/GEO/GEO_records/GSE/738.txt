TITLE
Rat models of cardiac hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by aortic banding (6, 12, 16, and 30 weeks), myocardial infarction (3 and 9 weeks), an av-fistula (aorta abd. to v. cava inf.. 3 and 8 weeks), or hormone infusion (two weeks either angiotensin 2 or a thyroxin analogue). Sham operated or saline infused animals served as controls. Gene expression was determined by Affymetrix RGU34A GeneChip's to identify genes with common regulation in the different models of cardiac hypertrophy. Keywords: other
