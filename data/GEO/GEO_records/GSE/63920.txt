TITLE
Cardiac mRNA profiling in mice treated with lipopolysaccharide

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the messenger RNA (mRNA) profile in the hearts of mice that were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and identify potential changes in the expression of genes that may account for inhibition of cardiac Ppara that has been observed in LPS-treated mice, 8 mouse samples were analyzed with whole genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Total RNA from pieces of hearts obtained from 8 C57BL/6 mice that were treated either with saline (4 mice) or with lipopolysaccharide (4 mice).

PLATFORM
GPL19507 MI mouse exonic evidence-based oligonucleotide (MEEBO) microarray
