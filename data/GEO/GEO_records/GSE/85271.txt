TITLE
KANK1 inhibits cell growth by inducing apoptosis though regulating CXXC5 in human malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to identify expression differences between untreated and Doxycycline treated human malignant peripheral nerve sheathing tumors (MPNST) cell lines. We sequenced mRNA from 6 lentiviral infected MPNST human stable cell lines(STS26T-pLIX405-KANK1 using Illumina Hiseq 2500 sequencing platform. Three control samples are untreated stable cells and three samples are Doxycycline treated (1 ug/ml).

DESIGN
mRNA profiles were examed by Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. Six samples were sequenced with three untreated stable cells and three Doxycycline treated samples.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
