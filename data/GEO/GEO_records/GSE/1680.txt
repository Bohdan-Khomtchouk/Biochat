TITLE
Effect of CCL3 on target ablation-induced macrophage recruitment into the olfactory epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim was to determine the identity of genes regulated at 3 d post-olfactory bulbectomy in the olfactory mucosa of carrier-injected Ccl3-/- mice compared with carrier-injected C57BL/6 mice.  Total RNA from the OE was hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.  A number of chemokine-, cytokine-, and growth factor-related genes were significantly regulated in the Ccl3-/- mice, and were restored in CCL3 protein-injected Ccl3-/- mice.  The results illustrated that CCL3 played a key role in recruitment of macrophages to the OE and provided insight into the genomic regulation involved in OE remodeling. Keywords: other
