TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Wt1 mutant renal anlagen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wt1 is required for renal development and homozyogus knockout mice show renal agenesis caused by apoptosis of the metanepric mesnchyme. To identify genes regulated by WT1, we performed comparative gene expression profiling on kidney rudmients of Wt1 heterozygous and homozygous mutant E10.25 embryos.

DESIGN
To identify deregulated genes, timed matings were performed and embryos isolated at E10.25, a time point before the onset of apoptosis in Wt1 mutants.  The region containing the metanephric mesenchyme was microdissected, RNA isolated and after labeling, hybridized to Mouse Genome Survey Microarrays. Deregulated genes were identified using GeneSpring (GSX) software.
