TITLE
Patterns of aberrant DNA methylation after toxicant-induced malignant transformation (MeDIP-chip dataset 1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently observed in cancer. The aim of this study was to determine how DNA methylation is changed after toxicant-induced malignant transformation. This study also puts the DNA methylation changes into context with respect to the aberrant DNA methylation events that occur in bladder and prostate carcinogenesis not associated with toxicant exposure.

DESIGN
Immortalized UROtsa (n=3) and RWPE-1 (n=2) are compared to normal HUC (n=2) and PrEC (n=2), respectively. Arsenite (n=1), monomethylarsonous acid (n=2) or cadmium (n=1) transformed UROtsa are compared to parental UROtsa (n=3). Arsenite (n=2), cadmium (n=1) or MNU (n=1) transformed RWPE-1 cells are compared to parental RWPE-1 cells (n=2). Clinical bladder tumor biopsies (n=6), urothelial carcinoma cell lines (n=2) and prostate cancer cell lines (n=3) are compared to thier normal tissue counterparts HUC (n=2) and PrEC (n=2). Immunoprecipitation using anti-methylcytosine (5MeC) antibody.
