TITLE
Cancer Immunosurveillance by Innate Lymphoid Cells and Innate-like T Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Malignancy can be suppressed by the immune system in a process termed immunosurveillance.  However, to what extent immunosurveillance occurs in spontaneous cancers and the composition of participating cell types remain obscure.  Here we show that cell transformation triggers a tissue-resident lymphocyte response in oncogene-induced murine cancer models.  Non-circulating cytotoxic lymphocytes, derived from innate, TCRαβ and TCRγδ lineages, expand in early tumors.  Characterized by high expression of NK1.1, CD49a and CD103, these cells share a gene expression signature distinct from those of conventional NK cells, T cells and invariant NKT cells.  Generation of these lymphocytes is dependent on the cytokine IL-15, but not the transcription factor Nfil3 that is required for the differentiation of tumor-infiltrating NK cells; and IL-15, but not Nfil3, deficiency results in accelerated tumor growth.  These findings reveal a novel tumor-elicited cancer immunosurveillance mechanism that engages unconventional type 1-like innate lymphoid cells and type 1 innate-like T cells.
