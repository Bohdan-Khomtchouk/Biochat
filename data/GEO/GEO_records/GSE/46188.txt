TITLE
Analyses of mIRNA transcript level following exposure to triptolide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analyses of mirna transcript levels following exposure to the drug triptolide in vitro and prodrug minnelide in xenograft pancreatic tumor mouse models.

DESIGN
Response of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines to minelide in vitro and exposure to its prodrug triptolide in SCID mouse tumors derived from the same cell lines.
