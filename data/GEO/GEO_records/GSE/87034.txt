TITLE
ChIP-seq of c-Myc in lung cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report genome wide binding profiles of c-Myc in lung cancer cells. We performed ChIP-seq of c-Myc in three cell lines that were derived from a mouse model of lung cancer.  Binding sites were identified by comparing to input controls.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of Myc in three lung cancer lines

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
