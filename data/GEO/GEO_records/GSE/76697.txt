TITLE
Role of ST2 expession in regulatory Tcells on muscle regneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We describe the effects of Treg ST2 expression on muscle regeneration.  We compare regneration from cryo-injured tibialis anterior muscle from Foxp3-Cre/ST2-flox vs Foxp3-Cre mice 8 days post-injury. These analyses from whole muscle provide insight into the role of muscle Tregs in the context of regeneration.

DESIGN
The tibialis anterior muscle from male Foxp3-Cre/ST2 flox or Foxp3-Cre/ST2 WT C57BL/6 mice (2 months old) were cryo-injured using a liquid nitrogen chilled metal probe for 8 seconds. 8 days post-injury whole muscle was harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Whole muscle was then homogenized directly in TriZol and gene expression profiling was performed on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
