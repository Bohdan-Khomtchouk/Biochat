TITLE
Gene expression changes after loss of Hoxa9 in transformed HSCs [HOXA9 RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Characterization of gene expression changes 72 hours after withdrawal of tamoxifen in murine hematopoietic progenitors transformed by Hoxa9-ER/Meis1 using RNAseq. In the presence of tamoxifen (4OHT), Hoxa9-ER localizes to the nucleus of cells allowing for transformation, while withdrawal of 4OHT (culture in EtOH) leads to loss of nuclear Hoxa9-ER. Loss of Hoxa9-ER leads to a decrease in cellular proliferation and differentiation along the myeloid lineage.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression by RNAseq in two conditions in biological replicates.

PLATFORM
