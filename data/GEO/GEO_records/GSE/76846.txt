TITLE
Expression profiling of long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs in human plasma of hypertension patients from South China

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNA profile in the plasma of human with hypertension and healthy controls from South China.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we identified the genome-wide expression level of lncRNAs for one hypertension sample and one healthy control sample. Each sample (total RNA) was pooled from the total RNA of fifteen age and gender matched subjects (hypertension patients or healthy controls).
