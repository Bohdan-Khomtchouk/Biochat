TITLE
Gene expression profiling in sinonasal sarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analyses of gene expression profiling in sinonasal sarcoma (SNS) harboring PAX3-MAML3 fusion gene or PAX3 rearrangement and other types of tumors without having such fusion or rearrangement. The results provide important information for further investigations of the PAX3-MAML3 fusion functions in SNS.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from FFPE tissues of 41 tumors including 8 SNS (6 with PAX3-MAML3 fusion and 2 with PAX3 rearrangement only) and 33 cases from other 10 different types of tumors. Gene expression profiling of fusion group including 8 SNA vs.non-fusion group including 33 control tumors were analyszed.
