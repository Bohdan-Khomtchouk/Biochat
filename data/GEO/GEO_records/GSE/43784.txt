TITLE
A nucleolar AAA-NTPase is required for Toxoplasma gondii division

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
Toxoplasma gondii cell cycle mutant 11-104A4 reversibly arrests in the G1 phase.  The defect in this mutant was mapped by genetic complementation to a gene encoding a novel AAA-ATPase/CDC48 family member (TgNoAP1).  A change in a tyrosine to a cysteine upstream of an AAA+ domain leads to protein instability and results in cell cycle arrest. This factor  is cell cycle regulated and exclusively expressed in the nucleolus during the G1/S phases.  At high temperature the mutant quickly arrests with a single nucleus and expresses transcripts enriched in the G1 subtranscriptome. This unique CDC48 ortholog operates in a parasite mechanism responsible for G1 progression and is the first G1-specific checkpoint factor described in Toxoplasma. We describe transcriptome of the temperature sensitive mutant 11-104A4. Transcriptome studies demonstrated that gene expression is reflective of the parasite arrest in G1 phase. mRNAs normally upregulated in S/M phase were largely downregulated in the mutant at the restrictive temperature 40oC.  Genetic complementation with extra copy of the wild type TgNoAP1 rescued growth of the mutant 11-104A4 at 40oC and reversed changes in the transcriptome.

DESIGN
RNA samples were isolated in duplicate from mutant 11-104A4 parasites grown for 32h at permissive (34oC) or non-permissive temperatures (40oC). In addition, a duplicate sample of RNA from mutant 11-104A4 complemented with cosmid TOXOV53 encoding wild type copy of TgNoAP1 similarly grown at 40oC was collected. Samples were hybridized to the Toxoplasma gondii Affymetrix microarray (ToxoGeneChip: http://ancillary.toxodb.org/docs/Array-Tutorial.html ). Hybridization data was preprocessed with Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) and normalized using per chip and per gene median polishing and analyzed using the software package GeneSpring GX (Agilent Technologies).
