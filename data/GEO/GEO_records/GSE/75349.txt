TITLE
A missense mutation in TFRC, encoding transferrin receptor 1, causes combined immunodeficiency (Family B)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix 6.0 SNP data for haplotype comparison of patients from two different families sharing the same homozygous mutation in TFRC, to determine if the families were related to each other Peripheral blood was used for patients who had no history of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Fibroblasts cell lines were used as a source of DNA for the individual who received HSCT.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from 3 subjects (2 from Family A, 1 from Family B in duplicate) was genotyped at 909,622 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array (Affymetrix).
