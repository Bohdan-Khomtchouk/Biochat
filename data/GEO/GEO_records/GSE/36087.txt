TITLE
miRNA expression profile in GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify aberrantly expressed miRNAs affecting the biology of GIST, miRNA array was performed in 19 cases of GIST.

DESIGN
A series of 19 GISTs specimens were analyzed using 3D-Gene Human miRNA Oligo chips containing 904 human miRNAs and 107 viral miRNAs anti-sense probes printed in duplicate spots (Toray, Kamakura, Japan).
