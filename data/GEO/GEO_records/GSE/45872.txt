TITLE
Hypoxia-enhanced Derivation of iPSCs from Human Dental Pulp Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hypoxia enhances the reprogramming efficiency of human dermal fibroblasts to become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Because we showed previously that the hypoxia facilitates the isolation and maintenance of human dental pulp cells (DPCs), we examined here whether it promotes the reprogramming of DPCs to become iPSCs.

DESIGN
To investigate the effect of oxygen concentration on global gene expression, we compared DPCs cultured for 6 days under hypoxia and normoxia.
