TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Mtb H37Rv and MtbΔwhiB3 at pH 4.5

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Since WhiB3 expression was shown to be maximally upregulated at pH 4.5 and MtbΔwhiB3 was shown to be defective in survival in Ph 4.5, we did microarray at pH 4.5 so as to study comprehensive role of WhiB3 in regulating gene expression at acidic Ph

DESIGN
Mtb H37Rv and MtbΔwhiB3 were grown till early log phase and exposed to 7H9-Tylaxapol at pH 4.5 for 2 hours at 37 degree at 150rpm. Two independent experiments were done for each of the strain.
