TITLE
Histone  H2B monoubiquitination facilitates the rapid modulation of gene expression during Arabidopsis photomorphogenesis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In eukaryotes, chromatin-based mechanisms superimpose with DNA sequence information to determine the transcriptional output of the genome.  Therefore, evaluating the role of chromatin modifications in the regulation of gene expression is key to understand the contribution of chromatin state variations to development. Recent studies identified several transcriptional coactivators that contribute to selectively regulate cellular pathways by coordinating histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub) with other histone modifications. Although H2Bub is present on a large number of genes, loss of H2B monoubiquitination activity was shown to affect RNA steady levels for a small subset of genes and therefore its influence on gene expression is not well understood. In this study we assessed the impact of H2Bub on dynamic expression changes during a rapid developmental tranistion that initiates only when exposing plants to light. This revealed that H2Bub deposition is highly dynamic in a genomic context. Furthermore, plants lacking histone H2B monoubiquitination activity were impaired for rapid changes of RNA levels for a large repertoire of genes, indicating that H2Bub is important for attaining appropriate expression levels /in fine/. Finally, the detection power of the genomic approach has allowed us to define a set of genes impacted by H2Bub dynamics for rapid changes in RNA levels. The purpose of this study was to integrate the genome-wide distribution of H2Bub chromatin mark together with transcriptome profiles of wild-type and /hub1 /mutant plants (accession GSE21922) at three time points during early photomorphogenesis
