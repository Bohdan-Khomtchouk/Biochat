TITLE
Single-cell analysis of allelic gene expression in pluripotency, differentiation and X-chromosome inactivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced the mRNAs of embryonic stem cells (ESCs)  cultured in different conditions. The two lines M (male) and F (female) used in this study were derived from E4 blastocysts of the same cross between a C57BL/6J (Mus musculus domesticus) and CAST/EiJ (Mus castaneus) male. mESCs were cultured in 2i and LIF as the ground state condition or in serum and LIF as the conventional condition. Epistem cell lines were also generated from the two lines by culturing them with Activin A and FGF2. In order to study more advanced development, we differentiated the two mESC lines through embryonic body formation to postmitotic motor neurons using retinoic acid and the smoothened agonist SAG. This differentiation process also results in the derivation of several types of interneurons.  We picked single cells from all different conditions and generated sequencing libraries using the Smart-seq2 and Tn5 protocol. For simplicity, we designate the different condition as ES2i, ES, Epi and Neuron from hereon. We also obtained preimplantation inner cell mass and epiblast cells from E3.5 ICM (inner cell mass) and E4.5 blastocysts of the crossbred mice (male CAST/EiJ Ã— female C57BL/6J) as well as postimplantation epiblast cells from E5.5 embryos of C57BL/6J mice
