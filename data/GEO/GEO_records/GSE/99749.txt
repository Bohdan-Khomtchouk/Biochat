TITLE
Integrating transcriptome and proteome profiles of prenatal muscle tissue to reveal the postnatal growth differences in pigsof Pig Muscle Tissue

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We using RNA sequences (from RNA-seq) from the prenatal muscle tissues of three pig breeds (Tibetan pig [TP], Wujin pig [WJ], and Large White pig [LW]) were analyzed to compare the differentially expressed genes related to embryonic myogenesis and to identify the genes related to postnatal growth rate and growth potential in pigs. We obtained 38.7-50.1 million clean data through the RNA-seq and detected that 19,626 genes were positively expressed and 13,660 of them were co-expressed in the muscle tissues of the four samples. The 3,626 unique DEGs in TP were mainly enriched in 76 GO terms and 35 KEGG pathways.The GO terms mainly included ATP binding, calcium ion binding, negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, and cell components of cytoplasm, nucleus, and extracellular exosome . The top 20 KEGG pathways mainly included metabolic, insulin signaling, FoxO signaling, and AMPK signaling pathways that are mostly involved in muscle development and growth.

DESIGN
RNA sequences from the tissues of  embryonic longissimus dorsi muscle of  three pig breeds (Tibetan pig [TP], Wujin pig [WJ], and Large White pig [LW]) were examined using HiSeq 4000.
