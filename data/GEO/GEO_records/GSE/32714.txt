TITLE
Transcriptional landscape of Candida parapsilosis

ORGANISM
Candida parapsilosis

SUMMARY
We used next generation sequencing (RNA-seq) to determine the transcriptional profile of C. parapsilosis growing in several conditions including different media, temperatures and oxygen concentrations.

DESIGN
We have 37 Samples representing BMW and YPD media, 1% and 21% oxygen, 30 and 37 degree celsius temperature, and CLIB214 and CDupc5 strains.

PLATFORM
GPL14718 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Candida parapsilosis)
