TITLE
Stress-associated H3K4 methylation accumulates during postnatal development and aging of Rhesus macaque brain

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
We examined the histone modification H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) in the prefrontal cortex of individual Rhesus macaques at different ages by chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) at the whole genome level

DESIGN
Four Rhesus macaque prefrontal cortex samples with 0.4, 9,22 and 26 years old were used for H3K4me2 ChIP-Seq

PLATFORM
GPL9160 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Macaca mulatta)
