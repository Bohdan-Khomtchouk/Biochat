TITLE
Multiple waves of transcriptome changes during extended hypoxic induction in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profile the expression pattern of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) at different time points of hypoxic stress. Through mRNA-seq, we identify functional waves of minor gene up-regulation at 8 and 24h hypoxia exposure followed by a massive wave of transcriptional activation after 48 hours. By weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we identify hub genes that likely play central roles in hypoxia transcription program. Strikingly, these hub genes included a prominent group of lincRNAs, suggesting non-coding RNAs may also have pivotal roles in the hypoxia regulatory circuit.  HPMECs share a core hypoxia signature profile, but with some notably differences, indicating a portion of HPMECs hypoxia response is cell-specific. Collectively, our study comprehensive surveys the hypoxia transcriptome, and provides insight into the temporal dynamics of hypoxia transcriptional response.
