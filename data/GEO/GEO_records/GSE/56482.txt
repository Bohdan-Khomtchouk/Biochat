TITLE
Expression Data comparing Gene Expression in 27-day old testes of wild-type and Brwd1-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Brwd1-/- mice are infertile with post-meiotic defects in the male. BRWD1 contains bromodomains and may function as a transcriptional regulator important for post-meiotic development in the male germline. This microarray compares post-meiotic gene expression between WT and mutant mice.

DESIGN
We collected total RNA from testes of 27-day old WT and Brwd1-/- (MT) mice. At this age, germ cells have completed meiosis and are mid-way in post-meiotic development. Any gene expression changes in spermatids would be apparent at this time-point. We decided to do this with 4 WT and 4 Brwd1-/- mice.
