TITLE
Expression analysis of Mycobacterium smegmatis delta-MSMEG_0166 mutant

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155 delta-MSMEG_0166 mutant, compared to the wild-type strain. MSMEG_0166 is a transcriptional regulator in the gntR family. Mutations in MSMEG_0166 result in hypersensitivity to the bactericidal ubiquitin peptide Ub2, as well as oxidative stress caused by either organic or inorganic agents

DESIGN
A three chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155 and three separate cultures of a MSMEG_0166 mutant strain, Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155 delta-MSMEG_0166, in which MSMEG_0166 is interupted by the insertion of a hygromycin resistance cassette.  Each chip measures the expression level of 6,588 genes from Myobacterium smegmatis with five 60-mer probes per transcript and two replicates of each probe for a total of 65,880 experimental probes.
