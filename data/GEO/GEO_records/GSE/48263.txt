TITLE
Genome wide mapping of effects of U6atac knockdown on pre-mRNA splicing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This project looks into experimentally identifying all minor introns by knocking down the minor spliceosome's catalytic snRNP, U6atac.

DESIGN
Knockdown of U6atac by antisense morpholino followed by examining mRNA splicing by RNA-seq
