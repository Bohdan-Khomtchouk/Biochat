TITLE
Transcriptional regulation of myoblasts in HMGA2 KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to identify critical factors regulating muscle stem cell activation and commitment, and determined through loss-of-function analyses that HMGA2 (high mobility group AT-hook 2) is a key regulator of myogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.

DESIGN
mRNAs were isolated from Hmga2 -/- and Hmga2 +/+ mice myoblasts, and a microarray experiment was performed.
