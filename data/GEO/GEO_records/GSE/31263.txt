TITLE
The DNA methylomes of a newborn and a centenarian

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have developed Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) of a newborn and a centenarian to address the epigenetic drifts in human aging, which might be an alternative pathway to explain the age-associated alterations. In addition, we have analyzed the methylome of a middle-age donor (26 years).

DESIGN
Examination of two DNA methylomes at the most extreme points of their lives to see differences that might contribute to explain the aged phenotype. The methylome of a middle-age donor (26 years) was also analyzed.
