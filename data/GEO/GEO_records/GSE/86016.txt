TITLE
PRDM16 represses the type I Interferon response in adipocytes [expression profiling]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PRDM16 is a strong activator of brown fat-specific genes, while also a repressor of white fat and muscle-specific genes. We asked what other pathways are regulated by PRDM16 in adipocytes that may be critical for brown and/or beige adipogenesis. Using microarray, we found PRDM16 also represses type I Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in adipocytes.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to profile changes in gene expression for wildtype and Prdm16 KO adipocytes stimulated with rosiglitazone to induce browning of the adipocytes.
