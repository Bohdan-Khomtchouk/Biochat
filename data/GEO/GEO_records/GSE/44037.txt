TITLE
Expression data from airway epithelial cells from patients with asthma, rhinitis, and helathy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The link between upper and lower airways in patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis is still poorly understood. As the biological complexity of these disorders can be captured by gene expression profiling we hypothesized that the clinical expression of rhinitis and/or asthma is related to differential gene expression between upper and lower airways epithelium. We used micro array to profile gene expression of primary nasal and bronchial epithelial cells from the same individuals and examining the impact of allergic rhinitis with and without concomitant allergic asthma on expression profiles.

DESIGN
17 subjects were included in a cross-sectional study (6 allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis; 5 allergic rhinitis; 6 healthy controls). RNA was extracted from isolated and cultured epithelial cells from bronchial brushes and nasal biopsies, and analyzed by microarray (Affymetrix U133+ PM Genechip Array).
