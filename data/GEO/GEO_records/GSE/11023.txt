TITLE
Focused microarrays as a method to evaluate subtle changes in chicken embryonic heart gene expression

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Microrrays plataforms with thousands of gene sequences have limited capacity to pick up subtle small changes in gene expression. A focused two-color microarray platform was designed for high replication and to use statistical power to detect small changes Keywords: time course, embryo development

DESIGN
Individual samples from 8 embryos  were arraged on a complete interwoven loop design where each treatment (embryonic ages 7, 15, 19 and 20) was replicated 8 times (4 dye-swaps).

PLATFORM
GPL6043 NCSU_chicken_JS2 (312 oligos)
