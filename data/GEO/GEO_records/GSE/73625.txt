TITLE
Expression profiles of microRNAs in Glioma-Initiating Cells (GICs) cultured under hypoxia and normoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, with glioma initiating cells (GICs) implicated to be critical for tumor progression and resistance to therapy. The hypoxic tumor microenvironment has been shown to play an important role to maintain the GICs; however, the mechanisms regulating responses of GICs to hypoxia remain poorly understood.

DESIGN
We used RNA-Sequencing to  to detail the global change of microRNA expression in GICs cultured under hypoxia compared to normoxia and identified de-regulated microRNAs during hypoxia. CD133+ 110040 GICs were cultured under 1% O2 for 0h, 6h, 12h and 24 hs. Then RNA was extracted and microRNA expression was profiled by RNA-Sequencing.
