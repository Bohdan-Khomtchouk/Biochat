TITLE
4PEHz-treated P.falciparum parasites vs. untreated extracted at timepoints t1 (12 Hours post invasion or HPI), t2 (24 HPI) and t3 (36 HPI)

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Plasmodium falciparum parasites were treated with the PfPdx1 inhibitor 4PEHz and the transcriptional responses of three different timepoints throughout the intraerythrocyic developmental cycle of the parasite were compared to untreated parasites. The goal was to determine the functional consequences of attenuating vitamin B6 metabolism in the parasites using 4PEHz (4-phospho-D-erythronhydrazide)

DESIGN
Two color array with reference pool design, at least 2 biological replicates from each timepoint of treated and untreated parasites.

PLATFORM
GPL17233 Agilent-021506 Plasmodium falciparum UP1_01_Of_1
