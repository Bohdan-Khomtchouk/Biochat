TITLE
Identification of SF-1 genomic binding sites in conditions of basal and increased dosage in the H295R adrenocortical tumor cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify genomic binding sites of the SF-1 nuclear receptor under conditions of basal and increased dosage in the H295R human adrenocortical tumor cell line.

DESIGN
14 samples: input DNA (2 replicates) - SF-1 ChIP Millipore antibody basal SF-1 dosage (3 replicates) - SF-1 ChIP Millipore antibody increased SF-1 dosage (3 replicates) - SF-1 ChIP Perseus antibody basal SF-1 dosage (3 replicates) - SF-1 ChIP Perseus antibody increased SF-1 dosage (3 replicates)
