SUMMARY
Phase I Safety, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacogenomic Trial of ES-285, a Novel Marine Cytotoxic Agent Administered as an Infusion over 24 h Every 21 Days in Patients with Solid Tumors Purpose: A dose-escalation, phase I study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenomics and efficacy of ES-285, a novel agent isolated from a marine mollusc, in adult cancer patients. Experimental design: Patients received a 24-hour i.v. infusion of ES-285 once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The starting dose was 4mg/m2. Dose escalation proceeded according to the worst toxicity observed in the previous cohort. Results: 28 patients were treated with 72 courses of ES-285 across 8 dose levels. No doselimiting toxicities (DLTs) were seen between 4mg/m2 and 128mg/m2. Two out of 4 patients treated at 256mg/m2 had dose-limiting reversible grade 3 transaminitis; one patient at 256mg/m2 also had transient grade 3 central neurotoxicity. One of 3 patients subsequently treated at 200mg/m2 died following drug-related central neurotoxicity. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated dose-proportionality with high volume of distribution (median Vss at 256mg/m2 was 2389L, range 1615-4051L) and long elimination half life (median t1/2 at 256mg/m2 was 29h, range 21-32h). The 3 patients with DLT had the highest drug exposure. Pharmacogenomic studies of paired surrogate tissue samples identified changes in gene expression following treatment that correlated with increasing dose. Pre-treatment 59- and 49-gene sets were identified in blood and skin respectively, that may predict DLT. Disease stabilisation for 6 to 18 weeks was recorded in 9 patients. Conclusion: Using this schedule, 128 mg/m2 was considered safe and feasible. At this dose, pharmacologically relevant concentrations of drug were safely achieved with pharmacogenomic studies indicating changes in the expression of genes of potential biological relevance.
