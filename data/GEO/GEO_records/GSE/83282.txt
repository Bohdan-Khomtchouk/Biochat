TITLE
Deep sequencing of mycovirus-derived small RNAs from the fungi Botrytis spp.

ORGANISM
Botrytis cinerea ; Botrytis paeoniae

SUMMARY
In this work, we have used deep sequencing to study the viral small RNA (vsiRNA) populations from different mycoviruses infecting field isolates of Botrytis spp. The mycoviruses under study belong to different genera and species and have different type of genome (dsRNA, (+)ssRNA, and (-)ssRNA). In general, vsiRNAs derived from mycoviruses are mostly of 21, 20 and 22 nucleotides in length, possess sense or antisense orientation either in a similar ratio or with a predominance of sense polarity depending on the virus species, have predominantly U at their 5' end, and are unevenly distributed along the viral genome showing conspicuous hotspots of vsiRNA accumulation. These characteristics reveal striking concomitances with vsiRNAs produced by plant viruses suggesting similar pathways of viral targeting in plants and fungi

DESIGN
sRNA sequencing of two isolates of Botrytis cinerea (Pi285.8 and V448) and one isolate of Botrytis paeoniae (V446) infected with different mycoviruses

PLATFORM
GPL22004 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Botrytis cinerea) GPL22005 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Botrytis paeoniae)
