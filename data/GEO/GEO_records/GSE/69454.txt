TITLE
Expression data from decitabine-treated and non-treated BR5FVB1-Akt cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The DNA methyl transferase inhibitor decitabine regulates gene expression in cancer cells. We used microarrays to detail the globle programming of gene expression, and identified a distinct class of immunoregulartory genes up-regulated upon decitabine treatment in ovarian cancer cells.

DESIGN
BR5FVB1-Akt cells were treated with or without 10 uM of dectiabine for 72 hours. Total RNA was extracted and whole-transcript gene arry (Mouse gene ST 2.0) was performed.
