TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by miR-101 in U2OS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-101 is a tumor suppressive microRNA. Besides EZH2, a well known EZH2 target, miR-101 should have other targets, which might also contribute to its tumor suppressive function. Thus, we performed array hybridization to determine changes in gene expression upon miR-101 overexpression in U2OS cells.

DESIGN
U2OS were transfected with synthetic miRNA negative control (NC) or miR-101 for 48hrs, and then harvested for RNA preparation.  Three independent experiments were performed. One NC sample were repeated twice for the microarray.
