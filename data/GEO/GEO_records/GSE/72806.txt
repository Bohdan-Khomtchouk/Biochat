TITLE
ABA is required for plant acclimation to a combination of salt and heat stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We examined changes in steady-state transcript level in leaves of Arabidopsis plants subjected to salinity, heat stress and their combination by a transcriptome analysis of leaves.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of Arabidopsis plants subjected to salinity, heat stress and their comination were generated by RNA-Seq analysis, in triplicate, using an Illumina HiSeq2000.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
