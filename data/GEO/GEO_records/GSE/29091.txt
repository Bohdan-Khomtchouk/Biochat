TITLE
Alteration of microRNA expression during mouse brain growing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated expression profiles of miRNAs in the process of normal mouse brain growing from embryonic day 16.5 to one year old by means of DNA microarray. The results indicated that a major change in the expression of miRNAs occurred in the brain within the first week to the fourth week postnatally. The data also exhibited miRNAs which gradually increased and not decreased in their levels over the course of brain growing.

DESIGN
Thirty-eight samples prepared from various aged mice were analyzed. Experiments were duplicated.
