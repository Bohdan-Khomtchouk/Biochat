TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of zebrafish heart exposed to sorafenib

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Sorafenib is associated with cardiac adverse effects, including left ventricular dysfunction. However, the precise mechanism remains unclear. Here, we aimed to establish the genes responsible for this cardiotoxicity using zebrafish. A pigmentless zebrafish line expressing green fluorescent protein in the heart were treated with or without sorafenib. In vivo fluorescent cardiac imaging revealed that the ventricular dimension of the longitudinal axis in zebrafish treated with sorafenib was significantly lower than in those without sorafenib. Transcriptome analysis of zebrafish hearts revealed that expression of stanniocalcin1 (stc1) in zebrafish treated with sorafenib was significantly lower than that without sorafenib treatment. We were able to demonstrate that the ventricular dimension of the longitudinal axis in stc1 morphant was significantly smaller than that of control zebrafish and that forced expression of stc1 normalized the decrease in ventricular diameter in stc1 morphant and zebrafish treated with sorafenib. These data suggest that stc1 is the gene responsible for sorafenib-induced cardiotoxicity.

DESIGN
Gene expression regulated by sorafenib in zebrafish at 4 dpf was measured. Four independent experiments were performed for each group.
