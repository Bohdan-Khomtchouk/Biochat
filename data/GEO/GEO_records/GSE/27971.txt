TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of Tetrahymena thermophila

ORGANISM
Tetrahymena thermophila

SUMMARY
We present a comprehensive transcriptome of ciliate T. thermophila using the Illumina RNA-seq platform. The data was generated from the six mRNA samples of growth, starvation and conjugation of Tetrahymena. Despite an AT rich genome, there are about 124.6 million reads mapped to T. thermophila genome. Using these mapped reads, we have significantly improved the previous genome annotation and investigated the gene expression. Besides, our result also provided a comprehensive understanding of the alternative splicing in T. thermophila, and suggested the existence of the regulated unproductive splicing and translation (RUST) in the single-celled eukaryote.

DESIGN
RNA-seq for six samples of Tetrahymena growth, starvation and conjugation.
