TITLE
Profiling of human CD4+ T subsets identifies a Th2-specific non-coding RNA GATA3-AS1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Host defense against diverse pathogens involves the recruitment and differentiation of CD4+ T effector subsets including T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17 and induced regulatory T (Treg) cells. Surface phenotype studies have revealed subset-specific surface markers for the identification and purification of human primary CD4+ T effector subsets. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the mRNA and large intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) expression differences between human primary CD4+ T effector subsets and identify potential subset-specific genes. To achieve this goal, mRNA and lincRNA microarray profiling of flow cytometry-sorted human primary Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells was performed. Principal component and pathway analyses revealed subset-specific gene expression patterns. A Th2-specific lincRNA, GATA3-AS1, also termed FLJ45983, was identified in primary immune cells and tissues, as well as in in vitro polarized CD4+ T effector subsets. Further analysis showed that GATA3-AS1 was a potential diagnostic marker in allergy, a Th2-associated disease. This first systematic genome-wide analysis of gene expression differences between primary CD4+ T effector subsets may help to identify novel regulatory protein-coding genes and lincRNAs regulating CD4+ T cell subset differentiation, as well as potential diagnostic markers. As an example, we identified a GATA3-associated Th2-specific marker lincRNA GATA3-AS1.
