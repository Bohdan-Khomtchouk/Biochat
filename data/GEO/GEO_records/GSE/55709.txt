TITLE
Tead2 expression levels control the subcellular distribution of Yap and Taz, zyxin expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cellular changes during an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) largely rely on global changes in gene expression orchestrated by transcription factors. Tead transcription factors and their co-factors Yap and Taz have been shown to be implicated in EMT, nevertheless, their direct target genes during EMT have remained elusive.We used genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and next generation sequencing to identify diect Tead2 target genes during EMT.

DESIGN
Py2T cells (murine breast cancer cell line) were treated with TGFÎ² for 5 days and subjected to ChIP using an antibody for Tead2 followed by next generation sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000; n=2)

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
