TITLE
Arabidopsis at the stage of Golovinomyces cichoracearum haustorium formation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Here, we sought to describe qualitative and quantitative changes in the global gene expression profiles of susceptible Arabidopsis plants supporting the development of G. cichoracearum haustoria. We analyzed the features of compatibility at this infection stage, and further evaluated the contribution of the SA- and JA/ET-dependent defense signaling pathways in the pathogen-induced responses by comparing responses in infected wild-type, npr1-1, and jar1-1 plants. Our findings collectively contribute to knowledge regarding early host cell alterations generated in response to attack by this virulent obligate biotrophic fungus. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Disease State: plant infected/uninfected with Golovinomyces orontii Genotype: wt/mutant strains Keywords: Logical Set
