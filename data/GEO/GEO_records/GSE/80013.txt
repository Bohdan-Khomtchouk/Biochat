TITLE
Rapid Inflammasome Activation Following Mucosal SIV infection of Rhesus Monkeys

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to evaluated the kinetics of virus dissemination to distal tissues and the initial innate and adaptive host immune responses following intravaginal SIV infection of rhesus monkeys.

DESIGN
We performed comprehensive serial necropsies in rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) on day 0, day 1, day 3, day 7 and day 10 following intravaginal inoculation of 5x104 TCID50 SIVmac251, measured viral RNA, and performed transcriptomic analysis to measure gene expression changes that correlate with virus spread. note: Grouped different sections of a tissue based on similar transcriptomic profiles; example: FRT = vagina+uterus+cervix
