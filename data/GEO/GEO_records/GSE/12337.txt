TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of PPARalpha-dependent alterations during cardiac hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Findings suggest that PPARalpha plays a decisive role in the development of hypertrophy, affecting the functional outcome of the heart. Unfortunately, information on the nature of PPARalpha-dependent processes in cardiac hypertrophy is fragmentary and incomplete. The primary aim of this study was to identify the processes and signaling pathways regulated by PPARalpha in hearts challenged by a chronic pressure overload by means of whole genome transcriptomic analysis. Second, we wanted to gain insight how PPARalpha modulates the identified processes, e.g. by trans-activation or by trans-repression. Keywords: 28 days of TAC

DESIGN
Wild-type and PPARalpha-/- mice were sham-operated or subjected to TAC for 28 days. Left ventricular gene expression profile was determined using Affymetrix 430 2.0 arrays containing over 45,000 probe sets (covering over 34,000 mouse genes) to detect PPARalpha-related differences in cardiac gene expression under basal conditions and after imposition of a sustained hemodynamic stress.
