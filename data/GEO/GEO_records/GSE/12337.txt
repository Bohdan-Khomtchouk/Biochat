TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of PPARalpha-dependent alterations during cardiac hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Findings suggest that PPARalpha plays a decisive role in the development of hypertrophy, affecting the functional outcome of the heart. Unfortunately, information on the nature of PPARalpha-dependent processes in cardiac hypertrophy is fragmentary and incomplete. The primary aim of this study was to identify the processes and signaling pathways regulated by PPARalpha in hearts challenged by a chronic pressure overload by means of whole genome transcriptomic analysis. Second, we wanted to gain insight how PPARalpha modulates the identified processes, e.g. by trans-activation or by trans-repression. Keywords: 28 days of TAC
