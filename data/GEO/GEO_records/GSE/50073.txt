TITLE
Expression data from RAW264.7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hypoxia promotes macrophage polarization triggered by IL-6.In an attempt to gain speciÔ¨Åc insight into the mechanism of macrophage polarization during hypoxia. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified distinct classes of changed genes during this process.

DESIGN
Four groups of RAW264.7 cells were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (normoxia control, normoxia+IL-6,hypoxia control,hypoxia+IL-6).
