TITLE
Expression Profiling:  Guanylate Cyclase Soluble Subunit Beta-3 (GUCY1B3) overexpression U87 MG cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA were extracted from Guanylate Cyclase Soluble Subunit Beta-3 (GUCY1B3) overexpression U87 MG stable cell lines and U87 MG cells. Three RNA samples of each of the two cell lines were used for microarray analysis to compare gene expression profile

DESIGN
Guanylate Cyclase Soluble Subunit Beta-3 (GUCY1B3) was cloned into pCDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO plasmid (Invitrgen) and then transfected into U87 MG (ATCC HTB-1) cells to generate stable overexpression cells. RNA from the stable cell lines and U87 MG were used for microarray
