TITLE
RNA-seq analysis reveals profound changes in transcript profiles between siCon- and siH19-transfected myotubes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used high throughput sequencing to analyze the transcriptional profiling of myotubes. By comparing the transcriptional profiling of myotubes with or without H19 knockdown,1131 genes or transcripts were found at least 1.5-fold up-regulated in siH19 relative to siCon cells, meanwhile 508 genes or transcripts were found at least 1.5-fold down-regulated in siH19 over siCon cells.

DESIGN
40h following initiation of differentiation, myotubes were transfected with either control siRNA or siH19. 48h later after transfection, total RNA was extracted for library preparation and RNA-seq analysis to compare trancript profiles between siCon and siH19 cells.
