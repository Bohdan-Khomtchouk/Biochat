TITLE
Comparison analysis of 2 week old C57BL6J lung exposed to 2 weeks of cigarette smoke compared to age-matched controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that gene expression in the cigarette smoke (CS) exposed neonatal lung and age-matched controls will be divergent.  CS exposed lung will have divergence of immune response genes and  structural genes.  The lungs of (6) 2 week old neonatal mice exposed to 2 weeks of CS were compared to the lung of (4) 2 week old age-matched control mice.  We utilized microarray analysis to examine transcriptional differences between smoke exposed neonatal lung and age-matched controls. Keywords: comparative expression profiling

DESIGN
This study utilizes microarray analysis to test these hypotheses. Six sets of lungs were harvested from CS exposed mice and four sets of lungs were harvested from age-matched control mice.  RNA was isolated and used for global gene expression profiling (Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 array). Statistically significant gene expression was determined as a minimum 6 counts of 9 pairwise comparisons, minimum 1.5-fold change, and p < 0.05. Further, Absolute | FC - FC SEM | > = 1.5.
