TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of LPS-responsive gene expression by microglia cells in Ntg and LRRK2KO mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of LRRK2-regulation of microglia responce to the LPS at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was whether LRRK2 influence the microglial phagocytosis- and neuroinflammation- related gene expression at mRNA level.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from microglia cells isolated from Ntg or LRRK2KO mouse brain subjected to  6 or 24 hours of LPS treatment in vitro

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
