TITLE
Blood gene expression profile from mouse C57Bl/10 exposed to chronic hypoxia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to study the gene expression profile in C57Bl/10 mouse blood, we exposed three different groups of animals. First was exposed to PO2 21% or normoxia. The second was exposed to chronic hypoxia (from PO2 21% to PO2 8%) and the third was also exposed to the same chronic hypoxia (CH) protocol but followed by two weeks under normoxia, and called as recovery group. The blood was extracted from inferior vena cava, the RNA was extracted, amplified and hybridized to Affimetrix MOE 430 V2.o chip. The results were analyzed using Partek Genome suite software. Using two fold cuttoff and 0% FDR parameters, we observed genes 512 diferentially expressed, of which one gene was up-regulated in both hypoxic and recovery condition, 202 were up-regulated during CH and then down-regulated after the recovery, 18 genes were down-regulated afteh CH and the up-regulated after recovery, ans finally 9 genes were down-regulated in both CH and recovery conditions.

DESIGN
Each group of  C57Bl/10 mouse had 4 individuals and they were divided into three different groups of animals. First was exposed to PO2 21% or normoxia for 14 days. The second was exposed to chronic hypoxia (from PO2 21% to PO2 8%) and the third was also exposed to the same chronic hypoxia (CH) protocol but followed by two weeks under normoxia, and called as recovery group. After the exposure period, the animals were anaesthetized with a mix of Ketamine (100 mg/mL) and xylasine (20 mg/mL) in a proportion of 1:1. A incison was made on abdominal area and from kidneis and liver area of inferior vena cava venus blood was collected  The blood was extracted from inferior vena cava. Then, the RNA was extracted, amplified and hybridized to Affimetrix MOE 430 V2.o chip. The results were analyzed using Partek Genome suite software. Using two fold cuttoff and 0% FDR parameters, we observed genes 512 diferentially expressed, of which one gene was up-regulated in both hypoxic and recovery condition, 202 were up-regulated during CH and then down-regulated after the recovery, 18 genes were down-regulated afteh CH and the up-regulated after recovery, ans finally 9 genes were down-regulated in both CH and recovery conditions.
