TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for knock down expression of semaphorin 3F

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression approach to biodosimetry, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish expression of semaphorin3F. Human colorectal cancer cell HCT116 was infected with empty control or eGFP-Sh-SEMA3F lentivirus,1468 genes was found altered significantly,709 genes was upregulated and 759 genes was downregulated significantly

DESIGN
knock down expression of semaphorin3F induced gene expression in human colorectal cancer cell was measured.  Three independent experiments were performed for each experiment
