TITLE
Oxidative and Cytokinin Treatment of CRF6

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Oxidative and Cytokinin treatment of Arabidopsis wildtype, crf6 mutant, and CRF6 overexpressing seedlings Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with oxidative stress or cytokinin to determine transcripts altered in each genotype background

DESIGN
We treated plants for 6hours with oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide (20mM)) or cytokinin (Benzyl Adenine (2microM) to determine target genes of CRF6
