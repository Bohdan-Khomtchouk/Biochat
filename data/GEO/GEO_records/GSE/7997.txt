SUMMARY
rs04-06_cdt1 - cdt1 - CDT1 is a protein of the pre-replication complex, and accumulates during the G1-S transition, thus play a major role in S-phase entry - Comparison of 3 independant RNAi lines Keywords: normal vs rnai mutant comparaison

DESIGN
3 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL5337 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.1
