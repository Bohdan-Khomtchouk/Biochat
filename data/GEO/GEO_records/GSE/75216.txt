TITLE
Investigating gene expression changes upon ageing in chm mutants

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report here mRNA-seq data of adult male Drosophila head tissues. We compare two different ages: young and midlife as well as chm/chameau (CG5229) heterozygous mutants.

DESIGN
Comparison of ageing effect (young vs. midlife) in wild-type and mutant.

PLATFORM
GPL19951 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Drosophila melanogaster)
