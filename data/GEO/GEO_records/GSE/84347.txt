TITLE
Transcriptome Profile of Lung Dendritic Cells after In Vitro Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) Infection

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Investigation of the transcriptome profile of lung dendritic cells (DCs) of two genetically different pig breeds (Pietrain and Duroc) after PRRSV infection in vitro and determination of the temporal changes in transcriptional profiles.

DESIGN
Pietrain and Duroc lung DCs were isolated and infected in vitro with PRRSV. Total cellular mRNA from non-infected (0 hours) and infected (3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 hours post infection) lung DCs was extracted and 12 lung DCs samples were used for the global transcriptome profile analysis (RNA-Seq).
