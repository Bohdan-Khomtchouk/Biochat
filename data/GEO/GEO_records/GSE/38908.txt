TITLE
Evidence of an Increased Pathogenic Footprint in the Lingual Microbiome of Untreated HIV Infected Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Opportunistic oral infections are ultimately presented in a vast majority of HIV-infected patients, often causing debilitating lesions that also contribute to deterioration in nutritional health.  Although appreciation for the role that the microbiota is likely to play in the initiation and/or enhancement of oral infections has grown considerably in recent years, little is known about the impact of HIV infection on host-microbe interactions within the oral cavity.  In the current study, we characterize modulations in the bacterial composition of the lingual microbiome in patients with treated and untreated HIV infection.  Bacterial species profiles were elucidated by microarray assay and compared between untreated HIV infected patients, HIV infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, and healthy HIV negative controls.  The relationship between clinical parameters (viral burden and CD4+ T cell depletion) and the loss or gain of bacterial species was evaluated in each HIV patient group.

DESIGN
Characterization of modulations in the dorsal tongue (lingual) microbiota that are associated with chronic HIV infection.
