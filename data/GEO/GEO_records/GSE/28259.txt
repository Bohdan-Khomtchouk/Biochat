TITLE
Differential Response of Streptococcus mutans Towards Friend and Foe in Mixed-Species Cultures

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
In the oral biofilm, the mitis streptococci are among the first group of organisms to colonize the tooth surface. Their proliferation is thought to be an important factor required for antagonizing the growth of cariogenic species such as Streptococcus mutans.  In this study, we used a 3-species mixed culture to demonstrate that another ubiquitous early colonizing species, Veillonella parvula, could greatly impact the competitive outcome of a mixed culture of S. mutans and S. gordonii.  Transcriptome analysis further revealed that S. mutans responds differentially to its friend (V. parvula) and foe (S. gordonii).  In the mixed culture with S. gordonii, all but one S. mutans sugar uptake and metabolic genes were down-regulated, while genes for alternative energy source utilization and H2O2 tolerance were up-regulated, resulting in a slower but persistent growth. In contrast, when cultured with V. parvula, S. mutans grew equally well or better than in monoculture and exhibited relatively few changes within its transcriptome.  When V. parvula was introduced into the mixed culture of S. mutans and S. gordonii, it rescued the growth inhibition of S. mutans.  In this 3-species environment, S. mutans increased the expression of genes required for the uptake and metabolism of minor sugars, while genes required for oxidative stress tolerance were down-regulated.  We conclude that the major factors affecting the competition between S. mutans and S. gordonii are carbohydrate utilization and H2O2 resistance.  The presence of V. parvula in the tri-species culture mitigates these two major factors and allows S. mutans to proliferate, despite the presence of S. gordonii.
