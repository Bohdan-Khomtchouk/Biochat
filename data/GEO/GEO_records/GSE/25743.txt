TITLE
EpCAM expressing Hs578T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EpCAM is frequently overexpressed in human invasive breast cancer. We reported EpCAM overexpression to be an independent prognostic marker for poor overall survival in node-positive breast cancer. We used microarrays in order to investigate changes of the transcriptome on EpCAM gene overexpression in human breast cancer cells

DESIGN
Hs578T cells were found to express only very little EpCAM mRNA and protein in comparison to established and well characterized breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7 or SK-BR-3. Hs578T cells were stably transfected with the EpCAM cDNA containing construct pIRESpuro3_EpCAM and the respective empty vector control.
