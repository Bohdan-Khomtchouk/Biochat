TITLE
Gene expression profiling in the leukemic stem cell-enriched CD34+ fraction identifies target genes that predict prognosis in normal karyotype AML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mononuclear cells from AML patients (n=46) were sorted into CD34+ and CD34- subfractions and genome-wide expression analysis was performed using Illumina BeadChip Arrays (HT12 v3). Of 2 AML samples only the CD34+ fraction could be analyzed. AML CD34+ and CD34- gene expression was compared to a large group of normal CD34+ bone marrow cells (n=31).

DESIGN
Mononuclear cells from AML patients (n=46) were sorted into CD34+ (46) and CD34- (44) subfractions and genome-wide expression analysis was performed using Illumina BeadChip Arrays (HT12 v3). AML CD34+ and CD34- gene expression was compared to a large group of normal CD34+ bone marrow cells (n=31).
