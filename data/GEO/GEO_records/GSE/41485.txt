TITLE
Expression data of A939572 SCD1 inhibitor treated ccRCC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Presently, there is a deficiency of effective therapies designed to target clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), with poor prognosis resulting in patients with advanced disease. Additionally, there is a lack of molecular factors which can be remedially targeted resulting in tumor specific inhibition, and therefore current therapeutic approaches often produce adverse side effects in patients. We identified that Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) was consistently overexpressed in patient ccRCC samples, and further investigation of SCD1 as a potential molecular target for ccRCC intervention utilizing a SCD1 inhibitor (A939572) resulted in tumor specific growth inhibition and induction of cell death. In order to understand the mechanism by which the SCD1 inhibitor mediated its anti-tumor effects, we performed gene array analysis and compared expression patterns between treated and untreated samples.

DESIGN
Four established ccRCC cell lines purchased from ATCC were treated with DMSO control versus A939572 over a 24 hour time period. RNA from each group was isolated and sent of for gene array anaylsis. Gene expression data from each individual treatment group was normalized to its respective DMSO contol, and resulting expression patterns associated with drug exposure was compared between the four cell lines.
