TITLE
Transcriptome response to heat stress in the chicken hepatocellular carcinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Background: Heat stress triggers an evolutionarily conserved set of responses in cells. The transcriptome responds to hyperthermia by altering expression of genes to adapt the cell or organism to survive the heat challenge. RNA-seq technology allows rapid identification of environmentally responsive genes on a large scale. In this study, we have used RNA -seq to identify heat stress responsive genes in the chicken male white-leghorn hepat ocellular (LMH) cell line. Result: The transcripts of 812 genes were responsive to heat stress (p < 0.01) with 235 genes up- regulated and 577 down-regulated following 2.5 hours of heat stress. Among the up- regulated were genes whose products function as chaperones, along with genes aff ecting collagen synthesis and deposition, transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and genes modulating the WNT and TGF-beta pathways. Predominant among the down-regulated genes were ones that affect DNA replication and repair along with chromosom al segregation. Many of the genes identified in this study have not been previously implicated in the heat stress response. Conclusion: These data extend our understanding of the transcriptome response to heat stress. Many of the identified biological processes and pathways likely function in adapting cells and organisms to hyperthermic stress. This study may provide important guides to future efforts attempting to improve species abilities to withstand heat stress through genome wide association studies and breeding. In addition, the genes down regulated by heat stress may provide important targets for improving hyperthemic treatment in cancer patients.
