TITLE
Gene expression analysis of different subtypes of GSCs upon miR-128 overexpression or downregulation and after knockdown of Polycomb components BMI1 and SUZ12

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the change of global transcriptome landscape among proneural and mesenchymal GSCs, after the transient knockdown of polycomb repressor complex and upon deregulations of miR-128 in different subtypes of GSCs

DESIGN
Pateient derived GSCs were classified among Proneural and Mesenchymal subtypes. Stable GSC were prepared with either overexpression or downregulation of miR-128. The polycomb repressor components BMI1 and SUZ12 were downregulated using siRNA.
