TITLE
RNA-seq reveals changes in sphingolipid metabolism upon transformation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from three independent pairs of mock and c-SRC transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts and examined changes in expression of sphingolipid metabolism genes

DESIGN
Three independent cultures of NIH3T3 MEFs were retrovirally transduced with either pBabe-Puro, og pBabe-Puro containing c-srcY527F. After a 7 day of selection in puromycine the three vector and three src transduced pools were propagated for RNA sequencing.
