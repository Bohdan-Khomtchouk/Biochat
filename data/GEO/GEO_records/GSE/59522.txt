TITLE
Autophagy mediates the mitotic senescence transition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ER:RAS-G12V expressing IMR90 cells were given 100nM 4-OHT and assessed for transcriptional profiling at various time points.

DESIGN
IMR90 cells expressing a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) inducible estrogen receptor (ER)-coupled RAS-G12V (ER:RAS-G12V) were given 100nM 4-OHT for these eight time points (0, 2, 8, 24hrs, 2, 4, 6 and 8days) then analysed for transcriptional profiling using the illumina expression array platform (human-6 v2 Expression BeadChips). There were three biological replicates (batch A, B and D) for each of the time points.
