TITLE
Genome wide DNA Methylation Study in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential DNA methylation was identified in CdLS, and correlates to cohesin binding as well. However, DNA methylation may only be one of several events that regulate gene expression in humans.

DESIGN
63 Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 39 CdLS probands, 2 RBS probands and 22 gender and racial matched healthy controls were tested on HumanMethylation27 DNA Analysis BeadChip (Illumina) which carries 27,578 highly informative CpG sites derived from the well-annotated NCBI CCDS database

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
