TITLE
Long-term Clofibric acid study

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
F344 rats were divided into 4 groups: vehicle control, DEN, DEN+CLO and CLO. After one week of basal diet, rats belonging to the groups DEN and DEN+CLO underwent intraperitoneal injection of DEN (30mg/kg body weight) dissolved in NaCl 9‰. The two other groups were injected with NaCl 9‰ alone. At 30mg/kg, DEN is non-necrogenic thus only exhibiting initiating properties. Twelve days after injection, diet from rats belonging to the groups CLO and DEN+CLO was changed for diet containing 5000ppm CLO for up to 608 days. Series of 5 rats from each group were necropsied at days 18, 46, 102, 264, 377, 447 (reverse phase from day 377: no more CLO in the diet for rats belonging to the DEN+CLO group), and for the CLO and Control group 524, and 608 days after the injection of DEN or saline. From day 524, half of the CLO-treated rats were kept on basal diet (reverse phase) until day 608. Keywords = Clofibric acid Keywords = Diethylnitrosamine Keywords = Rat Keywords: other
