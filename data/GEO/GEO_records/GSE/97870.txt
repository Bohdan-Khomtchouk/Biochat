TITLE
Tissue-specific CTCF/Cohesin-mediated chromatin architecture delimits enhancer interactions and function in vivo (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The genome is organized via CTCF/cohesin binding sites, which partition chromosomes into 1-5Mb topologically associated domains (TADs), and further into smaller contact sub-domains within TADs (sub-TADs; 40-1000kb). Here we examined in vivo an ~80kb sub-TAD, containing the mouse α-globin gene cluster, lying within a ~1Mb TAD. We find that the sub-TAD is flanked by predominantly convergent CTCF/cohesin sites which are ubiquitously bound by CTCF but only interact during erythropoiesis, defining a self-interacting erythroid compartment. Whereas the α-globin regulatory elements normally act solely on promoters downstream of the enhancers, removal of a conserved upstream CTCF/cohesin boundary extends the sub-TAD to the adjacent upstream CTCF/cohesin binding site. The α-globin enhancers now interact with the flanking chromatin, upregulating expression of genes within this extended sub-TAD. Rather than acting solely as a barrier to chromatin modification, CTCF/cohesin boundaries in this sub-TAD regulate both directionality and specificity of enhancer interactions with surrounding promoters.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of globin-depleted polyA-isolated RNA libraries isolated from primary erythroid ter119+ cells obtained from the spleens of acetylphenylhydrazine treated mice. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were comparied with mice containing deletions for HS-29 (D29) or HS-38 and HS-39 (D3839) CTCF binding sites. Biological triplicates are included for each mouse and are analysed compared to WT (C57)
