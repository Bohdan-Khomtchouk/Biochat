TITLE
Distinct Sets of Genetic Alterations in Melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared genome-wide DNA copy number alterations and mutational status in BRAF and RAS genes of 126 primary melanomas arising in four groups in which UV exposure differ: skin with (n=30), and without chronic sun damage (n=40); palms, soles and subungual (acral) sites (n=36) (which have very little sun exposure); and mucosa (n=20) (no sun exposure).
