TITLE
MicroRNAs and Metabolites in Serum Change after Chemotherapy and Impact on Haematopoietic Progenitor Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic reconstitution after chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) requires massive activation of the stem cell pool. In a previous study, we have shown that there are systemically released factors in patient serum after HSCT that may play an important role in hematopoietic recovery, and that these serum samples significantly stimulate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HPC) in vitro expansion. Aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression is a feature of leukemia and miRNAs also play a significant role in normal hematopoiesis and differentiation. In this study, we have addressed the question if miRNAs and metabolic pathways are involved in HPC activation after HSCT. Serum from patients before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy during aplasia was used as supplement for in vitro cultivation of CD34+ HPCs. Serum taken after chemotherapy significantly enhanced HSC proliferation and maintained a primitive CD34+ immunophenotype. Microarray analysis revealed that 23 miRNAs are differentially expressed in serum before and after chemotherapy - particularly miRNA-320 and miRNA-1275 were down-regulated and miRNA-3663-3p was up-regulated. This suggest that hematopoietic regeneration after chemotherapy might be tightly regulated by miRNAs and this opens new perspectives for in vivo stimulation of the stem cell pool.

DESIGN
Serum taken from 9 patients before and after chemotherapy as well as 7 healhy donors was analyzed for miRNA expression.
