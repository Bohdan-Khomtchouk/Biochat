TITLE
Yeast Genomic Expression Patterns in Response to Zymolyase Treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We used microarray to investigate the influence of zymolyase treatment which is used for degradation of yeast cell wall. Two types of RNA extraction methods were used, and zymolyase preprocessing was applied to one among them. The qualities of total RNA extracted by two extraction methods were checked, and then RNAs were used for generating cloned DNA and RNA. Finally, two types of cRNA were hybridized to Affymetrix yeast genome 2.0_array. Keywords: comparison of RNA extraction process

DESIGN
Yeast BY4743 was grown in YPD media containing 0.01% SDS, and was applied for two types of RNA extraction method.

PLATFORM
GPL2529 [Yeast_2] Affymetrix Yeast Genome 2.0 Array
