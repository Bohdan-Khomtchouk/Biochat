TITLE
Genome-wide profiling and validation for forensic tissue-specific DNA methylation markers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Forensic body fluid identification is important for crime scene reconstruction. We used Illumina HumanMethylation 450K bead array containing over the 450,000 CpG sites in 16 body fluid samples to find novel DNA methylation marker for forensic body fluid identification.

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in 16 body fluid samples

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
