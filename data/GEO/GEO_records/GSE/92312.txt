TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of two potato cultivars in response to “Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum” infection

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
In this study we compare the transcriptome response of two potato varieties Atlantic and NY138 to the infection by Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum. Four weeks old potato plant grown in growth chamber were infested with potato psyllid to transmit the pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum. Three weeks after infestation leaf samples were collected for RNA extraction and transcriptome analysis. This is the first transcriptome study on this potato disease.

DESIGN
Two factorial design experiment with two potato varieites Atlantic and NY138, and two treatment: no infection compared to infection by Candidatus liberibacter solanacearum

PLATFORM
GPL16436 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Solanum tuberosum)
