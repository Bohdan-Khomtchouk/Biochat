TITLE
Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells towards hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand in detail the molecular phases that occur during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to hepatocyte-like cells we performed an RNA-seq time course of the stages of differentiation across the 21 day differentiation time course. We used a chemically defined (serum-free) protocol, modified from Si-Tayeb et al., 2010 and Song et al., 2009. We describe acquisition of definitive endoderm characteristics at day 3, followed by hepatoblast charcter at day 7-13 and then maturation to hepatocyte-like cells at day 21.

DESIGN
Time course of differentiation of human embryoic stem cells to hepatocyte-like cells over 21 days, using an adapted chemically defined protocol of Song et al., 2009; Cell Research
