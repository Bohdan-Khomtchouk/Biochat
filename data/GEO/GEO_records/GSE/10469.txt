TITLE
Time course progression of BMP4-treated hESC gene expressions under 4 % and 20 % oxygen conditions.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H1 hESC were exposed to BMP4 (10 ng/ml) in absence of FGF2 for 0, 3, 12, 24, 72, and 120 h under both physiological (4 % O2) and atmospheric (20 % O2) conditions to identify candidate genes and gene networks associated with specification from totipotent precursor cells to trophoblast. RNA from cells under both conditions was isolated at each time point. Approximately 32,000 probe sets (out of 40,391) provided a signal above background at one of the time points. Of these, 14,478 showed a â‰¥2-fold (plus or minus) change (p < 0.05) under 4 % O2, and 18,580 under 20 % O2. The data indicate the potential usefulness of hESC grown in presence of BMP4 and absence of FGF2 for studying both the emergence of trophoblast from hESC precursors and for its subsequent differentiation over time, space and varied O2 concentrations. Keywords: Genes and gene networks associated with specification from totipotent precursor cells to trophoblast

DESIGN
Twelve sets of H1 hESC RNA were prepared from BMP4 treated cells for 0, 3, 12, 24, 72, and 120 h under both physiological (4 % O2) and atmospheric (20 % O2) and cultured on Matrigel coated six-well plate.
