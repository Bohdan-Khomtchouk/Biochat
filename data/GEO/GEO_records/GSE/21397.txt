TITLE
Continuous gene expression profile of leaf throughout the entire growth in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
A continuous gene expression profiling of leaves at regular interval from transplanting until harvesting was performed to understand the changes of transcriptional program and physiological state throughout entire growth of the rice plant.

DESIGN
For continuous gene expression profile of leaf, the uppermost fully-expanded leaf, 1st leaf before 83 days after transplanting (DAT) and flag leaf from then on, in the main stem was sampled at 12:00 PM at regular intervals of 7 days encompassing 17 different growth stages with three replicates.
