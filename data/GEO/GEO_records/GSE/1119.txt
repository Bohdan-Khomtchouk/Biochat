TITLE
Hac1p control of unfolded protein response

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
All samples are of the genotype listed in the title (e.g. W303, delta-hac1, etc.).  Samples treated with DTT were treated for 60 min with 6 mM DTT.  Samples  with 'dT' in the title were concurrently shifted from 23°C to 37°C; otherwise, samples were grown at 30°C.  All array data is from two independent experiments, with data listed as two files designated " A " and " B " , except for the " ADH1pro DTT " expt, which was performed once.  The data sets were filtered with NOMAD to include only " high quality " data. Keywords: other
