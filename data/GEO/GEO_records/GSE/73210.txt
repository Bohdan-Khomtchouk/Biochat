TITLE
Identification of factors involved in target RNA-directed microRNA degradation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanism by which micro (mi)RNAs control their target gene expression is now well understood. It is however less clear how the level of miRNAs themselves is regulated. Under specific conditions, abundant and highly complementary target RNA can trigger miRNA degradation by a mechanism involving nucleotide addition and exonucleolytic degradation. One such mechanism has been previously observed to occur naturally during viral infection. To date, the molecular details of this phenomenon are not known. We report here that both the degree of complementarity and the ratio of miRNA/target abundance are crucial for the efficient decay of the small RNA. Using a proteomic approach based on the transfection of biotinylated antimiRNA oligonucleotides, we set to identify the factors involved in target-mediated miRNA degradation. Among the retrieved proteins, we identified members of the RNA-induced silencing complex, but also RNA modifying and degradation enzymes. We further validate and characterize the importance of one of these, the Perlman Syndrome 3’-5’ exonuclease DIS3L2. We show that this protein interacts with Argonaute 2 and functionally validate its role in target-directed miRNA degradation both by artificial targets and in the context of mouse cytomegalovirus infection.

DESIGN
To show the importance of TUT1 and DIS3L2 in target-induced miRNA decay we knocked-down by RNAi these two genes, either individually or in combination, and measured the effect of antimiRNA oligonucleotides by cloning and sequencing small RNAs. As a negative control, we used an siRNA directed against the RLUC gene. We generated one library per condition.
