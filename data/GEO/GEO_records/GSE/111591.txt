TITLE
Loss of integrin αvβ8 on murine hepatocytes accelerates liver regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We assess the difference in overall gene expression levels post 2/3 hepatectomy in mouse livers as a result of loss of integrin αvβ8, through microArray experiments. We hypothesized that depletion of hepatocyte integrin αvβ8 would increase hepatocyte proliferation and accelerate liver regeneration following injury. Through use of microarray experiments we identify genes that are up/down regulated only in the mice with integrin αvβ8 depletion.

DESIGN
Four replicates of β8flox/flox / Alb-Cre- baseline adult livers (uninjured) were compared to four replicates of β8flox/flox / Alb-Cre- remnant liver following 2/3 hepatectomy, and four replicates of β8flox/flox / Alb-Cre+ baseline adult liver (uninjured) compared with four relicates of β8flox/flox / Alb-Cre+ remnant liver following 2/3 hepatectomy. All samples are 24 hours post hepatectomy.
