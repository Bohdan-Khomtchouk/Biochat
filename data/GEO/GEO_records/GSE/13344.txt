TITLE
Exon Array expression data from 13 areas of the late second trimester human brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tissue was microdissected from 13 regions, including 9 distinct neocortical areas, from both left and right sides of four late second trimester human brain specimens. Gene- and exon-level differential expression analyses were performed by mixed model, nested analysis of variance using the XRAY software from Biotique Systems.

DESIGN
For initial analysis, all neocortex samples were grouped together. In subsequent analyses, neocortex areas were compared with each other. In most analyses reported, left and right side samples were treated as additional biological replicates.
