TITLE
Exon Array expression data from 13 areas of the late second trimester human brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tissue was microdissected from 13 regions, including 9 distinct neocortical areas, from both left and right sides of four late second trimester human brain specimens. Gene- and exon-level differential expression analyses were performed by mixed model, nested analysis of variance using the XRAY software from Biotique Systems.
