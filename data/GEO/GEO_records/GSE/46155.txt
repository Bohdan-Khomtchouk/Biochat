TITLE
Comparative analysis of the Trichoderma reesei transcriptome during growth on the cellulase inducing substrates wheat straw and lactose

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
We have examined and compared the transcriptome of T. reesei growing on wheat straw and lactose as carbon sources under otherwise similar conditions.  Gene expression on wheat straw exceeded that on lactose, and 1619 genes were found to be only induced on wheat straw but not on lactose. They comprised 30 % of the CAZome, but were also enriched in genes associated with phospholipid metabolism, DNA synthesis and repair and iron homeostatis. Two thirds of the CAZome was expressed both on wheat straw as well as on lactose, but 60 % of it at least > 2-fold higher on the former. Major wheat straw specific genes comprised xylanases, chitinases and ÃŸ-mannosidases. Interestingly, the latter two CAZyme families were significantly higher expressed in a strain in which xyr1 encoding the major regulator of cellulase and hemicellulase biosynthesis is non-functional, demonstrating that XYR1 is a repressor of these genes.
