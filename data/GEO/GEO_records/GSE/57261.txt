TITLE
Study the effect of calreticulin knockdown on genome-wide transcript expression in HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective was to evaluate the status of the global hepatic transcriptome in the presence of inhibited calreticulin levels. Results identify a total of 324 genes were altered of which 245 genes were downregulated and 79 genes were upregulated. This suggests that such altered genes might be associated with altered hepatic physiology that are observed during calreticulin deficiency.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells subjected to calreticulin (CRT) siRNA for 24 hours compared to control HepG2 cells subjected to scramble siRNA for 24 hours. This was then hybridized to Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip arrays.
