TITLE
A cross-comparison of technologies for the detection of microRNAs from FFPE samples of hepatoblastoma patients [microarray]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This work highlights similarities and differences between three platforms (next-generation sequencing, microarray and NanoString) for detecting miRNAs and compares their strengths and weaknesses.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiles were determined in 6 Hepatoblastoma FFPE samples using a microarray platform.

PLATFORM
GPL16384 [miRNA-3] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-3 Array
