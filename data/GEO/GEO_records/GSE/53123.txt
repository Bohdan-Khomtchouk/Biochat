TITLE
Expression data from MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM cells grown in serum free medium, untreated, treated with direct (A-769662) and indirect (AICAR) AMPK activators.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (Molt-4 and CCRF-CEM) were treated with direct (A-769662) and indirect (AICAR) AMPK activators. Molt-4 and CCRF-CEM cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1582 and CCL-119). Control samples were used for the analysis of metabolic differences between cell lines. Therefore the data was analyzed in combination with, metabolomic data, and the genome-scale reconstruction of human metabolism. For experiments cells were grown in serum-free medium containing DMSO (0.67%) at a cell concentration of 5 x 105 cells/mL.

DESIGN
We analyzed acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (Molt-4 and CCRF-CEM) treated with direct (A-769662) and indirect (AICAR) AMPK activators, along with controls. We used the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array to measure whole genome exon expression.
