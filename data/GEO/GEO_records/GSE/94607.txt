TITLE
Arabidopsis CLE peptide hormones contribute to pollen development through precisely regulated transcriptomic and proteomic networks

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptide hormones are required for numerous plant growth and developmental processes. However, little is known regarding the function and working mechanism of the CLEs in the anther. Here, using RNA in situ hybridization analyses, we identified 7 CLE genes that are specifically expressed in the tapetum and microsporocytes in the anther, and the dominant-negative mutant plants of each of these genes exhibited significantly reduced anther size, pollen number, and abnormal pollen wall formation. Further transcriptomic and proteomic studies on cle19, DN-CLE19, and CLE19-OX mutant lines revealed that CLE19 affected the expression of more than 1,000 genes at the RNA level and 595 at the protein level, including genes involved in pollen coat and pollen exine formation, lipid metabolism, pollen germination, and hormone metabolism processes. Phenotypic analyses of mutants of the CLE19 downstream genes GRP20, ACOS5 and MEE48 revealed that the formation of pollen exine was affected in these mutants, confirming that these genes function downstream of CLE19 in the regulation of pollen wall formation. These findings demonstrate the function and downstream genes of CLE19 and redundant genes, providing insights into working pathways of the peptide hormones in pollen development.

DESIGN
mRNA-seq data of wild type (WT and C24), CLE19::DNCLE19 and 35S::CLE19 transgenic plants stage 4-10 anther were generated by deep sequencing by the Illuminaâ„¢ Hi-seq 2000 system
