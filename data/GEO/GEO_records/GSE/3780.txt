TITLE
FM95-14 Fetal Myoblast Differentiation Time Series

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fetal myoblasts represent an important source of myogenic stem cells. Analysis of undifferentiated myoblasts and comparison to their cognate differentiated progeny will allow the ascertainment of genes that are important for maintaining myogenic stem cells. Fetal myoblasts (undifferentiated, time 0hr) will be compared to myoblasts cells allowed to differentiate by the removal of the SKBM-2 medium + growth factors and feeding with DMEM + 2.5% Horse serum. Time course : 0 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, 18 hr, 24 hr, 36 hr, 48 hr, 3 days, 4 days, 7 days Keywords: other
