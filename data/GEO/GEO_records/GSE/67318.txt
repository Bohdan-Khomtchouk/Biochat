TITLE
Global DNA methylation landscape reveals roles of DNA methylation involved in the regulation of drug metabolizing enzyme [I]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to elucidate the role of DNA methylation in the DME gene regulation, global DNA methylation and mRNA expression profiles of human tissues and cell lines were examinde by HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip and SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8×60K v2. We demonstrated DNA methylation landscape of the DME genes in human tissues. Although a fraction of DME genes can be regulated by their DNA methylation, the variable DNA methylation status probably affects drug metabolism and response.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 2 human tissues (liver and small intestine) and 3 human hepatoma cells that were treated with or without 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine, and used for mRNA expression analysis.
