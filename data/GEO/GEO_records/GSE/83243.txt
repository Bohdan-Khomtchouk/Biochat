TITLE
Disruption of the ATXN1-CIC complex causes a spectrum of neurobehavioral phenotypes in mice and humans

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We isolated RNAs from Otp-lineage cells in the mouse brain using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) approach. We compared two groups of mice: Otp-cre; ROSAfsTRAP (control) and Otp-cre; Cicf/f; ROSAfsTRAP (conditional knockout). Following RNA isolation, RNAseq was performed and gene expression profiles were compared between controls and conditional knockouts.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression in Otp-lineage neurons in two mouse groups.
