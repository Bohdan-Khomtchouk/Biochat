TITLE
Expression changes following conditional deletion of SMARCA4 (Brg) in mouse embryonic stem cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq 72 h after acute deletion of Smarca4 in a line of conditional knockout mouse embryonic stem cells to examine altered gene expression.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA in mouse embryonic stem cells expressing conditional knockout of the mSWI/SNF ATPase Smarca4. For these studies, mRNA was harvested from Smarca4-CreER (Smarca4flfl) conditional knockout cells 72 h after treatment with either ethanol (EtOH) or 0.8 uM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Tam).
