TITLE
Strain differences in e11.5 XY gonad transcriptome suggest a mechanism for the sensitivity of C57BL/6J to sex reversal

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of individual mouse embryonic (e11.5) XY gonads comparing inbred strains that are sensitive (C57BL/6J) and resistant (129S1/SvImJ) to XY sex reversal, and their reciprocal F1 hybrids.

DESIGN
Two-color Agilent microarray profiles of 20 individual pairs of e11.5 XY gonads, including 5- C57BL/6J, 5- 129S1/SvImJ, 5- (B6x129S1)F1, and 5- (129S1xB6)F1 samples. Within each strain, samples were collected from multiple litters to account for potential litter biases. All samples were processed following the same protocol.
