TITLE
Su(H) bound regions in Nicd induced wing-disc hyperplasia

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The outcome of Notch activation on proliferation depends on cellular context. In Drosophila wing discs Notch activation causes hyperplasia despite having localized inhibitory effects on proliferation. To understand the underlying mechanisms we have used genomic strategies to identify the Notch-Su(H) target genes directly activated during wing disc hyperplasia. These data are the results from ChIP-Chip experiments to identify genomic regions occupied by Su(H) in hyperplastic Nicd-expressing Drosophila wing discs.

DESIGN
2 independent replicates; Immunoprecipitation perfomed with Su(H) antibody on chromatin isolated from wing discs overexpressing Nicd (abxUbxFLPase; Act > y > Gal4, UAS GFP; FRT82B tubGal80 with UAS-Nicd; FRT82B) and compared to the total input DNA.
