SUMMARY
Signaling of the RET receptor is crucial for the migration, proliferation, differentiation and survival of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) that form the enteric nervous system (ENS). Disturbances in RET signaling are associated with ENS defects, as is seen in patients with Hirschsprung disease. However, the downstream effectors of RET signalling in ENCCs is largely unknown. This study aims to gain new insight into the pathways involved in or triggered by RET in ENCCs. We used microarrays to detect the gene expression of mouse embryonic ENCCs when we stimulated with GDNF compare to control without GDNF and also compare to the gene expression of mouse embryonic gut (all are isolated from mouse embryonic day 14.5). Our aim is to gain insight of RET-GDNF downstream effectors and also all signalling pathways that regulate by RET-GDNF in ENCCs during development.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression profiling with RNA isolated from GDNF- (the RET ligand) stimulated and non-stimulated mouse ENCCs and also from mouse embryonic gut E14.5. We compare these three set of microarray data to each other and analyzed single-gene analysis methods. by this analysis we could detect genes that regulate by RET-GDNF signalling in ENCCs and by comparing data of ENCCs with and without GDNF to the expression data of mouse embryonic gut in the same stage of development, we could also detect gene that specifically express in ENCCs dependent and independently of RET-GDNF signalling. We analyzed the gene expression data of ENCCs with and without GDNF by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to detect which pathways are down- and up-regulated by RET-GDNF signalling.
