ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1

SUMMARY
We ran for each studied culture (WCFS1 NZ7608 and NZ7603) one aerobe and one anaerobe batch cultivation and designed one experiment. The hybridization scheme of the experiment (6 arrays) was as follows: WCFS1_aerobe NZ7608-aerobe NZ7603-aerobe WCFS1_aerobe and then three extra hybridizations: WCFS1_anaerobe w WCFS1_aerobe; NZ7608_anaerobe NZ7608_aerobe; and NZ7603_anaerobe NZ7603_aerobe. In the experiment we compared (1) the effect of oxygen in each studied culture and (2) the difference in response toward aerobe and anaerobe conditions of each mutant compared to the wild type Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
