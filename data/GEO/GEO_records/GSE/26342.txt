TITLE
Reconstruction of an integrative gene regulatory meta-network reveals cell cycle and antiviral response as major drivers of cervical cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cervical cancer is the one of the most common cancer type among women worldwide, with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) playing a causal role in this disease.  We applied a novel integrative approach to understand the disease process and find its major drivers. We performed a meta-analysis of gene expression and chromosomal aberration studies comprising data on over 500 patients for the reconstruction of a regulatory meta-network. We found that two sub-networks representing cell cycle and antiviral response (largely involving interferon pathways) were driven by chromosomal amplifications of key regulator genes. In the majority of patients, the two types of drivers were located in the same regions of chromosomal aberrations on 3q, 1q and 1p suggesting that a synergistic effect of both processes is necessary for cervical oncogenesis. In addition, our results revealed a cause of antiviral response in the tumor supporting a model of cervical carcinogenesis in which the loss of episomal HPV mediated by immune response promotes the expression of integrated viral oncogenes and tumor progression. This series is a part of meta-analysis on gene expression in cervical cancer

DESIGN
Forty cervical cancer biopsies and twenty normal adjacent tissue samples were obtained from patients with cervical squamous cell carcinomas. Twelve tumor samples were hybridized as pools of two samples, due to RNA quantity limitations. So, in total, there are 34 cervical cancer and 20 normal sample arrays. We used an internal reference design, where the reference RNA sample consisted of a pool of amplified RNAs from cervical cancer biopsies.
