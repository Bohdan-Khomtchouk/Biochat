TITLE
Chicken Spleen Tissues: MDV-infected vs non-infected in inbred lines 63, 72 & RCSM

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of chicken spleen tissues from Marek's disease virus (MDV) infected and non-infected control individuals from three inbred chicken lines 63, 72, RCSM with varying disease resistance characteristics. Line 63 is highly resistant; line 72 is highly susceptible; and line RCSM has intermediate resistance.  Our goal was to investigate the genetic basis of systemic variation in disease resistance in these genetically similar individuals. Three time points were chosen at different stages of disease progression - 5 days post-infection (dpi) - early cytolytic phase; 10 dpi - latent phase; and 21 dpi - late cytolytic phase with 4 replicates at each stage.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MDV infected sample vs non-infected control, 3 chicken lines - 63, 72 and RCSM, 3 time points - 5, 10 & 21 dpi. Biological replicates: 4 non-infected control replicates, 4 infected replicates for each line at each time point.
