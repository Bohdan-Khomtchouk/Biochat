TITLE
Gene expression analyses of GSC11 cell in stem cell culture conditions or in differentiation conditions for 1, 3, or 7 days

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although fetal bovine serum (FBS) induces the differentiation of cancer stem cells, the underlying mechanism by which this is accomplished has not been clarified. Whether reactive oxygen species affect the differentiation of cancer stem cells in solid tumors as they do in normal stem cells is not known. This study aimed to determine the role of reactive oxygen species in the FBS-induced differentiation of glioblastoma stem cells. We found that FBS activated the oxidative stress response system in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). The resulting differentiated cells showed tremendous increases in mitochondrial superoxide and oxygen consumption, accompanied by a loss in stem cell markers and a gain in differentiation markers. The antioxidant N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) inhibited the mitochondrial superoxide increase and prevented the glioblastoma stem cells from differentiating. It appears that FBS-induced cancer stem cell differentiation is caused by mitochondrial activation, which depends on increases in levels of mitochondrial superoxide.

DESIGN
GSC11 cells were cultured in stem cell medium or differentiated medium for 1, 3, or 7 days in triplicate. Total RNA was extracted from 12 samples. Microarray experiment and data analysis were done at Dept. of Systems Biology, MDACC (Houston, USA)
