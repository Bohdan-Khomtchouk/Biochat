TITLE
Phenotypic, genomic and functional characterization reveals no differences between CD138++ and CD138low subpopulations in multiple myeloma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite recent advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), it remains an incurable disease potentially due to the presence of resistant myeloma cancer stem cells (MM-CSC). Although the presence of clonogenic cells in MM was described more than 30 years ago, the phenotype of MM-CSC is still a matter of debate, especially with respect to the expression of syndecan- 1 (CD138). Here, we demonstrate the presence of two subpopulations - CD138++ (95-99%) and CD138low (1-5%) - in eight MM cell lines. To find out possible stem-cell-like features, we have phenotypically, genomic and functionally characterized the two subpopulations. Our results show that the minor CD138low subpopulation is morphologically identical to the CD138++ fraction and does not represent a more immature B-cell compartment (with lack of CD19, CD20 and CD27 surface expression). Moreover, both subpopulations have similar gene expression and genomic profiles. Importantly, both CD138++ and CD138low subpopulations have similar sensitivity to bortezomib, melphalan and doxorubicin. Finally, serial engraftment in SCID mice shows that CD138++ as well as CD138low cells have self-renewal potential and they are also phenotypically interconvertible. Overall, our results differ from previously published data which attribute a B-cell phenotype to MM-CSC and urge the need to explore more reliable markers to discriminate true clonogenic myeloma cells.

DESIGN
To compare the gene expression profile of the subpopulations CD138++ and CD138low within the MM cell line, RPMI-8226. RNA was isolated from CD138++ (n=3) and CD138low (n=3) RPMI-8226 cells. RNA was hybridized to Human Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix) according to Affymetrix protocols [Gutierrez, 2005, 402]. Microarray data were normalized using the Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) algorithm implemented in the Affymetrix Expression Console. Data analysis was carried out using DNA-Chip Analyzer software (DChip). The comparison criteria used in DChip analysis were fold change E/B≥2 or B/E≥2, mean difference E-B > 100 or B-E > 100 and the lower 90% confidence bound of fold-change was used
