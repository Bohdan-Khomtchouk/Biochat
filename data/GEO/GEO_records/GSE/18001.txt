TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of toc1-2 transcriptional networks

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To gain insights into the mechanisms of TOC1 function in the Arabidopsis circadian clock we performed transcriptional profiling of Wild-Type (WT) and and TOC1 mutant  plants (toc1-2) under constant light conditions for two days.

DESIGN
Comparisons of WT and toc1-2. Two biological replicates each per array. Two Arabidopsis Oligonucleotide Microarrays (two-color Cy3 and Cy5). synchronized under 12-hour light:12-hour dark (LD) cycles for 10 days followed by two days under constant light conditions. Samples were collected at circadian time 16 (CT16).
