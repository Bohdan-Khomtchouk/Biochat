TITLE
Expression data from glioma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to select the genes associated glioma patients survival. This study aimed to define genes associated with survival.  Expression profiling was performed on 50 gliomas. A gene classifier was developed.

DESIGN
Fifty glioma patients were selected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
