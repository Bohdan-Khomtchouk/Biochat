TITLE
RNA sequencing of organoids isolated from pancreatic cancer mouse model KRASG12D; p53R172H; Ptf1a-Cre.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We studied the transcriptomics of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and the role of a splicing factor called SF3B1 in this context. We generated mice that will develop PDAC via an inducible expression of KRASG12D; p53R172H specifically in the pancreas using a Ptf1a-Cre.

DESIGN
We have isolated organoids from: KrasG12D; p53R172H (KP), KrasG12D; p53R172H; Ptf1a-Cre (KPC) , KrasG12D; p53R172H; SF3b1 Fl/+ (KPS), and KrasG12D; p53R172H; Ptf1a-Cre; SF3b1 Fl/+ (KPCS) mice. We have 3 organoids per group, representing 3 biological replicates. We have exposed the organoids to normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (3%O2).
