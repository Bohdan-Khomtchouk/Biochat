TITLE
Gene expression profile of PBMCs in response to metreleptin treatment at different time points.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we evaluated the modulation of gene expression profile in PBMCs from patients with hypotalamic amenorrhea. We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes differentially expressed upon metreleptin treatment at different time points, week 12, 24 and 36.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile induced by metreleptin treatment in  PBMCs from hypotalamic amenorrhea subjects.
