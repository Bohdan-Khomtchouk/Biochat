TITLE
Mediating effects of miR-155 on the FceRI signaling responses of mast cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNA 155 (miR-155) has been shown to regulate the gene expression of important players of physiological and pathological processes, like hematopoietic lineage differentiation, immunity and inflammation, viral infections, cancer and cardiovascular diseases, among others. Degranulation is an event in which mast cells, upon activation of the FceRI, release their granule content rich in vasoactive amines, proteases and TNFa. Additionally activation of the receptor promotes de novo synthesis of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors.  Analysis of bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMC) deficient in miR-155 showed a significant increase in FceRI mediated degranulation and in the release of cytokines like TNFa, IL-6 and IL-13.  In addition miR 155-/-  mice presented higher anaphylaxis reactions compared to WT mice.   Gene expression analysis of BMMC was performed in order to identify intermediaries of FceRI mediated degranulation under the control of miR-155. The results indicate that miR-155 regulates negatively the expression of the regulatory subunits of the kinase PI3Kgamma, Pik3r5 (p101) and Pik3r6 (p84, p87PIKAP), involved in Ca+ influx and degranulation.

DESIGN
Total RNA from 3 independent cultures of WT and miR-155-/- BMMC treated with anti-DNP IgE and 20 ng/ml DNP-HSA for 1hr were used to performed gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix GenechipÂ® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST
