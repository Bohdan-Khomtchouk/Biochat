TITLE
Expression data at each site in colon cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colon cancer invade to depper layer and the expression of major molecules at cancer front change. But the screening of expression changing at cancer front has not be adequtely clarified. We compared gene expression at cancer front with it at cancer center.

DESIGN
We got cancer cells from cancer front(F) and cancer center(C) by lasermicrodissection.
