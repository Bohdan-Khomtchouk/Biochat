TITLE
Danio rerio: wilde-type control vs. tbx5 morpholino

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Using an oligonucleotide-based microarray analysis to study the expression of special genes in tbx5 morphants, we demonstrated that GH and some GH-related genes were markedly downregulated.

DESIGN
Two condition experiments, tbx5 morpholino vs. wilde-type control Danio rerio embryo.
