TITLE
RNA coimmunoprecipitations

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Nascent polypeptides emerging from the ribosome during biogenesis can interact with many chaperones and protein homeostasis factors. The high sensitivity of RNA identification can be used to identify substrates of specific cotranslationally acting chaperones. Protein A-tagged (TAP-tag) chaperones associated with translating ribosomes were immunopurified by binding to magnetic IgG beads, washed, and chaperone complexes were eluted with TEV protease treatment. Immunopurified RNAs and total cell extract RNAs were isolated, reverse transcribed, coupled to Cy5 and Cy3 dyes, respectively, and comparatively hybridized to DNA microarrays

DESIGN
