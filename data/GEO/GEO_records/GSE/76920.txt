TITLE
miRNA expression in the canalicular phase of  human lung development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression levels were assessed during the canalicular phase of normal fetal lung development at the critical time, when the distal airway epithelium proliferates and differentiates. Precise miRNA regulation is important for proper pulmonary organogenesis, supporting the delicate balance between expansion of progenitor cells and their terminal differentiation. Microarray analyses could indicate the potential involvement of miRNAs important for human pulmonary hypoplasia.

DESIGN
Two replicates of pooled RNA from two 18-20 week old fetal lung samples
