TITLE
The developmental transcriptome of Dictyocaulus viviparus

ORGANISM
Dictyocaulus viviparus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study was to track fluctuations in gene expression across all defined life cycle stages of the cattle lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus. Methods: Batches of worms from a Hannover, Germany strain were harvested in duplicate as eggs, L1, L2, L3, L4, hypobiotic L5, mixed-sex L5, male L5, female L5, mature males and mature females. RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed and sequenced on the Illumina platform. Finally, reads were mapped to the D. viviparus draft genome assembly and read counts associated with each feature were used to estimate gene expression levels and predict differential gene expression at various transitional points across the life cycle. Results: Principal component analyses indicated that major gene expression shifts occur upon hatching, infection of the bovid host, and sexual maturation.

DESIGN
Gene expression was assessed at various timepoints in the D. viviparus life cycle by high throughput sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq technology.  Raw data for this experiment was submitted as the SRA Study accession SRP007900 (BioProject accesion: PRJNA72587)
