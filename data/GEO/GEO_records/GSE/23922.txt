TITLE
Transcription profiling of primed, ILT3-Fc treated CD8+ T suppressor cells vs. primed, untreated CD8+ counterparts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD3 T cells were first primed for 7 days with allogeneic APC in the presence of absence of ILT3-Fc, then were restimulated for 4 hours (with the original priming APC) CD8 T cells were magnetically sorted from these cultures, and lysed for gene chip profiling.

DESIGN
Two condition experiments, ILT3Fc treated vs untreated CD8+ T cells, (4) ILT3Fc treated replicates and (4) untreated replicates

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
