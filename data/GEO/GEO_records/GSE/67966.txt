Antibody-induced CD47 signaling suppresses triple-negative breast cancer stem cells

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Intercellular communication is critical for integrating complex signals in multicellular eukaryotes.  Vascular endothelial cells and T lymphocytes closely interact during the recirculation and trans-endothelial migration of T cells.  In addition to direct cell-cell contact, we show that T cell derived extracellular vesicles can interact with endothelial cells and modulate their cellular functions.  Thrombospondin-1 and its receptor CD47 are expressed on exosomes/ectosomes derived from T cells, and these extracellular vesicles are internalized and modulate signaling in both T cells and endothelial cells.  Extracellular vesicles released from cells expressing or lacking CD47 differentially regulate activation of T cells induced by engaging the T cell receptor.   Similarly, T cell-derived extracellular vesicles modulate endothelial cell responses to vascular endothelial growth factor and tube formation in a CD47-dependent manner. Uptake of T cell derived extracellular vesicles by recipient endothelial cells globally alters gene expression in a CD47-dependent manner. CD47 also regulates the mRNA content of extracellular vesicles in a manner consistent with some of the resulting alterations in target endothelial cell gene expression. Therefore, the thrombospondin-1 receptor CD47 directly or indirectly regulates intercellular communication mediated by the transfer of extracellular vesicles between vascular cells. Treatment with B6H12 antibody inhibited co-immunoprecipitation of EGFR with CD47 and inhibited EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. B6H12 treatment of bCSC also suppressed asymmetric cell division and cell proliferation and up-regulated caspase 3/7 activity.  Correspondingly, caspase-7 cleavage in human breast cancers correlated with CD47 expression. Our data shows that B6H12 specifically targets bCSCs but not differentiated cancer cells, and this CD47 signaling is independent of SIRPÎ±.  Three replicates of each condition were generated.

DESIGN
Three replicates of each MDA-231 attached cells (differentiated), MDA-231 in suspension cells (bCSC), MDA-231 in suspension cells (bCSC) treated with Control Antibody and MDA-231 in suspension cells (bCSC) treated with B6H12 Antibody.
