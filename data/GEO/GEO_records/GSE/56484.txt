TITLE
Investigation of temporal changes in cellular gene expression upon infection with HIV-1.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose was to study temporal changes in cellular gene expression upon infection with HIV-1.  The T lymphoblastic leukemia cell line SUP-T1 was infected with HIV-1

DESIGN
The purpose was to study temporal changes in cellular gene expression upon infection with HIV-1.  1x10^6 homo sapien were infected with LAI/lab strain at MOI giving infection of almost 100% of cells; this was visible in a QC step in which cells 24 hours after infection were stained for p24 antigen.  MOI was set so that this infection rate was achieved after 1 hour incubation of cells with virus.  Mock, UV-inactivated virus, and live virus infections were carried out in three (each) separate tubes and infected cells were maintained in separate suspensions (9 samples each).  Time point aliquots were then collected in 4-hr intervals from each suspension, cells were pelleted, and lysed in 1 ml Trizol.  Lysed samples were immediately frozen on dry ice and moved to -80Â°C until RNA extraction, probe labeling and microarray analysis.
