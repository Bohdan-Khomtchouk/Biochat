TITLE
In vivo and transcriptome-wide identification of RNA-binding protein target sites [PAR-CLIP]

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Animal mRNAs are regulated by hundreds of RNA binding proteins (RBPs). The identification of RBP targets is crucial for understanding their function. A recent method, PAR-CLIP, uses photoreactive nucleosides to crosslink RBPs to target RNAs in cells prior to immunoprecipitation. Here, we establish iPAR-CLIP (in vivo PAR-CLIP) to determine, at nucleotide resolution, transcriptome-wide target sites of GLD-1, a conserved, germline-specific translational repressor in C. elegans. We identified 439 reproducible targets and demonstrate an excellent dynamic range of target detection by iPAR-CLIP. Upon GLD-1 knock-down, protein but not mRNA expression of the 439 targets was specifically and highly significantly upregulated, demonstrating functionality. Finally, we discovered strongly conserved GLD-1 binding sites nearby the start codon of target genes. We propose that GLD-1 interacts with the translation machinery nearby the start codon, a so far unknown mode of gene regulation in eukaryotes.
