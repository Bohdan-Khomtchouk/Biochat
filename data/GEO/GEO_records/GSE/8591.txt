TITLE
Ductal Carcinoma in situ CGH

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. Our goal was to use known aberrations within these samples as a benchmark for determining the ability to differentiate between sample noise and real signal. Keywords: aCGH

DESIGN
Human genomic DNA from a pool of individuals were hybridized to the Cy5 channel and labeled using indeirect amino alyl dUTP. The genomic DNA was extracted from LCM cells from DCIS and labelled with Cy3 using DOP amplification amino-alyl dUTP.
