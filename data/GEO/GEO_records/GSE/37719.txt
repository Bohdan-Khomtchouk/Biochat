TITLE
miR-155 regulates the ability of circulating cancer cells to colonize and establish metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Abstract: Metastases are established through a complex multistep process by which tumor cells disseminate from the primary tumor and expand at distant sites. Traditionally, studies on metastasis have focused on proteins and protein-coding genes, but recently microRNAs (miRNAs) have achieved increasing interest. miRNAs involved in the metastatic process are poorly defined, and while the use of clinical tissue samples or in vitro assessment for study of the first phases of the metastatic process is not feasible; such processes may be studies using in vivo models created by inoculation of human cell lines into mice. We have used such a model system consisting of three isogenic human cancer cell lines that are equally tumorigenic in mice, but while two of these cell lines give rise to metastasis at different rates, the last one disseminates single cells that remain dormant in distant organs. Using a global LNA- based miRNA microarray platform, 28 miRNAs were found to be significantly altered between the metastatic and non-metastatic cell lines, with mir-155 being the miRNA exhibiting the largest difference in expression level and central in a network analysis. Examining the potential targets of miR-155 identified calumenin, solute carrier family 26 (sulfate transporter) member 2 (SLC26A2), Integrin Î±V, and CD73, which showed an inverse expression pattern to miR-155 in the metastatic and non-metastatic cell lines as determined by immunocytochemical staining. The miRNAs identified in this study could be markers of the ability of cancer cells to colonize at distant organs.
