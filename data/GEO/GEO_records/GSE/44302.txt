TITLE
Comparison of  WAT EPCs  vs WAT ASCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human adipose tissue contains two populations of progenitors (EPCs and ASCs) with cooperative roles in breast cancer. EPCs (CD45-CD34+CD31+CD13-CCRL2+) can generate endothelial cells. ASCs (CD45-CD34+CD31-CD13+CD140b+) are mesenchymal progenitors which generated pericytes.

DESIGN
CD13+ cells and CD13- cells from 7 Lipotransfer aspirate
