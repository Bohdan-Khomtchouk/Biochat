TITLE
AML1/ETO, AML1, and HEB binding patterns on chromosme 19

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Approximately 20% of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) cases carry the t(8;21) translocation, which involves the AML1 and ETO genes, and express the resulting AML1/ETO fusion protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting NCoR/SMRT/HDAC complexes to DNA. We used ChIP-chip to identify the determinants of AML1/ETO binding on a contiguous DNA region (chromosome 19). AML1/ETO binding regions are characterized by a specific sequence signature that includes the presence of the consensus binding sites for the AML1 and HEB transcription factors. We therefore assessed the binding patterns of AML1 and HEB on chromosome 19. A specific chromatin modification (tri-methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 = 3MetK4) was also studied in U937 cells expressing AML1/ETO in order to correlate the identified binding profiles with active transcription sites. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
A U937 cell line that conditionally expresses HA-tagged AML1/ETO under the control of the mouse metallothionine promoter (U937-A1E) (Alcalay et al., J.Clin.Invest, 2003,112, 1751-1761) was used. Cell lines were treated for 8h with 100uM ZnSO4 to induce transgene expression in U937-A1E. We performed ChIP using anti-HA,  anti-ETO, anti-AML1/RUNX1, anti-HEBor anti-3MetK4  antibodies. ChIP products were then PCR amplified, labeled with Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent dyes and hybridized to the NimbleGen custom made NGS_HG17_Chr.19Array. U937-Mt cells, which carry the empty vector, served as control (C) for non-specific antibody binding. Each sample identifier indicates Antibody_Cell line (example: HA_A1E = ChIP using anti HA antibody in U937-A1E cells; HA_C = ChIP using anti HA antibody in U937-Mt control cells)
