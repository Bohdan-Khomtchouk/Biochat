TITLE
Specific macronutrients exert unique influences on the adipose-liver axis to promote hepatic steatosis in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Testing the effect of specific macronutrient combinations on mouse metabolism in vivo, we determined that diets pairing starch as carbohydrate with oleate as fat (42%:42% kcal) induced significant white adipose tissue pathology and hepatic steatosis compared to other isocaloric combinations.

DESIGN
C3H/HeOuJ mice were borken into 5 experimental groups fed 42% of calories as CHO:42% of calories as FAT and 1 control chow group.  Diets are as follows: custom DYETS#D511341  Starch/oleate, custom DYETS#D511344 sucrose/oleate, custom DYETS#D511343 starch/palmitate, custom DYETS#D511342 sucrose/palmitate, Tekland TD.95217 Adjusted Fat Diet (Western Diet), and PicoDiets #5053 Chow - Fed for 6months.  Epididymal white adipose tissue was homogenized and analyzed with NanoString nCounterÂ® Mouse Immunology panel for gene expression levels
