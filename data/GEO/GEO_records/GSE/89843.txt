TITLE
Swarm intelligence-enhanced detection of non-small cell lung cancer using tumor-educated platelets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report RNA-sequencing data of 779 blood platelet samples, including 402 tumor-educated platelet (TEP) samples collected from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, we report RNA-sequencing data of blood platelets isolated from 377 individuals without reported cancer, but not excluding individuals with inflammatory conditions. This dataset highlights the ability of TEP RNA-based 'liquid biopsy' diagnostics in patients with NSCLC.

DESIGN
Blood platelets were isolated from whole blood in purple-cap BD Vacutainers containing EDTA anti-coagulant by standard centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from the platelet pellet, subjected to cDNA synthesis and SMARTer amplification, fragmented by Covaris shearing, and prepared for sequencing using the Truseq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit. Subsequently, pooled sample libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. All steps were quality-controlled using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip, DNA 7500 and DNA High Sensitivity chips measurements. For further downstream analyses, reads were quality-controlled using Trimmomatic, mapped to the humane reference genome using STAR, and intron-spanning reads were summarized using HTseq.
