TITLE
De novo epigenetic programs inhibit PD-1 blockade-mediated T-cell rejuvenation [WGBS]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
De novo DNA methylation establishes T cell exhaustion and inhibits PD-1 blockade-mediated T-cell rejuvenation.

DESIGN
Mouse antigen-specific CD8 T cells were sorted from spleens of WT and Dnmt3a cKO mice during chronic LCMV infection on day 8 and day 35 post-infection for whole genome bisulfite sequencing [WGBS] analyses. Mouse antigen-specific CD8 T cells were sorted from spleens of WT mice during chronic LCMV infection after mock or PD-L1 blockade treatment for WGBS analyses. Mouse antigen-specific CD8 T cells were sorted from WT mice during acute LCMV infection on day 35 post-infection for WGBS analysis.
