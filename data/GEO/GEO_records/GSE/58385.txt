TITLE
Dynamic and coordinated expression changes of rice small RNAs in response to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Endogenous small RNAs are newly identified players in plant immune responses, yet their roles in rice (Oryza sativa) responding to pathogens are still less understood, especially for pathogens that can cause severe yield losses. Here, we examined the small RNA expression profiles of rice leaves at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours post infection of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) virulent strain PXO99, the causal agent of rice bacterial blight disease. Dynamic expression changes of some miRNAs and trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) were identified, together with a few novel miRNA targets, including a disease resistance gene targeted by osa-miR159a.1. Coordinated expression changes were observed among some miRNA and ta-siRNAs in response to Xoo infection, with small RNAs exhibiting the same expression pattern tended to regulate genes in the same or functional correlated signaling pathways, including auxin and GA signaling pathways, nutrition and defense related pathways, etc. Highly abundant small RNAs with pathogen-responsive expression changes were identified from the exonic region of a protein-coding gene, which may present a new class of functional small RNAs. These findings reveal the dynamic and complex roles of small RNAs in rice-pathogen interactions, and identified new targets for regulating plant immune responses.
