TITLE
Transcriptome analysis on gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Reliable identification of cancer markers can have substantial implications to early detection of cancer. We report here an integrated computational and experimental study on identification of gastric cancer markers in patientsâ€™ tissue and sera based on (i) genome-scale transcriptomic analyses on 80 paired gastric cancer/reference tissues, with the aim of identifying abnormally expressed genes at various subtypes/stages of gastric carcinoma (ii) a computational identification of differentially expressed genes that may have their proteins secreted into blood circulation, followed by experimental validations.

DESIGN
160 Total samples were analyzed on paried tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 80 gastric cancer patients.  Differential analysis identified genes with a fold-change  over 1.5.
