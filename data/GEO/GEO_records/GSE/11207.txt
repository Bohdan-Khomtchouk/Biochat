TITLE
Dorsal root ganglion (katz-affy-mouse-210210)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The molecular identity of touch sensation is still largely unknown. We choose an extrem and very specific example, touch sensation of pennis glan, to study this problem. It's known from previous retro-grade labeling result that only one DRG in rat innervate the pennis glan, which makes it idea for microarry analysis. To clone the mechanosensory receptor specifically or highly expressed in the primary sensory neurons innervating pennis glan. There is a specific mechanosensory receptor in the primary sensory neurons innervating pennis glan. 1. Retrograde labeling the innervating nerve by DiI 2. Dissect DRGs, dissociate neurons and pick up the fluorescent cells. 3. Pool around 20 positive cells and 50 control cells (big diameter neuron and small to medium diameter neuron respectively), purify total RNA. 4. Two rounds of amplification 5. Affymetrix analysis Keywords: dorsal root ganglion, touch sensatiion
