TITLE
Embryonic sensory thalamus nuclei-specific genes revealed by genetic labelling and FACS isolation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify genes expressed in specific developing thalamic nuclei during embryonic stages, a genetic dual labelling strategy was established to mark and isolate the cells. Transcription profiles were determined for the principal sensory thalamic populations by genome-wide analysis. We identified genes expressed in distinct thalamic nuclei with a potential function in the specification of individual sensory-modality thalamocortical connections.

DESIGN
Thalamic neurons were isolated by FACS based on fluorescence intensity of dual genetic labeling by Gbx2CreER-IRES-EGFP/+::R26lsl-tdTomato/+. Array was made on total RNA from 3 biological replicates of 3 different populations (9 samples) taken at E18.5 and 3 biological replicates of 2 different populations (6 samples) taken at E14.5
