TITLE
Identification of post-transcriptional regulatory networks during myeloblast-to-monocyte differentiation transition [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Treatment of leukemia cells with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 may overcome their differentiation block and lead to the transition from myeloblasts to monocytes. To identify microRNA-mRNA networks relevant for myeloid differentiation, we profiled the expression of mRNAs and microRNAs associated to the low- and high-density ribosomal fractions in leukemic cells and in their differentiated monocytic counterpart. Intersection between mRNAs shifted across the fractions after treatment with putative target genes of modulated microRNAs showed a series of molecular networks relevant for the monocyte cell fate determination In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from the profiling of ribosome/polysome-associated miRNAs and mRNAs in proliferating HL60 cells and in cells induced to differentiate by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VitD3) treatment

DESIGN
18 total samples, 9 from control proliferating HL60 cells and 9 from VitD3-treated HL60 cells
