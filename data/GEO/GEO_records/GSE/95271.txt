TITLE
Expression data of iPSCs, CTraS-iPSCs, embryoid bodies, and their derived neurospheres

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent studies indicated that the differentiation tendency of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) was affected by a certain small molecule treatment. We found the combination of small molecules that bringed out the differentiation potentials of PSCs, and defined such state of PSC as CTraS. Then, we used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression reflecting the effect of CTraS, and carefully compared the characteristics of iPSCs, CTraS-iPSCs, embryoid bodies (EBs), and their derived neurospheres (NSs) based on their expression profiles .

DESIGN
We isolated RNA from iPSCs, CTraS-iPSCs, EBs, and NSs derived from them (total 10 samples) for the gene expression microarray analysis. All of the iPSC lines we used were low passage number (less than 15).
