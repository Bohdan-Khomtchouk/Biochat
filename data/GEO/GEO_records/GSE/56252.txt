TITLE
The reprogramming of tumor stroma by HSF1 is a potent enabler of malignancy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment are essential for tumor progression and metastasis. Yet surprisingly little is known about the factors that drive the transcriptional reprogramming of stromal cells within tumors. We report that the transcriptional regulator Heat-Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) is activated in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and is a potent enabler of malignancy.  In CAFs, HSF1 drives a transcriptional program that complements, yet is completely different from, the program it drives in adjacent cancer cells. This CAF program is uniquely structured to support the malignant potential of cancer cells in a non-cell-autonomous way and involves two central stromal signaling molecules—TGFβ and stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1). As clinical confirmation, in early stage breast and lung cancer high stromal HSF1 activation is strongly associated with poor patient outcome. Thus, cancers co-opt the ancient, multifaceted survival functions of HSF1 to orchestrate malignant progression in unexpected ways that have far-reaching therapeutic implications.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to examine the HSF1-dependent effect of co-culture on gene expression in cancer cells and fibroblasts. D2A1 mouse breast cancer cells were co-cultured with WT or Hsf1 null MEFs for 72h, afterwhich the two cell types were separated from each other by FACS and analyzed. Each cell type was also grown separately, as control.
