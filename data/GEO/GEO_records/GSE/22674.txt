TITLE
Gene expression profiling in VRK1-deficient testis of Mus musculus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study effect of VRK1 deletion on spermatogenesis of the mouse, transciptomic analysis of genes in postnatal 8-day testicular cells of wild type and VRK1-deficient Mus musculus was performed.

DESIGN
Gene expression in testes from from wild type and VRK1-deficient mutant Mus musculus, respectively, was measured. Four independent experiments for wild type and mutant, respectively, were performed.
