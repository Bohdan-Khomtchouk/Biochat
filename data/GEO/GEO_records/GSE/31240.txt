TITLE
Glutathione-induced elicitation of defense responses in Lotus japonicus.

ORGANISM
Lotus japonicus

SUMMARY
To identify transcription factors involved in the production of defense-related phytochemicals through co-expression studies.

DESIGN
The changes in gene expression following GSH elicitation of leaves was followed over a time course.  Four biological replicates of the unelicited samples and three biological replicates were used for each time point.
