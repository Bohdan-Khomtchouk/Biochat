TITLE
Lineage specific differentiation is influenced by state of human pluripotency [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been reported in naïve and primed states. However, the ability of human PSCs to generate mature cell types is the only imperative property for translational utility. Here, we reveal that the naïve state enhances self-renewal capacity while restricting lineage differentiation in vitro to neural default fate. Gene expression analyses indicate expression of multiple lineage associated transcripts in naïve hPSCs and thus failed to predict biased functional differentiation.  Naïve hPSCs can be converted to primed allowing recovery of multilineage differentiation over long serial passage or immediately through suppression of OCT4 but not NANOG. To this end, we identified chemical inhibitors of OCT4 expression that acutely restore naïve hPSC differentiation. Our study identifies unique cell fate features and critical restrictions in human pluripotent states, and provides an approach to overcome these barriers that harness both efficient naïve hPSC growth whilst maintaining in vitro differentiation capacities essential for hPSC applications.

DESIGN
hPSC lines were transduced with shRNA lentiviruses in order to assess the effects of reducing NANOG and OCT4 gene expression on differention in the naïve state.  shRNA expressing cells were sorted and then total RNA was extracted in order to perform transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq. Each experimental condition involves 2 technical replicates of 2 biological replicates (2 tech X 2 biol = 4 reads).
