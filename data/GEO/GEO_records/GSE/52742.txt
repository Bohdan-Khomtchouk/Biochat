TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of B Lymphocytes reveals IL4R increase in allergic asthma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we present the first genome-wide expression profiling of peripheral B cells by massive parallel RNA sequencing in patients with allergic asthma validating the discovery potential of this approach in allergy.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was used to asses expression differences in B CD19 Lymphocytes from house dust mite allergic patients and healthy controls.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
