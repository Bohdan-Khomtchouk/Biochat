TITLE
Epigenome analysis of alcohol consumption in lymphocyte cell (LC) samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of individuals consuming alcohol and controls in LC samples. Individuals consuming alcohol were profiled at time of intake (T1) into treatment facility and four weeks into treatment (T2). Controls were profiled once. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA Methylation BeadChip v1.0 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across 485,577 CpGs in LC samples. Samples included 33 case subjects at T1, 26 case subjects at T2 and 33 controls.

DESIGN
Bisulfite-converted DNA from 92 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation BeadChip v1.0.
