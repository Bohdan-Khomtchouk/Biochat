TITLE
Antiproliferative effects and mechanisms of liver X receptor ligands in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This microarray is an analysis of differentially expressed genes in three pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines treated with LXR-agonist GW 3965. We first report that GW 3965 has antiproliferative effects in three PDAC cell lines. This microarray was designed to identify key mechanisms of the antiproliferative effect of LXR agonists within pancreatic cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from BxPC-3, MIA-PaCa-2, and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells grown in culture treated GW 3965 or ethanol (vehicle control) for 72 hours.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
