TITLE
Primary cilia sensing-regulated transcriptome in the collecting duct

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq technology was used to reveal the transcriptome changes of tubular epithelia in response to fluid flow and determine the role of primary cilia in this process. Many fluid flow-sensitive genes were identified, among which are those regulated by primary cilia sensing of fluid flow. These genes were further validated by RT-qPCR.

DESIGN
Ciliated and non-ciliated IMCD3 (inner-medullary collecting duct) cells were exposed to fluid flow followed by RNA isolation and sequencing.
