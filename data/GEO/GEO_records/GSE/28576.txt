TITLE
Tissue specific differential expression in response to a thermal stress in the snakelocks sea anemone.

ORGANISM
Anemonia viridis

SUMMARY
Differential expression between endodermal (zooxanthellate) and ectodermal tissue layers in the endosymbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis has been analyzed for 3 specimens subjected to a thermal stress (+10°C) for a 2 days period. A symbiosis-dedicated oligonucleotide microarray (2000 selected features) was generated, representing to date the only available oligonucleotide array used for symbiotic cnidarians (GPL10546). We are describing here the preferential expression in ectoderm vs endoderm (also called epidermis and gastroderm, respectively) during the time course of this thermal stress.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from ectodermal or endodermal dissected tissues. 3 different symbiotic anemones were subjected to a thermal and UV stress (+10°C), sampled at T0, T12h and T36h. Tissue dissections were carried out from tentacles immediately after sampling. For each sample, dye-swap hybridizations compared T0 and later time points. For each time point, statistical analysis combines the 3 biological replicates.
