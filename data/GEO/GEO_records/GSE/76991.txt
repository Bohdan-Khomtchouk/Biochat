TITLE
Differential expression analysis of Gcn5 knockdown embryos at early developmental stage 10.5 in Xenopus laevis

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
We sequenced cDNA prepared from ribosomal RNA depleted total RNA of 10-10 embryos injected with Gcn5-antisense oligonucleotides and with water to create expression profiles of Gcn5 knockdown and control, respectively, in Xenopus laevis at early embryonic developmental stage 10.5. (according to Nieuwkoop and Faber), and we executed differential expression analysis of sequence count data (DEseq).

DESIGN
Differential expression analysis using RNA sequencing
