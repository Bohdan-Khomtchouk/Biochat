TITLE
Individual multidrug resistance patterns in AML patients point to the need for personalized molecular analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this unique study, based on paired samples obtained at AML diagnosis and at relapse, we assessed 380 multidrug-resistance-related genes, using TaqMan-based qRT-PCR, as indicated by reports published over the past three decades.

DESIGN
11 paired AML samples taken at diagnosis and at relapse after treatment. Each patients act as its own control.
