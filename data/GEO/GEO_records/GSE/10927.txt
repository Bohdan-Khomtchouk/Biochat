TITLE
Human adrenocortical carcinomas (33), adenomas (22), and normal adrenal cortex (10), on Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human samples of 33 adrenocortical carcinomas, 22 adrenocortical adenomas, and 10 normal adrenal cortex samples, each from a different patient, had mRNA assays performed using Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays, with 54675 probe-sets.  We note that the same array data is in GEO series GSE33371, where we assayed the cancer samples for Beta-catenin staining or mutation, and make new comparisons based on those assays. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Human samples of 33 adrenocortical carcinomas, 22 adrenocortical adenomas, and 10 normal adrenal cortex samples, each from a different patient, had mRNA assays performed using Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays, with 54675 probe-sets. Two supplementary files are attached below. The Adrenocortical_logs.xls file shows the log-transformed probe-set values and the results of a statistical analysis for each probe-set. The Readme file describes the columns of this log file.
