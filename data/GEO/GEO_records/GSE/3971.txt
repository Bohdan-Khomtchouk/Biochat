TITLE
Invasive lobular and ductal carcinomas of the breast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This set of experiments includes 38 IDCs, 21 ILCs, 2 lymphnode metastases, and 3 normal breast samples. It is designed to compare gene expression profiles of IDCs and ILCs. Total RNAs from all samples were isolated using TRIzol, amplified using optimized T7 linear amplification protocol, and labeled with Cy5. Stratagen Universal Human Reference RNA was amplified the same way and labeled with Cy3. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
