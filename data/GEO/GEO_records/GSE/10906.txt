TITLE
'Bois noir' phytoplasma induces significant reprogramming of the leaf transcriptome in the field grown grapevine

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay healthy vs. Phytoplasma-infected plants (Bois noir phytoplasma). Study was conducted on grapevine plants grown in the same vineyard (leaf midribs were sampled). Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: healthy vs. infected plants/shoots. Biological replicates: 4 healthy, 4 infected. No replicates. Each sample was prepared as a pool of several samples (each sample was collected from a different shoots/plants) of the same disease status. Each sample was co-hybridized to a common reference cRNA (pool of all samples).
