TITLE
RNA Sequencing of default, melanocyte biased and enteric human neural crest populations (NC) and neuroectoderm (CNS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have generated expression profiles of three different neural crest populations from human embryonic stem cells.  These profiles were compared to a neuroectoderm population.  We find that the neural crest populations are separable and distinct.

DESIGN
All cell types were differentiated from human embryonic stem cells.  Neural crest populations were sorted on day 12 for CD49.  The neuroectoderm cells were unsorted and harvested on day 12 of differentiation.
