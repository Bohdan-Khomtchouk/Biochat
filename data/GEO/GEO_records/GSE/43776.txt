TITLE
The interactome of POU5F1 upstream enhancer in mouse embryonic stem cells revealed by 4C-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of 4C-Seq technique for exploring POU5F1 enhancer interactome in mouse embryonic stem cells. A statistical model was built to identify enriched interacting regions from raw 4C data. The biological replicate data were compared to identify reproducible interacting regions. The interacting sites in the reproducible regions are enriched with active histone marks as well as transcription factors Oct4, Klf4, Esrrb, Tcfcp2i1 and Zfx that are critical for reprogramming and pluripotency.

DESIGN
Generation of Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing data using 4C-Seq protocol
