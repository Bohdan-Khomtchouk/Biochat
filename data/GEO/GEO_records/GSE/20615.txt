TITLE
Intracellular Signaling Pathways in Nonviral Gene Delivery: Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression Profiles in Transfected Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes due to nonviral gene delivery of DNA lipoplexes versus control in human HEK293T cells.

DESIGN
Human HEK293T RNA was isolated from control, non-transfected cells (CTR), transfected (GFP), and untransfected (GFPMINUS) samples for analysis on microarrays with three to six biological replicates.
