TITLE
Anticancer properties of distinct antimalaria drug classes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Antimalarials have anticancer potential.  Results: We have systematically tested five distinct antimalaria drugs in a panel of cancer cell lines.  Conclusion: Three antimalarial classes display potent antiproliferative activity, and their potency is correlated with cancer cell gene expression patterns.  Significance: We confirm and extend anticancer potential of these antimalarials and we discuss their therapeutic potential based on clinical data. Key words: Malaria, Anticancer drug, Drug Discovery, Genomics, Gene Expression, Bioinformatics, Cancer

DESIGN
AffymetrixÂ® HG-U133 Plus 2.0 mRNA expression arrays were used to determine the expression. CEL result files were pre-processed using the RMA  (Irizarry et al, 2003) algorithm. This microarray analysis was performed for 91 cell lines.
