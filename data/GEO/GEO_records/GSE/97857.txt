TITLE
Time course of the Arabidopsis thaliana root meristem

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We isolated cells in the different developmental zones of the A. thaliana root at 3,4,5,6 and 7 days old (DO)

DESIGN
PET111:GFP seedlings were grown for 3,4,5,6, or 7 days (2 biological replicates per time point). GFP negative cells were collected from the meristematic zone (MZ) and elongation zone (EZ) to eliminate columella cells from root tip. RNA was extracted from GFP negative cells and sequenced
