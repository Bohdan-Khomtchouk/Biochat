TITLE
Transcriptome analyses of EJC haploinsufficient neocortices

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing of E10.5 neocortices from control, Magoh, Rbm8a, and Eif4a3 haploinsufficient embryos (generated with Emx1-Cre)

DESIGN
neocortical mRNA profiles of embryonic day 10.5 control (Emx1-Cre) and EJC haploinsufficent mutants (Eif4a3, Magoh, and Rbm8a conditional crossed with Emx1-Cre) mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate.
