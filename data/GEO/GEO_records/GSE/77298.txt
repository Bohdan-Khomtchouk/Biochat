TITLE
Synovial biopsies of rheumatoid arthritis and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Synovial biopsies were obtained from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium and from subjects without a joint disease to find gene upregulated during RA. The promoters of genes upregulated during RA compared to HC can be used to obtain disease-regulated gene therapy.

DESIGN
16 microarrays of end-stage RA synovial biopsies were compared to 7 microarrays of synovial biopsies from individuals without a joint disease. Genes with > 1.2-fold upregulation and P < 0.05 in RA VS HC were selected from the analysis.
