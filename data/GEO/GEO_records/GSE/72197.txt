TITLE
Gene expression profiles of naïve PC-9 cells and PC-9GR cells that are resistant to gefitinib.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated gene expression profiles of gefitinib-resistant PC-9 (PC-9GR) cells as well as naïve PC-9 cells. The data exhibited marked differences in the expression profiles between them.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from naïve PC-9 cells and PC-9GR cells that were resistant to gefitinib, and examined by Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarrays.
