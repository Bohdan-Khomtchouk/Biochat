TITLE
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines (copy number analysis)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Five NPC cell lines (HONE1, CNE1, CNE2, 5-8F, and 6-10B) and an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line NP69 were evaluated with 250K SNP arrays (Affymetrix) to detect the genome-wide DNA copy number alterations.

DESIGN
The same type of data of 45 Chinese samples from the HapMap project  was used as normal control. Data was analyzed using GCOS (GeneChip operating software, Ver.1.4), GTYPE (GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software, Ver.4.1), and CNAT (chromosome copy number analysis tool, Ver.4.0, BRLMM algorithm).
