TITLE
Expression data from H1299 human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines stably expressing CHES1 compared with H1299 infected with an empty vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression of the forkhead transcription factor CHES1, also known as FOXN3, is reduced in many types of cancers. In vitro, CHES1 expression suppresses cell proliferation in tumor cell lines but not in normal cells. Conversely shRNA-mediated depletion of CHES1 increases tumor cell proliferation. We used microarrays to characterize the gene expression changes induced by CHES1 in H1299 cancer cells

DESIGN
H1299 cells were infected with a retroviral vector that expresses CHES1 or an empty vector. After 5 days of infection, RNA was extracted from three independent replicas of each condition. Total RNA was send to Genome Quebec service for hybridization with Affymetrix microarrays.
