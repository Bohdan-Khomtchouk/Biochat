TITLE
Gene expression profiling of prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the molecular mechanism that underlay tumorigenesis and progression of prostate cancer (PCa), we studied the gene expression profiles of sixteen PCa compared to their matched normal tissues. Using Significance Analysis of Microarrays, we identified 53 genes differentially expressed that were more than 2 fold up- or down-regulated in at least 50 % of the tumors. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Samples from 16 patients with prostate cancer were analyzed. The matched normal tissue from each patient was used as control. The control RNA (normal tissue) was labeled with Cy3 and the test RNA (prostate cancer tissue) with Cy5.
