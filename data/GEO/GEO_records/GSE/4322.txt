TITLE
Sall4: -/- NT1 vs TBV

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sall genes are expressed early in development and in diversity of embryonic and adult structures. Sall4 plays a crucial role during the development of a number of systems. Mutations in the SALL4 gene have been linked to Okihiro/acro-renal-ocular syndrome, in which patients exhibit forearm malformations and eye movement deficits. Homozygote and heterozygote Sall4 cells from mouse blastocysts were collected and used to design a genetrap mouse mutant line. The homozygote Sall4 ES cells form mouse blastocyst were hybridizised versus TBV wildtype cells to detect changes in gene expression. Three biological samples of different passages of the same clone of NT1 and TBV were analyzed in 13 chip hybridizations; each sample was analyzed in 2-5 experimental replicates including dye swap experiments.
