TITLE
Dendritic Cell Fate is Determined by BCL11A Â 

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we confirm an essential requirement for the BCL11A transcription factor in fetal pDC development, and for the first time demonstrate this lineage specific requirement in the adult organism. Genome-wide analyses of BCL11A DNA binding and expression revealed that BCL11A regulates transcription of E2-2 and other pDC differentiation modulators including ID2 and MTG16. Our results identify BCL11A as an essential, lineage-specific factor that regulates pDC development.

DESIGN
ChIP sequenicng was performed for a transcription factor of BCL11A in Cal1 cell line. Input was sequenced and used as a control.
