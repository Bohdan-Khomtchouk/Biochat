TITLE
Long non-coding RNAs and mRNAs regulated by TGF-β

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cell dissemination is well established, but the involvement of lncRNAs in TGF-β signaling is still unknown. In this study, we observed that the lncRNA-Activated by TGF-β (lncRNA-ATB) was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastases and associated with poor prognosis. lncRNA-ATB promotes the invasion-metastasis cascade, which suggest that lncRNA-ATB, a mediator of TGF-β signaling, could predispose HCC patients to metastases and may serve as a potential target for anti-metastatic therapies.

DESIGN
SMMC-7721 hepatoma cells were continuously treated with 10 ng/ml of recombinant TGF-β1 for 21 days. Total RNA recovered from three untreated cells and three treated cells were used to acquire different expression profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs.
