TITLE
Acute heat stress induces differential gene expressions in the small yellow follicles of a broiler-type strain of Taiwan country chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To realize the gene expression in response to acute heat stress in chicken small yellow follicles, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a tool to identify genes response to acute heat stress. Female B strain Taiwan country chickens were subjected to acute heat stress (38℃) for 2 h, and then exposed to 25℃, with small yellow follicles collected 0, 2, and 6 h after the cessation of heat stress, using non heat-stressed hens as a control group (n = 3 hens per group). Based on a chicken 44K oligo microarray, 69, 51, and 76 genes were upregulated and 58, 15, 56 genes were downregulated after heat treatment of H2R0, H2R2, and H2R6, respectively, using a cutoff value of two-fold or higher in the small yellow follicles of the heat-stressed chickens from those of the control chickens. Upregulation of heat shock protein 25, interleukin 6, metallopeptidase 1, and metalloproteinase 13, and downregulation of type II alpha 1 collagen, discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2, and Kruppel-like factor 2 were confirmed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).

DESIGN
Acute heat stress induced small yellow follicles gene experssion in B strain Taiwan country chicken was measured at 0, 2, and 6 h of recovery after 2 h of 38 Celsius degree acute heat stress.
