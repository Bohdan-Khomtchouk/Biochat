TITLE
Human ES cell-derived neural rosettes reveal a functionally distinct early neural stem cell stage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
All data are derived from the same batch of human ES cells (line H9, WA-09). With the exception of the “UD” file all files represent neural cell types derived from the undifferentiated hESCs. Following mechanical isolation, rosettes were maintained for various passages in the presence of defined growth factors and morphogen factors as indicated below at the R-NSC stage. Cells at the NSCFGF/EGF stage were derived from mechanically isolated neural rosettes that were purified and long-term expanded as attached monolayer cultures in serum free medium in the presence of FGF2/EGF. Keywords: differentiation of human ES cells (line H9, WA-09).
