TITLE
Influence of anti-CD25 mAb on the transcriptome of activated PBMC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD25 monoclonal antibody binding to the alpha-chain of the Interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, blocks high affinity IL-2 binding thereby preventing complete T cell activation and being of ample importance in transplantation medicine and potentially the treatment of autoimmune disease. However, CD25 antibodies do not only block T cell activation but also prevent activation induced cell death (AICD) attributing a dual function to IL-2. In this study, the modulation of the genomic expression profile of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with therapeutic concentrations of humanized anti-CD25 mAb was investigated. PBMC were stimulated with CD3 antibody OKT-3 together with recombinant IL-2 in the absence or presence of anti-CD25 mAb. RNA was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis on U133A microarrays (Affymetrix). The expression profile revealed the up-regulation of 62 genes and down-regulation of 38 genes by anti-CD25 mAb, respectively.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated for 8 or 16 hrs with 100 ng/ml OKT-3 together with 100 U/ml recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) in the absence or presence of 30 Âµg/ml anti-CD25 antibody. RNA from cells under such treatment was isolated with Trizol and subjected to microarray analysis onto human U133A microarray following the Affymetrix protocol.
