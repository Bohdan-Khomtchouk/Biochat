TITLE
Identification of Gene Products Involved in the Oxidative Stress Response of Moraxella catarrhalis: Evaluation of OxyR dependent Genes

ORGANISM
Moraxella catarrhalis

SUMMARY
Series of DNA microarrays (4) comparing the M. catarrhalis strain 035E and M. catarrhalis oxyR mutant response to 50 mM hydrogen peroxide.

DESIGN
Wild-type cells and oxyR mutant cells were exposed to 50 mM hydrogen peroxide for 15 minutes. RNA was extracted and DNA microarray analysis performed. 4 biologic replicates were studied. One dye swap was included in this series analysis. Control oxyR mutant cells exposed to water
