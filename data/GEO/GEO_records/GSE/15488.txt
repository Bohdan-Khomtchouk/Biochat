TITLE
Human Cell Toxicogenomic Analysis of Bromoacetic Acid: A Regulated Drinking Water Disinfection By-product

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we linked the biological end point of genomic DNA damage from our quantitative, comparative disinfection by-product (DBP) database, with toxicogenomic analysis using a Super Array RT2 Profilerâ„¢ PCR Array containing primers for 84 genes related to human DNA damage and repair and  84 genes whose expression level is indicative of stress and toxicity.
