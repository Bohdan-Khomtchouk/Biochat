TITLE
Human Cell Toxicogenomic Analysis of Bromoacetic Acid: A Regulated Drinking Water Disinfection By-product

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we linked the biological end point of genomic DNA damage from our quantitative, comparative disinfection by-product (DBP) database, with toxicogenomic analysis using a Super Array RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array containing primers for 84 genes related to human DNA damage and repair and  84 genes whose expression level is indicative of stress and toxicity.

DESIGN
We used a non-transformed, normal, fetal human small intestinal epithelial cell line (FHs 74 Int), along with PCR arrays, to measure the modulation of gene expression after exposure to the regulated DBP bromoacetic acid (BAA). Human cells were exposed to 60 µM BAA for either 30 min or 4 h to measure early and late gene responses using the Superarray DNA damage signaling APHS-029B and the Human Stress & Toxicity PathwayFinder PCR Array PAHS-003A.
