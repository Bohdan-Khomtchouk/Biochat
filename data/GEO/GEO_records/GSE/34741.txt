TITLE
Vibrio campbellii bioluminescence and its effect on gene expression and virulence

ORGANISM
Vibrio campbellii ATCC BAA-1116

SUMMARY
The selective advantage of bioluminescence in bacterial cells that do not form symbiotic relationships with aquatic animals is still not known. Some evidence suggests that bioluminescence plays a role in DNA repair by a photoreactivation process (Czyz 2000) and that non-bioluminescent strains are less virulent than their bioluminescent isogenic counterparts (Ruwandeepika 2010). All hypotheses to date suggest bioluminescence associated or mediated changes in gene expression, yet the evidence for this does not exist. In this study, we generated an in-frame luxAB deletion mutant (the two contiguous genes that encode for bacterial luciferase) and compared its mid-log phase gene expression profile with that of the wild type spontaneous streptomycin resistant (STR) V. campbellii BAA-1116 parental strain from which it was derived. Both mid-log phase transcriptomes were elucidated using custom designed whole genome microarrays (520694F, Affymetrix) to determine the effect luciferase has on V. campbellii gene expression. The virulence phenotypes of both strains were also subsequently tested in Artemia franciscana challenge experiments.
