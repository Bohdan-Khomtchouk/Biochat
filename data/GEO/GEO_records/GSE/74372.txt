TITLE
Small RNA and mRNA expression profiling during axolotl forelimb regeneration

ORGANISM
Ambystoma mexicanum

SUMMARY
Previous studies of appendage regeneration in the axolotl have shown that multiple genetic programs are modulated through regulatory factors.  MicroRNAs are short highly conserved non-coding genes that suppress expression of target genes and thereby control multiple genetic programs.  Given their important regulatory roles and evolutionary conservation, we hypothesize that microRNAs define a conserved genetic regulatory circuit important for appendage regeneration.  We characterized microRNA expression during Axolotl forelimb regeneration using small RNA sequencing.  The same samples were assayed for mRNA expression using mRNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Small RNA and mRNA gene expression profiling during 0, 3, 6 and 14 days post amputation.
