TITLE
Identification of transcription factor EOR-1 binding sites in C.elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We, being members of modENCODE consortium, have established an experimetal pipeline in C.elegans that allows global identification of the binding sites for transcription factors using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). In current study, we identified the binding sites for EOR-1 at L3 stage, which plays important roles in regulating RAS/RAF-mediated signaling during excretory system development and RAS/RAF- and WNT-mediated signaling during P12 fate specification.

DESIGN
EOR-1 was tagged with a dual GFP:3xFLAG tag at the carboxy terminus, whose expression pattern was confirmed through both fluorescence imaging and immunoblot analysis. The binding sites were determined using ChIP-seq. Two biological replicates were used in this study and non-immunoprecipitated chromatin (input) from the same sample served as a control. Concordance between two replicates is about 95% when p-value is 0.05
