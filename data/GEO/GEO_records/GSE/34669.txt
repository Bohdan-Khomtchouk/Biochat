TITLE
Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) promotes hepatocarcinogenesis: novel insights from a mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) as a positive inducer of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Transgenic mice with hepatocyte-specific expression of AEG-1 were challenged with N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) and developed multinodular HCC with steatotic features. Thus, we have identified the follwoing AEG-1 functions: induction of steatosis, inhibition of senescence and activation of coagulation pathway to augment an aggressive hepatocarcinogenic phenotype.

DESIGN
Transgenic Mice liver tumors compared against WT mice liver tumors.
