TITLE
Measuring RNA editing through mmPCR-seq in Drosophila adapting to divergent microclimates and raised at different temperatures

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We applied microfluidic multiplex PCR and deep sequencing (mmPCR-seq) to quantify RNA editing levels at targeted sites in 32 isofemale lines from two divergent microclimates at 'Evolution Canyon' in Israel (16 fly lines from each microclimate).  Editing levels were compared between different populations at 25˚C , and were also compared between 25˚C and 18˚C within populations.

DESIGN
For each of the 32 isofemale fly lines from 'Evolution Canyon', quantification of RNA editing levels in the whole bodies of 3-5 day old male flies raised at 25˚C or 18˚C through RT-PCR amplification of 605 loci.  Two biological replicates are represented per fly line.
