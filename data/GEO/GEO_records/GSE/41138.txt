TITLE
Profiling microRNA expression in bovine alveolar macrophages using RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In this study, we determined the miRNA expression profile of bovine alveolar macrophages, using next-generation sequencing strategy. On an Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine, we sequenced 8 miRNA libraries, prepared from small RNA fractions of alveolar macrophages isolated from 8 different healthy animals (Bos taurus). From the data, the potential novel miRNAs were predicted, and the expression levels of the known miRNAs were determined. We report that 80 known bovine miRNAs are expressed in bovine alveolar macrophages with > 100 reads per million. The most highly expressed miRNA was bta-miR-21, followed by bta-miR-27a. Additionally, one putatively novel bovine miRNA was identified. To our knowledge, this is the first RNA-seq study to profile miRNA expression in bovine alveolar macrophages and provides an important reference dataset for investigating the regulatory roles miRNAs play in this important immune cell type.

DESIGN
Examination of bovine alveolar macrophage miRNA profiles, using RNA-seq. Alveolar macrophages were isolated from lung lavages from 8 animals. Small RNA fractions were prepared from the cells using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus mini kit, and miRNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Epicentre Scriptminer multiplex kit. The sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine.
