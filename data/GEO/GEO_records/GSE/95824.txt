TITLE
Assessment of the Pol IV largest subunit, NRPD1, DeCL domain deletion construct to rescue Pol IV-dependent siRNAs in the nrpd1-3 mutant (sRNA).

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis thaliana multi-subunit RNA Polymerase IV largest subunit DeCL domain was functionally assessed with an NRPD1 DeCL domain deletion construct.

DESIGN
The Pol IV largest subunit DeCL domain deletion mutant, nrpd1 Î”DeCL, was assessed for sRNA expression across 24 nt siRNA clusters
