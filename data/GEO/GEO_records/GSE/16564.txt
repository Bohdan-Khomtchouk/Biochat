TITLE
Expression data from AtT20 mouse pituitary gland cells following overexpression or down regulation of NSBP1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chromatin architectural protein NSBP1/HMGN5 belongs to the family of HMGN proteins which specifically interact with nucleosomes via Nucleosome Binding Domain, unfold chromatin and affect transcription. Mouse NSBP1 is a new and uncharacterized member of HMGN protein family. NSBP1 is a nuclear protein which is localized to euchromatin, binds to linker histone H1 and unfolds chromatin. We analyzed the effect of altered expression levels of mouse NSBP1 protein on global gene expression profile in AtT20 pituitary cells. We found that NSBP1 modulates the fidelity of cellular transcription in the nucleosome binding-dependent manner.

DESIGN
Stable clones overexpressing wild type mouse NSBP1 protein or mutated NSBP1SE protein which does not bind to nucleosomes were generated by retroviral infection of AtT20 cells. siRNA treatment was applied to down regulate NSBP1 in the cells. Total RNA was collected from biological triplicates and analyzed by Affymetrix expression arrays.
