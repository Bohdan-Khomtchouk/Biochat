ra12-03_raptor-nacl - Characterization to raptor mutants (partner of the kinase TOR) and of their answer to the salt stress. - Sowing on metal grids on MS/2 medium with continuous light. Transfer after 12 days of culture for 3h to liquid MS/2 medium containing or not 200 mM NaCl.

DESIGN
7 dye-swap - gene knock out, treated vs untreated comparison

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
