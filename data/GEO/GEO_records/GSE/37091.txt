TITLE
Gene signature of young and replicative senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs regulate various cellular processes. While several genes associated with replicative senescence have been described in endothelial cells, miRNAs that regulate these genes remain largely unknown. The present study was designed to identify miRNAs associated with replicative senescence and their target genes in HUVECs. Gene profiling was established using the same RNA input as that used for miRNA profiing. We have employed Agilent Whole Human Genome microarray platform  to evaluate the expressions of 19,596 human genes .

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were established for young and replicative senescent HUVECs
