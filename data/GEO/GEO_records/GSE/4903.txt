TITLE
Atrioventricular junction gene expression at embryonic day 10.5-11.0 in the mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goals of this study were to identify new candidates involved in the development of the Atrioventricular cushions in the mouse heart. Keywords = Heart development Keywords = Atrioventricular cushions Keywords = Atrioventricular junction Keywords = Atrioventricular myocardium Keywords = embryonic day ED10.5-11.0 Keywords = ventricles Keywords: development analysis

DESIGN
The atrioventricular junction and ventricular region were dissected from 80 embryonic day 10.5-11.0, wild type, C57BL/6 mouse hearts.  RNA was isolated from the respective regions, amplified using the Arcturus RiboAmp HS RNA amplification kit, and hybridized to Affymetrix MOE430A expression chips in duplicate.  Comparison between atrioventricular gene expression and ventricular gene expression will allow for the identification of genes necessary in the development of the AV cushions.
