TITLE
myb118 mutation; Identification of genes misregulated in developing seeds of Arabidopsis in response to the myb118 mutation.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra12-06_myb118; myb118 mutation What are the genes over expressed or down regulated in seeds in response to a myb118 mutation? Plants of the different genotypes (wild-type, myb118 mutant, myb118 antisense lines named 0E3 and T16) were grown in a green house, their flower were tagged and seeds were harvested 10 days after anthesis. Seeds were extracted from the siliques, stored at -80Â°C prior to RNA extraction.

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - normal vs transgenic comparaison

PLATFORM
GPL17404 INRA-CNRS-UEVE Arabidopsis thaliana 73K [120228_Athal_CATMA62_AA_exp]
