TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles of Germinal Center B Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the gene expression profiles of germinal center B cells obtained by FACS analyses of normal human lymph nodes.

DESIGN
We used FACS analyses to isolate germinal center B cells from 3 different individuals with one individual sampled twice. The overall goal was simply to identify genes that are highly expressed or silent in these purified cell populations.
