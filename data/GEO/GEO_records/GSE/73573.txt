TITLE
Expression data for KDM1B knockdown in Glioma-Initiating Cells (GICs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, with glioma initiating cells (GICs) implicated to be critical for tumor progression and resistance to therapy. KDM1B is involved in regulating GICs' responses to hypoxia, since over-expression of KDM1B delays the cell growth under hypoxia while knocking-down of KDM1B in GICs promotes their survival and tumorigenic abilities.

DESIGN
We used RNA-Sequencing to detail the global change of gene expression in GICs with knockdown of KDM1B, and identified de-regulated genes and pathways downstream of KDM1B. CD133+ D456MG GICs were infected with non-targeting control and shRNA of KDM1B. Then RNA was extracted and gene expression was profiled by RNA-Seq.
