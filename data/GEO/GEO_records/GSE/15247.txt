TITLE
Shg1p associated RNAs

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RNA co-immunopurification with TAP-tagged Shg1p (a component of the Set1 histone methyltransferase complex, SET1C) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An untagged (BY4741) served as a control (Gerber et al. 2004). Cells were grown to mid-log phase in rich media and harvested by centrifugation. TAP-tagged Shg1 was affinity-purified from cell-free extracts with IgG sepharose and eluted with TEV protease. RNA was isolated from extract (=input) and from the purified protein sample with the RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen). RNAs were reverse transcribed using a mixture of oligo-dT and random nonamer oligos in the presence of amino-allyl dUTP/dNTP mixture. cDNAs were fluorescently labeled and hybridized on yeast oligo microarrays over night at 42 degrees in formamide-based hybridization buffer. For the method see experimental procedure for RNA IP (Gerber/Dichtl).

DESIGN
An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract.
