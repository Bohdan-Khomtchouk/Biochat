TITLE
Global gene expression changes in patient-derived CML cell line K562 after short- and long-term BCR-ABL kinase inhibition.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
K562 cells were treated with the BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib over an extended period of time to determine how BCR-ABL inhibition affects BCR-ABL-dependent negative feedback and erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) signaling.  Specifically, what types of changes (upregulation versus downregulation) occur in both the negative and positive regulators of growth-factor receptor signaling.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from K562 cells treated with 0.2% DMSO for 24hrs or 100nM dasatinib for 4hrs, 8hrs, and 24hrs.
