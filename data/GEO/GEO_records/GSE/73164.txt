TITLE
Small molecule mediated annotation of miRNAs regulating HCV hijacking of lipid pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As part of SMART strategy, we aimed to characterize changes in miRNA expression associated with 25-hydroxycholesterol's antiviral effects.

DESIGN
Huh7.5 hepatoma cells were infected with a cell culture adapted JFH1 strain (JFH-1T; MOI = 0.1).  48 hours post-infection, cells were treated with either 5 Î¼M 25-hydroyxcholesterol or methanol (vehicle).  24 hours post- drug treatment, cells were lysed.

PLATFORM
GPL20933 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, v11.0
