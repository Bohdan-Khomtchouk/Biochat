TITLE
Recombinant and plasma-derived Factor VIII products induce distinct splenic cytokine microenvironments in hemophilia A

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the gene expression in dendritic cells after treating hemiphilic mice with HBSS, plasma derived or recombinant factor VIII Gene expression in dendritic cells were measured 24 hours post treatment

DESIGN
Hemophilic mice with treated with either (HBSS, rFVIII or pdFVIII) 24 hours post treatment the spleens were isolated and CD11+ DCs were purified. The gene expression in the DCs were then investigated by microarray studies.
