TITLE
Measuring transcriptional differences between Caulobacter crescentus cultured in nitrate versus ammonium as the sole nitrogen source

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
This study is measuring the steady-state levels of mRNA in wild-type Caulobacter crescentus grown in M2 defined medium containing either ammonium or nitrate as the sole nitrogen source.

DESIGN
Four independent cultures of Caulobacter crecentus were grown in each of two medium conditions: M2(nitrate)glucose and M2(ammonium)glucose.  Cultures in each medium type were grown to OD660=0.3 and RNA was isolated from each.

PLATFORM
