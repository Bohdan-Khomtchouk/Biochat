TITLE
cFos-Sox9 Axis Reprograms Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells into Chondroblastic Osteosarcoma [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal is to profile cFos binding sites in an p53 knockout mouse bone marrow-derived stem cells (mBMSCs).

DESIGN
Four single clones (clone2, 4, 8, 12) of p53 knockout (p53KO) mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing either luciferase (Luc) or cFos cDNAs. RNA was extracted from cells and subject to RNAseq.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
