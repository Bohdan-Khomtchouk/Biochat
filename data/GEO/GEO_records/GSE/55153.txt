TITLE
Epigenome signatures during gastric carcinogenesis based on next generation sequencing [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Because gastric cancer cells already had genetic and epigenetic alterations which can affect the gastric carcinogenesis, we tried to characterize genetic and epigenetic changes during gastric carcinogenesis. To do this, we performed SNP array.

DESIGN
Copy number alteration profiles of gastric mucosa, intestinal metaplasia, and gastric cancer cells were generated by SNP6.0 Array.

PLATFORM
GPL6801 [GenomeWideSNP_6] Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array
