TITLE
Improved DNA methylation analysis via enrichment of demethylated cells expressing an X-inactivated GFP transgene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The demethylating drug 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-aza-2dC) is frequently used to investigate the effect of global DNA demethylation on gene expression in cultured mammalian cells. Here, we utilize a novel method that uses the reactivation of an X-inactivated GFP transgene as a marker to enrich for cells that have undergone drug-induced demethylation. By combining it with microarray gene expression profiling, we demonstrate the method’s utility in identifying genes activated by global DNA demethylation. Keywords: 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine; methylation; dermal fibroblast; X-linked GFP
