TITLE
Gene expression signature of carcinoma cell response to extracellular matrix

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate changes in gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells upon interaction with different extracellular matrices

DESIGN
Gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was assayed after overnight incubation of the cells on gelatin or dense fibrillar collagen (HDFC) matrices at the presence or absence of serum in tissue culture medium. Five repeats were performed
