TITLE
Global analysis of gene expression by SV40 T antigen in mouse embryo fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SV40 large T antigen (TAg) contributes to cell transformation, in part, by targeting two well characterized tumor suppressors, pRb and p53. TAg expression affects the transcriptional circuits controlled by Rb and by p53. We have performed a microarray analysis to examine the global change in gene expression induced by wild-type TAg and TAg-mutants, in an effort to link changes in gene expression to specific transforming functions. For this analysis we have used MEFs expressing TAg or infected by SV40. Our analysis indicates that TAg can induce interferon-stimulated genes in MEFs and that this induction depends upon the LXCXE motif and p53 binding.

DESIGN
Two independent wild-type MEFs and three independent MEF cell lines expressing TAg and the mutants were used. Additionally, three independent mock and SV40 infections were conduted in MEFs. Total RNA was isolated from with the RNeasy kit. Total RNA was processed by the Genomics and Proteomics Core Laboratories at the University of Pittsburgh and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array. MAS 5.0 was used to obtain the present/absent calls and CEL files were normalized by RMA to obtain log2 expression values.
