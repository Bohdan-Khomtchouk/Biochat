TITLE
Small RNA and mRNA transcriptome profiling in wildtype mice at multiple stages of spermatogenesis, from whole testis at day 1 postpartum (pp), day 3 pp, and day 7 pp and purified leptotene/zygotene and pachytene spermatocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are essential for spermatogenesis. However, the stage‑specific requirements for specific miRNAs in the male mammalian germ line remain largely uncharacterized. The miR‑34 family is, to date, the only miRNA proven to be necessary for the production of sperm in mice, though its germline roles are poorly understood. Here, we generate and analyze paired small RNA and mRNA profiles across different stages of germline development in male mice, focusing on time points shortly before and during meiotic prophase I.

DESIGN
Testes from mice at day 1 pp, day 3 pp, day 7 pp, or from adult mice (day 70-80 pp) were removed, weighed and decapsulated. Mixed leptotene/zygotene or pachytene spermatocytes were isolated from the testis of adult mice.  RNA was isolated from either the whole testis or from purified spermatocytes using TRIzol.  Small RNA or RNA-Seq libraries were prepped using Illumina's sequencing library preparation kits. Libraries were genereated from two biological replicates per sample.
