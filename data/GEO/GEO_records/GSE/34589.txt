TITLE
Elk1 Directs a Critical Component of Growth Signaling by the Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Elk1 directs selective gene induction that is a substantial and critical component of growth signaling by AR in PC cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression in  LNCaP cells was determined in androgen-depleted medium in response to R1881 in  ELK1 knock down (via AR shRNA) or in  cells treated with control shRNA.
