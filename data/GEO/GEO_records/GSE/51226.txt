TITLE
MicroRNA transciptional profiling in murine abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) model - Day 7

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to identify differentially regulated microRNAs in infrarenal mouse aortic tissue after AAA-induction with PPE, compared with sham-operated mice. This treatment leads to rapid development of infrarenal aortic aneurysms with significant diameter differences observed by Day 7. We found 41 miRNAs were up-regulated with aneurysm and 37 down-regulated at p < 0.05, which were also altered by > 1.5-fold.

DESIGN
Utilizing the PPE infusion model, we induced AAA in Male 10-week-old C57/Bl6 mice, 7 days after AAA-induction with PPE. One array per mouse, 5 mice per group, two groups (PPE and sham).
