TITLE
Changes in Gene Expression Profiles in Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated with Scleroderma Treated with Tadalafil

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study looked at changes in gene expression profiles in subjects with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Scleroderma (PAH-SSc) before and after treatment with Tadalafil. A total of ten subjects were enrolled and various clinical assessments including 6-minute walk tes, cardiac MRI and right heart catheterization were done in addition to gene expression study.

DESIGN
An open label study with subjects who have pulmonary arterial hypertension and scleroderma treated with tadalafil and their gene expression profiles were analyzed before and after tadalafil treatment
