TITLE
Expression data from human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-375 play an important role in regulating the osteogenesis in human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells, following specific genes are up-regulated or down-regulated. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying osteogenesis and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes or down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Samples from human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells transfected with pre-miR-375 or control vector on the 7 days of osteogenic induction were for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells were obtained from ScienCell Company, and the catalog number is 7510
