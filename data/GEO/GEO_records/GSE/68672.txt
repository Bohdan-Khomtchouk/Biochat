TITLE
Differential microRNA expression profiling between human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and human neonatal dermal fibroblasts (NDFs).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed microRNA expression profiling of iPSCs and NDFs as a discovery platform to identify microRNAs involved in reprogramming of NDFs to iPSCs.

DESIGN
Using Agilent human miRNA (V3) 8X15K microarray, we performed microRNA profiling of iPSCs at passage 20 and NDFs at passage 5

PLATFORM
GPL11487 Agilent-021827 Human miRNA Microarray [miRNA_107_Sep09_2_105]
