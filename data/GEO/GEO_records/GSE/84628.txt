TITLE
ChIP-seq of Active Histone Mark (H3K27ac) and Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MYF5 and MYOD) in Fusion Negative Rhabdomyosarcoma Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed Chip-seq analysis of Myogenic Regulatory Transcription Factors (MYF5 and MYOD) in Fusion Negative Rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Endogenous MYF5/H3K27ac Chip-seq was performed in Rh18 cells and MYOD-H3K27ac Chip-seq was performed in RD cells, given that these cell lines express these proteins in a mutually-exclusive manner. Analysis revealed a common subset of enhancer and promoter regions bound by these transcription factors that are enriched for cell cycle regulation and embryonic muscle development pathways.  Keywords: rhabdomyiosarcoma, Chip-seq, chromatin, Transcription factos, MYF5, MYOD

DESIGN
5 samples are deposited including input DNA controls for each of 2 cell lines.

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
