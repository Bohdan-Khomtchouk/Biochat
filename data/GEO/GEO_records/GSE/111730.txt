TITLE
RNA-seq of bone marrow derived macrophages stimulated with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that MPLA reprograms macrophages in a way that supports a persistent monocyte/macrophage chemokine secretion profile reflected in macrophage mRNA. Additionally, this RNA-seq data revealed that certain genes (e.g. phagocytosis-related) persist much longer after MPLA than others (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines).

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived macrophages were harvested for RNA after 4hrs of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) priming, 24hrs of MPLA priming, and 3 days following the end of priming

PLATFORM
GPL21493 Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Mus musculus)
