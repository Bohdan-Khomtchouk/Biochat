TITLE
miRNA expression data from MCF-7 cells, overexpressing ANXA1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Annexin 1 (ANXA1), an endogenous anti-inflammatory protein which modulates cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis has been implicated in cancer initiation and progression.  ANXA1 was previously shown to be regulated by hsa-miR-196a and promoted cell proliferation and anchorarge-dependent growth and suppressed apoptosis. However, whether ANXA1 itself regulates miRNA expression is unknown.  Therefore, in this study, we investigated the regulation of miRNA by ANXA1 in breast cancer cells. Using microarray technology, 12 miRNAs were found to be significantly and consistently  downregulated in MCF-7 cells (MCF-V5) overexpressing ANXA1 overexpressing MCF-7 cells (MCF-V5).  Hsa-miR-26b* and hsa-miR-562 were chosen for further investigation.The data suggest that miR-26b* and miR-562 may play a role in ANXA1-induced migration and possibly angiogenesis by targeting NFKB and point towards a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.

DESIGN
Breast cancer MCF-7 cells (MCF-V5) overexpressing ANXA1  were cultured for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix miRNA microarrays. These were compared against the control, which were MCF-7 cells (MCF-EV) carrying an empty expression vector. Expression analyses were carried out in triplicates
