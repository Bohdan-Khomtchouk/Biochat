TITLE
Virus-Induced Airway Disease in Mice (C57BL/6J, d21/d49)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in lungs of C57BL/6J mice that develop chronic airway disease phenotypes after a single Sendai virus infection, compared with mice treated with UV-inactivated virus. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Whole lung RNA was analyzed from 3 mice per condition per time point for days 21 and 49 post infection, Sendai virus versus UV-inactivated virus, C57BL/6J mouse strain.
