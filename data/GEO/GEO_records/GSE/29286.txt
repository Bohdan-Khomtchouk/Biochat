TITLE
microRNA expression during skeletal muscle differentiation and exercse in skeletal muscle.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate microRNAs related to mitochondria biogenesis in skeletal muscle, microRNA expressions during skeletal muscle differentiation and exercise were analyzed in vivo and in vitro.

DESIGN
Murine skeletal muscle cell (C2C12) were assigned to undifferentiated, differentiated, and passively stretched (exercise mimicked). C57BL/6S mice were assigned to resting, acute exercise (1day), and chronic exercise (7days). Low molecular weight RNA ( < 200 nucleotides) was isolated from C2C12 cell or tibialis anterior muscle of mice and hybridized to Ncode microRNA microarrays. The experiment was performed using a loop design for the data analysis.
