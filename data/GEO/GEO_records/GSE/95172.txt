TITLE
Expression data from MOLM-14 human acute myeloid leukemia cell line after mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of the sudy is to evalute the role of mTORC1 signalling in the regulation of the metabolism of MOLM-14 cells. We used microarrays to investigate gene expression in MOLM-14 cells after down-regulation of mTORC1 signalling by rapamycin.

DESIGN
MOLM-14 cells (biological replicates) were treated or not by rapamycin 10nM (24 hours)
