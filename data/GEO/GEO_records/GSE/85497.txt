TITLE
transcriptional profiling of mouse full thickness skin of PPARgamma null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PPARgamma null (PpargΔ/Δ) mice present a generalized lipoatrophy and a dramatic skin phenotype, characterized by delayed hair morphogensis and the appearance, at adult age, of severe inflammatory infiltration. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the delayed hair morphogenesis observed in PpargΔ/Δ mice, we used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in full thickness skin of PpargΔ/Δ mice and respective control mice at embryionic stage E17.5.

DESIGN
We examined 2 experimental groups: PpargΔ/Δ and control mice at E17.5. For each experimental group we analysed the transcriptional profile of 4 individual RNA from full thickness skin.
