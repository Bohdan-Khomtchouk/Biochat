TITLE
Network Understanding of SNAIL inhibitor induced perturbations in EMT models

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two engineered HMLE cell lines representing various degrees of EMT were treated with a drug in development to target and inhibit SNAIL interaction with PTP53, called GN-25 total RNA was isolated and analyzed in an Agilent two-color experiment. Four biological replicates of each condition were directly compared, GN25 treated compared to untreated reference

DESIGN
The impact of GN-25 on gene expression was investigated using two engineered HMLE cell lines: one stably overexpressing Kras another stably overexpressing Kras and SNAIL
