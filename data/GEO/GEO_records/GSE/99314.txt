TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of YAP and TFCP2 binding DNA in liver cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To seek additional evidence that YAP closely interacts with TFCP2, we performed ChIP-seq assays in Bel-7402 cells using anti-TFCP2 or anti-YAP antibodies. We found that a subset of YAP binding regions overlapped with the TFCP2-occupied sites, suggesting that YAP- and TFCP2-regulated transcriptional outputs are likely correlated.
