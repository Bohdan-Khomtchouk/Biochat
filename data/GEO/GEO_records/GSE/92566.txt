TITLE
Aberrant connective tissue differentiation towards cartilage and bone underlies human keloids in African Americans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pilot study: Observational clinical study

DESIGN
To characterize keloids in African Americans, we performed transcriptional profiling of biopsies from large chronic keloids, adjacent nonlesional (NL) skin (n=3) and a newly formed keloid lesion using Affymetrix HGU133 2.0 plus arrays. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry staining were done to confirm increased expression of relevant genes
