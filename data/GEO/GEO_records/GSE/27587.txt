TITLE
Mixing Experiment - Mouse Kidney and Spleen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The design of this experiment was based on the assumption that transcript levels will change linearly while going from 100 percent of one tissue to 100 percent of the other. This assumed linear data set could be used to evaluate various issues related to low-level microarray data analysis.

DESIGN
Hybridization cocktails from two mouse tissues, kidney and spleen, were prepared and mixed in a range of ratios and applied to 4-5 replicate GLYCOv1 chips for analysis. The mixture ratios were as follows: 100 percent kidney, 75 percent Kidney/25 percent spleen, 50 percent kidney/50 percent spleen, 25 percent kidney/75 percent spleen, and 100 percent spleen.
