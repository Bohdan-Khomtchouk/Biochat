TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles in Intracranial Arteries and Abdominal Aortae

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were used to identify pathways common to arteries from different vascular beds. We used the Illumina Sentrix-6 whole-genome microarray platform to identify genes that are expressed in common between abdominal aorta and intracranial arteries of the circle of Willis. Keywords: Characterization of expression in normal arteries from different vascular beds: intracranial arteries and abdominal aorta.

DESIGN
Intracranial vessels and abdominal aortae were obtained from cadavers and preserved in RNAlater. RNA was isolated from single artery samples.

PLATFORM
GPL2507 Sentrix Human-6 Expression BeadChip
