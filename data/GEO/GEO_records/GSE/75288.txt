TITLE
Transcriptome changes triggered by the synthetic defense elicitors DPMP in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
DPMP (2,4-dichloro-6-{(E)-[(3-methoxyphenyl)imino]methyl}phenol )  is a newly identified synthetic defense elicitor. In order to uncover transcriptional patterns associated with defense activation, we profiled by mRNA-seq responses triggered in 14 d-old plate-grown Arabidopsis seedlings by continuous exposure to  3 µM DPMP or Mock.

DESIGN
After Arabidopsis plants were grown for 14 days on ½ MS agar plates containing either 3 µM DPMP  or mock (solvent only), shoot and root tissues were analyzed separately. We performed two independent biological replicates and sequenced the respective libraries using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL17639 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
