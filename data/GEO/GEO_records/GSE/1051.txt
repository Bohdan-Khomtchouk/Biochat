TITLE
Seed development in LEAFY COTYLEDON1 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in Ws-0 lec1 (LEAFY COTYLEDON1) mutant Arabidopsis thaliana. Developmental stages studied includes 24-Hr post-fertilization, globular stage, cotyledon stage, mature green stage, post-mature green stage, and seedlings. Microarray Methods: Total RNA was extracted using the Hot Borate Method [Stones et. al. PNAS vol 98 no 20: 11806-11811 (2001)]. Biotinylated cRNA were prepared using the ENZO BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Farmingdale, NY).  cRNA was subsequently hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis GeneChips. The scanned array images were analyzed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 4.0 (MAS 4.0) with a global scaling intensity set at 500. Keywords: other
