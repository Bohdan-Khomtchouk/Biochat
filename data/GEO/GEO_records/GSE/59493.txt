TITLE
Human dental pulp cells cultured in FBS vs. chemically defined conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) are one of the promising resources for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, including derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, our current protocol uses reagents of animal origin, mainly fetal bovine serum (FBS) with potential risk of infectious diseases and unwanted immunogenicity. This time, we designed a chemically defined protocol to isolate and maintain the growth and differentiation potentials of hDPCs.

DESIGN
To investigate the effect of chemically defined condition on global gene expression in DPCs, we cultured them in FBS and chemically defined conditions.
