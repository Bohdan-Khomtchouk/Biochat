TITLE
A distinct and unique M2 transcriptional program expressed by tumor-associated macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Description This series contains microarrays for tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) purified from 8 week old male C57/BL6N mice, 3 weeks after tumor implantation into the left hind limb. Peritoneal exudates cells (PECs) were also harvested from control C57/BL6N mice. The resulting adherent populations were maintained in culture and resting TAMs and PECs were treated for 4 hours with 100 ng/mL of LPS to promote macrophage activation. RNA isolation and cDNA microarrays: Total RNA was isolated from approximately 20x10e6 PEC and TAM cells using standard Trizol purification protocols (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Microarrays were manufactured at the NCI, Laboratory of Molecular Technology (Frederick MD). The 10,368 Mm UniGem2 set was printed on poly-lysine coated glass slides and hybridized according to NCI facility protocols. All slides were scanned using as Axon GenePix 4000 scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster city, CA) and resulting data was uploaded for analysis to the mAdb microarray database ( http://madb.nci.nih.gov/ ).
