TITLE
A quantitative analysis of CLIP methods for identifying binding sites of RNA-binding proteins (CLIP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) is increasingly used to map transcriptome-wide binding sites of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). We developed a method for CLIP data analysis and applied it to compare 254 nm CLIP with PAR-CLIP, which involves crosslinking of photoreactive nucleotides with 365 nm UV light. We found small differences in the accuracy of these methods in identifying binding sites of HuR, a protein that binds low-complexity sequences and Argonaute 2, which has a complex binding specificity. We show that crosslink-induced mutations lead to single-nucleotide resolution for both PAR-CLIP and CLIP. Our results confirm the expectation from original CLIP publications that RNA-binding proteins do not protect sufficiently their sites under the denaturing conditions used during the CLIP procedure, and we show that extensive digestion with sequence-specific ribonucleases strongly biases the set of recovered binding sites. We finally show that this bias can be substantially reduced by milder nuclease digestion conditions.

DESIGN
We performed duplicate experiments for each variant of the CLIP protocol (CLIP, PAR-CLIP), each protein (HuR, Ago2), and enzymatic digestion (complete T1 digestion, mild MNase digestion). In addition, we performed a single PAR-CLIP experiment with mild T1 digestion.
