TITLE
miRNA expression of myeloma cell lines under hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By using world wildly used myeloma cell lines (RPMI8226, KMS-11, KMS-12BM, and MM.1S), we conducted whole miRNA screening against the cells that were subjected by chronic hypoxia condition.

DESIGN
We compared four myeloma cell lines (RPMI8226, KMS-11, KMS-12BM, and MM.1S) cultured under hypoxia with cultured under normoxia (48hr) to find new important miRNAs of myeloma.
