TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of chronic periodontitis patients' gingival tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the molecular and cellular mechanism for chronic periodontitis in patients' gingival tissue by whole transcriptome sequencing.

DESIGN
Compare gene expression profiles between between periodontitis and healthy gingival samples using RNA-Seq (Illumina platform: Hi-Seq 2000)

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
