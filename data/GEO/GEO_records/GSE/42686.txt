TITLE
Chip-chip from undifferentiated and neuron-differentiated hMSCs cells with EZH2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EZH2 plays an important role in stem cell renewal and maintenance by inducing gene silencing via its histone methyltransferase activity. Previously, we showed EZH2 downregulation markedly enhances neuron differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). To understand how EZH2 regulates neuron differentiation of hMSCs, we wanted to identify the target genes of EZH2. For this reasons we performed ChIP-on-chip experiments using specific EZH2 antibodies followed by a human promoter array for the whole human genome.

DESIGN
The 3A6-hMSCs were differentiated into neuron for 5 days, and then 109 cells were harvested for the ChIP-on-chip assay. The procedure was based on the manufacturer's instructions (NimbleGen).
