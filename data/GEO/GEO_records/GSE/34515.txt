TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human blood classical monocytes (CD14++CD16-), CD16 positive monocytes (CD14+16++ and CD14++CD16+), and CD1c+ CD19- dendritic cells [human data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study gene expression of human blood classical monocytes (CD14++CD16-), CD16 positive monocytes  (consisting of non-classical CD14+16++ and intermediate CD14++CD16+ monocytes) and CD1c+ CD19- dendritic cells from healthy subjects were investigated. Keywords: expression profiling by array

DESIGN
The two major monocyte subsets and the CD1+ blood dendritic cells (DCs CD1c+ CD19-) were isolated from venous heparinized blood of three apparently healthy human volunteers (donors 1, 2 and  3) using MACS technology with all reagents and tools from Miltenyi Biotec. RNA was isolated and 1 Âµg was labeled using the Affymetrix One-Cycle Target Labeling Kit and the biotinylated cRNA used to perform Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays. The data sets for CD14++CD16- classical monocytes are tagged CD16neg, the data sets for CD16 positive monocytes are tagged CD16pos and the data sets for the CD1c+CD19- DCs are tagged CD1cpos.
