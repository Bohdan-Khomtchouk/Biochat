TITLE
A general mechanism for transcription regulation by Oct1 and Oct4 in response to genotoxic and oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identify inducible binding of the transcription factor Oct1 to numerous targets following exposure to hydrogen peroxide.

DESIGN
Oct1 bound ChIP fragments were sequenced in the presence and absence of H2O2 exposure using HeLa cells. Both 26 and 36bp reads were generated. Each processed file contains a list of genomic regions (NCBI 36.1, H_sapiens_Mar_2006, hg18) enriched for Oct1 binding. These files were generated by running the EnrichedRegionMaker on ScanSeqs window scored data, see http://useq.sourceforge.net/ . Adjacent and overlapping windows with a q-value FDR of 0.0001 were joined into larger enriched regions. The best scoring window's scores are used to represent the enriched region.
