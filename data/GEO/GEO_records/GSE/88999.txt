TITLE
Gene expression profiling of differentially treated hematopoietic stem cells (LSK SLAM)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression prolile of POL5551 treated (continuos infusion, 2 wks, 100 mg/kg/day) HSC was compared to that of G-CSF (100 ug/kg/injection, q12h, 2 vs. 5 days) and sham-op treated cells in order to identify potential inherent differences between the specimen. The cells were isolated from the BM of differentially treated mice.

DESIGN
Mice were treated with G-CSF (2 days and 5 days), POL5551 (2 wks) or sham-op. BM was isolated and enriched for kit (CD117)+ progenitors and LSK SLAM cells (HSC) were then flow sorted from the positive cell fraction.
