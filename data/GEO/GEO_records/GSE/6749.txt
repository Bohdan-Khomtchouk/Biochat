TITLE
renal ischemia vs sham - 7d

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
this experiment was designed to determine the effect of ischemia reperfusion on angiogenesis gene expression after 7 days of recovery Keywords: disease state

DESIGN
rat angiongenesis gene chips were designed.  RNA was compared from kidneys of post-ischemic rats and sham-operated rats.  4 pairs of rats/ 1 hybridization each. data were first analyzed to combine replicate spot intensities for each hybridization; these normalized ratios were then averaged across each hybridization to determine alteration in gene expression in response to ischemia reperfusion.
