TITLE
Comparative analysis of D. shibae wild-type vs. ∆ctrA, ∆chpT and ∆cckA

ORGANISM
Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12 = DSM 16493

SUMMARY
Comparison of D. shibae wild-type with single gene knock-out strains of a phosphorelay conserved in Alphaproteobacteria (∆ctrA, ∆chpT and ∆cckA)

DESIGN
Loop-design, two biological replicates of D. shibae wild-type, ∆ctrA, ∆chpT and ∆cckA in mid-exponential phase (OD 0.4) and stationary phase (6h after culture reached maximum OD)

PLATFORM
GPL11243 Agilent-020623 Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12 15k Oligo Microarray (Feature Number version)
