TITLE
Gene expression profile of human fibroblasts stimulated by breast cancer cell lines secretome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) were treated under serum-free conditions with cell culture media conditioned by breast cancer cell lines (SkBr3, MDA-MB-468, T47D) for 72 hours and subjected to gene expression profiling with Illumina platform.

DESIGN
NHDF treatments with c.m. was performed on independent biological triplicates and RNA derived from each replicate was separately extracted. Three hundred ng of total RNA were used for gene expression profiling by microarray using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
