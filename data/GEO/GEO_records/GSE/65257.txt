TITLE
Gene expression profiling of advanced murine K-RasG12V lung adenocarcinomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We aimed to analyze the transcriptional profile of full-blown murine lung adenocarcinomas driven by K-RasG12V oncogene.

DESIGN
We used a GEM model of lung adenocarcinoma driven by a resident K-RasG12V oncogene. On average, tumors were collected 10 months after Adeno-CRE infection.
