TITLE
Transcript profiling of wild-type and dcl1-5 early globular embryos

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) is required for miRNA biogenesis and embryonic pattern formation. Presumably the patterning defects observed in dcl1-5 null embryos are due to the loss of miRNAs and the consequent up-regulation of their respective targets. To test which miRNA targets were up-regulated in dcl1 embryos relative to wild-type embryos, we performed genome-wide transcript profiling of wild-type and dcl1-5 early globular embryos using directional mRNA-Seq.
