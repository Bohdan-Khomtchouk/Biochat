TITLE
Response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from young (≤ 45 years old) and old ( > 60 years old) healthy donors to influenza virus derived peptide stimulation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD4 T cell responses are characterized based on a limited number of molecular markers selected from exisiting knowledge. The goal of the experiment was to assess antigenic-peptide specific T-cell responses in vitro without bias using microarrays.

DESIGN
PBMCs were isolated from 11 young (≤ 45 years old) and old ( > 60 years old) healthy donors. The cells were stimulated with peptides derived from influenza virus for 24 hours. Unstimulated cells were cultured without the peptides for 24 hours.
