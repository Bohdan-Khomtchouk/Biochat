TITLE
Effects of ionomycin (final concentration of 2 µM) and BAPTA/AM (final concentration of 6 µM) on the RO82 W-1 human thyroid cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identifiy cellular pathways modified by calcium storing in cells presenting a glycolytic metabolism and a poor mitochondrial biogenesis. Keywords: calcium stress response in RO82 W-1 cells

DESIGN
In duplicate, cells treated with ionomycin or BAPTA/AM during 96h compared to equivalent DMSO treated cells
