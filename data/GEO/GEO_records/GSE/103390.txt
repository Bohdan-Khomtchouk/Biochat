TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of brainstem samples from mutants with Hoxa5 postnatal inactivation versus controls at postnatal day 21

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
After inactivation of Hoxa5 at postnatal days (P)1-P4, we established RNA-seq profiling with RNA extracted from P21 brainstem of tamoxifen-treated Hoxa5flox/flox;CMV-CreERT2+/- (Hoxa5 cKO) pups and  tamoxifen-treated Hoxa5flox/flox;CMV-CreERT2-/-(Hoxa5 control) pups

DESIGN
To explore HOXA5 downstream target genes in the postnatal brainstem, we carried out transcriptomic analyses by RNA-Seq using a model of postnatal Hoxa5 loss-of-function. We induced Hoxa5 inactivation after birth (P1 to P4) using the tamoxifen-inducible CMV-CreERT2 mice and conditional Hoxa5 floxed allele mice (Hoxa5flox). RNA was extracted from the brainstem of P21 tamoxifen-treated Hoxa5flox/flox;CMV-CreERT2+/- pups and from tamoxifen-treated Hoxa5flox/flox;CMV-CreERT2-/- littermates (see extract protocol).
