TITLE
Sox2 suppresses gastric tumorigenesis in mice [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Sox2 expression marks gastric stem and progenitor cells, raising important questions regarding the genes regulated by Sox2 and the role of Sox2 itself during stomach homeostasis and disease. The goal of this study is to determine the function of and the genes regulated by Sox2 in the stomach. Methods: mRNA profiles of Sox2 WT and Sox2 KO gastric glands were generated by RNA-sequencing, in triplicate, using a Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument, resulting in 36 million single-end 50bp reads per smaple. Sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (mm10/GRCm38) using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013). Read counts over transcripts were calculated using HTSeq v.0.6.0 (Anders et al., 2015) based on a current Ensembl annotation file for mm10/GRCm38 (release 75). Results: Sox2 is dispensiable for gastric stem cell self-renewal and epithelial homeostasis, however modulates the expression of cancer and intestinal related genes.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of stomachs from 10 week old Sox2 WT and Sox2 KO mice were generated by  sequencing, in triplicate, using a Illumina HiSeq 2500.
