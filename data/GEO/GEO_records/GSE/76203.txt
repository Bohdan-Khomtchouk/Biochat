TITLE
Integrative genomics identifies the molecular basis of resistance to Azacytidine therapy in Myelodysplastic Syndromes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq of bone marrow CD34+ cells of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients to identify at the molecular pathways involved in primary resistance to AZA therapy.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of bone marrow CD34+ cells of MDS and CMML patients at pre-treatment and after 6 cycles of AZA treatment to identify at the molecular pathways involved in resistance to AZA therapy.
