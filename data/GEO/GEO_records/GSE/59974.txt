TITLE
MiRNA expression arrays from esophageal squamous cell carcinomas with different neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT)  followed by surgery has been proved to improve esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients’ survival in comparison with surgery alone. However, the outcomes of CRT are heterogeneous, and no clinical or pathological method could predict CRT response. We aim to identify miRNA markers for ESCC CRT-response prediction through miRNA expression analyses.

DESIGN
MiRNA expression analyses were performed on pretreatment cancer biopsies from 28 ESCCs who received neoadjuvant CRT and surgery using Agilent human miRNA microarrays based on miRBase (release 18.0) GeneChip®.
