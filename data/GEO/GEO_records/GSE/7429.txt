TITLE
Gene Expression of Circulating B Lymphocytes for Osteoporosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B cells produce important cytokines regulate bone metabolism. We comparison gene expression patterns of circulating B cells in blood from 20 postmenopausal females with low or high bone mineral density (BMD): 10 low BMD vs. 10 high BMD. In total 29 differentially expressed genes were identified including some novel genes to be relevant to bone metabolism. These results provide insight into the role of B cells in pathologic osteoporosis. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
B cells were isolated from 70 ml of whole blood from each of 20 women, 10 with high BMD and 10 with low BMD, using B cell positive isolation method (Dynabeads CD19,Pan B) from Invitrogen Life Technologies Dynal Biotech Inc,CA. Total RNA was extracted from B cells using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit.A total of 4ug totalRNA was used to produced targets for each subject according to standard Affymetrix procedures. Hybridization was made for each subject. Robust Multiarray Algorithm was used to normalize the expression data and comparison was performed between high BMD and low BMD subgroups using t-statistics under mutiple-testing adjustment.
