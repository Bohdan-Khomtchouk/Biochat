TITLE
Gene Expression of Circulating B Lymphocytes for Osteoporosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B cells produce important cytokines regulate bone metabolism. We comparison gene expression patterns of circulating B cells in blood from 20 postmenopausal females with low or high bone mineral density (BMD): 10 low BMD vs. 10 high BMD. In total 29 differentially expressed genes were identified including some novel genes to be relevant to bone metabolism. These results provide insight into the role of B cells in pathologic osteoporosis. Keywords: disease state analysis
