TITLE
Co-culture of C. albicans with bacteria

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of C. albicans when monocultured in suspension culture or in biofilms compared to  when co-cultured with C. perfringens in suspension culture, or with E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, C. perfringens, or B. fragilis in biofilms, or in the presence of N-acetylglucosamine in biofilms.

DESIGN
At least 2 replicates for each condition except for biofilms +N-acetylglucosamine, some experiments are two-condition experiments: C. albicans +/- bacteria vs. C. albicans. Some experiments multiple condition: C. albicans +/- bacteria vs. mixed reference of all conditions in that experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL16243 Agilent-020166 Ca21_GE_plus_tiling_2.0 (Feature Number version)
