TITLE
Human bone-derived 11Lin-CD45-CD271+SSEA-4+ mesenchymal stem/stromal cells from young and elderly patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expressions of human bone-derived 11Lin-CD45-CD271+SSEA-4+ mesenchymal stem/stromal cells from young and elderly patients were analyzed. Results provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms of aging and cellular senescence.

DESIGN
Cultured human bone-derived 11Lin-CD45-CD271+SSEA-4+ mesenchymal stem/stromal cells from young (28 to 31years old) and elderly (80 to 91 years old) patients were analyzed.
