TITLE
Knocking down fibroblastic core TFs and/or Overexpressing monocytic core TFs in human dermal fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we simultaneously deconstructed fibroblastic TRNW and reconstituted monocytic TRNW, and analyzed its monocytic and fibroblastic gene expression in comparison with that of fibroblastic TRNW deconstruction only or monocytic TRNW reconstitution only. This study provides an explicit example demonstrating how two networks together regulate gene expression during cell reprogramming processes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human dermal fibroblasts(FIB), human CD14+ monocytes(Mon), knocking down fibroblastic only (KD-only),monocytic core TFs transduced (OE-only), and knocking down plus overxpression (KDOE)
