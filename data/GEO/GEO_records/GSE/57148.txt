TITLE
Characterizing gene expression in lung tissue of COPD subjects using RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression profiling of lung tissue to define molecular pathway of COPD using recent RNA sequencing technology.Lung tissue was obtained from 98 COPD subjects and 91 subjects with normal spirometry. RNA isolated from these samples was processed with RNA-seq using HiSeq 2000. Gene expression measurements were calculated using Cufflinks software. Differentially expressed genes and isoforms were chosen using t-test. Some of differentially expressed genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Examination of lung tissue in COPD patients versus normal control
