Effect of cortisol on S. Typhimurium parental strain and an isogenic scsA mutant

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
S. Typhimurium 112910a parental strain and an isogenic ΔscsA strain were grown to stationary phase in SPI2 inducing minimal medium (MM5.8 - Erikkson et al., 2006 Inf & Imm., 74:1243) with or without supplementation with 1µM cortisol

DESIGN
