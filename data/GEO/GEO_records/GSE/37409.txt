TITLE
Re-activation of EWS-FLI1 suppressed FOXO1 expression as a novel therapeutic strategy for EwingÂ´s sarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transient transfection of a Ewing's Sarcoma cell line expressing type I EWS-FLI1 fusion and doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA against EWS-FLI1 (A673sh)

DESIGN
In total, 7 samples were analysed: empty vector control and two nuclear directed AKT- and CDK2- phosphorylation resistant FOXO1 versions as well as  sh-scrambled and sh-FOXO1, either in the presence (w.o. Doxy.) or absence of EWS-FLI1 (+ Doxy.) each 2 replicates
