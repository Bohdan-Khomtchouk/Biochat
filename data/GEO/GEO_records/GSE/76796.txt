TITLE
Effect of anti-IL-15 administration on T cell and NK cell homeostasis in rhesus macaques (TEM)

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody treatment on T cell and NK cell homeostasis in rhesus macaques. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that repeated administrations of a rhesusized anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody would block IL-15 activity in vivo and result in changes to T and/or NK cell population dynamics that would reflect physiologic IL-15 function. The results provide important information on the specific role IL-15 plays in effector memory T cell and NK cell homeostasis, noting that effector memory T cells but not NK cells can be maintained in the absence of IL-15 signaling by the activity of other cytokines.

DESIGN
Sort-purified CD8+ TEM  from PBMC, before and after treatment with IgG1 Ab and anti-IL15 Ab
