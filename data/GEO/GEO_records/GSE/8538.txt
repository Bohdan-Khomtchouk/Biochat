TITLE
Mesenteric adipose tissue of rats treated with oleoyl-estrone

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this work was to determine if  OE treatment affects the expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism in white adipose tissue. Gene expression in adipose tissue from female treated rats (48 hours) was analysed by hybridization to cDNA arrays and levels of specific mRNAs were determined by Real-Time PCR. Treatment with OE decreased the expression of 232 genes and up-regulated 75 other genes in mesenteric white adipose tissue. Short-term treatment with OE affects adipose tissue capacity to extract fatty acids from lipoproteins and to deal with fatty acid transport and metabolism. Keywords: Effects of a drug on gene expression

DESIGN
The rats were given a daily oral gavage of 10 μmol/kg/day of oleoyl-estrone (OED, Barcelona, Spain) in 0.2 ml of sunflower oil during two days, by means of stomach cannulae. Controls received only the oil gavage. After 48 hours of the beginning of treatment, the mesenteric white adipose tissue was  dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC. Total RNA was extracted from adipose mesenteric tissue using Tripure isolation kit. Gene expression was analysed by hybridization to cDNA arrays (AtlasTM Rat Array 1.2 from BD-Clontech, Mountain View CA, USA). Two samples from control animals and two samples from treated animales were analyzed.
