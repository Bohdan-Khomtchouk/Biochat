TITLE
RNAseq of ∆yacP (∆rae1) mutant and plasmid complemented strain

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
To identify the substrates of YacP (Rae1) by determine which RNAs are affected in a ∆yacP mutant and plasmid complemented strain

DESIGN
4 strains were sequenced in triplicate: SSB1002 (W168 wild-type), CCB375 (W168 ∆yacP), CCB604 (W168 ∆yacP + pDG-yacP) + IPTG, CCB604 (W168 ∆yacP + pDG-yacP) - IPTG

PLATFORM
