TITLE
Phrenic neuron determinant gain-of-function screen in M. musculus ES cell-derived motor neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression response after induction of putative phrenic neuronal determinants in ES cell-derived motor neurons was compared to a pre-determined list of genes over-expressed in FACS-sorted primary. Transcription factor Pou3f1 was identified as a major determinant of phrenic identity.

DESIGN
Expression in induced cell lines were compared to YFP controls, and over-representation of phrenic genes was computed for the list of differentially expressed genes in each indiced cell lines.
