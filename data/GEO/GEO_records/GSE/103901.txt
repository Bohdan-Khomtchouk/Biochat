TITLE
ILC1 confer early host protection at initial sites of viral infection [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We show that tissue-resident ILC1 serve a non-redundant early role in host immunity through rapid production of interferon (IFN)-Î³ following mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection.

DESIGN
Comparative RNA-seq analysis of mature NK and ILC cells in adipose, liver, spleen, and peritoneal cavity.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
