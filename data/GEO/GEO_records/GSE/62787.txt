TITLE
Sex-biased expression of miRNAs by microarray in critically endangered Amur sturgeon

ORGANISM
Acipenser schrenckii

SUMMARY
In this study, we utilized the microfluidics chip technology on the gonads of Amur sturgeon to identifiy gender-specific miRNAs. The probes of all miRNAs about 663 published in fish and our novel miRNAs from sturgeon were chosed in the microarray experiment.

DESIGN
Above 4µg to 8µg total RNA from one female and one male separativley were performed the miRNA microarray assays.Each probe was repeated five times on the chip to ensure reproducibility of microarray.
