TITLE
Sex-biased expression of miRNAs by microarray in critically endangered Amur sturgeon

ORGANISM
Acipenser sturio

SUMMARY
In this study, we utilized the microfluidics chip technology on the gonads of Amur sturgeon to identifiy gender-specific miRNAs. The probes of all miRNAs about 663 published in fish and our novel miRNAs from sturgeon were chosed in the microarray experiment.
