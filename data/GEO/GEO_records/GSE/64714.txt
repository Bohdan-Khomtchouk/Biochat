TITLE
Expression data from RhoA-null and wildtype keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using mice with a keratinocyte-restricted deletion of the RhoA gene, we explored its role in the regulation of gene expression in vivo and in vitro

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from RhoA-null or wildtype keratinocytes, in two different conditions, freshly isolated (in vivo) or cultured (in vitro), using the RNeasy kit  (Qiagen, Germany). Hybridization to GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was carried out at the Copenhagen University Hospital Microarray Center using standard protocols. 2 biological replicates were analyzed for each in vivo genotype (2 samples from RhoA-null, 2 from wildtype), while 3 replicates for each in vitro genotype.
