TITLE
ECOG 5998, trial of immunosupressives for the treatment of Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eastern Clinical Oncology Group trial number 5998 determined the efficacy of the immunosupressives methotrexate (step 1) and cylophosphamide (step 2) in the treatment of Large Granular Lymphocyte leukemia.  Expression data from pre-treatment samples were evaluated for a priori ability to predict treatment response to Step 1 and for correlation with STAT3 mutation types predictive of response.  Method:  patient PBMCs from Ficoll, normal patient PBMCS enriched for CD3+/CD8+ or CD3+/CD8+/CD45RA+/CCR7- were extracted in Trizol.  Conclusion:  A gene expression profile was associated with response to treatment with evidence of particular STAT3 mutations driving this expression profile and response.

DESIGN
Total RNA from patient Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) negatively enriched CD3+/CD8+  or negatively enriched CD3+/CD8+/CCR7-/CD45RA+(CD45RO-)
