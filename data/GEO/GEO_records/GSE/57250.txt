TITLE
Transcriptional regulation of Tet1 during development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a recently discovered epigenetic modification that is lost in human cancers. Formation of 5hmC is catalysed by the Ten eleven translocation (TET) proteins that mediate the sequential oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5hmC, leading to eventual DNA demethylation. Several mechanisms can lead to loss of 5hmC in cancers, including mutations in IDH or TET2 genes. However, little is known about the role of TET proteins and 5hmC in adult cells. Here, we report that TET1 downmodulation is required to permit adult cells to proliferate. TET1 is rapidly downmodulated in proliferating primary cells and in regenerating liver. TET1 silencing accelerates cell cycle progression while its constitutive expression inhibits cell growth. TET1 is a negative regulator of cell proliferation and it is regulated during development in tissue specific manner. These findings enlarge our knowledge on how one epigenetic modification such as the DNA hydroxymethylation mediated by TET1 is a key player on the control of cell proliferation.
