TITLE
A novel phenotypic drug screen identifies potent inhibitors of mycobacterial virulence protein secretion

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) depends on protein secretion systems for intracellular survival and virulence. The major virulence determinant and ESX-1 dependent effector protein EsxA causes tissue damage and necrosis which promotes spread and dissemination of the bacterium. We developed a fibroblast survival assay (FSA) that exploits this phenotype by selecting for molecules that protect host cells from Mtb-induced lysis. Hit compounds identified in this high-throughput screen blocked the secretion of EsxA thus promoting phagosome maturation which led to substantially reduced bacterial burden in activated macrophages. Target identification studies performed on these drugs led to discovery of a benzothiophene containing histidine kinase inhibitor and a benzyloxybenzylidine hydrazine compound affecting mycobacterial metal ion homeostasis which enabled us to reveal zinc stress as a signal for EsxA secretion. Collectively, this novel drug screening approach can help to tackle the mounting problem of antibiotic-resistant mycobacteria by largely extending the target spectrum of small molecule libraries.
