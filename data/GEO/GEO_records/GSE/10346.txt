TITLE
PRRSV-infection of porcine alveolar macrophages

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to produce a deep, global analysis of gene expression changes that occured following infection of normal porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) with PRRSV.  The goal was to examine the gene expression changes to help determine the mechanisms that result in reduced function and immunosuppression observed in PRRSV-infected pigs. Keywords: time course of infection

DESIGN
The PAMs were infected in culture at an MOI of 10 with PRRSV strains VR-2332 and incubated at 37C until 6, 12, 16 or 24 hours post infection.  Total cellular RNA was collected from each at the appropriate time.  SAGE libraries were prepared from each infected time point as well as from noninfected PAMs.  The SAGE libraries were sequenced to at least 95,000 tags each.
