TITLE
PRRSV-infection of porcine alveolar macrophages

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to produce a deep, global analysis of gene expression changes that occured following infection of normal porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) with PRRSV.  The goal was to examine the gene expression changes to help determine the mechanisms that result in reduced function and immunosuppression observed in PRRSV-infected pigs. Keywords: time course of infection
