TITLE
Expression data from different chicken tissues at 7-week of age

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
A better understanding of the regulation of gene expression and lipid metabolism in the chicken will benefit producers, as well as scientists who use the chicken as a model organism for studies of developmental biology and human therapeutics. We constructed the gene expression profiles of major chicken tissues to screened genes prominently high expressed in chicken adipose tissue and liver using the Chicken Genome arrays by comparing their expression profiles with twenty other tissue types.

DESIGN
Our objectives have been to construct gene expression profiles of the major chicken tissues, identify genes prominently high expressed in chicken adipose tissue and liver than other tissues.
