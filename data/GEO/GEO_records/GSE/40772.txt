TITLE
Differences in miRNA Detection Levels are Technology and Sequence Dependent [Affymetrix array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We undertook an integrative technological approach to compare miRNA detection capability of three high-throughput commercial platforms.

DESIGN
We artificially introduced human precursor, 2â€™-O-methyl modified and mature spiked-in miRNAs in a controlled fashion into native human placenta total RNA.

PLATFORM
GPL14613 [miRNA-2] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-2 Array
