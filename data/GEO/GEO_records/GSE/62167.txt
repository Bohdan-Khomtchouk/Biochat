TITLE
Expression data from the T-DNA insertion line atpip1;2-1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Some aquaporins do not show a pronounced function as water diffusion facilitators but act as small molecule transport facilitators for substances such as urea, glycerol, boron or gases such as CO2 . Transcriptome analysis provided distinguishable, specific profiles for water stress or for conditions of increased or decreased CO2 concentrations We used Affymetrix microarray analysis to elucidate the function of the aquaporin AtPIP1;2 gene

DESIGN
A T-DNA insertion line  atpip1;2-1 was used for RNA extraction and further microarray analysis based on the Affymetrix platform. The transcriptome of the atpip1;2-1 line was compared to the wild type (N-60000).
