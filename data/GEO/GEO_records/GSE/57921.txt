TITLE
Gene expression signatures for breast cancer cells metastatic to bone marrow

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify and compare gene expression profile of each cell line, we have employed microarray expression profiling.  The expression of many genes was similar in MM231-D3H2LN-GFP-BM2 cells parental cells, MM231-D3H2LN-GFP cells; however, the expression of genes related to the cell cycle was decreased in the BM2 cells compared with the parental cells. We also confirmed that the global gene expression patterns of the CD44+ and CD44- MM231-D3H2LN-GFP-BM2 cells were similar, although some genes which encode proteins that breast cancer cell dormancy, such as SRC and ERBB2  were increased and decreased, respectively, in the CD44- population.

DESIGN
The gene expression of breast cancer cells metastatic to bone marrow and those with or without expression of cancer stem cell marker were measured.
