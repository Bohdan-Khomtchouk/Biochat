TITLE
Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs): effects of MPS1 inhibition on signaling pathways in GBM cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the biological effects of MPS1 inhibition (both by siRNA and Drug (NMSP715)) on signaling pathways in GBM cells (U251 & U87), we profiled the modulation of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins using RPPA

DESIGN
Relative protein levels for each sample were determined by interpolation of each dilution curves from the standard curve antibody slide. All the data points were normalized for protein loading and transformed to a linear value. Linear values were transformed to Log2 value and then median‚Äêcentered for hierarchical cluster analysis.
