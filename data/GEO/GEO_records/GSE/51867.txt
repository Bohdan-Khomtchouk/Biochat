TITLE
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) of HEK293 cells (HEK293-CT) and HEK293 cells stably over-expressing the BAHD1 gene (HEK-BAHD1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of methylome of HEK293-CT cells and HEK293 cells stably over-expressing the BAHD1 gene (HEK-BAHD1)

DESIGN
We used BS-seq to identify genomic regions differentially methylated upon overexpression of the chromatin repressor BAHD1 in HEK293 cells.
