TITLE
Platelet-secreted microRNA-223 promotes endothelial cell apoptosis induced by advanced glycation end products via targeting the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Platelets contain abundant miRNAs, however, the biogenesis pathway of miRNAs in anucleate platelets is unclear.

DESIGN
Platelet-rich plasma was diluted in washing buffer and the platelet suspension was centrifuged to isolated pure platelets.Finally, platelets were recovered in suspension buffer at the concentration of 4–5×10^8 platelets/ml. Aliquots of the platelet suspensions were activated in the presence of 2.5 mM CaCl2 with 0ng/ml or 1 ng/ml thrombopoietin (TPO)
