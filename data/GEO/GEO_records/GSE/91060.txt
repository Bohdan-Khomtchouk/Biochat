TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) profiles in leg muscle of Xinghua Chickens.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We have used RNA-seq to examine long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA from rRNA depleted in  chicken leg musle of three different development stages (11 embryo age, 16 embryo age, and 1 days post hatch). Our study reveals the prevalence of lncRNA in chicken, and has identified lncRNA differentially abundant in different stage of embryonic skeletal muscle, suggesting its important functions during poultry muscle development.

DESIGN
To assess lncRNA and mRNA expression during chicken skeletal muscle development, we sequenced and analyzed leg musle at 11 embryo age, 16 embryo age, and 1 days post hatch.
