TITLE
Cold-induced protein RBM3 regulates neocortical development via Yap1 in maternal hypothermia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of gene expression. The goals of this study are to compare the different transcripts between control or RBM3 knockdown in the neural stem cells when the maternal hypothermia was induced.

DESIGN
Methods: the in utero electroporation was employed to introduce the RBM3 knockdown plasimds or control plasmids into the E13 embryonic cortex. and then the GFP+ Neural stem cell isolated from E15 mice by using FACS. RNA used for global transcriptome analysis were extracted from these GFP+ neural stem cells and sequenced by Hiseq 2500. Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified when we compared Normalized Reads Count between groups with p < 0.05 and |Log2FoldChange| > 1.

PLATFORM
