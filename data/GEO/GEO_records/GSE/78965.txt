TITLE
Differential gene expression analysis of follistain treated skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq analysis was performed to define the associated changes in gene expression of skeletal muscle treated with follistatin

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle mRNA profiles from follistatin and control treated tibialis anterior muscles. Acute  (3 day treatment, 3 control  and 4 follistatin replicates) and chronic (7or 14 day treatment, 3 control and 4 follistatin replicates) timepoints were analysed.
