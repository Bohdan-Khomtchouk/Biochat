TITLE
The expression profiles of AML cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EVI1 is one of the famous poor prognostic markers for a chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To identify molecular targets on the surface of leukemia cells with EVI1high expression, we compared the gene expression profiles of several AML cell lines by DNA microarray

DESIGN
To search for novel molecular targets in refractory myeloid leukemia with high EVI1 expression, we initially analyzed the gene expression profiles of 12 human myeloid cell lines. Four cell lines with chromosome 3q26 abnormalities (UCSD/AML1, HNT-34, Kasumi-3 and MOLM-1) expressed EVI1High, and eight myeloid cell lines without chromosome 3q26 abnormalities (HEL, HL-60, K052, THP-1, FKH-1, K051, NH and OIH-1) expressed low levels of EVI1 (EVI1Low)
