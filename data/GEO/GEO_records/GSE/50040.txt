TITLE
Cross-talk between E. coli strains and a human colorectal adenocarcinoma-derived cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The deposit microarray data were generated in a study that comprehensively integrated gene expression profiles and metabolic responses of Caco-2 cells that incubated with either E. coli K-12 or O157:H7. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of colonic bacteria on the global gene expression regulation and metabolite levels of the host, and investigate the molecular mechanics of the E. coli/host interaction.

DESIGN
Caco-2 cells were incubated with one of two strains of E. coli strains (K-12 or O157:H7). Gene expression measurements were analyzed at three time points: 60, 90, and 120 minutes after co-culture, and compared with the controls in the monoculture.
