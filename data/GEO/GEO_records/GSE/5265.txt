TITLE
TGF-beta on breast cancer cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular mechanism of action of TGF-beta as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Comparison of gene expression between MCF10ACa1h breast tumor xenograft with or without an intact TGF-beta response. Keywords: genetic modification design

DESIGN
Nine tumors in each genotype group were arrayed twice and 1 additional tumor/group was arrayed once. For the replicate array for each tumor, reference and tumor RNA dyes were swapped compared with the initial array. Initial and replicate arrays were performed on different array print batches.
