TITLE
Expression data from baseline and post-endurance training in human PBMCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is an association between transcriptome and the exercise-related phenotype. Peripheral blood cells suffer alterations in the gene expression pattern in response to perturbations caused by exercise. The acute response to endurance activates stress and inflammation, as well as growth and tissue repair responses. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were obtained at baseline and after an endurance training protocol from healthy male untrained police recruits. Samples were used to identify differentially expressed transcripts in response to training and further infer about activated metabolic and signalling pathways. Additionally, baseline expression was associated with the oxygen uptake change and stratified individuals according to their percent change in oxygen uptake.

DESIGN
Fasting blood samples were withdrawn at baseline and after the exercise training protocol, 48 hours after the last exercise session. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and hybridized into Affymetrix microarrays.
