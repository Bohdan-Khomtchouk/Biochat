TITLE
BMM_BalbC_LPS_timecourse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM) total RNA from C3H/ARC mice extracted after stimulation by LPS at different time points. Each time point stimulated with 10ug/ml LPS from Salmonella minnesota for the time indicated. The RNA from each BMM stimulated time point was labeled with Cy3 and compared with a common reference (total RNA from C57BL6/J 17.5 embryo) labeled with Cy5. Keywords = LPS, macrophages, innate immunity Keywords: time-course
