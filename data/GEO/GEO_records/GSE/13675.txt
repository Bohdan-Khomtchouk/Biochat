TITLE
Conduritol B Epoxide treatment of MSCs and 293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to study the biological consequences of inhibiting acid beta-galactosidase with the use of conduritol b epoxide, which serves as a chemical model of Gaucher disease

DESIGN
