TITLE
The Wnt/Î²-catenin-signaling pathway is modulated by androgen ablation therapy for advanced clinical prostate cancer and contributes to androgen independent cell growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgen ablation therapy (AAT) is standard treatment for locally-advanced/metastatic prostate cancer (PCa).  Many patients develop castration-resistance (CRPCa) after ~2-3 years, with a poor prognosis.  The molecular mechanisms underlying CRPCa progression are unclear.  mRNA-Seq was performed on tumours from 7 patients with locally-advanced/metastatic PCa before and ~22 weeks after AAT initiation.  Differentially regulated genes were identified in treatment pairs.

DESIGN
Tumour biopsies from 7 patients were taken before and after AAT treatment
