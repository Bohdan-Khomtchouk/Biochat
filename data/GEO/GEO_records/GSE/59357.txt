TITLE
Gene expression profiles of dasatinib-resistant and dasatinib-sensitive pancreatic cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene profiles from three dasatinib-resistant and three dasatinib-sensitive pancreatic cancer cell lines were compared by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
RNA from three dasatinib-resistant (MiaPaCa2, Panc1, SU8686) and three dasatinib-sensitive (Panc0504, Panc0403, Panc1005) pancreatic cancer cell lines were extracted. Biological triplicates were employed for each cell line. Complementary DNA microarray analysis was performed using Illumina Human HT-12 v4 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at the National University of Singapore Core Facility following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
