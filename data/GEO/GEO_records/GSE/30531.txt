TITLE
Expression data of A375 melanoma cells after DMSO or MLN4924 treatment from 1 hour to 24 hour

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to determine the change in gene expression of genes involved in the CDT1/NAE pathway

DESIGN
A375 cells were grown and then incubated in the presence of either DMSO as control or 650nM MLN4924. Cells were treated for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours. RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix HG-U133Plus 2.0 arrays were performed.
