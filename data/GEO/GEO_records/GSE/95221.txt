TITLE
Î³H2AX-ChIP-Seq in cells depleted for the telomeric protein TRF2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We show the enrichment of yH2AX in HeLa cells when the telomeric protein TRF2 is downregulated (siTRF2 minus siControl). We generated genome-wide maps of the enriched profile of reads and found an accumulation of yH2AX reads at the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes and at large regions of chromosomes 3, 8, 11 and 16.

DESIGN
Identification of yH2AX-rich regions after TRF2 inhibition
