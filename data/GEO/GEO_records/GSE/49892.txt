TITLE
Global Expression of Molecular Transporters in the Human Vaginal Tract

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis using antiretroviral agents is a promising strategy for the prevention of sexual HIV transmission in women. Molecular transporters in the human vaginal tract may play a pivotal role in determining drug disposition and, consequently, pharmacodynamic outcomes in these efforts. Little is known, however, on the expression of these transporters in vaginal tissues, representing a critical knowledge gap. Our study analyzed the genome-wide transcriptome in 44 vaginal tissue samples from 6 reproductive-age women undergoing gynecologic surgeries.

DESIGN
The genome-wide transcriptome in 44 vaginal tissue samples from 6 reproductive-age women (20-56 years old) undergoing gynecologic surgeries was measured.
