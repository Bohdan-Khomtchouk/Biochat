TITLE
Genome-wide ATAF1 binding sites in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Using a transgenic line expressing HA-tagged ATAF1 uncovered > 400 ChIP-seq peaks in ATAF1-HA plants compared to Col-0 wild-type plants. Only a small sub-set of the candidate peaks could be verified using ChIP-qpcr or EMSA. Among the verified peaks we uncovered the key ABA biosynthetic gene NCED3 as a target of ATAF1

DESIGN
ChIP was performed using anti-HA antibodies on wild-type Col-0 plants and plants expressing HA-tagged ATAF1

PLATFORM
GPL9302 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Arabidopsis thaliana)
