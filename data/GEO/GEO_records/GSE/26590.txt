TITLE
Counteractive balancing of transcriptome expression involving CodY and CovRS in Streptococcus pyogenes

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes NZ131

SUMMARY
Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS) responds to environmental changes in a manner that results in an adaptive regulation of the transcriptome. Global transcriptional regulators are able to integrate important extracellular and intracellular information and are responsible for modulation of the transcriptional network. The roles of several global transcriptional regulators in adaptation and virulence gene expression have been described. In this study we used microarray to investigate the regulatory roles of CodY and CovRS played in Streptococcus pyogenes. keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Streptococcus pyogenes NZ131 wild-type cells, ΔcodY, ΔcovRS and ΔcodYcovRS strains were grown in C-medium until mid-exponential phase or early-stationary phase. The transcriptional profile of the whole genome was examined with microarray.
