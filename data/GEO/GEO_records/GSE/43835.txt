TITLE
Enhancer Transcripts Mark Active Estrogen Receptor Binding Sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we used Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq), a method that assays the genome-wide location and orientation of all active RNA polymerases. We generated a global profile of active transcription at ERα binding sites in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in response to short time course of E2 treatment. This method enabled us to detect active transcription at enhancers and define a class of primary transcripts transcribed uni- or bidirectionally from the ERα binding sites. The raw data used in this study is from GSE27463 but sequenced to a greater depth.

DESIGN
Using GRO-seq over a time course (0, 10, 40 min) of estrogen signaling in ER-alpha positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.
