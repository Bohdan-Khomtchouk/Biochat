TITLE
Differential expression in testis in 4 house mouse species

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA from testis from 4 mus musculus species was hybridized on affymetrix gene chip U74Av2. Subspecies-specific differences in expression level were then extracted by conditioning on outcomes to cases where the expression in one subspecies differed significantly from all others but these did not differ significantly among each other. Keywords: other
