TITLE
The induced APL cells generated by the transplantation of PML-RARA-transduced human CD34+ hematopoietic cells into immunodeficient mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A humanized in vivo APL model has been established utilizing the retroviral transduction of PML-RARA into human CD34+ hematopoietic cells and the transplantation of these cells into immunodeficient mice. The resultant leukemia recapitulated human APL phenotypically, and was clustered in the same category as human APL samples in the gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
CD34+ cells from human cord blood were retrovirally transduced with PML-RARA. They were then intravenously injected into a tail vein of nine- to 20-week-old NOD/Shi-SCID/IL-2RÎ³null (NOG) mice which were irradiated with 220 cGy of X-rays. Three to four months later, the CD45+/ CD33+/ EGFP+ cells were sorted from the bone marrow for a microarray analysis. Two human APL/M3 AML samples were utilized for a comparison with these cells.
