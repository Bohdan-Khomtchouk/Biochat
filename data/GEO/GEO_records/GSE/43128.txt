TITLE
Eye imaginal disc expressing transgenic human proinsulin in Drosophila eye under regulation of GMR-GAL4

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in response to expression of either mutant (C96Y) or wild-type human proinsulin and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes. Results provides insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying a form of neonatal diabetes.

DESIGN
Drosophila eye imaginal discs were selected at the wandering stage of 3rd instar larval development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
