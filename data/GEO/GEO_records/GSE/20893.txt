TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling of the porcine developing brain

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression profiling with use of microRNA microarrays was performed on porcine developing brain. Two tissues, cortex and cerebellum were sampled at each of three different developmental stages: gestation day 50 (F50), gestation day 100 (F100) and three months old (named adult), respectively. The aim was to find developmental stage as well as the tissue specific microRNA candidates and validate them with qPCR.

DESIGN
Samples containing both small RNA and total RNA were subjected, respectively. One replicate per array was made from each developmental stage/tissue, for each isolation method. Fetus gestation day 50 cortex total RNA was run in four replicates. Fetus gestation day 50 cortex small RNA was run in two replicates.
