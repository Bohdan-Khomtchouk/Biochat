TITLE
Analysis of gene expression profiles of the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein knockdown BHK21 (Cirp−/−BHK21) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study,  We analyzed the gene expression of Cirp−/−BHK21 cells at different timepoint using Mus musculus genome-wide expression microarrays to explore the molecular mechanism of Cirp action.

DESIGN
Total of 18 samples were detected  between Cirp−/−  and control BHK21 cells at 24h,48h and 72h three timepoint using  Mus musculus genome-wide expression microarrays, three repeats of Cirp−/− and control were detected at each timepoint.

PLATFORM
GPL15887 NimbleGen Mouse gene expression array [100718_MM9_EXP] (gene-level version)
