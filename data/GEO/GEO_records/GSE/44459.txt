TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of prometastatic and metastasis-resistant lungs from mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We describe the gene expression profile of metastasis-prone lungs of mice after injection of LN4-tumor cell conditioned media intraperitoneally for one week, compared to the metastasis-inhibitory PC3 tumor cell conditioned media, which is the parental cell line to LN4

DESIGN
2 mice injected with RPMI medium (control), 2 mice injected with PC3-derived conditioned medium, and 2 mice injected with PC3M-LN4 conditioned medium

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
