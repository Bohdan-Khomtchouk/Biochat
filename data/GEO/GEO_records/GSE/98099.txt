TITLE
Gene expression profile of the RAG2 gene depletion on thymus of mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It contains a disruption of the recombination activating gene 2 (RAG2) and homozygoue mice exhibit total inability to initiate V(D)J rearrangement and fail to generate mature T or B lymphocytes. ( https://www.taconic.com )

DESIGN
For comparison anaysis between species (RAG2 KO mouse and pig), We purchase RAG2 KO mouse from Taconic farms Inc. The comparison study of SCID mice and pigs as best hosts for xenogeneic tissue or cell grafts is poorly understood. Here, we sought to clarify different biological properties between mouse and pig by examining their function in lymphoid organs. Please note that the superseries GSE97505 records represent the pig data
