TITLE
Interleukin-16-knock-out bone-marrow derived macrophages response to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify differently expressed genes following stimulation of interleukin-16-knock-out bone-marrow derived macrophages with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Macrophages were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 6 hours and a signature was identified that distinguished between infected and control samples. Expression of several genes from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming the predicted macrophage response pattern.

DESIGN
Gene expression in macrophages was measured at 6 hours after stimulation  Three independent experiments were performed.
