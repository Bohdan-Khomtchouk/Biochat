TITLE
Diel gene expression analysis of Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 in light and dark cycle

ORGANISM
Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 during a 24-hr light and dark cycle. The diel gene expression analyzed in this study is further described in Mu√±oz-Marin, M., I. N. Shilova, T. Shi, H. Farnelid & J. P. Zehr. 2017. Unicellular cyanobacterial symbiosis facilitates aerobic nitrogen fixation. Science (to be submitted).

DESIGN
A twenty eight chip study using total RNA extracted from cultures of Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 that were harvested at designated time points during a 24-hr diel sampling. Each chip measures the expression level of 4,788 genes from Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 with up to six 60-mer probes per gene, with two-fold technical redundancy.

PLATFORM
GPL23571 NimbleGen T. erythraeum IMS101 expression plus tiling of intergenic regions 4x72K array [080610_Trich_erth_UCSC_TS_expr]
