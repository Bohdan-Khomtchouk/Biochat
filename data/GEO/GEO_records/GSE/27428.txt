TITLE
Transcriptional profile of ΔcalA and ΔcrzA Aspergillus fumigatus mutants during  mammal infection

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
Aspergillus fumigatus mutant strains were collected from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) during acute mouse infection (4 and 12 hours).

DESIGN
Transcriptional analysis were conducted by comparison of each mutant with the wild type strain (CEA17) in a dye swap experiment. Besides, we performed the transcriptional profile of akuB(KU80) mutant compared to CEA17 wild type strain. All the strains were recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from CD1 mice infected with 10e8 spores for 4 and 12 hours.
