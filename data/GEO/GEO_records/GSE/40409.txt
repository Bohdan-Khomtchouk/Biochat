TITLE
Transcriptome wide target profiling for miR-3118-3p and miR-4307-3p.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome Identification of  direct targets of miR-3118-3p and miR-4307-3p using biotinylated pull-downs found that both miRNAs have roles relevant to pancreatic cancer.

DESIGN
HEK293T cells were transfected with biotinylated miRNAs (either miR-3118-3p or miR-4307-3p). The miRNAs and target mRNA were pulled down with streptavidin and compared to the input control.
