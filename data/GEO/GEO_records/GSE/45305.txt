TITLE
Bacillus subtilis W168, WT vs. uppS-RBS (A to C)

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of the uppS-RBS (A to C) mutant during log growth phase in LB medium.

DESIGN
Bacillus subtilis W168, WT vs. uppS-RBS (A to C). The experiment was conducted two times using three independent total RNA preparations (biological triplicates). Each comparison was performed in dye-swap with the same RNA preparation. For each paried comparison, one sample was labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 and the other was with Alexa Fluor 647.
