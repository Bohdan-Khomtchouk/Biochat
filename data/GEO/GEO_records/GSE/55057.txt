TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of brown adipose tissue gene expression of IL15-depleted mice under normal diet or diet enriched with the beta3-adrenergic agonist CL 316243

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chronic inflammation is one of the major players in the obesity related metabolic syndrome. However the various inflammatory mediators appear to promote insulin resistance directly or indirectly through their ability to induce the inflammatory cascade. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is involved in the pathogenesis of different autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and type 1 diabetes. We postulated that as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-15 promotes obesity during fat excess by promoting insulin resistance from tissues involved in energy metabolism. We used microarrays to characterize the gene expression profile of the brown adipose tissue of IL-15 mice under normal diet or diet enriched with  the beta3-adrenergic agonist CL 316243

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from adipose tissue of wt- or IL15-KO mice under normal diet or diet enriched with the beta3-adrenergic agonist CL 316243

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
