TITLE
Expression data from HepG2 cell treated with Herb CRATOXYLUM COCHINCHINENSE LOUR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray data of  HepG2 were derived at various timepoints. Fold-change of the regulated genes were compared among various timepoints.

DESIGN
Treated HepG2 and untreated HepG2 were harvested. Fold change of genes among timepoints were derived.

PLATFORM
GPL16686 [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
