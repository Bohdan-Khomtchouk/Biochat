TITLE
Comparative gene expression analysis of Nrf2 activators, CDDO-Im, CDDO-Me and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in VC1 lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nrf2 is an important therapeutic target as activation of this pathway detoxifies harmful insults and reduces oxidative stress. However, the role of Nrf2 in cancer biology is controversial.  Protection against oxidative stress and inflammation can confer a survival advantage to tumor cells, leading to a poor prognosis, and constitutive activation of Nrf2 has been detected in numerous tumors. In our study, we examined the role of two clinically relevant classes of Nrf2 activators, the synthetic triterpenoids (CDDO-Im and CDDO-Me) and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in lung cancer. Using microarrays, we attempt to examine whether these Nrf2 activators have an effect on the same subset of Nrf2 genes.

DESIGN
VC1 lung cancer cells were treated with either DMSO, 0.05 uM of CDDO-Im, 0.1 uM of CDDO-Im or 15 uM of DMF for 6 hours before RNA was extracted by Qiagen RNeasy kit and analyzed using Illumina Micorarrays.
