Expression data from B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is a heterogeneous disease that can be subdivided according to primary recurrent genetic abnormalities that are strongly associated with characteristic biological and clinical features.  The detection of these abnormalities can facilitate diagnosis, risk stratification, and targeted therapy. We identified an unexpectedly high incidence of fusion genes involving ZNF384 genes, including TCF3-ZNF384, EP300-ZNF384, and CREBBP-ZNF384, in BCP-ALL of our cohort.  We therefore used microarrays to evaluate the gene-expression characteristics of BCP-ALL harboring ZNF384-related fusion genes and compared with those of BCP-ALL with other types of conventional genetic abnormality.

DESIGN
BCP-ALL samples with various genetic abnormalities were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  In addition to BCP-ALL harboring ZNF384-related fusion genes, including TCF3-ZNF384 (10 cases), EP300-ZNF384 (5 cases), and CREBBP-ZNF384 (2 cases), BCP-ALL with conventional genetic abnormalities, such as BCR-ABL1 (19 cases), ETV6-RUNX1 (70 cases), high hyperdiploid (90 cases), MLL-AF4 (13 cases), and TCF3-PBX1 (19 cases), were included.  As a control, non-leukemic B-cell precursor samples (3 cases) were also selected.
