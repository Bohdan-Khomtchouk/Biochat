TITLE
Human body index - transcriptional profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal and diseased human tissues were profiled for gene expression using the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 array In total 677 samples were processed , representing over 90 distinct tissue types Some tissue samples were purchased from Stratagene (SG), Ambion (AB), and Becton-Dickinson (BD) Keywords: Human body index of gene expression

DESIGN
Affymetrix human U133 plus 2.0 array was used to transcriptionally profile both normal and diseased human tissues representing over 90 distinct tissue types.
