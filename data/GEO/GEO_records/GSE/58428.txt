TITLE
Genome wide mapping of AR and its associated factors in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and AR downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation.We performed ChIP-seq analysis to investigate the role of AR and its associated factors such as coregulators or collaborating factors.In addition, by siRNA mediated knockdown of such factors, changes of AR-binding sites in prostate cancer cells were analyzed.
