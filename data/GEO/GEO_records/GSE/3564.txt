TITLE
Genomic comparison of Salmonella enterica serovars and Salmonella bongori

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
This experiment set includes 64 arrays representing 26 serovars and strains of Salmonella spp. including many representatives of subspecies I, Arizona from subsp. IIIa, and S. bongori from subsp. V.  The genomic DNA from all strains were labeled with Cy5 and hybridized against an equal amount (1.5 ug) of S. typhimurium SL1344 reference genomic DNA that was labeled with Cy3, all on an S. typhimurium SL1344 spotted DNA microarray.  Most of the arrays are present in triplicate to account for variability in probe generation, hybridization, and slide quality.  Several are represented in duplicate, and a few without any replicates. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
