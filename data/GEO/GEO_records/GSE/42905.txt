TITLE
Legionella pneumophila transcriptomic response of hfq mutant during post-exponential phase

ORGANISM
Legionella pneumophila

SUMMARY
Legionella pneumophila wild-type and hfq mutant were grown to post-exponential. The wild-type strain is used as the control.

DESIGN
Two strains: wild-type (control) and hfq mutant (test). Three biological replicates.  Ch1 is gDNA, use as a reference channel (Talaat, 2002, NAR)
