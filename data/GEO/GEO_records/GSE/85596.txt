TITLE
Plasma and B cells from mice treated with GSK-LSD1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We treated mice daily with the GSK-LSD1 or vehicle for 21 days. B and plasma cells were isolated by FACS and RNA-seq performed. Pathway analysis showed that MYC targets, Unfolded protein  response, TNFalpha signaling, STAT3, STAT5 and other signaling pathways were significantly altered.

DESIGN
Examination of mouse B and plasma cells treated with GSK-LSD1 or control.

PLATFORM
