TITLE
Patterns of gene Expression during the Spinal cord Injury/Regeneration

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces a sequence of endogenous autodestructive changes known as secondary injury, as well as reactive biochemical changes that are neuroprotective and/or promote recovery. All these responses to SCI are, in part reï¬‚ected in changes in gene expression. In order to assess changes in gene expression involved in the regeneration process,microarrays were performed as a function of time after SCI for the various treatments.

DESIGN
Three groups rats(i.e.NT-3-chitosan tube group, tube alone group and lesion control group) used to interrogate Affymetrix (SantaClara,CA) GeneChips were sacrificed by intraperitoneally over dose injecting 6% chloral hydrate at 1, 3, 10, 20, 30, and 90 d after the operation. The spinal cords were surgically re-exposed and spinal tissue including dura and meninges was dissected into three blocks, i.e. 5 mm long segments in the lesioned area (M), rostral to the lesioned area (R), and caudal to the lesioned areas (C) were sampled under RNAase-free conditions. The samples were quick frozen and kept in liquid nitrogen.
