TITLE
Patterns of gene Expression during the Spinal cord Injury/Regeneration

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces a sequence of endogenous autodestructive changes known as secondary injury, as well as reactive biochemical changes that are neuroprotective and/or promote recovery. All these responses to SCI are, in part reï¬‚ected in changes in gene expression. In order to assess changes in gene expression involved in the regeneration process,microarrays were performed as a function of time after SCI for the various treatments.
