TITLE
Transcriptional regulation by infliximab therapy in kawasaki disease patients with immunoglobulin resistance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infliximab (IFX) has been reported as the further therapy in intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG)-resistant Kawasaki disease (KD) patients. IFX is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, but how IFX affect KD vasculitis is unknown. We investigated expression profiling of whole blood cells to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the effectiveness of IFX therapy and to find characteristic biomarker and an important target in refractory KD. Methods: Refractory KD patients who failed to respond to repeated intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) infusions had received a single infusion of IFX as third therapy. To validate specifically transcripts abundance for IFX therapy, we detected the altered transcripts expression and signaling pathways of whole blood mRNA in these IFX-responsive patients (n=8) using Affymetrix array, comparing initial IVIG-responsive patients (n=6).Results: A total of 1,388 transcripts abundance were significantly altered before and after IFX treatment. These transcripts abundance in IFX had Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain pathway that play a role in activation of NFκB and IL-1 signaling pathway outside the field of TNF-α signaling pathway. Fifty transcripts including Peptidase inhibitor-3 (PI3), Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP8), Chemokine (C-C motif) receptor-2 (CCR2) and Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) were significantly down-regulated in IFX. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the inhibition of TNF-α by IFX have affected various molecular mechanism materially for IVIG-resistant KD patients.

DESIGN
28 samples of pre- and post-treatment in IFX-responsive patients (n=8) and IVIG-responsive patients (n=6).
