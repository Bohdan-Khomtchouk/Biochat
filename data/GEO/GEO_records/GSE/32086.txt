TITLE
Identification of candidate genes affecting juvenile wood density in Pinus radiata

ORGANISM
Pinus radiata

SUMMARY
Wood density is a foundamental quality trait for structural timber, bioenergy and pulp industries. We investigated genes differentially transcribed in radiate pine juvneile trees with distinct wood density using cDNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Radiata pine trees were selected from a progeny trial planted at Flynn, Australia. Based on the gravitical measurement of wood cores, 12 families with highest and lowest density each were selected, representing two groups of trees with contrasting wood density. One individual with higher or lower density were further sampled in each selected family. Developing xylem tissues of selected trees were sampled in autumn (April) when latewood (LW) was formed. The xylem tissues were scraped at breast height with a sharp chisel after the bark was removed. Wood cores of the sampled trees were further measured using SilviScan 2. Total RNA extracted from ten developing xylem tissues with confirmed distinct density in each tree group were pooled into two bulks (five trees each), and the two bulks of HD were compared with two LD bulks in the microarray experiment (named the bulk experiment). Six developing xylem tissues with the most distinct density from each tree group were further chosen. Six xylem tissues with HD were individually compared with bulked six xylem tissues with LD in the second microarray experiment (named individual experiment). These two different pooling strategies can partly minimize the genetic variation among different genotypes. Dye swaps were applied in each biological replicate.
