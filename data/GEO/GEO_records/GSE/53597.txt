TITLE
Golden snub-nosed monkey transcriptome data used for gene annotation

ORGANISM
Rhinopithecus roxellana

SUMMARY
To optimize the golden snub-nosed monkey genome annotation, one RNA library of mixed tissues from one individual were constructed using the Illumina mRNA-Seq Prep Kit.

DESIGN
We sequenced mixed tissues using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.
