TITLE
Effects of PAMAM dendrimers in the mouse brain after a single intranasal instillation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The in vivo effects of nasal exposure to polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers on their effects on gene expression in the mouse brain. A single dose of PAMAM dendrimers or saline (control) was intranasally administered to 8-week old male BALB/c mice.

DESIGN
PAMAM-induced gene expression in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex was measured at 24 hours after exposure to doses of 0, 0.15 mg/kg b.w.  Pooled RNA from six independent experiments were analyzed at each time.
