TITLE
Plant genes affected by Solanum tuberosum and Colorado potato beetle interaction

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Potato leaves From Solanum tuberosum var. Kennebec will be wounded and oral secretions from 4th instar CPB will be isolated and added to the plants as described by Kruzmane et al (2002, Physiol. Plantarum 115:577-584).  The leaf from the 6th node of the potato plant will be wounded or wounded and treated with oral secretions from CPB. Unwounded leaves from node 1-5 of the wounded  and wounded plus oral secretions plants will be harvested as systemic material. The leaves will be harvested after 4 hrs and RNA will be isolated. 4 hrs was chosen because this represents a time when early and late induced genes should both be present. In addition, the leaf from the 6th node will be subjected to feeding by CPB that have been raised on potato leaves and starved for 16 hrs immediately prior to infestation. Insects will be allowed to feed for 1 hr and the leaves will be harvested after 3 additional hrs. An additional set of plants will be used to infest the leaf on the 6th node for 4 hrs. Leaves from the 6th node will be collected from uninfested plants after 4 hrs as a control. Three sets of 6-12 plants will be used for each sample. Keywords: Direct comparison
