TITLE
Analysis of molecular signatures in mammalian hibernation

ORGANISM
Urocitellus parryii

SUMMARY
Mammalian hibernators display phenotypes similar to physiological conditions in non-hibernating species under conditions of calorie restriction and fasting, hypoxia, hypothermia, ischemia-reperfusion, and sleep. However, whether or how similarities are also reflected on molecular and genetic levels is unclear. We identified molecular signatures of torpor and arousal in hibernation using a new custom-designed cDNA microarray for the arctic ground squirrel (Urocitellus parryii,) and compared them to molecular signatures of selected phenotypes in mouse. Our results show that differential gene expression related to metabolism during torpor is closely related to that during calorie restriction and hypoxia. PPARÎ± is crucial for metabolic remodeling in hibernation. Genes related to the sleep-wake cycle and temperature response genes induced by hypothermia follow the same expression changes as in torpor-arousal cycle. Increased fatty acid metabolism might contribute to the protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury during hibernation. Further, by comparing with thousands of pharmacological signatures, we identified drugs that may induce similar expression patterns in human cell lines as during hibernation.

DESIGN
Arctic ground squirrels sampled during winter hibernation were compared with the animals sampled during summer. Liver was hybridized on a custom 9,600 probes nylon membrane microarray platform.  Four squirrels in early torpor, five in late torpor, four in early arousal, four in late arousal, and seven in summer active were studied in experiments.
