TITLE
Effect of heme on macrophage gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Heme generates an atheroprotective macrophage phenotype in humans, in coronary atherosclerotic intraplaque hemorrhage. We carried out microarray analysis to define this phenotype and assess its likely mechanism.

DESIGN
Paired samples, at 2 time points, on monocytes from n=4 human donors

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
