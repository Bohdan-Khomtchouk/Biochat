TITLE
TJ411(fer-15(b26)II; age-1(hx542)II) vs. BA713(fer-15(b26)II)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To identify changes in gene expression in age-1 mutants, we compared expression in fer-15(b26) animals to expression in fer-15(b26); age-1(hx542) mutants.  We prepared RNA from young adult fer-15(b26) mutants grown at 25?C (five samples prepared at Stanford University and six samples prepared at the University of Colorado) and young adult fer-15(b26); age-1(hx542) mutants (four samples at Stanford University and six samples at the University of Colorado). Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Place of growth: Stanford vs Colorado Genotype: mutant strains vs wt (N2) mixed stage; some expts are reverse dye
