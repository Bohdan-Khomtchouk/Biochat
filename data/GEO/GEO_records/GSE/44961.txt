TITLE
Depletion of Jak2V617F MPN-propagating stem cells by interferon-alpha in a murine model of polycythemia vera

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Interferon alpha (IFNa) is an effective treatment for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). In addition to inducing hematological responses in most MPN patients, IFNa reduces the JAK2V617F allelic burden and can render the JAK2V617F mutant clone undetectable in some patients. The precise mechanism underlying these responses is incompletely understood and whether the molecular responses that are seen occur due to the effects of IFNa on JAK2V617F mutant stem cells is debated. Using a murine model of Jak2V617F MPN, we investigated the effects of IFNa on Jak2V617F MPN-propagating stem cells in vivo. We report that IFNa treatment induces hematological responses in the model and causes depletion of Jak2V617F MPN-propagating cells over time, impairing disease transplantation. We demonstrate that IFNa treatment induces cell-cycle activation of Jak2V617F mutant long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC) and promotes a predetermined erythroid-lineage differentiation program. These findings provide insights into the differential effects of IFNa on Jak2V617F mutant and normal hematopoiesis and suggest that IFNa achieves molecular remissions in MPN patients through its effects on MPN stem cells. Furthermore, these results support combinatorial therapeutic approaches in MPN, by concurrently depleting dormant JAK2V617F MPN-propagating stem cells with IFNa and targeting the proliferating downstream progeny with JAK2-inhibitors or cytotoxic chemotherapy.
