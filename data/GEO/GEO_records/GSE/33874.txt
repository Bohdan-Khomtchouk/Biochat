TITLE
Identification of a Potential Ovarian Cancer Stem Cell Gene Expression Profile from Advanced Stage Papillary Serous Ovarian Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the potential ovarian cancer stem cell gene expression profile from isolated side population of fresh ascites obtained from women with high-grade advanced stage papillary serous ovarian adenocarcinoma Microarrays were used to interrogate the differentially expressed genes between side population (SP) and main population (MP)  isolated from fresh ascites obtained from women with high-grade advanced stage papillary serous ovarian adenocarcinoma, and the results were analyzed by paired T-test using BRB-ArrayTools

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was completed for 10 SP and MP pairs using the Affymetrix human U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays
