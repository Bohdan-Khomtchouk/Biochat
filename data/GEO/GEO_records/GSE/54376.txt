TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Lsd1 binding sites in escort cells/early follicle cells and cap cells/terminal filament cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Loss of Lsd1 in Drosophila in specific cells of the Drosophila ovary results in increased BMP signaling outside the cap cell niche and an expanded germline stem cell (GSC) phenotype. To better characterize the function of Lsd1 in different cell populations within the ovary, we performed Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). This analysis shows that Lsd1 associates with a surprisingly limited number of sites in escort cells and fewer, and often, different sites in cap cells. These findings indicate that Lsd1 displays highly selective binding in specific cellular contexts.
