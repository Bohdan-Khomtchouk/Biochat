TITLE
GE/miRNA expression profile of Human Epicardial Adipose Tissue (EAT) and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT) in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) vs. Controls (CTRL) - PART 2 - miRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiles of Human EAT vs. SAT (CTRL & CAD). The aim of the present study was to assess a miRNA expression chart characterizing EAT vs. SAT, and CAD vs. CTRL. Results provide the information that EAT is characterized by a differential expression of different miRNA when compared to its reference tissue (SAT), and that EAT is characterized by specific miRNA expression changes in patients with CAD.

DESIGN
RNA obtained from EAT & SAT of the same patients (paired samples). Comparisons: EAT vs. SAT (paired samples) & CAD vs. CTRL
