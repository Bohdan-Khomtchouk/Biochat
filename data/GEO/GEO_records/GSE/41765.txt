TITLE
Analysis of RP58 genome-wide binding in mouse embryonic cerebral cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RP58 is a candidate gene for human microcephaly. Its loss in mouse leads to brain growth defects. RP58 is a critical regulator of neuronal differentiation.

DESIGN
RP58 ChIP-seq: 3 samples examined: E14.5 Rp58+/+, E14.5 Rp58+/-, E14.5 Rp58-/- mouse cortices

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
