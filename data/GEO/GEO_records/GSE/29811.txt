TITLE
Expression data from H2-producing Rhodobacter sphaeroides cultures fed different organic substrates

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1

SUMMARY
Rhodobacter sphaeroides produces hydrogen gas (H2) via its nitrogenase enzyme during photoheterotrophic growth under nitrogen-limited conditions.  We find that cells produce different amounts of H2 and show different growth rates, depending on the organic substrate provided (lactate, succinate, glucose, xylose, or glycerol). We used global transcript analyses to determine what genes are involved in the onset of H2 production, and those that lead to different H2 production capacities in cells fed different organic substrates.
