TITLE
Gene array analysis of human adult lung antigen presenting cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Antigen presenting cells (APC) are a heterogenous population, comprised of macrophages/monocytes (CD14+ cells), classical dendritic cells (CD141+DC and CD1c+ DC) and pDC. Upon stimulation, APC migrate from peripheral organs to lymph nodes, where they drive T cell specific lineage fate, that is towards immune activation or suppression.   APC in human tissues remain poorly defined. Through our previous published data we have charactised APC within adult skin and blood. Here we extend these findings, by performing microarray analysis of adult lung CD14+ DC, CD141+ DC and CD1c+ DC.  Once, we were confident we could clearly distinguish the populations of interest (CD14+ cell, CD141+ DC and CD1c+ DC)  from other cells, we sorted FACS purified the cells and prepared them for gene array analysis.

DESIGN
APC were isolated by FACS from adult lung that was collagenase digeseted for 1hr.  Gene expression analysis using total RNA from specific human APC subsets purified by FACS was performed.
