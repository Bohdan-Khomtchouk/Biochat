TITLE
Expression of the RNA recognition motif protein RBP10 promotes a bloodstream-form transcript pattern in Trypanosoma brucei

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma brucei

SUMMARY
In this study we investigate the function of RBP10, and present evidence that the presence of RBP10 is sufficient to induce the expression of mRNAs involved in bloodstream-form energy metabolism.

DESIGN
for BS RBP10 RNAi Samples: total of 6 slides, including 3 biological replicates and dyeswap for RBP10 overexpression Samples: total of 5 slides, including 3 biological replicates and dyeswap

PLATFORM
GPL5905 JCVI PFGRC Trypanosoma brucei 19K v3 array designed primarily based on strain TREU927
