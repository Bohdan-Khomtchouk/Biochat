TITLE
Ribosome hibernation factor promotes Staphyloccocal survival and differentially represses translation

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
We sequenced a total of 16 cDNA libararies derived from fragmented total mRNA and ribosome protected mRNAs from S. aureus hpf mutant (NE838) and its parental strain JE2 grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB) or minimal medium (MM). The data represented 2 independent biological replicates.

DESIGN
Examination of the impact of hpf on global S.aureus translatome, mRNA abundance and the ribosome density along the transcripts.
