TITLE
Expression data from human primary skeletal muscle myotubes treated with aldosterone, spironolactone, eplerenone, mifepristone, prednisolone or vehicle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To define the direct gene expression changes in normal human skeletal muscle with mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor agonist and antagonist treatment.

DESIGN
18 total samples were analyzed.  3 biological replicates for each of the following treatment groups were included: 1) aldosterone; 2) spironolactone; 3) vehicle (DMSO); 4) eplerenone; 5) mifepristone; 6) prednisolone.  Pairwise comparison between groups were carried out and a fold-change â‰¥2 were selected.
