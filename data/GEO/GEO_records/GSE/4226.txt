TITLE
Alzheimer Disease peripheral blood mononuclear cell expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparisons between the sample groups (normal elderly control (NEC) and Alzheimer disease (AD)) allow the identification of genes with disease and gender expression patterns. Keywords: biological repeat

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from normal elderly control (NEC) and Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects.  Targets from biological replicates of female (n=7) and male (n=7) NEC and  female (n=7) and male (n=7) AD were generated and the expression profiles were determined using the NIA Human MGC cDNA microarray.
