TITLE
Fam60a defines a embryonic stem cell specific Sin3a/Hdac complex.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP coupled with NGS identifies genome-wide binding sites of a  ES cells specific Sin3a/Hdac complex. The aim of these experiments is to study the role of Fam60a in the Sin3a/Hdac complex. ChIP-Seq experiments reveal that Fam60a is required to maintain high levels of Sin3a binding on target genes in mESCs. Depletion of Fam60a causes a drop of Sin3a binding to target sites. Underlining the function of Fam60a in mES cells, ChIP-seq analysis of Sin3a and Fam60a in mouse fibroblasts reveal strikingly low global binding level of Sin3a to its target genes while Fam60a is absent at these sites.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq of Sin3a and Fam60a in E14 mESCs and NIH3T3. ChIP-Seq of Sin3a following shRNA-mediated knockdown of Fam60a in mESCs.
