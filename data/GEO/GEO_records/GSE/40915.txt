TITLE
Deep sequencing of the small RNA transcriptome of blood leukocytes from Parkinson's disease patients prior to and following deep brain stimulation (DBS) and as compared with healthy control volunteers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of small RNA sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of microRNA molecules (miRNAs) in blood leukocytes of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Expression changes which may contribute to PD pathogenesis and reaction to treatment were identified in RNA preparations from blood leukocyte samples collected from PD patients prior to and following DBS neurosurgery on stimulation and following a short one hour cessation of the electrical stimulation (which enabled dissociation of the surgery effects from the electrical stimulation alone) and from matched healthy control volunteers, all under signed informed consents.

DESIGN
Examination of four states: Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients 1 day prior to DBS, PD patients a few weeks after DBS neurosurgery (upon symptoms stabilization) both on and following one hour electrical stimulation cessation, and age-matched healthy control volunteers.
