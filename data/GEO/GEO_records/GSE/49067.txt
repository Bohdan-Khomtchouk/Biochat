TITLE
Expression data from responders/nonresponders before/after receiving DLI for relapse of CML s/p BMT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Increasing evidence across malignancies suggests that infiltrating T cells at the site of disease are crucial to tumor control. We hypothesized that marrow-infiltrating immune populations play a critical role in response to donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), an established and potentially curative immune therapy whose precise mechanism remains unknown.  We therefore analyzed marrow-infiltrating immune populations in 29 patients (22 responders, 7 nonresponders) with relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia who received CD4+ DLI in the pre-tyrosine kinase inhibitor era. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying T cell infiltration into bone marrow of responders and nonresponders to DLI.

DESIGN
mRNA expression profiling of marrow-infiltrating CD3+ positively selected T cells of 4 responders compared to 2 non-responders, before and after DLI, was performed on Affymetrix microarrays.
