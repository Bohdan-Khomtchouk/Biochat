TITLE
Nrf2 Knockout vs. Wildtype mice, liver sample

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In situ synthesized oligo arrays, U74Av2, from Affymetrix were used to measure differential gene expression in RNA samples generated from the liver of Nrf2 knockout and wildtype mice at 5 month age. Total RNAs from two Nrf2 knockout or wildtype littermates were analyzed separately. There are two replicates (GSM 13431, 13435) for the female Nrf2 wildtype group, two replicates (GSM 13439, 13441) for the male Nrf2 wildtype group, two replicates (GSM 13436, 13437) for the female Nrf2 knockout group, and two replicates (GSM 13438, 13440) for the male Nrf2 knockout group. Keywords: parallel sample
