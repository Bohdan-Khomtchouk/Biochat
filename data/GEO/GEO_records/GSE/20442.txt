TITLE
Arabidopsis lyrata flowering tissues small RNAs

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis lyrata

SUMMARY
Small RNA sequences from Arabidopsis lyrata flowering tissues, as isolated from flowering tissues of two biological replicates.  These data were analyzed to 1) discover new micoRNAs in A. lyrata 2) examine microRNA processing accuary in A. lyrata and 3) to examine patterns of 24nt siRNA accumulation in A. lyrata.

DESIGN
Two small RNA libraries from flowering tissues of two biological replicates were analyzed using an Applied Biosystems SOLiDâ„¢ System

PLATFORM
GPL10082 AB SOLiD System 3.0 (Arabidopsis lyrata)
