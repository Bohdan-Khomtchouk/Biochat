TITLE
JIR1201, JIR1212, JIR1244, JIR1461, JIR1474, JIR3209, JIR3350, JIR3356 and JIR3528 genomic arrays

ORGANISM
Dichelobacter nodosus

SUMMARY
Comparing the genetic content of strains JIR1201, JIR1212, JIR1244, JIR1461, JIR1474, JIR3209, JIR3350, JIR3356 and JIR3528 to wild-type strain JIR3356. Comparison of JIR3356 with itself to eliminate any variation that may occur with the technique. This experiment should not produce any statistically significant expression changes. Keywords: genomic hybridisation

DESIGN
Two biological replicates were analysed per strain, which included a dye swap. Raw data was compiled using IMAGENE. Normalisation and statistical analysis was undertaken using BASE. Statistics were performed using the Wilcoxon signed ranked test.
