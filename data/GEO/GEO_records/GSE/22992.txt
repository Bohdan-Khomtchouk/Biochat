TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in nitrogen depletion with oligodT priming

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Multi-targeting priming (MTP) for genome-wide gene expression assays provides selective targeting of multiple sequences and counter-selection against undesirable sequences. We demonstrated superior performance of two MTPs compared to oligo-dT microarray profling and RNA tag sequencing the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to nitrogen deficiency and profiling Neurospora crassa early sexual development. Priming with MTPs in addition to oligo-dT resulted in higher sensitivity, a greater number of well-measured genes, more genes significantly differentially expressed, and a greater power to detect meager differences.

DESIGN
Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c was grown on two different media and two different primers were used for reverse transcription: oligo(dT) and Multi-Targeted Primer [MTP] protoperithecia oligo(dT)+ MTP (PP2) perithecia oligo(dT)+ MTP (PT2). Two biological replicates and dye swapping
