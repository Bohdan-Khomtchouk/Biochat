TITLE
Comparing gene expression of Lentigo to perilesional normal

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analyze of gene expression of Lentigo and perilesional normal and compare gene expression of Lentigo to gene expression of perilesional normal.

DESIGN
We have 2 sample (two patient), we collected Lentigo and perilesional normal region in each patient, extract RNA and analyze exon array. We compare of gene expression of Lentigo and gene expression of perilesional normal.
