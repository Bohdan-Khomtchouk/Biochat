TITLE
Trophoblast stem cells (TSC) global transcriptome in stemness and differentiation conditions after treatment with PF1-3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we report a potent, acetyl-lysine competitive and cell active inhibitor, PFI-3, that tightly binds to the bromodomain present in BRG1/BRM and the fifth bromodomain in Polybromo (BAF180). The high specificity of PFI-3 was achieved based on a novel binding mode of a salicylic acid head group that led to the replacement of water molecules typically maintained in bromodomain inhibitor complexes. Embryonic stem cells exposure to PFI-3 led to deprivation of stemness and deregulated lineage specification. Furthermore, differentiation of trophoblast stem cells in the presence of PFI-3 was dramatically enhanced.

DESIGN
TSC were treated with PF1-3 or control compound in stemness or differentiation conditions, 2 replicates were used for treatment in stemness and differentiation conditions together with 2 control replicates in stemness and one during differentiation; DFKZ genomics and proteomics

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
