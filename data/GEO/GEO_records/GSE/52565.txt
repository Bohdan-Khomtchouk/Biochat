TITLE
Expression data from 63 week old mouse hippocampus - comparison between wildtype and transgenic animal

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A number of studies have identified changes in gene expression in cells from HGPS patients and in tissues from animal models for HGPS. To investigate if the severe nuclear distortions seen in approximately 95% of the neuronal cells of the hippocampus resulted in any changes in gene expression, global genome transcript analysis was performed using the Affymetrix exon arrays on RNA extracted from the hippocampus of 63-week old HGPS and littermate controls.

DESIGN
Total of 6 animals were analyzed - 3 wildtype and 3 transgenic animals. Genes with an FDR≤10% and a fold-change ≥2 were selected and analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
