TITLE
Gene profiling data of CD4+ T cells doubly transduced with EOS+LEF1 or GATA1+SATB1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor FoxP3 partakes dominantly in the specification and function of FoxP3+ CD4+ T regulatory cells (Tregs), but is neither strictly necessary nor sufficient to determine the characteristic Treg transcriptional signature. Computational network inference and experimental testing assessed the contribution of several other transcription factors (TFs). Enforced expression of Helios or Xbp1 elicited specific signatures, but Eos, Irf4, Satb1, Lef1 and Gata1 elicited exactly the same outcome, synergizing with FoxP3 to activate most of the Treg signature, including key TFs, and enhancing FoxP3 occupancy at its genomic targets. Conversely, the Treg signature was robust to inactivation of any single cofactor. A redundant genetic switch thus locks-in the Treg phenotype, a model which accounts for several aspects of Treg physiology, differentiation and stability.

DESIGN
To study the impact of the combination of two transcription factors on the expression of the Treg transcriptional signature, CD4+ Tconv cells activated with anti-CD3+CD28 beads were retrovirally transduced with cDNAs encoding EOS and LEF1, or GATA1 and SATB1. The cells were then sorted into Trizol, and RNA was purified, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays.
