TITLE
Adipose-derived stem cells improved mouse ovary function after chemotherapy-induced ovary failure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ADSCs are a new type of MSC that is typically abundant in individuals. Numerous investigations reported that adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) transplantation could ameliorate the structure and function of injured tissues. However, their protective role in premature ovarian failure remains obscure. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic efficacy of ADSC transplantation for chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage and microarray analyses were used to assess gene related to ovarian function.

DESIGN
Total RNA of ovarians of four groups was extracted using the TRIZOL Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeling and hybridization were performed at the CapitalBio Company, according to protocols described in the 32K mouse genome arrays user manual. The data were analyzed using LuxScan 3.0 Image analysis software (CapitalBio company).
