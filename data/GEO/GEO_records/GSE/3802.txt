TITLE
Histone H2B^3-32

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Histone H2B was mutated to give H2B^3-32.  Total RNA from three replicate cultures of wild-type and mutant was isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by H2B N-terminal domain. Keywords: repeat
