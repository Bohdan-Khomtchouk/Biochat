TITLE
Transcriptional network between pCAR1 and KT2440 chromosome

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida

SUMMARY
The completely sequenced catabolic plasmid pCAR1 of Pseudomonas resinovorans CA10 confers the ability to degrade carbazole upon the recipient strain Pseudomonas putida KT2440.  To study the coordinated expression of pCAR1 with its host chromosome, transcriptome of the transconjugant strain KT2440(pCAR1) was analyzed at growth with carbazole as the sole carbon source compared to succinate as an alternative carbon source. Next, horizontal gene transfer of a plasmid potentially alters the transcriptome of its host chromosome.  Transcriptome of the transconjugant strain KT2440(pCAR1) was compared to the parental strain KT2440 at the same growth conditions. Furthermore, pCAR1 encodes a possible global regulator designated ORF70, which belongs to the MvaT family of H-NS-like nucleoid-associated proteins in Pseudomonas.  To investigate the regulon under the control of ORF70, transcriptome of KT2440(pCAR1deltaORF70) was compared to the parental strain KT2440(pCAR1) at the same growth conditions. Keywords: Comparative transcriptome analysis
