TITLE
Phosphorylated and Sumoylation-Deficient Progesterone Receptors Drive Proliferative Gene Signatures During Breast Cancer Progression (Affymetrix gene expression analysis)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Anlaysis of the differential gene expression between T47D cells expressing wild type (WT) progesterone receptor isoform B (PR) or SUMOylation-deficient PR molecules.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from T47D breast cancer cells induced (with AP21967) to express either iWT PR-B or mutant PR-B (iK388R, SUMO-deficient), treated with or without synthetic PR ligand R5020 for 6 h. Each sample had 1 replicate.
