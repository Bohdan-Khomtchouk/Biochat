TITLE
Expression data from  glp-1(e2141) hermaphrodites maintained with or without males for 8 days

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Males induce dramatic physiological changes to hermaphrodites, including a significant shortening of lifespan. We have termed this effect as male-induced demise (MID) of hermaphrodites. This experiment was performed to analyse changes in gene expression due to the presence of males. We have shown that Knock down of utx-1 ameliorates the MID. In this experiment we also examine male-induce gene expression that may be altered when knocking down expression of utx-1 via RNAi. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression andidentified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes upon the addition of males.

DESIGN
There are 12 samples in total. To identify male-induced expression using microarray analysis, 250 glp-1(e2141) L1 hermaphrodites (to avoid production of progeny) were placed in the presence of 250 wild-type males (L4-adult day 1) for 8 days on a 10 cm NGM plate seeded with OP50. As a control for worm number, 500 L1 glp-1(e2141) hermaphrodites were placed on a 10 cm NGM plate seeded with OP50 for 8 days. Both conditions were incubated at 25Â°C, the restrictive temperature for the glp-1(e2141) worms throughout the experiment. On day 8, male worms were removed from the plate and RNA was extracted from 200 hermaphrodites from each condition. RNA from 3 independent experimentsfor each condition was used for the microarray hybridization with the exception of utx-1 RNAi (with males) of which one condition did not provide sufficient total RNA. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy (Qiagen). Microarray hybridization was performed at the Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid facility with oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix, GeneChipC. elegans Genome Arrays).
