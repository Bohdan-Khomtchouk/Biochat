TITLE
Whole transcriptome analysis of UUO mouse model of renal fibrosis reveals new molecular players in kidney diseases

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study demontrates differences in the transcriptome ( both of protein coding transcripts and long non-coding RNAs) in the unilateral ureteric obstruction model of renal fibrosis.

DESIGN
Renal tissue was studied from animals undergoing sham operation (as controls) or right ureteric ligation. Animals were sacrificed 2 and 8 days following ligation and the right kidney tissue was examined.
