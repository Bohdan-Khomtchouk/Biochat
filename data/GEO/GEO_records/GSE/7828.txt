TITLE
MicroRNA profiles of 84 colon adenocarcinomas and paired nontumorous

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify microRNAs that were differentially expressed in colon tumors and determine if microRNA expression profiles could predict poor cancer survival. Keywords: disease state design

DESIGN
For these experiments, we used RNA extracted from pairs of colon adenocarcinoma tissue and adjacent nontumorous tissue. RNA from pairs of tissues were hybridized on the same day with up to 12 pairs of tissues being hybridized on a given day. To identify differentially expressed microRNAs, paired class comparison in BRB array tools was used.  Samples were paired in the individual from where the tissues originated. Therefore, every tumor tissue has it's own nontumorous reference for comparison.
