TITLE
Expression of ATHB17 in Maize Increases Ear Weight at Silking

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Transformation of the Arabidopsis ATHB17 gene into maize results in the expression of a truncated protein (smaller by 113 amino acids) that functions as a dominant-negative regulator that can modify activity of endogenous maize HD-Zip II transcription factors.  This RNASeq experiment indicates that the observed effects of ATHB17d113 on the maize ear inflorescence and ear transcriptome are very small. Expression of ATHB17delta113 protein in maize leads to changes in ear growth resulting in increased ear size at early reproductive stages and, potentially increased sink size.

DESIGN
Two ATHB17delta113 expressing events (Event 1 and Event 2) were compared to control plants (herein referred to as WT) in the context of Monsanto Elite Maize hybrid line NN6306.  Three bioreps of both Ear inflorescence and Ear tissues were sampled for the WT and each of the two transgenic events.
