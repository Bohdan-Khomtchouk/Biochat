TITLE
Genome-wide Oct4 binding profile in lung cancer A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oct4 stemness gene encoding a transcription factor has been shown to overexpress in cancers. However, precise mechanisms of Oct4 relevant to transcriptional reprogramming leading to somatic cancer progression remain unclear. To address the Oct4-mediated transcriptional program in lung cancer, we integrated genome-wide Oct4 binding profiles from chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing and ENCODE datasets. We identified that Oct4 occupied at functional promoter and enhancer regions of genes which play key roles in several signaling pathways involving tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Genome-wide Oct4 binding sites were identified via chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis of vecoter control and stably Oct4-overexpressing A549 lung cancer cells. ChIP-seq analyses were performed in duplicated samples using Applied Biosystems SOLiD system.
