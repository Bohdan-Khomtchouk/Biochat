TITLE
Combinatorial targeting of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation suppresses tumor growth and metastases.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Warburg effect, consisting of increased glucose uptake and glycolysis, provides metabolic energy as well as cellular building blocks for tumor growth. Inhibition of the Warburg effect with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) has been explored in clinical trials with limited efficacy. Blockage of glycolysis can induce autopahgy resulting in alternative energy generation through oxidative phosphorylation providing a potential bypass of the effects of inhibition of glycolysis. Here in we demonstrate that activation of AMPK, as a consequence of energetic stress, induces mitochondrial energy production potentially bypassing the effects of glycolysis inhibition. We thus combined blockage of glycolysis by 2DG with inhibition of the electron transfer complex I (ETC1) in the mitochondria with the clinically applicable antidiabetic drug metformin. The combination resulted in activation of AMPK and autopahgy that however rendered eventual depletion of ATP and cell death. Furthermore, combined inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration inhibited tumor growth and markedly decreased metastatic capacity in vivo. In order to understand the mechanism of these metabolic inhibitors, we performed whole genome transcriptional analysis.

DESIGN
Human SK-4 esophageal cancer cell lines were treated  with 5 different treatment groups [2 deoxy glucose (4mM), Metformin (5mM), AICAR (2mM), 2 deoxy glucose (4mM) plus Metformin (5mM) and 2 deoxy glucose (4mM) plus AICAR (2mM)] with non treated control groups for 12 hrs. Each groups was quadruplicated. Microarray experiments and data analysis were done at Dept. of Systems Biology, MDACC (Houston, USA)
