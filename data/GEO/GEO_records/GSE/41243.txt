TITLE
Gene expression from Gaucher Disease iPSc

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression data obtained from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from wild type fibroblasts (iPSc WT) and from Gaucher Disease type 2 fibroblasts (GD iPSc). Also, gene expression analysis from the initial fibroblasts was made (WT fibroblasts and GD- fibroblasts), as well as gene expression analysis from a human embryonic stem cell line (hES4).

DESIGN
Two different iPSc cell lines derived from Gaucher Disease type 2 fibroblasts were analysed in order to be compared to iPSc derived from Wild Type fibroblasts (only one cell line) and human embryonic stem cells (only one cell line). The initial cells: two different wild type fibroblasts and one Gaucher disease type 2 fibroblasts were also analysed.
