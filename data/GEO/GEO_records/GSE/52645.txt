TITLE
Vanillin derivatives triggers oxidative stress and inhibit mitochondrial functions in Cryptococcus neoformans

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii H99

SUMMARY
Purpose: The purpose of this study is to define the mechanism of antifungal action of the vanillin derivative, o-vanillin, against Cryptococcus neoformans Methods: mRNA profiles of C. neoformasn cells cultured with or without o-vanillin were generated by RNA-Seq, using Illumina GAIIx. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were mapped to reference genome and the normalized RPKM values were calculated by CLC Genomics Workbench. Results: o-vanillin significantly altered global transcript profiles, induces oxidative stress, and interferes mitochondrial functions in C. neoformans. Conclusions: o-vanillin can be considered as the effective antifungal drug candidate.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of the cells grown in the presence or absence of o-vanillin were generated by RNA-Seq using Illumina GAIIx.
