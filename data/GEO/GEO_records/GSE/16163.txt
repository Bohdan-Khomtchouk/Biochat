TITLE
Meiotic time course of open chromatin as measured by FAIRE

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae SK1

SUMMARY
To investigate the relationship between chromatin organization and meiotic processes, we used Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) to map open chromatin during the transition from mitosis to meiosis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

DESIGN
SK1 yeast strain SHy002 (MATa/MATÎ± ho::LYS2/ho::LYS2 leu2::hisG/leu2::hisG lys2/lys2 ura3/ura3). Meiotic Time Course with samples collected during vegetative growth (YPD) and 0 hr, 1.5hr, and 3hr after transfer to sporulation media (SM). Regions of open chromatin were mapped using Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE).
