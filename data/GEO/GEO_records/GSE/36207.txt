TITLE
Translatome of Jurkat cells: control vs. stress treatment.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Translation efficiencies of Jurkat mRNAs in control and in cells treated with thapsigargin 10microM for 1h and 3h.

DESIGN
Three-conditions experiments. Biological replicates: 1 from three pooled control experiments, 1 from three pooled 1h stress experiment, 1 from three pooled 3h stress experiment.
