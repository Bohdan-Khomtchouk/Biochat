TITLE
In vivo study of ADH-1 in combination with melphalan for treatment of melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify patterns of change in gene expression that correlated with drug treatment (saline control, ADH-1 alone, melphalan alone and ADH-1 plus melphalan) in our animal model of regional therapy for extremity melanoma we evaluated gene expression using microarray genechips and a Pearson correlation analysis.   Genes were ranked according to the degree to which expression correlated with systemic ADH-1 treatment alone or in combination with regional melphalan.  Tissue samples were harvested at 4, 24 and 48 hours after treatment with melphalan. Specific cellular pathways associated with drug treatment were identified using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Keywords: time course; chemotherapy; melanoma; melphalan; N-cadherin; ADH-1
