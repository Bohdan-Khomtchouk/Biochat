TITLE
In vivo study of ADH-1 in combination with melphalan for treatment of melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify patterns of change in gene expression that correlated with drug treatment (saline control, ADH-1 alone, melphalan alone and ADH-1 plus melphalan) in our animal model of regional therapy for extremity melanoma we evaluated gene expression using microarray genechips and a Pearson correlation analysis.   Genes were ranked according to the degree to which expression correlated with systemic ADH-1 treatment alone or in combination with regional melphalan.  Tissue samples were harvested at 4, 24 and 48 hours after treatment with melphalan. Specific cellular pathways associated with drug treatment were identified using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Keywords: time course; chemotherapy; melanoma; melphalan; N-cadherin; ADH-1

DESIGN
Sample size was 2 rats for each drug treatment group at both the 4 and 24 hour time points.  At the 48 hour time point sample size was 1 rat for each drug treatment group.  ADH-1 treatment preceded melphalan by 1 hour.  ADH-1 treatment was repeated at 24 and 48 hrs.  Tissue was harvested for RNA analysis at 4, 24 and 48 hours after completion of isolated limb infusion with melphalan (and 1 hour after an ADH-1 dose).
