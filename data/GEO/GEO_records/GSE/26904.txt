TITLE
Gene expression analysis of FHL2-knockout mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FHL2 is known to be deregulated in liver cancer. In the present study, microarray gene expression profiling was performed to identify the genes regulated downstream of FHL2 In this dataset, we compared the RNA samples from livers of FHL2 knockout mice and those of wild-type (WT) mice.

DESIGN
FHL2 knockout mice was initially generated by Chu et al. 2000. RNA from three mice per group (male, age: 10-11 weeks) were pooled and the two groups were subjected to analysis .
