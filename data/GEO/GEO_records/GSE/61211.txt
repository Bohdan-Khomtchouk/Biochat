TITLE
Differential gene expression between uninfected and infected U937 derived macrophages with Â Leishmania braziliensis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The main objective of this study is to identify the list of genes differentially expressed between infected with Leishmania braziliensis  and non-infected macrophage cultures based on gene expression microarray profiling

DESIGN
The dataset is comprised by the expression profile of 6 samples from three independent experiments and each experiment had three technical replicates. 3 of the 6 samples were U937 derived macrophages infected by Leishmania braziliensis and the other 3 were U937 derived macrophages without infection with Leishmania braziliensis. A total of 18 microarrays analysis were performed.
