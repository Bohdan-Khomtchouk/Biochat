TITLE
Investigation of pneumococcal two-component signal transduction system RR/HK06 in D39

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
We wanted to identify genes regulated by the two-component signal transduction system RR/HK06 in Streptococcus pneumoniae. We used microarray in order to discover regulated genes, investigating the effects of the over-expression of RR06 in D39 (serotype 2). Keywords: Gene Regulation

DESIGN
The RNA used for microarray analysis was extracted from S. pneumoniae D39 over-expressing RR06 and D39 containing over-expression vector without insert. RNA used was from two biological replicates with dye-swap performed for each.
