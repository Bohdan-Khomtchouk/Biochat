TITLE
Investigation of pneumococcal two-component signal transduction system RR/HK06 in D39

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
We wanted to identify genes regulated by the two-component signal transduction system RR/HK06 in Streptococcus pneumoniae. We used microarray in order to discover regulated genes, investigating the effects of the over-expression of RR06 in D39 (serotype 2). Keywords: Gene Regulation
