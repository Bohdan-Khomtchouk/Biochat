TITLE
ENAP1 is involoved in the Histone H3K23 acetylation- and EIN3- mediated ethylene response

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report that ethylene reduce the ENAP1 binding. We perform Chip-sequencing of ENAP1 using chromatins isolated from 3-day old etiolated Col-0/ein2/ein3eil1 seedlings treated with ethylene or air gas. Results show that ethylene reduce ENAP1 binding in TSS region of EIN3 targeted genes that are regulated at the transcriptional level by ethylene.

DESIGN
Examination of 1 different protein binding in 3 Arabidopsis lines which under 2 different treatment.

PLATFORM
