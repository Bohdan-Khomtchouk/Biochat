TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisae strains deleted for the RNA-binding hnRNP Npl3

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription is a major obstacle for replication fork progression and a cause of genome instability. Such instability increases in mutants with a suboptimal assembly of the nascent messenger ribonucleo-protein particle (mRNP), as THO/TREX and some heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) mutants. We used microarrays to the global impact of Npl3 in gene expression and found that Npl3 deletion has a functional impact in highly-expressed, long and G+C rich genes regardless of gene function

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae strains were grown in YPD liquid culture, total RNA was isolated and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL2529 [Yeast_2] Affymetrix Yeast Genome 2.0 Array
