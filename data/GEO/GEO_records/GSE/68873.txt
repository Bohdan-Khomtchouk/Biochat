TITLE
Depletion of p8 causes cytoplasmic vacuolization in A549 lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of A549 after shRNA-mediated depletion of p8. Knockdown of p8 causes cytoplasmic vacuolization, resulting in tumor suppression. Results provide insight into the role of p8 in lung cancer.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of A549 control and A549 p8-KD were generated by RNA-sequencing, using Illumina GAIIx or Illumina HiSeq 2000.

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens) GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
