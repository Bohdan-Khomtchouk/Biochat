TITLE
Deep transcriptional sequencing analysis of human prostate adenocarcinoma and reference samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate adenocarcinoma and matched adjacent normal samples were profiled by deep transcriptional sequencing to analyze transcription-induced chimeras and gene fusions.  Reference samples from the MAQC and brain and universal reference libraries were also sequenced.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment plus reference samples: Prostate adenocarcinoma versus matched normal from three separate patients, plus brain and universal reference samples from the MAQC project.
