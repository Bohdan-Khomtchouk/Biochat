TITLE
Immature cell populations and an erythropoiesis gene expression signature in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Implications for pathogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective. Previous observations suggest that active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is associated with a prominent erythropoiesis gene expression signature. The aim of this study was to determine the association of this signature with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulations and its specificity for sJIA as compared to related conditions. 125 patients with JIA (18 sJIA and 107 non-sJIA) and 29 controls were studied. PBMC were isolated and analyzed for multiple surface antigens by flow cytometry and for gene expression profiles. The proportions of different PBMC subpopulations were compared among sJIA, non-sJIA patients and controls and subsequently correlated with the strength of the erythropoiesis signature. Additional gene expression data from patients with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHLH) and from a published sJIA cohort were analyzed to determine if the erythropoiesis signature was present.
