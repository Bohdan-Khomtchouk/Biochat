TITLE
O-linked Î²-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) acts as a glucose sensor to epigenetically regulate the insulin gene in pancreatic beta cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compare global gene expression changes in the Min6 cell line in response to altered glucose flux and pharmacological manipulation of the O-GlcNAc postranslational protein modification.

DESIGN
Min6 cells were treated for 1hr in the following conditions: Low glucose (LG), high glucose (HG) and LG+GlcNAcstatin (LG+GNS). After treatment, total RNA was extracted and used for sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
