TITLE
Distribution of TrxG, RNA Pol II and associated histone marks in Sg4 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PcG and TrxG are important epigenetic regulators of genome expression. Here we have determined genomic distributions of TRX, ASH1, RNA Pol II, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K9ac in cultured Drosophila Sg4 cells by hybridization of ChIP products with tiling microarrays.

DESIGN
genomic distributions of TRX, ASH1, RNA Pol II, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K9ac in cultured Drosophila Sg4 cells by hybridization of ChIP products with tiling microarrays.
