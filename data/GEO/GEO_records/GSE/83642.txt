TITLE
Effect of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and transforming growth factor (TGFb) on gene expression in dermal fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary adult dermal fibroblasts isolated from forearm skin biopsy of 3 healthy donors were treated with DMF and TGFb.

DESIGN
3 cell lines of dermal fibroblasts were derived from skin biopses from healthy donors. All cell lines were subjected to 4 treatments: control (DMSO), dimethyl fumarate (DMF), TGFb, and TGFb+DMF. The goal of the study was to identify sets of genes regulated by different treatments.
