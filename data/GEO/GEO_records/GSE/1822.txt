TITLE
EWS-FLI1-transfection of HEK293

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Response of HEK293-cells after transfection with EWS-FLI1. HEK293 cells were transfected with the expression vector pIRES2-EGFP containing type I EWS-FLI1 or empty control vector. For transient transfection standard DEAE dextran method was used and RNA was isolated 48h post transfection. For stable transfection cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and cells were selected with 400 ug/mL G418. DNA-microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix HG-U133A microarrays.(see Staege et al. Cancer Res. 2004) Keywords = HEK293 Keywords = EWS-FLI1 Keywords = Ewing family tumors Keywords: other
