TITLE
The GATA transcription factor gene gtaG is required for terminal differentiation in Dictyostelium.

ORGANISM
Dictyostelium discoideum

SUMMARY
The GATA transcription factor GtaG is conserved in Dictyostelids and essential for terminal differentiation in Dictyostelium discoideum, but its function is not well understood. Here we show that gtaG is expressed in prestalk cells at the anterior region of fingers and in the extending stalk during culmination. The gtaG- phenotype is cell-autonomous in prestalk cells and non-cell-autonomous in prespore cells. Transcriptome analyses reveal that GtaG regulates prestalk gene expression during cell differentiation before culmination and is required for progression into culmination. GtaG-dependent genes include genetic suppressors of the Dd-STATa-defective phenotype as well as Dd-STATa target-genes, including extra cellular matrix genes. We show that GtaG may be involved in the production of two culmination-signaling molecules, cyclic di-GMP and the spore differentiation factor SDF-1 and that addition of c-di-GMP rescues the gtaG- culmination and spore formation deficiencies. We propose that GtaG is a regulator of terminal differentiation that functions in concert with Dd-STATa and controls culmination through regulating c-di-GMP and SDF-1 production in prestalk cells.

DESIGN
Total 28 samples were used for this analysis. 7 developmental timepoints of wild-type and gtaG- strains were analyzed with 2 biological replication.
