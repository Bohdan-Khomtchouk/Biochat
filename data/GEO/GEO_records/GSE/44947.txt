TITLE
Transcriptional Characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae Interacting with Human Pharyngeal Cells

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4

SUMMARY
We used a combination of adherence assays, mutagenesis and functional genomics to identify novel factors involved in adherence.  This work identifies a list of novel potential pneumococcal adherence determinants.

DESIGN
S. pneumoniae TIGR4 transcriptome was sequenced using RNA-Seq on the Illumina GA.  High-quality, single ended, 36bp reads were mapped to the TIGR4 genome.
