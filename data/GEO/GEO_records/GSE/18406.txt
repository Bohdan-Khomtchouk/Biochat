TITLE
microRNA-target RNA pairs revealed by Parallel analysis of RNA ends in Vitis vinifera

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Vitis vinifera RNA degradome

DESIGN
Isolated polyadenylated RNA from total RNA extracts of  Vitis vinifera leaves, were ligated to 5'-adapter that include san MmeI recognition site. The ligated products were purified again, reverse transcribed and cleaved with MmeI. The 5' fragments were purified from gel and to a 3'- dsDNA adapter and PCR amplified. After PCR amplification the sample was subjected to Solexa/Illumina high throughput pyrosequencing. Please see www.illumina.com for details of the sequencing technology.
