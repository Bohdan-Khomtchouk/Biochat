TITLE
Peritoneal cavity macrophage response to IFNg and IFNa

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We seeked to determine in vivo effects of IFNg and IFNa response in peritoneal cavity macrophages. These cells were part of ImmGen Interferon cytokine study and immunocytes were sorted according to Immgen's standard lineage panel. Profiles from peritoneal cavity macrophages were used to analyze cell specific responses to IFNg.

DESIGN
8,000 units of recombinant IFNg or 10,000 units of recombinant IFNa were injected subcutaneously in C57bl6 6-week-old male mice. Mice were sacrificed 2 hours after injection and peritoneal lavage was collected. F4/80+ ICAM+ peritoneal cavity macrophages were double sorted using FACSAria into Trizol.
