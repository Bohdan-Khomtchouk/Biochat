TITLE
Inducible overexpression analysis of KUODA1 in Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify potenital target genes of the transcription factor KUODA1 (AT5G47390), we performed expression profiling using an estradiol inducible overexpression system.

DESIGN
Estradiol-treatment allows for the nuclear translocation of the constitutively expressed chimeric transcription factor XVE and subsequent expression of KUA1 from the LexA promoter. Stable trangenic T3 seedlings were grown for 14 days and either treated with 15 ÂµM estradiol or ethanol (mock) for 4 hours. Two mock and two  estradiol treated samples were used for RNA isolation and hybridization.
