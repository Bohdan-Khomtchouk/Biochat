TITLE
Genome-wide Scan for Methylation Profiles in head and Neck Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of HPV positive and HPV negative head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.1 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485577 CpGs in 4 HPV positive and 4 HPV negative HNSCC tumors

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 8 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.1
