TITLE
Copy number variation of genes (exons) in invasive Cottus compared to the parental species, Cottus rhenanus and Cottus perifretum.

ORGANISM
Cottus

SUMMARY
Hybridization between Cottus rhenanus and C. perifretum has resulted in an evolutionary young hybrid lineage of invasive Cottus that has colonized a new habitat where the parental species are not found (Nolte et al. 2005; Proc. R. Soc. B 272: 2379â€“2387). This CGH array was designed to screen for copy number variation among Cottus species and to find gene duplicates that are unique to the hybrid lineage (see also Dennenmoser et al. 2017; Copy number increases of transposable elements and protein coding genes in an invasive fish of hybrid origin).
