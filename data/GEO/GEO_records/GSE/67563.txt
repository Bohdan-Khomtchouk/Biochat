TITLE
High-frequency generation of fertile transgenic mice from H19-Igf2 engineered androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent success in the derivation of mouse haploid embryonic stem cells from androgenetic blastocysts (ahESCs) has provided new avenues for the generation of genetically modified animals. However, the efficiency to produce viable transgenic mice via intracytoplasmic ahESCs injection (ICAI) was very low, which may correlate with the aberrant regulation of imprinted genes. Here we designed to delete the paternal imprinted gene H19 by CRSPR-Cas9 system combined with homologous recombination. The H19 deleted (H19Δ) ahESCs maintained haploidy and genome integrity, expressed pluripotency markers, differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs), and contributed to chimeras after blastocyst injection. These cells exhibited similar imprinting features with sperm cells, and can produce fertile progenies after ICAI at a high efficiency. More importantly, it is feasible to perform genetic manipulations in H19Δ ahESCs, and the genomic modifications can be properly transmitted to offspring. Our study will benefit the reproductive medicine in curing the hereditary genetic diseases and infertility in the future.

DESIGN
The copy number variations of the two H19Δ ahESC lines were analyzed by the SurePrint G3 Mouse CGH 4×180 K microarrays (Agilent).  Wild-type OG-3 ahESCs were used as reference.
