TITLE
MicroRNA profile of tumorigenic cells during formation of pulmonary adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Study designed to obtain microRNA profile of tumorigenic Sca-1+CD34+ cells during the formation of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. After intranasal infection with adenovirus CRE (Ad-Cre), lung adenocarcinoma was identified pathologically in Lox-stop-lox Kras (LSL-Kras) G12D mice. Sca-1+CD34+ cells were sorted by flow cytometry and tested for the tumor-initiating ability to undergo self-renewal and differentiation. MiRNA profile was obtained from the microarray and further confirmed by qRT-PCR.The function of miRNAs was predicted bioinformatically, and miR-294 was verified to explore its relationship with tumor migration and invasion.

DESIGN
We taken lung tissues from the LSL-Kras G12D mouse on the 0, 15th, 30th days, and defined as Group A, B, C respectively. These 3 samples were analyzed. Each kind of probe has 4 repeat spots on the microarray. Total RNA are harvested using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). All processing conducted at the Kang Cheng Biological chip Company Limited.  Microarray was synthesized using Î¼ParafloTM microfluidic chip technology, and the information of miRNA probe sequence of each region was obtained from the database of Sanger miRBase version 11.0.
