SUMMARY
Aberrations in chromatin dynamics play a fundamental role in tumorigenesis, yet relatively little is known of the molecular mechanisms linking histone lysine methylation to neoplastic disease. ING4 (Inhibitor of Growth 4) is a native subunit of an HBO1 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex and a tumor suppressor protein.  Here we show a critical role for the specific read-out of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) by the ING4 PHD finger in mediating ING4 gene expression and tumor suppressor functions.  The interaction between ING4 and H3K4me3 augments the acetylation activity of HBO1 on H3 tails, and drives H3 acetylation at ING4 target promoters to effect a DNA damage-dependent gene expression program.  Further, ING4 facilitates apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress and inhibits anchorage-independent cell growth, and these functions are dependent on ING4 interactions with H3K4me3.  Together, our results demonstrate a mechanism for brokering crosstalk between H3K4 methylation and histone H3 acetylation, and reveal a new molecular link between chromatin modulation and tumor suppressor mechanisms.
