TITLE
Performance of Immunochip 1.0 with hemolymph samples collected at 3 and 48 hours from Vibrio-challenged mussels

ORGANISM
Mytilus galloprovincialis

SUMMARY
We aimed to exemplify early and late transcriptional response of M. galloprovincialis to live Vibrio cells. Hemolymph was collected at 3 and 48 hours after the injection of 10 to 7 cells Vibrio splendidus LGP32 into the posterior adductor muscle. Hemolymph samples were similarly collected from paired control mussels injected with PBS-NaCl. The purified RNAs were successfully amplified, labelled and competitively hybridized to the new mussel oligoarray Immunochip 1.0.

DESIGN
After acclimatization, groups of 40 farmed mussels from the Venice lagoon (Italy) were injected either with 10 to 7 cells of Vibrio splendidus LGP32 or with NaCl-enriched PBS. One ml of hemolymph was withdrawn at 3 h and 48 h post-injection from each control or treated mussel. Two RNA pools (N=10) per time point were composed from the treated mussels, processed and competitively hybridized in dye-swap combination (Cy3 / Cy5 aRNAs) on the same Immunochip slide against time-paired control RNA pools (N=40). Since each Immunochip array contains 4 replicates per probe, the dye-swap testing yielded a total of 16 expression values per probe per time-point.
