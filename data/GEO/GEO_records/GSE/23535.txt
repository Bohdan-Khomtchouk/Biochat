TITLE
Performance of Immunochip 1.0 with hemolymph samples collected at 3 and 48 hours from Vibrio-challenged mussels

ORGANISM
Mytilus galloprovincialis

SUMMARY
We aimed to exemplify early and late transcriptional response of M. galloprovincialis to live Vibrio cells. Hemolymph was collected at 3 and 48 hours after the injection of 10 to 7 cells Vibrio splendidus LGP32 into the posterior adductor muscle. Hemolymph samples were similarly collected from paired control mussels injected with PBS-NaCl. The purified RNAs were successfully amplified, labelled and competitively hybridized to the new mussel oligoarray Immunochip 1.0.
