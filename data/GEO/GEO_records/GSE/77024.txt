TITLE
Genome-wide identification of snoRNA-guided 2’-O-methylation sites [Ribometh-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We combine two experimental high-throughput sequencing methods to identify new 2'-O-methylation sites in human and assign snoRNA guides to sites with previously unknown guides.

DESIGN
We applied RiboMeth-seq to map 2’-O-Me sites in rRNA and poly(A)-enriched RNA obtained from either the nucleus or cytoplasmic fraction of HEK293 cells. We carried out the alkaline hydrolysis for different time intervals of 8, 14 or 20 minutes. The sample titles report  protocol, cell type, extraction and digestion time.
