TITLE
compare the difference of gene expression between wild type ESCs and Mll2 Knockdown ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mll2 (ALR) is a histone 3 lysine 4 trimethyltransferase to function as gene activation.In our study, we found that Mll2 is vital for proper control of proliferation and lineage differentiation of mouse ESCs, particularly towards the cardiac-specific lineages. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression to compare the difference after Mll2 knockdown in E14 cell lines.

DESIGN
E14 cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for Mll2  for 24 hours, and then puromycin was added at 2mg/ml to select for 5 days. Then collet samples of control and Mll2 knockdown E14 cells for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
