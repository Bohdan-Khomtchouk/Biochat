TITLE
Next generation sequencing of human monocyte derived dendritic cells stimulated for two hours with LPS, C5a and/or MSK inhibitor SB-747561

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to determine the full breath of C5aR and TLR crosstalk in human DC, RNA sequencing analysis on human moDC stimulated in the absence or presence of C5a and TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was performed. To minimize interference of induced positive and negative feedback loops, we analyzed gene expression after two hours of DC activation. The involvement of CREB signaling in C5aR and TLR crosstalk was investigated by including moDC stimulated in the presence of MSK inhibitor.

DESIGN
Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells of 4 independent donors were were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
