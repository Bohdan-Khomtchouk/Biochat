TITLE
MicroRNA signatures of Insulin-producing cells differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The expression profile of miRNAs in MSCs and differentiated Insulin-producing cells was examined using RNA-seq technology. The expression of 411 miRNAs was observed, which we classified into three groups according to expression levels in differentiated Insulin-producing cells relative to that in MSCs: group I contained 107 miRNAs with an increased level of expression, group II contained 250 miRNAs that showed no change in expression and group III contained 54 miRNAs with decreased levels of expression.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different expression profile of miRNAs in 2 cell types

PLATFORM
GPL16133 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Gallus gallus)
