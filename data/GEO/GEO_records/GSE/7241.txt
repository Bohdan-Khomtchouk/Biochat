TITLE
Acid1 overexpression fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts with over-expression of the transcription cofactor Acid1. An induced/non-induced system regulated by treatment with Tamoxifen (OHT) stimulates the transport of Acid1 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus that leads to an overexpression of the protein in the nucleus (induced situation). 3 and 6 hours after induction of Acid1 expression profiles were performed Keywords: murine, fibroblast, Acid1, cDNA arrays

DESIGN
NIH3T3 fibroblast overexpressing Acid1 3h and 10h after treatment including 50% dyeswap experiments

PLATFORM
GPL3697 GSF/IEG mouse array
