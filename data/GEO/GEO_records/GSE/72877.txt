TITLE
The methylome of Alu repeats in primates

ORGANISM
Gorilla gorilla ; Pan troglodytes ; Pongo pygmaeus ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Next Generation Sequencing of Unmethylated Alu (NSUMA) interrogation of more than 130,000 individual Alus for differential methylation with concomitant analysis of copy number variations applied to the study of hypomethylation in primates.

DESIGN
3 replicates of Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus and Homo sapiens were studied.
