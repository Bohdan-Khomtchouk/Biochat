TITLE
Gene expression profile of NR2E3 in MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
While the roles of individual nuclear receptor (NR) in human diseases have been well characterized, interplays among NRs have not been extensively characterized due, in part, to technical difficulties in simultaneously monitoring molecular activities of all 48 NR genes. Using systems-level analysis of publically available gene expression data from NCI-60 cell lines, we uncovered novel interaction between ESR1 and orphan receptor NR2E3. Expression of NR2E3 is significantly associated with expression of ESR1 in NCI-60 cell lines as well as in breast cancer patients. To investigate how NR2E3 gene signatures are globally correlated with ESR1 signaling pathway, we performed microarray after knocking down NR2E3 or ESR1 in MCF-7 cells.
