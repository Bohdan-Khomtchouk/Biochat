TITLE
H3K4me3 chromatin profiling in SUMOylation-competent and -deficient bone marrow derived dendritic cells unstimulated or stimulated with LPS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To determine H3K4me3 chromatin profile in UBC9WT and UBC9KO BMDC before and after LPS stimulation. Methods: H3K4me3 chromatin profile was determined by sequencing UBC9 WT and UBC9 KO BMDC chromatin immunoprecipitated with antibody specific for H3K4me3. Results: We show differential chromatin profile for H3K4me3 on the ifnb1 locus between UBC9 KO cells and UBC9 WT. Conclusions: Loss of SUMOylation causes a deregulation of ifnb1 transcription activation mark.

DESIGN
A study of H3K4me3 chromatin profile in UBC9 WT and UBC9 KO Bone Marrow derived Dendritic Cells.
