TITLE
Expression data from yeast treated with enediynes compared to gamma radiation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We are investigating the transcriptional response of yeast to treatment with enediynes or gamma radiation, which generate different extents of double or single strand breaks in DNA. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the DNA damage response in yeast Keywords: dose

DESIGN
Yeast were grown to mid log phase and treated with enediynes or gamma radiation (in biological triplicate) resulting in similar extents of cell killing.  The responses were compared to each other and we have deciphered a gene expression profile that is specific for double and single strand breaks in DNA.
