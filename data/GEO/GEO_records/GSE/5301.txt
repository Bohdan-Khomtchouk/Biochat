TITLE
Expression data from yeast treated with enediynes compared to gamma radiation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We are investigating the transcriptional response of yeast to treatment with enediynes or gamma radiation, which generate different extents of double or single strand breaks in DNA. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the DNA damage response in yeast Keywords: dose
