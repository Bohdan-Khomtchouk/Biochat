TITLE
Expression data from WEEV infected BE(2)-C/m cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcription response of differentiated human BE(2)-C/m neuronal cells to infection with WEEV at 12 h and 24 h after infection.

DESIGN
Two independent sets of BE(2)-C/m cells uninfected or infected with WEEV at an MOI=10 and harvested at 12 h or 24 h after infection.  Total RNA was harvested analyzed with Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 chips.
