TITLE
human induced pluripotent stem cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Successful reprogramming of differentiated human somatic cells into a pluripotent state would allow creation of patient- and disease-specific stem cells. We previously reported generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, capable of germline transmission, from mouse somatic cells by transduction of four defined transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate the generation of iPS cells from adult human dermal fibroblasts with the same four factors: Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Human iPS cells were expandable and similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, surface antigens, gene expression, DNA methylation status of pluripotent cell-specific genes, and telomerase activity. Furthermore, these cells could differentiate into cell types of the three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas. These findings demonstrate that iPS cells can be generated from adult human fibroblasts. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Total RNA from HDF and hiPS cells (clone 201B) was labeled with Cy3. Samples were hybridized with Whole Human Genome Microarray 4 x 44K (G4112F, Agilent), with the one color protocol. Arrays were scanned with a G2565BA Microarray Scanner System (Agilent).  Data analyzed by using GeneSpring GX7.3.1 software (Agilent). Array data of hES H9 cells (GSM194390) was retrieved from GEO ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM194390 ). Genes with " present " flag value in all three samples were used for analyses (32266 genes).
