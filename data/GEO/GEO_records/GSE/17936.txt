TITLE
Nkx2.5 regulates Jarid2 during outflow tract morphogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Nkx2.5 is required for specification of pharyngeal arch second heart field (SHF) progenitors that contribute to outflow tract (OFT) and right ventricle (RV) formation. Multiple sets of microarray data were analyzed to identify genes that are candidate targets of Nkx2.5 in the second heart field. These sets are: 1) publicly available data for cardiothoracic tissue from E9.5 Nkx2.5 wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous embryos; 2) an analysis of mouse E10.5 pharyngeal arch tissue; 3) an analysis of mouse E12.5 heart tissue; and 4) a temporal analysis of the cardiogenic cell line P19CL6. This combined analysis identified 11 genes (Lrrn1, Elovl2, Safb, Slc39a6, Khdrbs1, Hoxb4, Fez1, Ccdc117, Jarid2, Nrcam, and Enpp3) expressed in SHF-containing pharyngeal arch tissue whose regulation is dependent on Nkx2.5 expression.
