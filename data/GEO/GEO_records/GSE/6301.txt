TITLE
Pol II localization in yeast termination mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RNA Polymerase II was mapped over 4% of the yeast genome by ChIP, in wild-type and a handful of mutants in transcriptional termination factors. Keywords: ChIP-chip, transcription termination

DESIGN
RNA Polymerase II was mapped over 4% of the yeast genome by ChIP, in wild-type and a handful of mutants in transcriptional termination factors.  RNA polymerase was isolated by ChIP from sonicated chromatin, amplified by PCR, and labeled by Klenow labeling with direct-labeled dCTP.
