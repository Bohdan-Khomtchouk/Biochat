TITLE
MicroRNAs differentially expressed in liposarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed expression profiling of microRNAs comparing liposarcomas (n=17) with normal fat pad (n=8). We found 35 miRNAs differentially expression (P < 0.0001, fold > 1.5), including mir-155.

DESIGN
We performed expression profiling of microRNAs comparing liposarcomas with normal fat pad.
