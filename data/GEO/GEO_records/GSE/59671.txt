TITLE
Celecoxib, rofecoxib treated human smooth muscle cells microarray timecourse

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this data set is to measure the effect of rofecoxib and celecoxib on the transcription profile in an in vitro inflammation model. Transcription profiling was carried out using Affymetrix HG U-133A v2 microarrays.

DESIGN
Human aortic smooth muscle cells (3F1243) were pre-treated with rofecoxib (500 nM) or celecoxib (500 nM) for two hours and subsequently exposed to IL-1beta (10 ng/ml). Transcription profiling was carried out at several time points of IL-1beta exposure: Four samples at -2 hours. Four samples each of control, celecoxib, and rofecoxib at each time point 0hr, 2hr, 8hr and 24hr. 52 samples in total.
