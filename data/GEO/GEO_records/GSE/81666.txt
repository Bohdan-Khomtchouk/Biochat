TITLE
Expression data of nuclear mRNA export mutant rae1-167 cells

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
rae1 is an essential gene and encodes one of nuclear pore complex. rae1-167 mutant cells show rapid accumulation of polyA-RNA in the nucleus at 36°C followed by protein accumulation, suggesting that accumulated nuclear mRNA influences nucelar cytooplasmic transport. We used microarrays to compare the overall gene expression of rae1-167 cells grown at 36°C with that at 25°C.
