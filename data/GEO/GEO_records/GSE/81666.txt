TITLE
Expression data of nuclear mRNA export mutant rae1-167 cells

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
rae1 is an essential gene and encodes one of nuclear pore complex. rae1-167 mutant cells show rapid accumulation of polyA-RNA in the nucleus at 36째C followed by protein accumulation, suggesting that accumulated nuclear mRNA influences nucelar cytooplasmic transport. We used microarrays to compare the overall gene expression of rae1-167 cells grown at 36째C with that at 25째C.

DESIGN
rae1-167 cells grown in YE4S medium were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarray. In order to characterize transcriptional profiling of rae1-167 cells at 36째C, we carried out the genome-wide gene expression analysis of rae1-167 cells.
