TITLE
The difference of gene expression for live or dead BbrY associated mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To confirm epithelial gene expression of the large intestine after inoculation of dead (heat-treatment) or live Bifidobacterium probiotic strain (BbrY) we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling. The epithelial cells were released from dead or live BbrY associated mice 3 or 28 days after association and GF mice with HANKS including EDTA and Hepes and treated by TRI-zol reagent. It was confirmed that the live BbrY associated mice were affected epithelial gene expression much more than dead cell feeding by K-means clustering and the functional categories.

DESIGN
BbrY-association induced gene expression in cecal epithelial cells was measured at 3 or 28 days after BbrY-association. Four mice was used for each experiment and GF mice were used as reference.
