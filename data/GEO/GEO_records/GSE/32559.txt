TITLE
Laccaria bicolor gene expression in different tissues and with different host trees

ORGANISM
Laccaria bicolor S238N-H82

SUMMARY
Laccaria bicolor transcript profiles of different tissues and mycorrhizal root tips from different host trees were analyzed. The array probes were designed from gene models taken from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI, department of energy) Laccaria bicolor genome sequence version 1. One goal was to compare gene expression profiles from ectomycorrhizal root tips with different host plants.
