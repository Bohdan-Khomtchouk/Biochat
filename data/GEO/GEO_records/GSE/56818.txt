TITLE
Global transcriptional response of Clostridium difficile carrying the ϕCD38-2 prophage

ORGANISM
Clostridioides difficile

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to conduct a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of the C. difficile strain R20291 carrying the newly introduced ϕCD38-2 prophage. A total of 39 bacterial genes were differentially expressed in the R20291 lysogen, 26 of them being downregulated. Several of the regulated genes encode transcriptional regulators and PTS subunits involved in glucose, fructose and glucitol/sorbitol uptake and metabolism. Also of note, the presence of ϕCD38-2 upregulated the expression of a group of regulatory genes located in phi-027, a resident prophage common to most ribotype 027 isolates. The most differentially expressed gene was the conserved phase-variable cell wall protein CwpV, which was upregulated by about 20-fold in the lysogen. This is the first study describing the global response of C. difficile to the presence of a newly introduced prophage.

DESIGN
Two strains (WT and lysogen) were subjected for RNA-seq analysis with two biological replicates each.
