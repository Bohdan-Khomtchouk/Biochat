TITLE
The effect of sleep deprivation on gene expression in the brain and the liver of three inbred mouse strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These studies adress differential changes in gene expression between 6h sleep deprived and control mice in the brain and the liver. We profiled gene expression in three different inbred strains to understand the influence of genetic background. Keywords: brain, genetic background, sleep deprivation

DESIGN
Experiments were performed on male mice (C57BL/6J (B6), AKR/J (AK), DBA/2J (D2)), 12-13 weeks of aged, purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Animals were housed in a light/dark cycle of 24 hrs with water and food available ad libitum. Mice of the 3 inbred strains were sleep deprived for 6h starting at light onset (ZT0) and sacrificed together with their home-cage controls at ZT6 (n=9 / strain =3 / condition =2 / tissues =2; total = 108 mice).
