TITLE
ETS Family Transcriptional Regulators Drive Chromatin Dynamics and Malignancy in Squamous Cell Carcinomas (RNA-Seq II)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
After characterizing super-enhancer-associated chromatin dynamics accompanied by malignant progression of skin stem cells, we show that ETS family members auto-regulate themselves and a cohort of cancer-associated super-enhancer transcription factors which together are essential for tumor maintenance.

DESIGN
Epidermal basal stem cells from ETS2(T72D) super-activated epidermis and normal epidermis were FACS-prufied for RNA-sequencing.

PLATFORM
