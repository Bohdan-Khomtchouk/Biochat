TITLE
Transcriptome Sequencing (RNA-seq) of Normal Human Osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three normal human osteoblast samples, acquired from PromoCell, were used as controls to compare to RNA-seq data from prepublished osteosarcoma samples (submitted to the European Bioinformatics Institute; EGAS00001000263) for the purpose of evaluating expression levels of genes identified as common insertions sites in a Sleeping Beauty screen of osteosarcomas in mice.

DESIGN
Three normal human osteoblast samples (pellet form in RNAlater) were acquired from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany), and RNA was isolated from them immediately upon receipt.
