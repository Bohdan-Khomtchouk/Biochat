TITLE
Expression data to investigate Costello syndrome using human iPSCs differentiated into astroglial progenitors and astrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compare gene expression between three HRAS-wild type lines (13, 162d, 165d) and three HRAS-G12S mutant lines (7, 8, 16). Arrays were conducted in all lines from iPSC-derived astroglial progenitors at 8 weeks of differentiation, and in wild-type astrocyte lines at 28 weeks of differentiation.

DESIGN
Cells of the astroglial lineage were generated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Human 1.0 ST microarrays.  At each stage, cells were plated as a monolayer and treated with 10ng/ml of CNTF for one week before extraction.
