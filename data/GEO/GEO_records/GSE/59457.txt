TITLE
DNA methylation levels of various brain regions from HIV+ and HIV- subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiles of various human brain regions (cerebellum, occipital lobe, etc). The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 480,000 CpGs. The dataset includes 130 samples. Multiple brain regions were assessed per subject. The goal was to evaluate the effect of HIV infection on DNA methylation levels. Genome wide DNA methylation profiles of various brain regions from HIV positive and negative subjects. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 480,000 CpGs. Dataset included 130 samples: 99 samples from HIV+ subjects and 31 samples from HIV- subjects.

DESIGN
The Illumina Infinium450 platform was applied to various brain regions from HIV+ and HIV- subjects. We evaluated 130 brain samples from 84 different subjects. Specifically, we considered cerebellum (20 HIV+ samples and 4 controls), frontal lobe (2 cases, 4 controls), hippocampus (4 controls), medial frontal cortex (18 cases), occipital cortex (59 cases, 13 controls), temporal cortex (4 controls). In total, there were 99 samples from HIV+ subjects and 31 samples from HIV- controls of similar ages. The subjects were recruited from the National Neurological AIDS Bank study or Multicenter AIDS Cohort study in Los Angeles. Informed consent and all study procedures were approved by the UCLA Medical IRB. DNAm data from HIV+ cases and HIV- controls were generated at the same time and randomized across plates and chips. HIV viral load information was available for blood (measured at the last blood draw) and for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
