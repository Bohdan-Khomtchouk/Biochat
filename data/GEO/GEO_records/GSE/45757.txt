TITLE
Expression Data from 22 human pancreatic cancer cell lines grown in triplicates +/- MEK inhibitor CI-1040

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of mRNA profiles after MEK1/2 inhibition in human pancreatic cancer cell lines reveals pathways involved in drug sensitivity. We used microarrays to find gene expression patterns associated with drug response and also identified genes regulated by the MAP kinase pathway

DESIGN
22 pancreatic cell lines were grown in culture media containing serum and either treated with vehicle control or CI-1040 for 24 hours
