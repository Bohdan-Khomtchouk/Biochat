TITLE
Genes that mediate colorectal cancer liver metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study identifies a set of genes through functional selection in an orthotopic colorectal cancer mouse model that play an important role in mediating colorectal cancer liver metastasis. We look at the gene profiling of metastatic colorectal cancer cells (L1 and L2) and non-mestastatic colorectal cancer cells (sw620 and sw480) using Affymetrix U133A oligonucleotide arrays.

DESIGN
4 samples (each with triplicates) were analyzed. Genes with a fold-change â‰¥2 (P < 0.05) were selected.
