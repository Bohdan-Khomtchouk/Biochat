TITLE
Vibrio cholerae Expression Study

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
Question Addressed: What is the level of expression of genes in Vibrio cholerae recovered from various conditions.  These conditions include samples recovered directly from patients (O139 from stool samples from ICDDR,B and N16961 from stool samples from a vaccine trial held in Cincinnati) as well as standard logarithmic and stationary phase grown bacteria.   Labeling reactions were performed in duplicate for each stool derived and in quadruplicate for each in vitro grown strain.   A common reference was used for each slide, it was composed of RNA from the exponentially growing 92A1552 V. cholerae strain

DESIGN
transcription profiling by array
