TITLE
Circulating miRNA signature in serum of pateints with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and healthy controls.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from serum of pateints with PAS, CC and healthy controls. Global microRNA profiling was done using miRNome microRNA Profiler QuantiMir Human PCR Array (#RA660A-1, version 15; BioCat, Heidelberg, Germany)

DESIGN
miRNA arrays were performed on pooled RNA samples from six patients for PSC and CC each and a comparison was performed to healthy control patients. MiRNAs with Ct value above 32 were discarded.
