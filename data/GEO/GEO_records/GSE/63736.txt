TITLE
Genome wide binding sites of NF-κB subunits RelA, RelB, p50, and p52 in the Hodgkin lymphoma cell line L1236

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The malignant cells of Hodgkin's lymphoma are characterized by a constitutive activation of the canonical as well as the non-canonical NF-κB signaling cascades. We carried out genome-wide localization and expression profiling experiments in the Hodgkin lymphoma cell line L1236 for the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathway components p65, p50 and p52, RelB, respectively. We found that the single NF-κB subunits bind to overlapping, but distinct cistromes by using consensus motifs of high similarity.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq analysis of 4 NF-κB subunits with 2 biological replicates each
