TITLE
Gene expression profiling of AML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AML/MDS patients carrying 11q amplifications involving the mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) locus are characterized by a later onset, a complex aberrant karyotype (CAK) frequently including deletions within 5q, 17p and 7q, as well as fast progression of the disease with extremely poor prognosis. We and other have shown that the MLL gene is over expressed in amplified cases, however, in most of the cases the amplified region is not restricted to the MLL locus. In the present study we investigated 19 patients with AML/MDS and MLL gain/amplification [15 AML (two secondary, following MDS and PV, and three therapy related) and 4 MDS cases (two therapy related)]. By means of array CGH performed in 12 patients (GSE9928) we were able to delineate the minimal deleted regions within 5q, 17p and 7q and identified three independent regions 11q/I-III that were amplified in all cases. Gene expression profiles established in 15 cases were used to define the candidate genes within these regions. Interestingly, analysis of our data suggests an interdependency of genes influenced by losses of 5q and 17p and expression of genes present in 11q23-25. Additionally, we demonstrate that the gene expression signature can be used to discriminate AML/MDS with MLL amplification from all other types of AML, thus, indicating specific pathogenesis present in this entity. Keywords: AML patients, tumor stratification

DESIGN
In this study, gene expression profiling performed for 15 AML patients. aCGH analysis performed on 12 DNA samples derived from patients with AML, preselected for the presence of MLL amplifications, were analysed on a submegabase resolution BAC array. No replicates, no dye swap was done (GSE9928).
