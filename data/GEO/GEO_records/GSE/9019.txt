TITLE
Gene expression of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, in vivo with and without IgA 225.4

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
Rag1-/- C57BL/6  or Rag1-/- C57BL/6 injected with the IgA producing hybridoma producing 225.4 anti- Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Capsular polysaccharide 4 dependent carbohydrate epitope specific epitope) mice were colonized with B. thetaiotaomicron wildtype strain VPI-5482 for 10 days.  Cecal bacteria were harvested and snap frozen and RNA isolated. Keywords: Single time point, experimental and control groups.

DESIGN
There are 4 replicates of mice with no IgA (Rag1 - Rag 4) and 4 replicates of mice with the 225.4 IgA (Backpack1 -Backpack4)
