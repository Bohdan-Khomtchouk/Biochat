TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of cold adaptation in indigenous Siberian populations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Following the dispersal out of Africa, where hominins evolved in warm environments for millions of years, our species has colonised different climate zones of the world, including high latitudes and cold environments. The extent to which human habitation in (sub-)Arctic regions has been enabled by cultural buffering, short-term acclimatization and genetic adaptations is not clearly understood.  Present day indigenous populations of Siberia show a number of phenotypic features, such as increased basal metabolic rate, low serum lipid levels, increased blood pressure, short stature and broad skulls that have been attributed to adaptation to the extreme cold climate. We have genotyped 200 individuals from ten indigenous Siberian populations for 730,525 SNPs across the genome to identify genes and non-coding regions that have undergone unusually rapid allele frequency and  long-range haplotype homozygosity change in the recent past. At least three distinct population clusters could be identified among the Siberians, each of which showed a number of unique signals of selection. We present a list of cold adaption candidate genes that showed significant signals of positive selection with our strongest signals associated with genes involved in energy regulation and metabolism (CPT1A, LRP5, THADA) and vascular smooth muscle contraction (PRKG1). By employing a new method that paints phased chromosome chunks by their ancestry we distinguish local Siberian-specific long-range haplotype signals from those introduced by admixture.

DESIGN
200 blood samples from 200 Siberian individuals that come from ten different indigenous populations were genotypes for 730,525 SNPs across the genome.  Eighteen Vietnamese samples were also genotyped and used as reference samples.
