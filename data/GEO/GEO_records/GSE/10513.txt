TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles of PBMC Subsets in Acute GVHD Following Cord Blood Transplantation (IMS v.2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In comparison with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using other sources, umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) offers substantial clinical advantages including a lower incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) despite the use of allogeneic UCB stem cells with more disparate HLA.  However, detailed pathophysiology of acute GVHD developed after UCBT has not yet been clarified. Here, we examined the roles of inflammatory cells in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD following UCBT, by expression profiling of a total of 615 genes in each of 4 subsets (CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, and CD56+) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which were taken from 5 patients with hematologic malignancy, in whom acute GVHD had developed after UCBT.  By comparing expression profiles measured during acute GVHD with those measured upon discharge (recovery phase), for each subset of PBMCs, we identified immuno-regulatory genes which were assumed to be linked to the pathogenesis of acute GVHD. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, and CD56+ cell subsets were isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 5 patients with hematologic malignancy, in whom acute GVHD had developed after cord blood transplantation.  PBMCs were taken twice â€“ during acute GVHD phase and upon discharge (recovery phase), from each patient.  By using a custom-made fibrous oligonucleotide DNA microarray Genopal (Mitsubishi Rayon), we compared expression profiles of 615 unique genes measured during acute GVHD with those measured upon discharge (recovery phase), for each subset of PBMCs.
