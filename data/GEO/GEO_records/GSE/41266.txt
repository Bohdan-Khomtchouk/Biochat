TITLE
Comparative analysis between wild type and hap5-null mutant in response to rapamycin treatment

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
To identify the potential Hap5-regulated genes, we treated wild type cells and hap5 mutant cells with rapamycin and their corespondent transcriptional profiles were compared. Total 608 significant genes were identified. Among them, 343 genes are upregulated in hap5 mutant in repsonse to rapamycin while 265 genes are downregulated in comparison with the wild type.

DESIGN
Rapamycin induced gene expression in wild type and hap5-null mutant was measured after 4.5 h growth in YPD followed by 0.5 h of incubation in the presence of 0.2 ug/ml rapamycin.  Four independent experiments were performed for each strain.
