TITLE
Gene expression profile after TRPV4 knockdown in 3T3-F442A adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparing gene expression profile in 3T3-F442A adipocytes with shRNA against TRPV4 or GFP. TRPV4 is an ion channel expressed in adipocytes. Results provided information that how loss-of-function of TRPV4 affects gene expression in adipocytes.

DESIGN
4 samples were analyzed as two groups: shGFP (control) and shTRPV4 (experimental). Each group has two replicates.
