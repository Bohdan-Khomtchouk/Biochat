TITLE
Network analysis of gene expression in mice provides new evidence of involvement of the mTOR pathway in antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify potential candidate genes for future pharmacogenetic studies of antipsychotic (AP)-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), we used gene expression arrays to analyze changes induced by risperidone in mice strains with different susceptibility to EPS This study is a part of a convergent functional genomic approach that plans to integrate the data presented here with: data from gene expression analysis of neuroblastoma cell line under treatment with risperidone; and data from gene expression analysis of peripheral blood from first psychotic patients treated with risperidone.

DESIGN
Gene expression was assessed by microarray (Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Arrays MG 430 PM) in mice treated with risperidone 1mg/kg for three consecutive days
