TITLE
Expression data of the iPSCs derived from foreskin fibroblast cells of normal person and KS patient

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Klinefelterâ€™s Syndrome (KS) is one of the common chromosome aneuploidy diseases in males with unexplained physiological mechanism. iPSCs, are similar to ESCs in terms of indefinitive self-renewal and pluripotency, provided an alternative choice for modeling disease to facilitate the disease research in vitro. We used microarray to detect the global reprogramming of KS and normal fibroblast cells to iPSCs. Also we used microarray to explore the possible molecular varieties between KS patient and normal person in the early development.

DESIGN
Fibroblast cells from both normal person and KS patient were reprogrammed into iPSCs by ectopic expression of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC. The expression profiles of normal and KS fibroblast cells, a line of normal iPSCs and two lines of KS iPSCs as well as a line of human ESCs were detected.
