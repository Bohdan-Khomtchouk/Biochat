TITLE
Expression data from regulatory T cells with Stat3 ablation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression dependent upon Stat3 in regulatory T cells

DESIGN
Regulatory T cells isolated from Foxp3 < Cre/wtS > Stat3 < fl/wt > or Foxp3 < Cre/wt > Stat3 < fl/fl > were isolated using FACS based sorting followed by RNA extraction, amplification, labeling and hybridization on Affymatrix Microarray

PLATFORM
