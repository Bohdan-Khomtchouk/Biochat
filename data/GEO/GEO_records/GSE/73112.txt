TITLE
Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase regulates peripheral B cell receptor revision, polyreactivity and B1 cells in lupus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FAAH expresson is induced in Sle2 splenic B cells. Increased peripheral B cell receptor revision, or selective peripheral expansion of BCR-revised B-cells, may lead to systemic autoimmunity, and FAAH is a lupus susceptibility gene that could regulate this process in Sle2 mice.

DESIGN
To determine the gene expression profile in peripheral B cells from Sle2 mice (compared to B6 mice), we isolated splenic B cells from these two strains of mice, extracted the total mRNA and performed the microarray analysis Please note that Sle2 mouse is a congenic strain that harbors the Sle2 locus from Chromosome 4 of NZM2410 strain in a B6 background and Sle2 is the name of the lupus susceptibility locus.
