TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq of ten-thousand epithelium cells from the mammary glands of mice in puberty, estrus and diestrus phases

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epithelial cells were isolated by FACS from the mammary glands of pubescent (5 week old), estrus adult (10 week old) and diestrus adult (10 week old) female mice. Freshly sorted cells were submitted to a 10X Genomics Chromium System for single cell capture. cDNA synthesis and library preparation was done according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer to achieve 75 bp paired-end reads.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling was completed for 5387 total epithelial cells from pubescent (5 week old) mice, 2729 total epithelial cells from adult (10 week old) mice in the estrus phase, and 2439 total epithelial cells from adult (10 week old) mice in the diestrus phase.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
