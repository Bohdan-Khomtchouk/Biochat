TITLE
DNA profiling of serous ovarian and Fallopian tube carcinomas with array CGH and MLPA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary serous ovarian carcinoma (OVCA) and serous Fallopian tube carcinoma (FTC), both belonging to the BRCA-linked tumour spectrum, share many properties and are treated similarly. However, a detailed molecular comparison has been lacking. We hypothesized that comparative genomic studies of serous OVCAs and FTCs should point to gene regions critically involved in their tumorigenesis. Array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) analysis indicated that serous OVCAs and serous FTCs displayed common but also more distinctive patterns of recurrent changes. Targeted gene identification using a dedicated multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) probe set directly identified EIF2C2 on 8q as a potentially important driver gene. Other previously unappreciated gained/amplified genes included PSMB4 on 1q, MTSS1 on 8q, TEAD4 and TSPAN9 on 12p, and BCAS4 on 20q. SPINT2 and ACTN4 on 19q were predominantly found in FTCs. Gains/amplifications of CCNE1 and MYC, often in conjunction with changes in genes of the AKT pathway, EVI1 and PTK2, seemed to be involved at earlier stages, whereas changes of ERBB2 were associated with advanced stages. The only BRCA1-mutated FTC shared common denominators with the sporadic tumours. In conclusion, the data suggest that serous OVCAs and FTCs, although related, exhibit differences in genomic profiles. In addition to known pathways, new genes/pathways are likely to be involved, with changes in an miRNA-associated gene, EIF2C2, as one important new feature. Dedicated MLPA sets constitute potentially important tools for differential diagnosis and may provide footholds for tailored therapy. This study also includes 13 of the 14 Fallopian tube carcinoma samples T10112, T10119, T10116, T10118, T10121, T10129, T10109, T10125, T10117, T10126, T10102c, T10107, T10131a (i.e., GSM172360..GSM172530) in Series GSE7180.
