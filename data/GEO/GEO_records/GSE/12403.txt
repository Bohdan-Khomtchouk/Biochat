TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis seed compartments at the linear-cotyledon stage

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We collected linear-cotyledon stage seed compartments from 5 to 7 micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments from seeds containing linear-coyledon-stage embryos. For the purposes of this study we captured 7 compartments: embyro proper, cellularized endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat, general seed coat, whole seeds and micropylar endosperm.
