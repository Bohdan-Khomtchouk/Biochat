TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis seed compartments at the linear-cotyledon stage

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We collected linear-cotyledon stage seed compartments from 5 to 7 micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments from seeds containing linear-coyledon-stage embryos. For the purposes of this study we captured 7 compartments: embyro proper, cellularized endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat, general seed coat, whole seeds and micropylar endosperm.

DESIGN
linear-cotyledon stage seed compartments were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 14 samples (embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, cellularized endosperm, general seed coat, chalazal seed coat, whole seeds and micropylar endosperm, 2 biological replicates each).
