TITLE
Comparison of the gene expression profiles of different strains of A. baumannii by microarrays

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter baumannii

SUMMARY
In the present work we compare the gene expression profile of A. baumannii and a mutant knock-out strain of A. baumannii lacking a small RNA gene 13573 and the corresponding small RNA 13573 over-producing strain. The main objective is to recognize the main pathways in which the small RNA 13573 is involved. Moreover, the same wild type strain was used to infect mice and was further analyzed after the infection with the aim of finding genes differentially expressed in vivo.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates have been performed for each comparison. The RNA collection from Acinetobacter baumannii strain over-expresing the small RNA (sample 13573) was compared with this isolated from A. baumannii harboring the empty vector (PETRA sample) while gene expression in the knock-out strain (KO sample) was compared with the wild type strain Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 (ATCC sample). The RNA from A.baumannii recovered from the infected animals (INF sample) was compared with the wild type (ATCC).
