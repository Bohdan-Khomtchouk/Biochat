TITLE
Foxp3 ablation in peripheral mature regulatory T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Foxp3 ablated peripheral regulatory T cells. Regulatory T cells require the expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 for thymic development. It is not known whether continuous expression of Foxp3 is required for the maintained function of mature regulatory T cells in the periphery. Results indicate changes to the regulatory T cell developmental program in the absence of Foxp3. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Compare Cre recombinase treated peripheral regulatory T cells possessing a Cre sensitive Foxp3 locus to Cre treated regulatory T cells with a wild type Foxp3 locus. Cre exposure is observed via the Cre sensitive expression of the yellow flourescent protein molecule.
