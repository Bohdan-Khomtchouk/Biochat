TITLE
MicroRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression in the response of rice plants to fungal elicitors [degradome]

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Elicitor-responsive miRNAs and their targets in rice

DESIGN
Rice small RNA profiling in two tissues (leaf and root) and two time points (30 minutes and 2 hours) of elicitor treatment (Margaporthe oryzae). Three replicates of each condition.
