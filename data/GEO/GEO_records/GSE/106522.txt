TITLE
HUH VP30 cells with and without interferon α and β treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain HUH VP30 samples for mRNA analysis with and with out interferon α and β treatment.   Huh VP30 cells have been stably transfected with the Ebola VP30 gene, enabling replication of VP30-deficient Ebola virus. PubMed ID 18212124  and 19211761.

DESIGN
Treatments were initiated by replacing culture medium (containing 10% FBS) with fresh medium containing 250 U/ml of human interferon α and 250 U/ml of human interferon β(PBL Biosciences) with a multiplicity of 5 PFU per cell.  Mock-treated cells were given normal culture medium only.  Mock and treated cells were incubated at 37°C until sample collection time points of 6, 12, and 18 hours.  MERSCOV003.0P references the write up of the experimental procedure.
