ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Compared the effects of Estrogen and its analog Genistein on mouse thymus. Endogenous estrogen were minimized by removal of ovaries. Samples were collected at 4 time points: 0 days, 2 days, 3 days and 6 days from the start of the treatment. Two biological replicates at each time point. Keywords: comparison of hormone and its analog; Time course

DESIGN
Control samples were from the mice that were untreated and at 0 day since treatment. Two treatments (Estrogen injection and Genistein diet) and three time points. Two replicated samples at each time point and each treatment. Total 14 samples.
