TITLE
Evaluation of the whole genome amplification of bisulfite modified DNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared genom-wide DNA methylation profiles between whole genome amplified bisufite-modified DNA and non-amplified DNA.

DESIGN
3 samples were bisulfite-converted, non-amplified DNA (technical triplicate). 6 samples were amplified with EpiTectÂ® Whole Bisulfitome from 10ng or 50ng of bisulfite-converted DNA. All samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
