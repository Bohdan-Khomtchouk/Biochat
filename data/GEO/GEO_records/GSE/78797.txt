TITLE
Expression data from the mouse ES cell-derived differentiated cells treated with or without MPA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mycophenolic acid (MPA), effectively promoted ES cell pancreatic differentiation with a concomitant reduction of neuronal cells. The targets of MPA were investigated by microarray analysis of cells treated on day 5 with MPA and harvested on day 6 and 8.

DESIGN
Cells were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We performed gene expression profiles of differentiated mouse ES cells treated with or without 2 microM MPA at day5, 6, and 8
