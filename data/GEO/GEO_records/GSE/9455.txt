TITLE
Pre-treatment expression data from patients recruited to the paclitaxel arm of the CTCR-OV01 study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
All patients with suspected ovarian cancer (Raised CA 125 and a complex pelvic mass in a perimenopausal woman) were radiologically staged using CT scan and a chest x-ray. Patients with evidence of intra-abdominal metastasis and/or malignant pleural effusion were approached for entry to the study. Tissue biopsy was obtained either under radiological control (core needle biopsy) or via laparoscopic surgery (punch biopsy). Patients with histologicaly confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer were randomized to receive either three cycles of carboplatin (AUC 7) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2). Following data filtering, only 3426 genes were retained for further downstream analysis (see 'Data_after_filtering.txt' at the foot of this record).  For data filtering details, please see the 'Data processing' field in any of the associated Sample records. Keywords: Prospective Randomized trial

DESIGN
Patients with suspected ovarian cancer had a biopsy obtained before the start of treatment. Each sample was divided into two; one for histological confirmation and the other was immediately frozen for RNA extraction.
