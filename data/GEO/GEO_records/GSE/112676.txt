TITLE
Whole blood transcriptome analysis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a biomarker study [HT12_V3]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome-wide analysis of whole blood gene expression profiles of ALS patients, gender- and age-matched controls and patients diagnosed with diseases mimicking ALS at a tertiary referral center for motor neuron diseases.

DESIGN
mRNA was obtained from whole blood around the time of diagnosis and expression profiles were compared between ALS patients, controls and mimics in a biomarker design.

PLATFORM
