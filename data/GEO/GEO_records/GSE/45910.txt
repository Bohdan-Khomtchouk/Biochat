TITLE
Apparently Balanced Chromosomal Rearrangements (BCRs) as a model for random mutagenesis in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcribed regions in adult temporal lobe, hippocampus and frontal lobe were assesed by strand specific next generation sequencing of polyA RNA.

DESIGN
Strand specific mRNA expression profiles of three human adult brain regions were generated by next generation sequencing using Illumina GAIIx
