TITLE
Transcriptome inheritance of a citrus somatic hybrid

ORGANISM
Citrus

SUMMARY
The main objective of the present study was to analyze whether the novel phenotype of this complex three-way tetraploid interspecific hybrid, displaying mixed dominant, codominant and transgressive traits is associated with non additive expression of the two diploid parental genomes. Keywords: Comparative transcriptomic hybridization
