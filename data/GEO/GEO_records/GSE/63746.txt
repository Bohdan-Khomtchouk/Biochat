TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of fatty acid synthase (FASN) gene silenced retinoblastoma cancer cells (WERI RB1) using cDNA microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fatty acid synthase is a major enzyme involved in de novo lipogenesis and associated with tumor invasion and poor prognosis. The effect of fatty acid synthase knockdown in retinoblastoma cancer cells (WERI RB1) using siRNA mediated gene silencing were accessed for global gene deregulations. The analysis resulted in RB cancer cell death through deregulations of various cell signalling, metabolic, immunity, angiogenesis, apoptosis and cell cycle pathway related genes. Further validations were done using qRT-PCR and western analysis. Our results provide evidence that blockade in lipid metabolism inturn lead to RB cancer cell death through impaired cell signalling pathway.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the WERI RB1 cells transfected with FASN siRNA at 48h, along with its untransfected control cells. cDNA converted samples were run on microarray platform- Illuminaâ€™s HumanHT-12_V4_0_R2 BeadChips

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
