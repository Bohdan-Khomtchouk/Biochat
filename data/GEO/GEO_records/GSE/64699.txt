TITLE
Acyl-CoA synthetase 1 in differentiated adipocytes from small for gestational age neonates: Putative association with fetal programming of cellular insulin sensitivity and lipid content [Set1B: adipogenesis data from year 2012]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesised that SGA as a proxy for intrauterine growth restriction promotes specific epigenetic marks and pathways, whose physiological implications may become apparent only in the fully differentiated state. We established primary UC-MSC lines isolated from SGA and normal neonates and differentiated them into mature adipocytes.

DESIGN
Samples were collected from umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC). A sample from each SGA (MSC-01) and control group (MSC-44).
