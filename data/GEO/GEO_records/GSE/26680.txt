TITLE
ChIP-Seq data for REST, MCAF1, Ring1b and H4K20me3 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Multiple protein complexes and histone marks have been implicated and/or associated with gene repression in ES cells. To gain insights into repressive complexes present at repressed genes and their associated chromatin state, we profiled REST, MCAF1, Ring1b and H4K20me3 in mouse ES cells.

DESIGN
DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. ChIP was performed using an antibody against REST, MCAF1, Ring1b and H4K20me3.
