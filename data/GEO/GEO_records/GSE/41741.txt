TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of CTCF binding sites in lymphocyte subsets [pro-B cells]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we compare the binding pattern of CTCF at the T  cell receptor alpha locus in different subsets of developing lymphocytes

DESIGN
For the ChIP-seq, input and immunoprecipitated DNA was given to The Scripps DNA Array Facility, where it was prepared for massively parallel sequencing on Illumina Hi-Seq.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
