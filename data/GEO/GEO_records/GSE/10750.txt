TITLE
Overexpression of the transcription factor GAT201 in Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (serotype A, H99)

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptional profiles of WT Cryptococcus neoformans (H99) and strain CM126 (pRPL2b-GAT201) which overexpresses the transcription factor GAT201 using a ribosomal protein promoter Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
WT vs. CM126 competitive hybridization.  4 biological replicates including 2 dye flips.  Cultures grown at 37 degress Celsius in minimal (YNB) medium.  Cultures independently grown and harvested during exponential growth.
