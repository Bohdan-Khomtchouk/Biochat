TITLE
Effect of lin-28 and lin-46 on miRNA profile in late L1 stage Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Comparison of miRNA profiles of wildtype and lin-28(n719); lin-46(ma164) Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes at the L1 stage

DESIGN
Two genotypes, wildtype vs. mutant. Biological replicates: 3 wild type, 3 mutant, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per slide.
