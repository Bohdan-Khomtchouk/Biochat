TITLE
Expression data for mouse embryogenesis from oocyte to newborn

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Studies in mouse have led to enormous progress in our understanding of early human development. The identification of genes and the signaling pathways involved in mouse embryogenesis have helped us to better understand fertilization, morulation, gastrulation, organogenesis and embryonic development in mammals. We report a detailed analysis of the global gene expression profiles from oocyte to the end of organogenesis in mouse. Our studies revealed distinct temporal regulation patterns for genes belonging to different functional categories, supporting their roles during organogenesis.

DESIGN
Mouse embryos were selected at successive stage for for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of embryos at each developmental stage in order to increase the temporal resolution of expression profiles. To that end, we hand-selected embryos according to morphological criteria at 12 time-points from embryos to newborn
