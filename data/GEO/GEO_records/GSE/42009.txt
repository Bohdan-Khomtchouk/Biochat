TITLE
Chromatin In Situ Proximity (ChrISP): Single-cell analysis of chromatin proximities at a high resolution

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Current techniques analysing chromatin structures are hampered by either poor resolution of individual cells or high resolution in only large cell populations. Here we describe a new method, ChrISP,which reproducibly scores for chromatin fiber proximities in 3D in single cells with a resolution of < 170 A. Moreover, ChrISP visualizes higher order structures of individual chromosomes in relation to structural hallmarks of interphase nuclei beyond the resolution of the light microscope.

DESIGN
Mapping of " unique " (chromosome territory) and " repeated " (COT1) dna used in ChrISP to asses its composition
