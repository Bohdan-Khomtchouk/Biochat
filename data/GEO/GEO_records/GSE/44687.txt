TITLE
A. borkumensis cells: control vs. 1-octanol-stressed cells

ORGANISM
Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Alcanivorax borkumensis cells, grown on either pyruvate or hexadecane as carbon source, that were stressed with 1- octanol. The gene expression was measured 15 min, 30 min, 60 min and 90 min after 1-octanol addition.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 1-octanol-stressed vs. unstressed cells; different time points were investigated after 1-octanol was spiked in (15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min); for each condition 3 replicates were used, for the control condition 4 replicates (pyruvate cultures) and 3 replicates (hexadecane cultures) were used for analysis
