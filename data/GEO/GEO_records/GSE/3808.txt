TITLE
Complete embryonic metanephric kidney analysis of wild type and Hoxa11, Hoxd11 null targeted mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Complete (whole) embryonic kidneys were dissected from wild type and Hoxa11, Hoxd11 compound null embryons throughout development.  Targets from two biological replicates of each were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix MOE430A and MOE430B arrays.  Comparisons between normal and mutant and comparisons of development samples identified global patterns of gene regulation in kidney development Keywords: embryonic metanephric kidney, kidney development, Hoxa11, Hoxd11, compound null targeted mice

DESIGN
Embryonic metanephric kidney samples throughout development were analyzed based on normalization to adult kidney samples.  In addition, Hoxa11, Hoxd11 compound null embronic kidneys were normalized to wild type embryonic controls.  All developmental and adult stages were represented in biological (seperate embryo/animal replicate)
