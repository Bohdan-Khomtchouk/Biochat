TITLE
Tissue macrophage subsets derived from regenerating muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Muscle injury was elicited by cardiotoxin injection into the tibialis anterior muscle. Macrophages were isolated 2 days post-injury from the regenerating muscle. We used microarray to obtain global gene expression data of muscle-derived tissue macrophage subsets.

DESIGN
Tissue macrophages were collected from regenerating muscle samples of three animals, Ly6C+ F4/80low and Ly6C- F4/80high macrophage subsets were sorted. The global gene expression patterns of distinct macrophage subsets were analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays.
