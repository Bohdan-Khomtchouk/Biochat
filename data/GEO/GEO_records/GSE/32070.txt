TITLE
Aberrant Regulation of HDAC2 Mediates Proliferation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells by Deregulating Expression of G1/S Cell Cycle Proteins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the specific roles of HDAC2 in the development of liver cancer, we employed large-scale gene expression analysis to identify the molecular signature that may affect enabling characteristics of cancer cells. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed on the Hep3B cells transfected with HDAC2 shRNAs, and recapitulated molecular signatures that related to hallmarks of cancer.

DESIGN
With the aim of identifying changes in gene expression following gene knockdown of HDAC2, we performed expression profiling in shRNA expression vector-transfected Hep3B cells, and compared the results to those obtained from vector-transfected Hep3B cells.
