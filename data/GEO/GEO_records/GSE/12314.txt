TITLE
Storage Protein Suppression in Transgenic Soybean Cotyledons

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Suppression of both endogenous storage proteins in soybean cotyledons was accomplished by RNAi.  Microarray analysis was used to compare 3 samples, 1 nontransgenic control, 2 transgenic biological replicates.

DESIGN
3 samples.  Each sample had 2 technical replicates. 1. Control, nontransgenic 2. RNAi transgenic for storage protein suppression 3. Second RNAi transgenic for storage protein suppression, independent line from the first sample
