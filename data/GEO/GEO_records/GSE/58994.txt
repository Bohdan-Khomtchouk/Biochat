TITLE
Expression data from primary human leukocytes (peropheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC) cultured in vitro with HIV-1MN, HIV-2NIH-Z, CpG-A ODN or media alone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV-1 and HIV-2 can both infect humans, but HIV-2 causes a slow progressing disease and is well controlled by the immune system for prolonged period of times. Here we tested acute response aainst HIV-1 and HIV-2 exposure in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from three indepednent donors.

DESIGN
A total of 24 samples were analyzed. PBMC from three donors were cultured with Media alone, HIV-1MN, HIV-2NIH-Z or the TLR9 agonist CpG-A (4 conditions), and cells were harvested at 6h and 12h (2time points) for RNA extraction.
