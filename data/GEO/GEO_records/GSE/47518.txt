TITLE
Identification of s-RNYs targets in bone marrow-derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were collected from 4 C57BL/6J males and transfected with siRNAs against the terminal loop of mouse RNYs and control. 48 hr after transfection, the total RNA was isolated by using RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) and mRNA profiling was performed on Agilent Sureprint whole genomemicroarrays. The normalized data were analyzed with Biometric Research Branch (BRB) array tools 3.8.0. Log2-transformed signal intensities were used to identify probes with at least 1.2 fold change of expression difference between BMDMs overexpressing s-RNYs and control, and with a statistically significant p-value (p < 0.05).

DESIGN
One color design, corresponding to 2 conditions performed on 4 mice: siRNA against terminal loop of RNY versus Control (Ct) siRNA for a total of 8 samples.
