Temporal Changes in MicroRNA Expression in Blood Leukocytes from Patients with the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
MicroRNA (miRNA) control gene transcription by binding to and repressing the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA). Their role in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is undefined. Blood leukocytes from 51 patients enrolled in a prior randomized trial of corticosteroids for ARDS were analyzed. After screening eight patients with microarrays for increased miRNA expression, 25 miRNAs were selected for further analysis using RT-PCR in all 51 patients on days 0, 3 and 7.
