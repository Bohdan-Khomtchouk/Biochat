TITLE
Low H3K27me3  define poorly prognostic pediatric posterior fossa ependymomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A subgroup of  Posterior fossa ependymomas show reduced H3K27me3 are more invasive, exhibit poor prognosis and epigenetically deregulated genes converge on radial glial factors, suggesting developing cerebellar radial glia as candidate cells-of-origin.

DESIGN
H3K27me3 ChIP sequencing was performed on 3 posterior fossa (PF) and 3 supratentorial (ST) ependymoma samples. 3 PF ependmoma samples showed low H3K27me3 and designated PF_H3K27me3-ve; all 3 ST ependymoma samples show high H3K27me3 and desginated ST_H3K27me3+ve

PLATFORM
