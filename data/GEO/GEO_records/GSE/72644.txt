TITLE
Mapping alterations spatially and temporally during early stages of breast tumourigenesis [expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identifying genomic alterations that precede tumourigenesis of breast tumours will allow us to better understand tumour development and heterogeneity. In particular, by obtaining and profiling normal-epithelium samples at various distances from the tumour, we can draft both a spatial and temporal map of the genomic events and transcriptomic alterations that occur along the mammary duct (leading up to and including the tumour).

DESIGN
Dataset consisting of 9 patients with breast cancer, from which multiple normal epithelium samples were obtained from along the duct leading to the tumour,  one sample from the contralateral duct, and a sample from the tumor itself

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
