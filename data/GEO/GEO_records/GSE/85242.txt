TITLE
Gene expression profile of doxycycline inducible shHNF4G hairpins in 22RV1 prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine genes regulated by HNF4G, we performed doxycycline induced shRNA mediated knockdown of HNF4G using two lentiviral constructs as well as a scrambled shRNA in duplicate. Two pLKO.1 constructs against HNF4G (HNF4Gsh1: TRCN0000019243,  targeting CACCAGCATCTCTCCAAACAA in coding DNA sequence (CDS); and HNF4Gsh2: TRCN0000420190, targeting GATGAGCTGGTTAGACCATTTC in CDS) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich MISSIONÂ® shRNA Plasmid DNA and pLKO.1 shScr (targeting CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCG) was purchased from Addgene.  RNA was harvested 3 days after doxycycline treatment and gene expression profiling was performed.

DESIGN
22Rv1 sublines expressing doxycycline inducible hairpins against HNF4G (HNF4Gsh1 and HNF4Gsh2) and SCR control were treated with doxycycline or vehicle for three days after which cells were harvested for gene expression analysis.
