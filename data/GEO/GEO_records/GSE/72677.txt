TITLE
Condensins are integrated into epigenetic regulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Condensins are essential for global chromosome organization in diverse bacteria. Atypically, Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes two condensins, SMC-ScpAB and the unconventional MksBEF. We report that the two proteins indeed act as condensins but have distinct localization patterns and physiological functions. Inactivation of SMC and MksB results, respectively, in growth defects and impaired biofilm formation. Transcriptional signatures of condensin mutants revealed changes in several epigenetically controlled regulons including those involved in infection. Based on their phenotypes and expression profiles, ΔmksB cells resemble planktonic cells during acute infection whereas Δsmc cells appear locked in their chronic infection form. Accordingly, condensin mutants showed reduced virulence in a mouse model of lung infection. ATPase mutations in SMC recapitulated many of its phenotypes indicating that they require function of the protein, not only DNA binding. Thus, condensins mediate a novel link between global chromosome organization and epigenetic regulation in P. aeruginosa and can regulate epigenetic switching.
