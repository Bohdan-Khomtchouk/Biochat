TITLE
Expression data of multiple sclerosis patients receiving subcutaneous Interferon-beta-1a therapy [U133 Plus 2.0]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to characterize the transcriptional effects induced by subcutaneous IFN-beta-1a treatment (Rebif, 22 µg or 44 µg three times a week) in patients with relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis (MS). By using Affymetrix DNA microarrays, we obtained genome-wide expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 12 MS patients within the first two years of IFN-beta administration.

DESIGN
EDTA blood samples were taken from all patients immediately before first and second IFN-beta injection as well as after 1 month, 1 year and 2 years. Total RNA of Ficoll-isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from each sample was extracted, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays to quantify the mRNA levels. This GEO entry provides the U133 Plus 2.0 microarray data.
