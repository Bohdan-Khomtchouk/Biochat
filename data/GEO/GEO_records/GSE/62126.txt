TITLE
Gene expression analysis of EpH4 cell monolayers following TGF-β3 treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
EpH4 cell monolayers were treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β3 or vehicle for 24 hours. The experiment was performed three independent times, with 3 wells per condition in each experiment. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
Each sample represents pooled RNA from three wells of a single experiments. N=3 experiments. Gene expression was analyzed using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.1 ST Array Strips and the GeneAtlas System.

PLATFORM
GPL11537 [MoGene-1_1-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.1 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
