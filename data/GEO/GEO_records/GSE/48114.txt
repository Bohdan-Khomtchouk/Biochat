TITLE
Pre-mRNA splicing factor atsf1-2 mutant seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of atsf1-2 mutant seedlings for pre-mRNA splicing defect.  The atsf1-2 mutant is a homozygous T-DNA insertion line isolated from a SALK line, SALK_062177.  Results identify transcripts with altered alternative splicing pattern in the atsf1-2 mutant. We used microarrays to examine the transcriptome profile in the atsf1-2 mutant and identified genes of  which transcript levels were changed significantly.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 9 days under long day condition.  They were then used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix ATH1 Genome Array.  Three replicates for Col-0 (control) and atsf1-2 (mutant) were compared respectively.
