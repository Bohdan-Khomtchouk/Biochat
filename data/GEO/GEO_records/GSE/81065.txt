TITLE
The innate immune protein calprotectin promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus interaction

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine the impact of metal deprivation (such as the metal deprivation induced by calprotectin treatment) on the physiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa under multiple growth conditions. The RNA-seq analysis was designed to reveal the impact of calprotectin treatment on P. aeruginosa physiology during planktonic growth.

DESIGN
Six samples total were analyzed. Three were control replicates that had been treated only with the buffer used to suspend the recombinant calprotectin protein. The remaining three were replicate samples treated with 0.25 mg/mL calprotectin. All samples were grown for 18 hours under aerobic growth conditions.
