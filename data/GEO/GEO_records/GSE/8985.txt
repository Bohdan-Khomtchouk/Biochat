TITLE
Effect of hfq-deletion on Salmonella transcriptome

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
The expression profile of an S. Typhimurium hfq mutant-strain was compared to the parental strain under 2 different growth conditions; early stationary phase and SPI-1 (Salmonella pathogenicity island 1) inducing condition. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
This study comprises two separate experiments performed under different growth conditions, were the gene expression profile was compared to that of the parental strain. Three biological replicates were performed for each strain and condition. For this study, we used Salmonella genomic DNA as the comparator which also acted as the control for spot quality.
