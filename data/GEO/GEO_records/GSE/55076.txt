TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression changes accompanied with up-regulation of GATA1 in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of hematopoietic stem/progenitors from GATA-1-GFP transgenic mouse bone marrow at gene expression level. Results provide changes in gene expression pattern accompanied with up-regulation of GATA-1 transcription factor at early stage of murine adult hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
RNA samples obtained from isolated GATA1+LSK and other hemaopoietic stem/progenitor populations including GATA1-LSK, LMPP, CMP and LT-HSC were subjected to mRNA amplification and cDNA microarray analysis.
