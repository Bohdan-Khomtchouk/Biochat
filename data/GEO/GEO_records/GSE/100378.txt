TITLE
Shared αβ T Cell Receptor Usage in Lungs of Sarcoidosis Patients with Löfgren’s Syndrome [iRepertoire]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expansions of CD4+ T cells utilizing TRAV12-1 and TRBV2 were found exclusively in HLA-DR3+ LS patients. These TCRs shared CDR3 homology, suggesting that these T cells are responsible for recognizing sarcoidosis-associated antigen(s) and are involved in the local alveolitis.

DESIGN
Analysis of TCR sequences from 13 sarcoidosis and 3 control patient blood and/or lung samples.
