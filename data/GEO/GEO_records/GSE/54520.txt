TITLE
ChIP-Seq analysis of HNF4A and FOXA2 in embryonic mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HNF4a and FOXA2 are two liver enriched transcription factors that have been shown capable of reprogramming fibroblasts into hepatocyte-like cells. However to date it is not yet understood how these master regulators, expressed in both embryonic and adult liver contribute to the transcriptional changes necessary for hepatocyte maturation during development. Consequently we undertook to identify binding sites and target genes for HNF4a and FOXA2 in the embryonic liver. A comparison of embryonic and adult liver TF binding patterns revealed widespread differentiation-dependent genome occupancy associated with changes in target gene expression during liver development.

DESIGN
Examination of HNF4a and FOXA2 binding sites in hepatoblasts purfied from embryonic liver (E14.5).
