TITLE
Multiple levels of gene regulation mediate differentiation of the intracellular pathogen Leishmania

ORGANISM
Leishmania donovani

SUMMARY
Whole genome high density tiliing array of eight timepoints from the promastitgote to amastigote differentiation process.

DESIGN
RNA from two independent biological replicates from eight points in the promastigote to amastigote differentiation process were hybridized to Nimblegen arrays (Madison,WI USA) that contained 10 probes per open reading frame and 3 probes per structural RNA spotted three times per array.  The microarray probes were designed to Leishmania infantum strain JCPM5 and the sample RNA was obtained from Leishmania donovani strain S1.  The two species are thought to be nearly identical at the nucleotide level, however whole-genome sequence was not available from L. donovani.
