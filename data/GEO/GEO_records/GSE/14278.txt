TITLE
Comparison of CD4+ T cell function between HIV-1 resistant and HIV-1 susceptible individuals (Affymetrix)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding why some indidivual resist HIV-1 infection despite continued exposure is an important goal for vaccine development. We compared CD4+ T cell gene expression at baseline in HIV-1 resistant commercial sex-workers from Nairobi, Kenya to HIV-1 high-risk negative (non-resistant) commercial sex-workers using gene expression arrays Keywords: Case-control, disease state analysis

DESIGN
CD4+ T cells from both HIV resistant and HIV low-risk negative individuals were isolated from PBMC after 24 hours of culture by negative slelction. Total RNA was isolated and gene expression compared using Affymetrix total genome arrays.
