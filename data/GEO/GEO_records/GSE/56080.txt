TITLE
Orphan Nuclear Receptor ERRγ is required for pancreatic islet beta-cell maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We characterized the effect of loss of ERRγ expression in mouse pancreatic islets using adenoviral constructs.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from Ad-EGFP or Ad-Cre infected pancreatic islets from ERRγfl/fl mice. Gene expression profiles were compared between the wild-type control (Ad-EGFP) and ERRγKO (Ad-Cre) islets.
