TITLE
Gene expression of TCR-alpha/beta CD4- CD8- human T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The origin and function of human double negative (DN) TCR-alpha/beta T cells is unknown.  They are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus because they expand and accumulate in inflamed organs.  Here we provide evidence that human TCR-alpha/beta CD4- CD8- DN T cells derive exclusively from activated CD8+ T cells.  Freshly isolated TCR-alpha/beta DN T cells display a distinct gene expression and cytokine production profile.  DN cells isolated from peripheral blood as well as DN cells derived in vitro from CD8+ T cells, produce a defined array of pro-inflammatory mediators that includes IL-1, IL-17, IFN-gama, CXCL3, and CXCL2.  These results indicate that, upon activation, CD8+ T cells have the capacity to acquire a distinct phenotype that grants them inflammatory capacity.

DESIGN
TCR-alpha-beta+ CD25- T cells from healthy human individuals were sorted into CD4+, CD8+, and CD4-CD8- T cells. Cell lysis and RNA extraction was performed immediately.  RNA from each cell subset was pooled.
