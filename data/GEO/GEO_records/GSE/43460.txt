TITLE
Estrogen Induced DNA Methylation Changes in Mouse Hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Estrogen, specifically estradiol, has been shown to mediate DNA methylation changes at mutiple locations downstream of estrogen response elements (EREs). We identified differentially methylated regions associated with long-term estradiol exposure in the hippocampus of C57BL/6J mice.

DESIGN
Hippocampus was collected from ovariectomized (OVX) C57BL/6J mice treated with estradiol (n=5) and vehicle controls (n=5). Genomic DNA was extracted and treated with methylation sensitive restriction enzymes HpaII and HinP1I to enrich for the unmethylated fraction. This fraction was interrogated using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ®  Mouse Tiling Promoter 1.0R Array
