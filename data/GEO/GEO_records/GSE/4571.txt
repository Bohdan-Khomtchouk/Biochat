TITLE
Expression profiling of Treg cell versus their controls in human and mouse

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied Affymetrix GeneChip technology for expression profiling of CD4+CD25+ (Treg) T cells versus their naive CD4+CD25- controls to obtain more information about the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in Treg specific immune suppression Keywords: cell type comparison
