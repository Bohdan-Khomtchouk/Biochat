TITLE
Expression profiling of Treg cell versus their controls in human and mouse

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We applied Affymetrix GeneChip technology for expression profiling of CD4+CD25+ (Treg) T cells versus their naive CD4+CD25- controls to obtain more information about the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in Treg specific immune suppression Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Expression profiles from: [1] human Treg cells obtained from peripheral blood by cell sorting were compared to their naive controls.  RNAs were prepared from pools of ten individual healthy donors, labeled in two independend labeling reactions and hybridized onto two GeneChips of the same lot. [2] mouse Treg cells obtained from spleen by cell sorting of Balb/c mice were compared to their naive controls.  RNAs were prepared from pools of three individual Balb/c mice, labeled in three independend labeling reactions and hybridized onto three GeneChips of the same lot. The differences in gene expression were used to unravel molecular mechanisms that help to explain the suppressive and anergic phenotypes of Treg cells after antigen activation.
