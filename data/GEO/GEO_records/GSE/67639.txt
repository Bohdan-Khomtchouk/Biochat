SUMMARY
Background: Accurate survival stratification in early-stage NSCLC could inform the use of adjuvant therapy. We developed a clinically-implementable mortality risk score incorporating distinct tumor microenvironmental gene expression signatures and clinical variables.    Methods: Gene expression profiles from 1106 non-squamous NSCLCs were used for generation and internal validation of a 9-gene molecular prognostic index (MPI). Expression of the MPI genes was determined within sorted tumor cell subpopulations. A quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was developed and validated on an independent cohort of FFPE tissues. A prognostic score using clinical variables was generated using Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data and combined with the MPI.    Results: The MPI stratified stage I patients into prognostic categories in four independent validation datasets, including three microarray and one FFPE qPCR cohorts (HR=2.4, 95% CI, 1.8-3.3, P=7x10-9 in the largest microarray cohort; and HR=2.5, 95% CI 1.1-6.0, P=.03 in stage I patients of the qPCR validation cohort). Prognostic genes were expressed in distinct tumor cell subpopulations and expression of genes implicated in cellular proliferation and stem cells portended poor outcomes, while expression of genes involved in normal lung differentiation and immune infiltration was associated with superior survival. Integrating the MPI with clinical variables conferred greatest prognostic power (HR=3.3, 95% CI 2.4-4.6; P=2x10-15 in the largest microarray cohort; and HR=3.6, 95% CI 1.5-8.8, P=.003 in stage I patients of the qPCR validation cohort). Finally, the MPI was prognostic irrespective of somatic alterations in EGFR, KRAS, TP53, and ALK.    Conclusion: The MPI incorporates genes expressed in the tumor and its microenvironment, and designates risk of death for patients with early-stage non-squamous NSCLC. The MPI can be implemented clinically using qPCR assays on FFPE tissues and a composite model integrating the MPI with clinical variables provides the most accurate risk stratification.

DESIGN
Third part re-analysis of GSE31210, GSE13213, GSE5843, NCI caArray ( https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/caArray2/caArray+Directory ) accessions ca00153, ca00182, ca00191 (now retired), Roepman et al. PMID 19118056. Where applicable, raw Affymetrix CEL files were renormalized using MAS5 and Custom CDF probe mappings to Entrez Gene IDs. Within each dataset, each gene was standardized so that it had mean zero and variance 1 across stage 1 adenocarcinoma patients. Datasets were then merged into one meta-cohort of 1106 samples.
