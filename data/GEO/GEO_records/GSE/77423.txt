TITLE
PDGF Engages an E2F-USP1 Signaling Pathway to Support ID2-mediated Survival of Proneural Glioma Cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of critical survival determinants of PDGF-driven proneural glioma. Results provided information about the genes and pathways that are regulated by PDGF signaling in PDGF-driven proneural glioma and led to the assessment of the importance of the USP1-ID2 axis in proneural glioma.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from PDGF-driven glioma spheroid cells (PDGF-GSC) and primary tumors arising in the Gfap-tTa/Tre-PDGFB mouse model used in our study was analyzed to determine to which subtype of GBM these specimens belonged.
