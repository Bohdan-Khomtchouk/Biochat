TITLE
Small RNA profiling during anther development in 7B-1 male-sterile tomato mutant and its wild type

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The RNA-seq was used to identify differentially regulated miRNAs between a male sterile and wild type tomato during anther development.

DESIGN
Two small RNA libraries were constructed from male-sterile and wild type tomato flower buds using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit from Illumina, and were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq2000

PLATFORM
GPL16345 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Solanum lycopersicum)
