TITLE
A Novel Human Gastric Primary Cell Culture System for Modeling Helicobacter Pylori Infection In Vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified specific long-term culture conditions that allow the formation of 3-dimensional human gastric spheroids, which can be differentiated by withdrawal of Wnt3A and R-spondin1 to human gastric organoids. These cultures can expand indefinitely and exhibit important characteristics of human stomach tissue. Furthermore, these 3-dimensional cultures can be transferred into 2-dimensional primary epithelial cell layers, which can be successfully infected with H. pylori and thereby provide ideal conditions to study infections in vitro.

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed as dual-color hybridizations on Agilent human whole genome catalog 44K arrays. To compensate for dye-specific effects, a dye-reversal color-swap was applied.
