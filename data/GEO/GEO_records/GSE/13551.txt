TITLE
MEF2D binding sites in rat hippocampal neurons

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the binding profiles of MEF2D, a member of MEF2 family transcription factors, in rat hippocampal neurons. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
We used custom-designed rat genome tiling array manufactured by Nimblegen Systems, Inc . This array contains probes that represent the following rat genomic regions: 182 genes identified by mRNA profiling experiments, 86 genes whose expression was decreased by both KCl-mediated depolarization and MEF2 RNAi, and 40 control genes whose expression was not altered by MEF2 RNAi or MEF2-VP16-ER. The array not only covers the entire gene regions but also contains probes that correspond to the 40 kb 5′and 3′ to each gene.  Repeatmasking was conducted by Nimblegen to ensure that repetitive elements were not tiled on the microarray.  Probe length and spacing between the probes were 50-75mer and 50 bp, respectively.
