TITLE
Effect of BORIS depletion on transcriptome of breast cancer cell line MCF7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of BORIS depleted MCF7 cells To delineate the alternative pre-mRNA splicing program mediated by BORIS in breast cancer cells, BORIS was depleted in MCF7 using shRNA, and the resultant changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA expression pattern was profiled using Affymetrix Human Transcriptome 2.0 Array

DESIGN
We analyzed shContol and shBORIS transfected MCF7 cell line using the Affymetrix Human Transcriptome 2.0 platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix transcriptome console Computational Tool. Biological replicates were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL17586 [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [transcript (gene) version]
