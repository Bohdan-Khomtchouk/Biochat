TITLE
The lncRNA LUST promotes CCICs self-renewal stimulating the wnt/b-catenin signaling activation [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comprehensive RNA-seq experiments in CD24bright/CD44bright (CCICs), CD24dim/CD44dim (more differentiated counterpart) cells and colonospheres delineate the role of the lncRNA LUST  in promoting CCICs self-renewal.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq study from HT-29 CD44bright/CD24bright and CD24dim/CD44dim sorted cells subpopulation
