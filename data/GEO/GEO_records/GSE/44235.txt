TITLE
Genomic features and regulatory roles of intermediate-size non-coding RNAs in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Recent advances in genome-wide techniques allowed the identification of thousands of non-coding RNAs with various sizes in eukaryotes, some of which have further been shown to serve important functions in many biological processes. However, in model plant Arabidopsis, novel intermediate-sized ncRNAs (im-ncRNAs) (50~300nt) have very limited information. By using a modified isolation strategy combined with deep-sequencing technology, we identified 838 im-ncRNAs in Arabidopsis globally. More than half (58%) are new ncRNA species, mostly evolutionary divergent. Interestingly, annotated protein-coding genes with 5â€™-UTR derived novel im-ncRNAs tend to be highly expressed. For intergenic im-ncRNAs, their average abundances were comparable to mRNAs in seedlings, but subsets exhibited significantly lower expression in senescing leaves. Further, intergenic im-ncRNAs were regulated by similar genetic and epigenetic mechanisms as those of protein-coding genes, and some showed developmentally-regulated expression patterns. Large-scale reverse genetic screening showed that the down-regulation of a number of im-ncRNAs resulted in either obvious molecular changes or abnormal developmental phenotypes in vivo, indicating the functional importance of im-ncRNAs in plant growth and development. Together, our results demonstrate that novel Arabidopsis im-ncRNAs are developmentally-regulated and functional components discovered in the transcriptome.
