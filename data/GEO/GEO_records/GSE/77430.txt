TITLE
Alterations in the hepatic epigenome in mice exposed to a maternal high fat diet in utero [HELP]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exposure to a high fat (HF) diet in utero is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome later in life. However, the molecular basis of this enhanced susceptibility for metabolic disease is poorly understood. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to examine DNA methylation patterns in liver of offspring exposed to a Control or HF maternal diet. WT mice were fed a C (9.5% fat, 3.59 kcal/g) or HF (35.5% fat, 5.29 kcal/g) diet for 2 wk before mating, throughout pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were weaned to a low fat (5.6% fat, 3.4 kcal/g) diet and were sacrificed at 5wks of age. DNA methylation analysis revealed the majority of differentially methylated regions were hypermethylated in HF liver. Chromosomal distribution analysis showed hypermethylation hot spots on chromosomes 4 (atherosclerosis susceptibility QTL1) and 18 (insulin dependent susceptibility 21). Most of the hypermethylated genes in these hot spots are associated with cardiovascular system development and function. In summary, exposure to a maternal HF diet significantly alters the DNA methylation patterns in the liver of exposed offspring and contributes to programmed development of metabolic disease later in life.

DESIGN
High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from liver in mouse exposure to a control or high fat (HF) diet in utero (n=3 each group). Genome wide methylation analysis was performed using HELP assay.
