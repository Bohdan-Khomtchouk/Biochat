TITLE
Gene expression data of untreated and RA-treated wild type and RXRα-deficient mice liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our project focuses on retinoic acid (RA) effect on hepatic lipid homeostasis. Even though RA has more than one receptor including retinoids x receptor (RXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR), most probably, RA effect on lipid homeostasis is mediated by RXR and its partners such as PXR, FXR, and PPAR. So we treated the wild type and RXRα-knockout mice by retinoic acid to check the global gene expression especially for lipid homeostasis genes. We used microarrays to observe the global gene expression underlying hepatic lipid homeostasis.

DESIGN
We treated both the wild type and RXRα-KO mice with normal diet and RA-containing diet for 7 days. For each group, three replicates were done. Liver total RNA were used to test global gene expression by microarray.
