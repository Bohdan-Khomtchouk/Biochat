TITLE
Encyclopedia of C. elegans 3' UTRs and their regulatory elements

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) constitutes a major site of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Sequence elements in the 3'UTR interact with trans-acting regulators such as microRNAs that affect translation and stability. The overall aim is to use a 3'RACE cloning-sequencing stragety to identify the 3'UTRs of C. elegans transcripts and explore their heterogeneity in different developmental stages and tissues. Keywords: Transcriptome analysis For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf Raw data files are available on our FTP site: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/geosup/Series/GSE17781
