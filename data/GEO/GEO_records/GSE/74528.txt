TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of IMQ-treated wt and Trex2-/- skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TREX2 is a keratinocyte specific 3â€™-deoxyribonuclease that participates in the maintenance of skin homeostasis upon damage. This transcriptome analysis identified multiple genes and pathways deregulated by TREX2 loss in the IMQ-induced psoriasis-like model in mouse skin.

DESIGN
mRNA sequencing of 5 biological replicates of skin from wild-type mice treated with Imiquimod and 6 of Trex2 knockout mice treated with Imiquimod
