TITLE
Small RNA profile in Moso Bamboo root and leaf

ORGANISM
Phyllostachys edulis

SUMMARY
The small RNA libraries from Moso bamboo (Phyllostachy heterocycla) roots and leaves were constructed by using high definition adapters .  The small RNA profiles were analyzed. A collection of micro RNAs with similarity to the micro RNA entries in mirbase were discovered. The putative genomic loci of the micro RNAs were identified.

DESIGN
Analysis of small RNA profiles from the root and leaf tissues of young Moso Bamboo seedlings
