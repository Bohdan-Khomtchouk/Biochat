TITLE
Expression data from MCF7 tumor xenografts treated with either single agent BMS754807, or Tamoxifen or Letrozole alone; or Tamoxifen or Letrozole in combination with BMS754807 for 28 days

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
breast cancer. Combined IGF and estrogen-targeted therapy may improve the benefit of hormonal therapy alone. We employed a postmenopausal model of estrogen-dependent breast cancer in vitro and in vivo using the aromatase-expressing MCF-7/AC-1cells. Using this model, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of the dual IGF-1R/InsR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, BMS-754807 alone and in combination with letrozole or tamoxifen in vivo. We used microarrays to compare gene expression changes of MCF7 breast xenograft treated with either BMS754807, or Tamoxifen or Letrozole alone; or Tamoxifen or Letrozole in combination with BMS754807 for 28 days

DESIGN
Breast xenograft  MCF7 bearing mice treated with either BMS754807, or Tamoxifen or Letrozole alone; or  Tamoxifen or Letrozole in combination with BMS754807 for 28 days. RNA were extracted from tumors and hybridizedon Affymetrix microarrays to compare gene expression changes
