TITLE
Hepatocyte ductal metaplasia in chronic mouse liver injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of hepatocytes-derived ductal cells with properties intermediate between mature hepatocytes and cholangiocytes

DESIGN
Chimeric adult mice were generated where mature hepatocytes were marked with a fluorescent red marker.  Chronic injury was induced for ~6weeks and three cell types were isolated by FACS (Influx, BD) for expression analysis by RNAseq based on cell surface phenotype and origin: hepatocytes (n=3), hepatocyte-derived oval cells (1c3+, n=5), and cholangiocyte-derived oval cells (1c3+, n=5).
