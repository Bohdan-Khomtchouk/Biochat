TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by S. aureus and GAS (S. pyogenes) in murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the differential regulation of Th17-inducing cytokine genes in Dendritic cells by GAS and S. aureus

DESIGN
RNAseq was performed in libraries derived from mRNA from bone-marrow derived (BMDC) infected with S. aureus or GAS in vitro

PLATFORM
GPL18635 Ion Torrent Proton (Mus musculus)
