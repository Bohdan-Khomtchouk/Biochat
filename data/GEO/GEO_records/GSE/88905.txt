TITLE
Genome-wide effect of AML engraftment on bone marrow endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analysed the transcriptional signature in endothelial cells extracted from the bone marrow of mice engrafted with human AML and compared it to the one of mice engrafted with human normal hematopoietic cells

DESIGN
Immunodeficient mice were transplanted with human AML cells derived from patients, or with normal human hematopoietic cells derived from cord blood. Mice were sacrificed once assessed the bone marrow engraftment, and the bones were processed to isolate endothelial cells using the CD31 marker. RNA was extracted, sequencing libraries were prepared and sequenced.
