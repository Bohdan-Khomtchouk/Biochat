TITLE
Expression profiles of TIS21/BTG2/PC3 gene knockout in liver of C57BL/6J mice in response to starvation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TIS21/BTG2/PC3 has been known as one of the primary response genes regulated by p53-dependent and p53-independent manners. In our study, TIS21 reveals various functions as a tumor suppressor in human and mouse tumors. Recently, it has been reported that expression of TIS21 can be induced during starvation in liver, muscle and white adipose tissues. However, there was no report on the role of TIS21 in response to starvation. To investigate any role of TIS21 gene in the metabolic stimulation, we fasted C57BL/6J mice for overnight (20 hour), and then transcriptional profiles of the TIS21-knockout and TIS21-wild type mice were compared. Along with this trial, we also analyzed transcriptional profiles of fetal livers of the 13.5 day-old embryos derived from the TIS21-wild type and knockout mice.

DESIGN
TIS21-KO vs. TIS21-WT from the livers of the 10 week-old male mice starved for 20 hour (from 5:00pm to next day 1:00 pm), and the fetal livers of the 13.5 days old embryos. The mRNAs isolated from fetal livers were pooled (n > 3). Biological samples: mRNAs isolated from livers of the TIS21-KO adult mice  (KO-Ad)  vs. livers of the TIS21 wild-type adult mice (WT-Ad);  pooled mRNAs from livers of TIS21-KO embryos (KO-Fetal) vs. pooled mRNAs from livers of wild-type fetal embryos (WT-Fetal);  Per each sample, the transcriptional profile was measured in technical duplication.
