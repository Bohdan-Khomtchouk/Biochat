TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of primary human dermal fibroblasts_comparing two young samples (fibroblasts isolated from a 5 month old vs. those from a 1 year old)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endogenous changes in the nuclear encoded genes of the mitochondrial ETC were analyzed using the mitochondrial energy metabolism profiler array from Qiagen to compare nuclear-encoded gene expression changes between fibroblasts isolated from two young patients.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiler array.  Equal amount total RNA from each donor was isolated prior to making the cDNA and analyzing the changes in nuclear-encoded gene expression.
