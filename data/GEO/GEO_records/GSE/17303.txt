TITLE
Transcriptional effects of the IWR1 deletion

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Analysis of the genome-wide transcrptional effects caused by the deletion of the IWR1 gene by comparing the transcriptional profile of a iwr1 mutant strain with the isogenic wild type strain when cells were exponentially grown in YPD medium.

DESIGN
Three independent cultures for the wt and the iwr1 mutant were used for the whole genome transcription analysis and they were grown in YPD at the early exponential phase. Total RNA was isolated and cDNA synthesis and labeling, filter hybridization and quantification/normalization of hybridization signals were performed as described in Garcia-Martinez, J., Aranda, A. and Perez-Ortin, J.E. (2004) Mol Cell 15(2),303-313.
