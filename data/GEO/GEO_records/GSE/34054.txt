TITLE
miRNA gene expression profile of ApoE-/- mice during neointima formation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify microRNAs involved in neointima formation in mice with an atherogenic background, wire-induced carotid injury was performed in ApoE-/- mice on western-type diet. Uninjured carotid arteries served as control. RNA was isolated after 1, 7, 14, and 28 days (n=3-4 each group) and hybridized to an Agilent microRNA microarray (Sanger v12). Significantly regulated microRNAs ( > 2-fold) over time (P < 0.05; ANOVA and Benjamini-Hochberg correction) were clustered by K-means algorithm. Distinct groups of similarly regulated microRNAs were detected in the course of neointima formation in hyperlipidemic mice.

DESIGN
miRNA gene expression profile of ApoE-/- mice were measured at 1, 7, 14, 28 days after vascular injury.  3 to 4  animals per group were used for each time points.
