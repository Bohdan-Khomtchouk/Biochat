TITLE
Expression profiles of EDTA-dissociated colon epithelial cells of wild-type mice and vil-Cre-Bcl9-/-/Bcl9l-/- mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assess potential changes in Wnt signaling more comprehensively, EDTA-dissociated colon epithelial cells from three pools of wild-type and Bcl9/Bcl9l-mutant mice were subjected to an exploratory comparative gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
Total RNA of three samples of EDTA-dissociated colon epithelial cells of wild-type mice and three samples of vil-Cre-Bcl9-/-/Bcl9l-/- mice, each sample consisting of material of two or three different mice, was collected and resulting amplified cDNA hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays. Samples are labeled as follows: Genotype_PoolID _UniqueID_NumberOfMice.
