TITLE
Gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) and heart.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression patterns of the iCMs shift from a MEF state toward a cardiac-like phenotype by Gata4/Mef2c/Tbx5 (GMT) or GMT/Hand2 (GHMT) transduction at 2 and 4 weeks after transduction (2W, 4W). Hand2 upregulated a panel of cardiac genes and suppressed cell cylce genes during cardiac reprogramming.

DESIGN
MEFs were used for negative control, mouse heart tissue for positive control. Gene expression profiles were compared among MEFs, iCMs and heart.
