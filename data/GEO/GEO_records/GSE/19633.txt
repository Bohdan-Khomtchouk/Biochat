TITLE
Comparison of the testicular transcriptome of chromosomes 2, X, Y and the mitochondrial genome between two mouse species

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used tiling arrays to compare the testicular expression of chromosomes 2, X, Y and the mitochondrial genome between Mus m. domesticus and Mus spretus. We found an excess of dysregulated non-coding RNAs on chromosome 2. This group consists of intronic antisense RNAs, intergenic RNAs and also premature forms of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). The unique transcriptional regulation in spermatogenesis is a characteristic of chromosome X. It is subject to meiotic transcriptional silencing, which is accompanied by generating X-chromosomal retrogenes on autosomes. We found striking dysregulation of the G6pdx - G6pd2 parental-retrogene pair between the mouse species. The postmeiotic expression of G6pdx in Mus spretus points out the continuous evolution of X chromosome silencing and provides clue for regulatory changes, which accompanies the out-of-X gene flow.
