TITLE
Discovered salivary transcriptomic biomarkers for the detection of gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have performed gene expression microarray analysis to profile transcriptomic signatures between cancer and noncancerous patients Gastric cancer is currently the second leading cause of cancer deaths. Due to the difficulty of diagnosing patients in the early stages of gastric cancer, it is critical to develop a method that can diagnose the disease at the early stage to allow for better treatment options. In this study, we discovered salivary transcriptomic and miRNA biomarkers for the detection of gastric cancer and identified there are mRNA-miRNA correlations in saliva.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from saliva supernatant and mRNA candidates were identified that can distinguish gastric cancer from non-gastric cancer patients
