TITLE
miRNA profile of THP-1 macrophage infected with different MTB strains

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the microRNA profiles of THP-1 macrophages upon the MTB infection of (1) Beijing/W and non-Beijing/W clinical strains, and (2) susceptible and multidrug-resistant (MDR-) MTB strains.

DESIGN
THP-1 cells were induced differentiation into a macrophage phenotype. Then cells were infected with three MDR (INHR, RIFR) Beijing/W, three sensitive (INHS, RIFS) Beijing/W, three MDR(INHR, RIFR) non-Beijing/W, and three sensitive (INHS, RIFS) non-Beijing/W strains. Total RNA were extracted and transfered into cDNA for miRNA profile analysis. Non-infected cells were used as control.
