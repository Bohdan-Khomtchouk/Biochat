TITLE
Structural and functional adaptation of Haloferax volcanii TFEα/β

ORGANISM
Haloferax volcanii

SUMMARY
Purpose: The Haloferax volcanii ∆tfeB strain provided a unique opportunity to study a putative role of TFEβ in the regulation of gene expression. Results: The deletion of the tfeB gene in H. volcanii results in the aberrant expression of approximately one third of all genes, consistent with its function as a basal transcription initiation factor. Interestingly, tfeB deletion particularly affects foreign genes including a prophage region. Conclusions: Our results confirm the dual function of TFE as basal factor and regulator of transcription

DESIGN
We isolated total RNA from Haloferax volcanii ∆tfeB H2644 and H2645 and the parental H53 strain during early exponential growth (O.D.650=0.2) and subjected it to next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)

PLATFORM
GPL23691 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Haloferax volcanii)
