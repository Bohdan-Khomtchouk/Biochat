TITLE
Deletional Tolerance Mediated by Extrathymic Aire-Expressing Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The prevention of autoimmunity requires elimination of self-reactive T cells during their development and maturation. Expression of diverse self-antigens by stromal cells in the thymus is essential to this process, and depends, in part, on the activity of the Autoimmune Regulator (Aire) gene. Here we report the identification of extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs) resident within the secondary lymphoid organs. These stromally-derived eTACs express a diverse array of unique self-antigens and are capable of interacting with and deleting naive autoreactive T cells. Using two-photon microscopy we observe stable, antigen-specific interactions between eTACs and autoreactive T cells. We propose that such a secondary network of self-antigen-expressing stromal cells may help reinforce immune tolerance by preventing the maturation of autoreactive T cells that escape thymic negative selection. A genetic modification design type is where an organism(s) has had genetic material removed, rearranged, mutagenized or added, such as knock out. Keywords: genetic_modification_design
