TITLE
The investigational Aurora kinase A inhibitor MLN8237 induces defects in cell viability and cell cycle progression in mouse bladder cancer cells in vitro and in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PURPOSE: Despite over 70,000 new cases of bladder cancer in the United States annually, patients with advanced disease have a poor prognosis due to limited treatment modalities.  We evaluate the role of Aurora A, identified as an upregulated candidate molecule in bladder cancer, in regulating bladder tumor growth. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression in human bladder cancer samples was evaluated using RNA microarray and reverse-transcriptase PCR. The specific Aurora kinase A inhibitor MLN8237 (Millennium) was used to determine effects on bladder cancer cell growth using in vitro and in vivo models using malignant T24 and UM-UC-3 and papilloma-derived RT4 bladder cells. RESULTS: Urothelial carcinoma upregulates a set of 13 mitotic spindle associated transcripts, as compared to normal urothelium, including MAD2L1 (7.6-fold), BUB1B (8.8-fold), Aurora kinases A (5.6-fold) and Aurora kinase B (6.2-fold). Application of MLN8237 (10nM-1ÂµM) to the human bladder tumor cell lines T24 and UM-UC-3 induced dose-dependent G2 cell cycle arrest, aneuploidy, mitotic spindle abnormalities, and apoptosis. MLN8237 arrested tumor growth when administered orally over 4 weeks in a mouse bladder cancer xenograft model (p < 0.05). Finally, in vitro combination of MLN8237 with either paclitaxel or gemcitabine produced schedule-dependent synergistic antiproliferative effects in T24 cells when administered sequentially. CONCLUSIONS:  Mitotic spindle checkpoint dysfunction is a common characteristic of human urothelial carcinoma, and can be exploited with pharmacologic Aurora A inhibition. Future studies that explore the mechanisms of spindle checkpoint failure in bladder cancer and evaluate the therapeutic role of Aurora kinases for bladder cancer patients would be of value.

DESIGN
Tissue samples with urothelial cell carcinoma  from  bladder  as well as normal  references  were collected and the gene expression profiles were compared. No technical replicates.
