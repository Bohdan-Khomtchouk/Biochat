SUMMARY
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a heterogenous disease with a highly variable clinical course and analysis of ZAP-70 and CD38 expression on B-CLL cells allowed for identification of patients with good (ZAP-70-CD38-), intermediate (discordant expression of ZAP-70 and CD38) and poor (ZAP-70+CD38+) prognosis. In an attempt to identify a molecular basis that may underly this diverse clinical behaviour DNA microarray technology was employed to compare eight ZAP-70+CD38+ with eight ZAP-70-CD38- B-CLL cases. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression distinguising B-CLL from patient with good (samples 1 to 8) and poor prognosis (sample 9 to 16) and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes.
