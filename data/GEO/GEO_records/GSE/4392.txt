TITLE
Expression data from native ZAP-70+CD38+ vs. ZAP-70-CD38- CLL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a heterogenous disease with a highly variable clinical course and analysis of ZAP-70 and CD38 expression on B-CLL cells allowed for identification of patients with good (ZAP-70-CD38-), intermediate (discordant expression of ZAP-70 and CD38) and poor (ZAP-70+CD38+) prognosis. In an attempt to identify a molecular basis that may underly this diverse clinical behaviour DNA microarray technology was employed to compare eight ZAP-70+CD38+ with eight ZAP-70-CD38- B-CLL cases. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression distinguising B-CLL from patient with good (samples 1 to 8) and poor prognosis (sample 9 to 16) and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes. Keywords: Disease progression

DESIGN
To compare the transcriptosomes of good prognosis CLL cases (ZAP-70-CD38-) to poor prognosis cases (ZAP-70+CD38+), we purified CD19+ cells from peripheral blood samples by immunomagnetic isolation using MidiMacs,  resulting in > 95% purity of leukemic cells as detected by FACS analysis of CD19+CD5+ cells. The leukemic cells were freshly purified from untreated patients and RNA was directly isolated from fresh cells without further ex vivo treatment of the cells. Eight immunomagnetically purified peripheral blood derived  ZAP-70+CD38+ CLL cases were compared with eight ZAP-70-CD38- B-CLL cases.
