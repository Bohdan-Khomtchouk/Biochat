TITLE
Chromosome 1 tile path array (version 1) analysis of astrocytomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number assessment of chromosome 1 in astrocytic tumors using a chromosome 1 tile path array. Goal was to determine the patterns of chromosome 1 copy number alterations in astrocytic tumors. Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization

DESIGN
Single hybridization per case. 1 diffuse astrocytomas WHO grade II, 6 anaplastic astrocytomas WHO grade III, 5 glioblastomas WHO grade IV were analyzed. Target (tumor) labelled with Cy5 and reference with Cy3. Mixture of 20 normal male or female genomic DNA was used in sex-mismatched hybridization.
