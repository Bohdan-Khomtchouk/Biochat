TITLE
RAMPAGE from LHCN-M2 (ENCSR002MPN)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from independent growths of cell line LHCN-M2, skeletal myoblasts derived from satellite cells from the pectoralis major muscle of a 41 year old caucasian heart transplant donor. They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RAMPAGE libraries from rRNA-depleted Total RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
