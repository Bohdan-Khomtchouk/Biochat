TITLE
E. coli gene expression following CHIR-090 treatment

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
CHIR-090 is an inhibitor of lipid A biosytnesis. CHIR-090 treatment on E. coli sinificantly increased the expression of fatty acid biosythesis gene fabA and fabB. Keywords: Inhibition response

DESIGN
The lipid A biosynthesis in E. coli was inhibited by CHIR-090, and the RNA was extracted after 10 minutes treatment to capture the effect of increased saturated fatty acid on global gene expression.
