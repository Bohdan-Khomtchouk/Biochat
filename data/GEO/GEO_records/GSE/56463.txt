TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of various organs at different developmental stages in rice (single-end)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
To identificate long noncoding RNAs in rice, we profiled transcriptome of various organs at different developmental stages using stranded single-end RNA-seq based on poly(A) selection.

DESIGN
Transcriptom profiling in flower buds, flowers, flag leaves and roots sampled before flowering and after flowering, milk grains and mature seeds.

PLATFORM
