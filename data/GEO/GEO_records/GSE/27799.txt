Expression data from LSK WT and LSK N1-C+

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Notch signaling is one of the central regulators of differentiation in a variety of organisms and tissue types. Within the hematopoietic system, Notch is essential for the emergence of definitive HSC during fetal life and controls adult HSC differentiation to the T-cell lineage. Notch activation is controlled by the gamma-secretase complex complex, composed of presenilin, nicastrin (Ncstn), anterior pharynx-1 (Aph1), and presenilin enhancer-2 To determine other role of Notch signaling in HSC we designed a conditional mouse model of Notch activation. WT and N1-IC+ HSC were analysed to determined genes controlled by Notch signaling.

DESIGN
Bone marrow lineage negative, cKit+, Sca1+ cells were sorted from WT and N1-IC+ littermates for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays
