TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of developmental and sex-regulated gene expression profiles in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We have constructed DNA microarrays containing 17,871 genes, representing about 94% of the 18,967 genes currently annotated in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome. These DNA microarrays can be used as a tool to define a nearly complete molecular profile of gene expression levels associated with different developmental stages, growth conditions, or worm strains. Here, we used these full-genome DNA microarrays to show the relative levels of gene expression for nearly every gene during development, from eggs through adulthood. These expression data can help reveal when a gene may act during development. We also compared gene expression in males to that of hermaphrodites and found a total of 2,171 sex-regulated genes (P < 0.05). The sex-regulated genes provide a global view of the differences between the sexes at a molecular level and identify many genes likely to be involved in sex-specific differentiation and behavior. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
