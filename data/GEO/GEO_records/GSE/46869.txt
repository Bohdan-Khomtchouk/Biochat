TITLE
Gene expression profiles of PIK3CA knockdown by shRNA in lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain insight into EMT-independent biological processes through which PI3K promotes invasion, RNA samples from 344SQ_p110Î± shRNA cells and 344SQ_scr cells were subjected to global transcriptional profiling.

DESIGN
Two groups, control and PIK3CA shRNA, in 344SQ lung cancer cell line Two group comparison
