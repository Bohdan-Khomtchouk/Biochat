TITLE
Expression data from V156D matn1 knock-in mouse rib chondrocytes at 5 days

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
V156D matn1 mutation (homologous to the V194D matn3 mutation causing Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia (MED)) was introduced by gene targetting in order to evaluate the potential of matrilin-1 to be a novel chondrodysplasia based on domain homology and aminoacid conservation. We used microarrays to analyse the differential expression of genes between wild type and mutant animals at day 5 (postnatal)

DESIGN
Rib chondrocyes were extracted from 5 littermates of known genotype and RNA was extracted from the pooled smaple using the TriZOL method; the RNA integrity was checked using BioAnalyser, and hybridised to the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2 Array

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
