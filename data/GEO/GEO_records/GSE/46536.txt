TITLE
The Histone H3 Lysine 9 Methyltransferases G9a and GLP Regulate Polycomb Repressive Complex 2-Mediated Gene Silencing [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
G9a/GLP and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) are two major epigenetic silencing machineries, which in particular methylate histone H3 on lysines 9 and 27 (H3K9 and H3K27), respectively. Although evidence of a crosstalk between H3K9 and H3K27 methylations has started to emerge, their actual interplay remains elusive. Here, we show that PRC2 and G9a/GLP interact physically and functionally. Moreover, combining different genome-wide approaches, we demonstrate that Ezh2 and G9a/GLP share an important number of common genomic targets, encoding developmental and neuronal regulators. Furthermore, we show that G9a enzymatic activity modulates PRC2 genomic recruitment to a subset of its target genes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unanticipated interplay between two main histone lysine methylation mechanisms, which cooperate to maintain silencing of a subset of developmental genes.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq has been performed for G9a and Ezh2 in wild type TT2 mES cells or in mES cells lacking both G9a and GLP (G9a-/-GLP-/-). As a control, input DNA was saved before immunoprecipitation. Note that the two inputs (Input_TT2_0 and Input_TT2_1) have been combined and used as control for Ezh2 and G9a ChIP-seq.
