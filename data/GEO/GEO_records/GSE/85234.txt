TITLE
Inference of differentiation time for single cell transcriptomes using cell population reference data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular mechanisms of neural commitment from mouse ESCs, we selected very dense time points during neural differentiation based on qPCR results and performed mRNA-sequencing at both of cell population and single cell levels.

DESIGN
Two neural induction protocols were used. 21 time points were selected for cell population mRNA-seq. Of them, 8 time points were selected for single cell RNA-seq, and for each time point, 8 individual cells were selected.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
