TITLE
Genes regulated by miR-127-3p in glioblastoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overexpression of miR-127-3p in LN229 glioblastoma cells promotes their migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo in xenograft models. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in miR-127-3p overexpression LN229 cells compared with mock overexpression LN229 cells

DESIGN
MiR-127-3p overexpression LN229 cells and and mock overexpression LN229 cells were cultured in DMEM cell culture media for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the genes regulated by miR-127-3p in glioblastoma cell lines.
