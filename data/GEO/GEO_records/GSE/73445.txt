TITLE
Characterization of Paf1 complex occupancy in mouse embryonic stem cells under control conditions or Phf5a knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Phf5a regulates transcription elongation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), through regulation of the Paf1 complex. In this study we assayed for genome-wide localization of Paf1, Leo1 and Cdc73 subunits of the Paf1 complex in mouse ESCs under conditions of shControl and shPhf5a knockdown. These results revealed that downregualtion of Phf5a results in the significant decrease of Paf1 complex binding to its targets in ESCs.

DESIGN
Ten million cells were used for the ChIP and precipitated using 5 micrograms of respective antibodies. Original reference: Zhu B. et al. (2005) " The human PAF complex coordinates transcription with events downstream of RNA synthesis "
