TITLE
Differential gene expression of ydgG mutant

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The E. coli Genechip antisense genome array was used to study the differential gene expression profile of E. coli K12 ydgG mutant compared to its isogenic wild type in a mature biofilm. Keywords: E. coli K12 antisense chip

DESIGN
Overnight cultures were diluted 100X into 1 L shake flasks containing 250 mL of LB + 0.2 % and 10 g of glass wool. The cells were shaken at 250 rpm and 37 C for 24 hours (final OD600=5 for the suspended cells), to form a biofilm on the glass wool, and RNA was isolated from the biofilm and Affymetrix protocol was used for preparing fragmented and labelled cDNA that was hybrizide to the chips.
