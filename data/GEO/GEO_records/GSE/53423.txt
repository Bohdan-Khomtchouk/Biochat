TITLE
Comparative analysis of TAL1 binding in TSA-treated versus non-treated Endothelial Colony Forming Cells (ECFCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endothelial progenitors represent one of the most promising cell-based strategies for vascular repair of ischemic tissue damage, including limb ischemia, myocardial infarction and stroke. We have shown that the transcription factor TAL1 regulates a transcription program that drives the migration and adhesion of ECFCs. Furthermore,  treatment of ECFCs with the HDAC inhibitor TSA increases the expression of TAL1-dependent genes and promotes the migration, chemotaxis and adhesion of ECFCs. Finally, ex vivo treatment with TSA also improves the vascular repair properties of ECFCs in vivo when these cells are transplanted in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. The goal of this experiment was to test whether TSA treatment of ECFCs affect TAL1 genomic binding.

DESIGN
TAL1 ChIP-sequencing was performed from ECFCs that have been treated or not TSA. As negative controls, we performed Mock-ChIP-seq from the same samples using normal IgG instead of the TAL1 antibody. Overall, we find that there is no change in TAL1 genomic binding in ECFCs upon TSA treatment.
