TITLE
Comparative genomic hybridizations of Mycobacterium avium isolates obtained from multiple host species

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium avium

SUMMARY
A comparative genomic approach was used to identify large sequence polymorphisms among Mycobacterium avium isolates obtained from a variety of host species.  DNA microarrays were used as a platform for comparing mycobacteria field isolates with the sequenced bovine isolate Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) K10.  ORFs were classified as present or divergent based on the relative fluorescent intensities of the experimental samples compared to Map K10 DNA.  Map isolates cultured from cattle, bison, sheep, goat, avian, and human sources were hybridized to the Map microarray.  Three large deletions were observed in the genomes of four Map isolates obtained from sheep and four clusters of ORFs homologous to sequences in the Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium (Maa) 104 genome were identified as being present in these isolates.  One of these clusters encodes glycopeptidolipid biosynthesis enzymes.  One of the Map sheep isolates had a genome profile similar to a group of Mycobacterium avium subsp. silvaticum (Mas) isolates which included four independent laboratory stocks of the organism traditionally identified as Maa strain 18.  Genome diversity in Map appears to be mostly restricted to large sequence polymorphisms that are often associated with mobile genetic elements. Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Each isolate was competitively hybridized against Map K10 with a minimum of 2 dye flip hybridizations per isolate.
