TITLE
Epigenetic Signatures of Salivary Gland Inflammation in Sjögren's Syndrome.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of human labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsy samples obtained from 28 female members of the Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) Registry. The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across more than 450,000 highly informative CpG sites. Samples included 15 non-case glands, and 13 glands from patients with Sjögren's Syndrome.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 31 samples (3 replicates) were hybridised to the Illumina 450K Infinium Methylation BeadChip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
