TITLE
Quantitative modeling of transcription factor binding specificities using DNA shape

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The SELEX-seq platform was used to generate DNA-binding affinity predictions for the human Max transcription factor.  This experiment was performed as part of a cross-validation study comparing the accuracy of DNA shape-augmented TF binding specificity models across two different platforms (SELEX-seq and gcPBM)

DESIGN
Two rounds of SELEX were performed on Max protein as described in Slattery et al, Cell, 2011 (PMID 22153072).  Briefly, His-tagged Max was incubated with a randomized 16mer oligonucleotide library (GTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGACGATCTGG[ACGT]{16}CCAGAACTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG).  Max bound DNA was amplified and sequenced as described (Slattery et al, 2011).
