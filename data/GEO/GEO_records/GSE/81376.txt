TITLE
Mouse IMCD3 cell lines knocked-down for VPS33B, VIPAR and PLOD3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse IMCD3 cell lines knocked-down for VPS33B, VIPAR and PLOD3 are used as models of ARC syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder cause by mutations in VPS33B or VIPAR. Previous work has shown that ARC syndrome causes epithelial cell polarisation defectes and mislocalisation of membrane proteins, so polarised IMCD3 cells were used as an experimental model. Affymetrix arrays were used to characterise the changes to the transcriptome when protein levels of VPS33B, VIPAR and PLOD3 are reduced.

DESIGN
mouse IMCD-3 cell lines, 15 samples in total, three biological repeats of each of: wild type, control shRNA, VPS33B shRNA, VIPAR shRNA, PLOD3 shRNA
