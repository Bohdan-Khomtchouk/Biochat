TITLE
Epigenome analysis of normal and cancer, lung fibrosis and COPD fresh frozen tissue samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a comparative study the genome wide methylation levels using Illumina Infinium 450k chips were assigned. The specific methylation pattern of lung cancer patients (n=17), patients suffering from idiopathic lung fibrosis (n=37) as well as 32 patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 43 DNA samples derived from healthy-lungs were determined. Lung biopsy samples were obtained by bronchoscopy. Thus obtained tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Classification of lung fibrosis patients base on CT scans of the affected lung.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 129 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip v1.2
