TITLE
Gene expression profile in peritoneal macrophage infected with Listeria monocytogenes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Several Toll-like receptors are activated by Listeria monocytogenes infection, resulting in the activation of  MyD88 dependent signaling pathway.  However, the negative role of MyD88 in gene expresson is unclear. To address this, we performed microarray analysis of mRNAs from WT or MyD88-/- peritoneal macrophages infected with Listeria monocytogenes.

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from WT or MyD88-/- mice were infected with Listeria monocytogenes for 6 hours, and then subjected to microarray analysis.
