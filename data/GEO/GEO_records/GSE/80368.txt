TITLE
Epigenome analysis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma associated fibroblast cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of cancer associated fibroblasts. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that tumor induced DNA methylation in cancer associated fibroblasts. Results showed DNA methlation status in cancer associated fibroblasts changed  after coculture with pancreatic cancer cells.

DESIGN
Mesenchymal stem cells and 09.05CAFs which was primary cultured fibroblasts either cultured alone or co-cultured with pancreatic tumor cells then purified by anti-FAP antibody coupled Dynabeads. DNA were abtained and DNA methylation were compared between cultured alone and cocultured.
