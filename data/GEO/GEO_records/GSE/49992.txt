TITLE
Gene expression profiling of longissimus dorsi muscle,subcutaneous and abdominal adipose tissues in Yan yellow cattle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Microarray technologies,which can measure the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously are useful in understanding global gene networks and identifying novel genes and functional gene classes.The adipose depots may have various adipogenic state-specific genes and regulations of adipose accretion patterns in beef cattle.Therefore,the purpose of this study was to examine the molecular mechanisms of longissimus dorsi muscle,subcutaneous and abdominal adipose tissue depots in a native Chinese yellow breed by identifying differentially expressed genes using Bovine Genome Array.The GO and pathway analysis further validated differentially expressed genes identified in array analysis.

DESIGN
A total of 9 bulls of the same breed (Yan yellow cattle) were included in the study.The sample collection procedure was approved by animal care committee of Husbandry Bureau of Yanji City.All cattle were reared under identical conditions and the samples were obtained according to standard procedures.The samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80Â°C for microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL2112 [Bovine] Affymetrix Bovine Genome Array
