TITLE
The effect of artificial microRNA p-27-5p on breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are a group of non-coding small RNAs with lengths around 21~23nt and function as inhibitors to repress mRNA translation by targeting their 3' untranslated region. Recent research shows that microRNAs are involved in many biological processes such as cell growth, development and cancer, etc. Here, we introduce a novel artificial microRNA p-27-5p which can inhibit cell proliferation in breast cancer cell lines. This data shows the expression changes in breast cancer cell line T-47D with the effect of artificial miR-p-27-5p.

DESIGN
4 total samples were analyzed. We generated mimic/control paired samples with 2 repeats.
