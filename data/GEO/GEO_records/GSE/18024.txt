TITLE
FIA plasma induces arthritis in naïve mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Plasma collected from mice with FIA were pooled, and 0.3 ml was injected intravenously into 6-week-old naïve SJL mice on days 0 and 2. Synovial antigen array profiling of plasma from the arthritic recipient mice demonstrated autoreactive B-cell responses against peptides representing native fibrinogen and citrullinated fibrinogen, and further epitope spreading resulting in additional targeting of fibronectin, collagen type V, cartilage gp39, and clusterin.
