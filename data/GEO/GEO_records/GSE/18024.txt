TITLE
FIA plasma induces arthritis in naïve mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Plasma collected from mice with FIA were pooled, and 0.3 ml was injected intravenously into 6-week-old naïve SJL mice on days 0 and 2. Synovial antigen array profiling of plasma from the arthritic recipient mice demonstrated autoreactive B-cell responses against peptides representing native fibrinogen and citrullinated fibrinogen, and further epitope spreading resulting in additional targeting of fibronectin, collagen type V, cartilage gp39, and clusterin.

DESIGN
Custom-spotted protein slides were probed with plasma samples from individual mice. Four slides were probed with plasma derived from naïve mice and four slides were probed with plasma derived from mice injected with FIA plasma.
