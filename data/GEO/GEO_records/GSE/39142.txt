TITLE
The YmdB phosphodiesterase is a global regulator of biofilm-specific mRNA levels in Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Detailed description (other than provided below) of growth conditions, RNA preparation, cDNA synthesis and hybridization conditions can  be found in the submitted paper.

DESIGN
GSM956794-GSM956801: Bacillus subtilis 168 wild type and its ymdB derivative strain were grown in CSE-Glu medium and cells were harvested at mid exponential (OD600 ~0.8) and early stationary phase (OD600 ~2.2-2.4).  For both time points, 4 biological replicates were used, resulting 4 slides for both exponential and stationary phase. Dye swaps are included in both experiments. GSM1011025-GSM1011032: Bacillus subtilis GP966 antibiotic tagged synthetic wild type and its ymdB E39Q point mutant strain GP969 were grown in CSE-Glu medium and cells were harvested at mid exponential (OD600 ~0.8) and early stationer phase (OD600 ~2.2-2.4).  For both time points, 4 biological replicates were used, resulting 4 slides for both exponential and stationer phase. Dye swaps are included in both experiments.
