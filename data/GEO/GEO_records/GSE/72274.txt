TITLE
Altered microRNA profiles in cumulus cells isolated from PCOS patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the altered miRNA expression profiles of PCOS patients, the differentially expressed miRNAs were identified from cumulus cells of PCOS patients by comparing to that of normal women.

DESIGN
Case-control study that involved 18 women with PCOS and 18 women without PCOS (control). The miRNA expression profiles of cumulus cells were identified by miRNA array.
