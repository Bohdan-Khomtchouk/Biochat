TITLE
Expression data of embryonic kidney from MWF E15.5 and SHR 16.0 rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Defects in nephrogenesis can have detrimental effects on cardiovascular and renal health in adult life. This is confirmed by observations in the Munich Wistar FrÃ¶mter (MWF) rat that exhibits a congenital nephron deficit and renal failure with age. We performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis in embryonic kidneys to identify candidate genes for the reduced nephron number in MWF. We compared MWF E15.5 with stage-matched spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at E16. Microarray analysis revealed 311 transcripts representing 253 known genes with differential expression between MWF and SHR (FC > +1.5 or < -1.5, FDR < 0.05).

DESIGN
8 samples were analyzed, n=4 per group
