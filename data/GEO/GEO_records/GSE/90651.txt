TITLE
SNP data from hepatocellular carcinoma PDX

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma samples were obtained after patients provided written informed consent and with the approval of the institutional research ethics board at the Liver Cancer Institute of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University (Shanghai, China). Fresh tumor tissues were implanted in NOD/SCID mice. Tumor lines were successfully maintained through multiple rounds of serial transplantation. We used microarrays to evaluate the genotype similarity between patient tumor and patient-derived xenograft (PDX).

DESIGN
PDX (F0, F2, F4) for DNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL6801 [GenomeWideSNP_6] Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array
