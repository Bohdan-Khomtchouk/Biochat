TITLE
Transcriptomic Analysis of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was designed to understand the transcriptomic composition and the biological functions of cancer stem cells isolated from non-small cell lung cancer line (NSCLC) Putative lung cancer stem cells were isolated from cancer cell lines based on expression of known stem cell surface markers: CD166, CD44 and EpCAM using the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS).

DESIGN
Affymetrix microarray were performed on cancer stem cells isolated from normal lung epithelial cells and lung cancer cell lines (A549 and NCI-H2170) using GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST array. The normal putative stem cells isolated from normal primary human bronchial/trachial epithelial cell line (PHBEC) was serve as control. Putative cancer stem cells isolated from A549 and NCI-H2170 cell lines are the treatment group. Each sample was performed in triplicate and total number of samples are five (n=5)
