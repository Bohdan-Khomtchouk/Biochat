TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933 during heat shock using microarrays

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of Escherichia coli K-12 has been widely studied over a variety of conditions for the past decade while such studies involving E. coli O157:H7, its pathogenic cousin, are just now being conducted. To better understand the impact of heat shock on E. coli O157:H7, global transcript levels of strain EDL933 cells shifted from 37°C to 50°C for 15 min were compared to cells left at 37°C using microarrays. Keywords: Stress Response

DESIGN
Twelve independent RNA samples from heat shocked cultures were paired with twelve independent RNA samples from control cultures for hybridization to twelve two-color microarrays. For six arrays, the control RNA sample was labeled with Cy3 dye and the experimental RNA sample was labeled with Cy5 dye, the dyes were reversed for the other six arrays to overcome dye bias.
