TITLE
Expression data from mouse SEOC tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have developed mouse models for serous epithelial ovarian cancer (SEOC) based on conditional inactivation of p53 and Rb tumor suppression (RB-TS) in combination with or without Brca1/2 following injection of adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase into the ovarian bursa. These models develop metastatic (Stage IV) disease with key histopathological features resembling human SEOC.To determine whether these mouse tumors resemble human SEOC at the molecular level, we conducted global gene expression analysis on 27 ovarian carcinomas and 3 pooled normal ovarian surface epithelium samples (single epithelial layer isolated from ovarian surface by laser capture).

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from flash frozen ovarian tumors or from ovarian surface epithelial cells microdissected from frozen sections using PixCell IIe laser capture microdissection instrument.
