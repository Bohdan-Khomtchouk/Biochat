TITLE
Expression data from C. elegans treated with anatase TiO2 nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The nematode C. elegans was exposed to TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) to evaluate the ecotoxicity of TiO2 nanoparticles. We used the DNA microarray method to understand changes in gene expression after the exposure to TIO2 NPs. We identified various genes involved in metal detoxification as well as in regulating worm development.

DESIGN
We employ the model organism C. elegans (with a fully sequenced genome) to effectively study the toxicology of TiO2 NPs (i. e., anatase) under dark conditions.

PLATFORM
GPL200 [Celegans] Affymetrix C. elegans Genome Array
