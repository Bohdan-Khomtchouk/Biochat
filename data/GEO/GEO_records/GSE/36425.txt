TITLE
Expression data MCF10A/ErbB2 RB-proficient and RB-deficient cells cultured in 3-D cell culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis for structural components in Rb-deficient and RB-proficient ErbB2-overexpressing immortalized breast cell line using 3-D cell culture model to analyze structural and organizational changes of epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Cells were cultured in a reconstituted membrane for 7 days. Cells were extracted with the use RNA-STAT-60 method.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
