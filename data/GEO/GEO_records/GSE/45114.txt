TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of HCC vs. Normal liver and Pericancer vs. Normal liver.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant and lethal cancers in the world. Its complex process of molecular pathogenesis indicates that HCC is caused by multiple etiological factors and involves multiple types of genes during its development and progression. In the current study, we performed a microarray analysis on the mRNA transcriptome of HCC (C), peri-cancerous liver (P) and normal liver (N) tissues. After integrating these results with information from the Gene Ontology and KEGG Pathway databases, we analyzed the potential interactions between different genes and constructed an interaction network, and identified the regulator, mediator and effector genes in this interaction network.

DESIGN
Three types of tissues: 49 pairs of homogenous human primary hepatocellular carcinoma (Cancer, C) and pericancer liver tissues (Pericancer, P), 10 normal liver tissues (Normal, N). Three-condition experiment, HCC vs. Normal and Pericancer vs. Normal.
