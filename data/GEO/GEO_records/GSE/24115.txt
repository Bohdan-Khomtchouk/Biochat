TITLE
Genome-wide chromatin analysis of wing imaginal discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report the relationship between 'absent, small or homeotic discs 2' (ASH2) occupancy, histone modifications and the transcription machinery using the wing disc as a source of chromatin. Our results indicate that genes related to development and transcriptional regulation are direct targets of ASH2 and that this protein contributes to H3K4me3 of nearby nucleosomes. Moreover, ASH2 occupancy correlates with phosphorylated forms of RNA polymerase II and histone positive marks in active genes. RNA Pol II phosphorylation in Ser5 is reduced in ash2 mutants, indicating that ASH2 plays a role in promoter stalling.

DESIGN
Examination of three histone modifications and two polymerase modifications in wing imaginal dics cells.
