TITLE
Gene expression signature of Lewis rats with experimental NMO and controls

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
study was performed to reveal the extent to which NMO-IgG contributes to tissue damage in experimental NMO

DESIGN
Gene expression was studied in Lewis rats after transfer of myelin basic protein-specific T cells on day 0 and NMO-IgG on day 4. The animals were sacrificed 24 hours later. Controls did either not receive T cells (0), did receive control IgG or PBS instead of NMO-IgG, or were left completely untreated.
