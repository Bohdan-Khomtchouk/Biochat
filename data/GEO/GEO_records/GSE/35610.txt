TITLE
Global transcriptional profile at a higher fermentation temperature in jinggangmyicn-producing S.hygroscopicus 5008

ORGANISM
Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. jinggangensis 5008

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular mechanism of the positive thermoregulation on Jinggangmycin A biosynthesis, the transcriptomes of  S. hygroscopicus 5008 cultivated at 30℃ or 37℃ in liquid medium were compared by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Global gene expression in the strain 5008 was measured at 30℃ or 37℃, respectively. Three independent experiments were performed at each condition.

PLATFORM
GPL15170 Agilent Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. jinggangensis 15K [Agilent-025874]
