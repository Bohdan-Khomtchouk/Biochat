TITLE
Global transcriptional profile at a higher fermentation temperature in jinggangmyicn-producing S.hygroscopicus 5008

ORGANISM
Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. jinggangensis

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular mechanism of the positive thermoregulation on Jinggangmycin A biosynthesis, the transcriptomes of  S. hygroscopicus 5008 cultivated at 30℃ or 37℃ in liquid medium were compared by microarray analysis.
