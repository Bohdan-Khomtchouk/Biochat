TITLE
Azaspiracid exposure to lymphocyte T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human lymphocyte T cells in vitro were exposed to azaspiracid (1 or 10 nM) for 1, 4, or 24 hours.  Time matched controls (methanol 0.1% v/v) was used.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted and gene expression changes observed using Agilents whole genome array.  n =2 at 1 hr and n = 3 at 4 and 24 hr.  At least one array from each time point utilized a dye swap.
