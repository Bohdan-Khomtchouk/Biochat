TITLE
SIRT6 and SIRT1 contribute to circadian gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of the hepatic circadian transcriptomes reveals that SIRT6 and SIRT1 separately control transcriptional specificity, and therefore, define distinctly partitioned classes of circadian genes.

DESIGN
Livers from WT and SIRT6 KO mice, and livers from WT and SIRT1 KO mice, were harvested over the circadian cycle at ZT 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 for gene expression analysis.
