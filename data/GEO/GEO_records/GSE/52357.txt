TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the mandibular arch from Alk5 mutant mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to investigate the role of TGF-beta signaling in tissue-tissue interactions between myogenic precursors of craniofacial muscles and cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs). Here, we conducted gene expression profiling of the mandibular arch from mice at embryonic day E11.5 with a CNCC-specific conditional inactivation of the TGF-beta  receptor type 1 gene Alk5. These mice provide a model of microglossia as well as disrupted extraocular and masticatory muscle development, which are congenital birth defects commonly observed in several syndromic conditions.

DESIGN
To investigate the adverse effects of dysfunctional TGF-beta signaling on tissue-tissue interactions between CNCCs and myogenic precursors of craniofacial muscles, we analyzed mandibular arch tissue of mice with a CNCC-specific conditional inactivation of Alk5 (Wnt1-Cre; Alk5 fl/fl). We performed microarray analyses of the mandibular arch  of  Alk5 fl/fl control mice and Wnt1-Cre; Alk5 fl/fl mutant mice, collected at embryonic day E11.5 (n=4 per group).
