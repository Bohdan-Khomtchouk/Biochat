TITLE
BET Bromodomain inhibition promotes neurogenesis while inhibiting gliogenesis in neural progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neural stem cells (NSCs) and progenitor cells (NPCs) are increasingly appreciated to hold great promise for regenerative medicine to treat CNS injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. However, evidence for effective stimulation of neuronal production from endogenous or transplanted NPCs for cell replacement with small molecules remains limited. To identify novel chemical entities/targets for neurogenesis, we had established a NPC phenotypic screen assay and validated it using known small-molecule neurogenesis inducers. Through screening small molecule libraries with annotated targets, we identified BET bromodomain inhibition as a novel mechanism for enhancing neurogenesis. BET bromodomain proteins, Brd2, Brd3, and Brd4 were found to be downregulated in NPCs upon differentiation, while their levels remain unaltered in proliferating NPCs. Consistent with the pharmacological study using bromodomain selective inhibitor (+)-JQ-1,  knockdown of each BET protein resulted in an increase in the number of neurons with simultaneous reduction in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Gene expression profiling analysis demonstrated that BET bromodomain inhibition induced a broad but specific transcription program enhancing directed differentiation of NPCs into neurons  while suppressing cell cycle progression and gliogenesis. Together, these results highlight a crucial role of BET proteins as promising epigenetic regulators in NPC development and suggest a therapeutic potential of BET inhibitors in treating CNS injury and neurodegenerative diseases.

DESIGN
NPCs were treated with (+)-JQ-1 or inactive enantiomer (-)-JQ-1 at 0.2 μM or 0.5 μM for 12 and 24 hrs in differentiation medium. The experiments were carried out in  3 independent preparations of NPCs (triplicates)
