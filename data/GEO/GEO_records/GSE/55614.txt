TITLE
Genome-wide Mapping of ARRB1 Reveals its Role as a HIF1A Transcriptional Co-regulator and Regulator of Cellular Metabolism [expression array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Beta-arrestin 1 (ARRB1) has been implicated in transcriptional regulation as part of protein complexes bound to chromatin. Here we investigate its effect on transcription and its potential impact on prostate cancer. We report the first genome-wide mapping of chromatin binding for ARRB1 and combine it with expression array data to define its transcriptome. We identify Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1A (HIF1A) as a nuclear binding partner that recruits ARRB1 to promoter regions of HIF1A targets. We show that ARRB1 modulates HIF1A-dependent transcription and promotes a shift in cellular metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. In addition, we show that ARRB1 plays an important role in neoplastic transformation, cell growth and resistance to hypoxic stress. This is the first example of an endocytic adaptor protein regulating metabolic pathways and implicates ARRB1 as a tumour promoter.

DESIGN
Gene expression of C4-2 cells stably overexpressing ARRB1-GFP or nuclear ARRB1-GFP fusion proteins  were compared with the GFP empty vector control or parental C4-2 cell lines using the illumina expression array platform. There were three biological replicates for the control groups and two for each of the ARRB1 groups.
