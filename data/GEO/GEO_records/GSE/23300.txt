TITLE
Affymetrix SNP6.0 microarray data - Myelodysplastic syndromes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mutations in the TET2 gene are frequent in myeloid disease, although their biological and prognostic significance remains unclear.  We analyzed 355 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes using ‘Next-Generation’ sequencing (NGS) for TET2 aberrations; 91 of whom were also subjected to SNP6 array karyotyping. Seventy-one TET2 mutations, with a relative mutation abundance (RMA) ≥10%, were identified in 39 of 320 (12%) MDS and 16 of 35 (46%) CMML patients (p < 0.001). Interestingly, 4 patients had multiple mutations likely to exist as independent clones or on alternate alleles, suggestive of clonal evolution. ‘Deeper’ sequencing of 96 patient samples identified 4 additional mutations (RMA 3%-6.3%). Importantly, TET2 mutant clones were also found in T cells in addition to CD34+ and total bone-marrow cells (23.5%, 38.5% and 43% RMA respectively). Only 20% of the TET2-mutated patients showed loss of heterozygosity at the TET2 locus. There was no difference in the frequency of genome-wide aberrations, TET2 expression or the JAK2V617F 46/1 haplotype between TET2-mutated and non-mutated patients. There was no significant prognostic association between TET2 mutations and WHO subtypes, IPSS score, cytogenetic status, or transformation to AML. On multivariate analysis, age ( > 50yrs) was associated with a higher incidence of TET2 mutation (p=0.02).

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples. Copy number and acquired UPD analysis of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays was performed for 91 cases with Myelodysplastic syndromes.
