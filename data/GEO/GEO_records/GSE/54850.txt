TITLE
Dynamic mRNA gene expression during a nutritional downshift from glutamine to proline

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Dynamic mRNA gene expression from the wildtype YSBN6 during a nutritional downshift from glutamine to proline. Glutamine and proline were initially together in the media, with cells consuming exlusively glutamine (proline utilization inhibited due to nitrogen catabolite repression). The concentration of glutamine was frequently evaluated at-line, and the moment at which glutamine was not detected anymore is referred to as the time of the shift.

DESIGN
Given the uncertainty of the exact time of the shift, two samples were taken at steady-state, approximately 10 and 5 minutes before the shift. Once the shift was identified, samples were taken 3, 7, 10, 14, 24, 56 and 120 minutes after the glutamine depletion. Biological triplicate gene expression was measured for samples -10, 7 and 24 minutes after shift, for a total of 15 chips. Changes were generally evaluated relative to the steady-state point (-10 minutes). Biological variability can be assessed from the replicates time points. Other dynamic omics data are associated with this dataset. Consult the publication for more details.
