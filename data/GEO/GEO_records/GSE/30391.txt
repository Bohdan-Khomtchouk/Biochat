TITLE
Expression data from human Wharton's jelly stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human umbilical cord Whartonâ€™s jelly stem cells (WHJSC) are gaining attention as a possible clinical source of mesenchymal stem cells for use in cell therapy and tissue engineering due to their high accessibility, expansion potential and plasticity. However, the cell viability changes that are associated to sequential cell passage of these cells are not known. In this analysis, we have identified the gene expression changes that are associated to cell passage in WHJSC. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cell passage on WHJSC.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from three different samples corresponding to cell cultures of three different individuals at each cell passage (P1 to P10) of WHJSC.
