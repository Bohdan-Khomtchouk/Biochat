TITLE
Genes regulated by TAZ in a lung fibroblast cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the roles of TAZ in lung fibroblasts, we compared the expression profiles of a lung fibroblast cell line, HFL-1, transfected with control siRNA and siTAZ.

DESIGN
We collected RNA from HFL-1 cells transfected with control siRNA and siTAZ. Two kinds of TAZ siRNAs (siTAZ #1 and siTAZ #2) were used. Two biological replicates (rep1 and rep2) were used for each condition.
