TITLE
Mammalian cells acquire epigenetic hallmarks of human cancer during immortalization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Progression to malignancy requires cells to overcome senescence and switch to an immortal phenotype. Thus, exploring the genetic and epigenetic changes that occur during senescence/immortalization may help elucidate crucial events that lead to cell transformation. In the present study, we have globally profiled DNA methylation in relation to gene expression in primary, senescent and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Primary, senescent and immortalized mouse fibroblasts obtained from three independent embryos. Compare immortalized versus primary and senescent versus primary cells.
