TITLE
Whole Genome Bisulfite sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana High and Low phosphate methylomes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Pi availability is a significant limiting factor for plant growth in both natural and agricultural systems. To cope with such limiting conditions, plants have adapted developmental and biochemical strategies to enhance Pi acquisition and to avoid starvation. A myriad of genes that are involved in the regulation and display of these strategies have been identified. However, the possible epigenetic components regulating the phosphate starvation responses have not been thoroughly investigated. DNA methylation is a major epigenetic mark involved in diverse biological processes and it may play a critical role in Pi starvation stress adaptation, also changes in DNA methylation can lead to a unique gene expression pattern in response to specific developmental and environmental conditions. Here in we demonstrate that non-CpG DNA methylation is required for proper expression of a number of Pi-limitation responsive genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and results in altered morphologic and physiologic phosphate starvation responses.Our data suggest that DNA methylation is involved in the modulation of Pi starvation responses via the transcriptional regulation of a set of phosphate-starvation responsive genes.
