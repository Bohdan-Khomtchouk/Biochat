TITLE
Integrated analysis, transcriptome-lipidome, reveals the effects of INO-level (INO2 and INO4) on lipid metabolism in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Characterize the transcriptional response to INO2 and INO4 expression level (INO-level) and efficient factor

DESIGN
We used microarrays to capture the global responses of INO-level in Carbon and Nitrogen limited growth.
