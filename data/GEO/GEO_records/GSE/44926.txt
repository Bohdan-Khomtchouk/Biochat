TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of vascular progenitors differentiated from human embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, corresponding donor starting cells, and mature human endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of FACS-purified CD31+CD146+ vascular progenitors (VP) derived from (a) human embryonic stem cells (VP-hESC), (b) adult fibroblast derived induced pluripotent stem cells (VP-AdF-iPSC), (c) stromal primed cord blood CD34+ myeloid progenitor derived iPSC (VP-sp-CB-iPSC), (d) corresponding starting fibroblasts and myeloid progenitors, (e) human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and (f) human dermal microvascular endothelial cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from (a) adult fibroblasts, (b) human myeloid progenitors: Non-nucloefected CD34+ CB cells that were expanded with growth factors from Day -3 until Day 0 and harvested, (c) FACS-purified CD31+CD146+ vascular progenitors (VP) that were differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESC), (d) VP differentiated from low passage stromal-primed episomal iPSC derived from growth-factor activated cord blood myeloid progenitors, (e) VP differentiated from iPSC derived from adult fibroblasts, (f) human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and (g) human dermal microvascular endothelial cells.. Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchips were used for all analyses in this series. Three or independent samples of each sample type were each run on individual microarrays.
