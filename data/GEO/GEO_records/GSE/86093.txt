TITLE
Cxcl1 antagonist on UVB-induced skin inflammation leading to inhibitory effects on photo-skin tumorigensis in Xeroderma pigmentosum type A deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Xeroderma pigmentosum type A (XP-A) is a hereditary disease characterized by early onset of skin cancers development by ultraviolet (UV) exposure. Although etiology of susceptible to skin tumor of XP-A is well investigated as a repair deficiency by UV-induced DNA damage, the mechanism of unusual strong and prolonged skin inflammation caused by UV in XP-A and whether UV-induced inflammatory response relates to skin tumor-prone phenotype remains to be elucidated. Among up-regulated inflammatory response related genes in Xpa mice compared with wild-type by gene profiling study, Cxcl1 in Xpa mice was significantly different from wild-type and blood level of Cxcl1 was increased with UVB exposed on even small area of skin in Xpa mice. We administered Cxcl1 neutralizing antibody or antioxidant agent n-acetylcysteine for Xpa mice after UVB irradiation, showing that blood levels of Cxcl1, ear swelling and skin redness as an inflammatory response were significantly suppressed. Xpa mice with chronic UVB exposure and Cxcl1 neutralizing antibody or n-acetylcysteine administered Xpa mice yields much less skin tumors compared with control group. Those results indicate that highly inflammatory response of Xpa mice by UVB plays a role of skin tumor development that could be suppressed by chemokine as Cxcl1 through antioxidant mechanism.

DESIGN
UVB exposed with 1kJ/m^2 on Xpa mice and wild-type and back skin were collected 3 and 24 hr after UVB irradiation.
