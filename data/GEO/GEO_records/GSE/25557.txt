TITLE
Characterization of Definitive Endoderm formation from HESC and iPSC lines by Microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HESC-H9 and iPSC lines 3.5, 3.6 and 3.12 were analyzed using Affymetrix microarray before and after Definitive Endoderm (DE) formation. DE was induced using the ActivinA differentiation protocol described by D'Amour et al., 2006 (PMID: 16258519)  Clustering analysis of transcripts that were differentially regulated during DE formation indicated that iPSC lines 3.5 and 3.12 differentiate in manner that is highly similar to HESC-H9 cells iPSC line 3.6 had a more divergent transcriptional profile.

DESIGN
Three induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSC) and one human embryonic stem cell line (hESC - H9) were  collected as undifferentiated (UD) cells, and flash frozen.  These cell lines were also subjected to definitive endoderm (DE) induction, collected and flash frozen.  RNA was harvested from the frozen cell pellets and hybridized to the Affymetrix microarray chip. The three iPSC cell lines are iPSC 3.5, iPSC 3.6. and iPSC 3.12.  In the UD state, iPSC 3.5 was analyzed in duplicate, while iPSCs 3.6 and 3.12  and H9s were analyzed in biological triplicate.  All four cell lines were analyzed as biological triplicates for DE induction.
