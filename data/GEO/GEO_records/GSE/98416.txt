TITLE
miRNA sequencing of primary mouse dorsal root ganglia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Peripheral nerve regeneration after injury is a complex process involving a large number of transcriptional changes. How these changes impact the regenerative outcome is though, poorly understood. Here, we take advantage of the genetically based differences in the peripheral and central regenerative capacity of CAST/Ei and C57BL/6j inbred mice to better understand the molecular bases driving superior regeneration in the CAST/Ei mouse strain.

DESIGN
14 samples were analyzed with 3 to 5 biological replicates per sample type

PLATFORM
GPL18635 Ion Torrent Proton (Mus musculus)
