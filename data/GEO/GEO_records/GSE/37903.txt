TITLE
Expression data from AK4 overexpression in CL1-0 lung cancer cell line and AK4 knockdown in CL1-5 lung cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that AK4 down-regulation shRNAs significantly reduced cell migration and invasion in highly invasive lung cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as in lung metastases in vivo We used microarrays to analyze the AK4 regulated gene expression underlying invasion-metastasis cascade.

DESIGN
CL1-0 lung adenocarcinoma cells with AK4 overexpression and CL1-5 cells with AK4 knockdown were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
