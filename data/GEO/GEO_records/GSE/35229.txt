TITLE
Expression data from patient iPSC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Baseline gene expression of patient dermal fibroblasts derived iPSCs generated by lentiviral Yamanaka 4 factors. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patient specific iPSCs.

DESIGN
Compare the global gene expression of iPSCs with hESCs and fibroblasts
