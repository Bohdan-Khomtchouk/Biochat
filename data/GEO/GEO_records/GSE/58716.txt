TITLE
Global analysis of photosynthesis transcriptional regulatory networks [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides

SUMMARY
To gain a deeper understanding of the transcription factors that regulate photosynthesis in Rhodobacter sphaeroides ChIP-seq was used to determine the genome-wide binding locations of 4 transcription factors (FnrL, PrrA, CrpK and RSP_2888) known or predicted to be involved in the regulation of photosynthesis.

DESIGN
Genome-wide protein-DNA interaction analysis of 4 transcription factors known or predicted to be involved in the regulation of photosynthesis in Rhodobacter sphaeroides, using ChIP-seq and complementary assays.
