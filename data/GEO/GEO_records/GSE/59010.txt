TITLE
Genome-wide binding site profiling of NdgR in Streptomyces coelicolor

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
We identified genome-wide binding regions of NdgR in Streptomyces coelicolor using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). We constructed 6×myc-tagged NdgR strain using homologous recombination with myc-tagging vector. Analysis of the sequencing data aligned to Streptomyces coelicolor genome database (NC_003888).

DESIGN
6x-myc tagged Streptomyces coelicolor M145 was cultured on solid minimal media supplemented with N-acetylglucosamine and asparagine during 36hrs. Anti-myc antibody (9E10) was used for immunoprecipitation (IP). IP-DNA was sequenced using Illumina Genome Analyzer Ⅱx
