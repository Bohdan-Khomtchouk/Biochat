Intestinal inflammatory regulation requires high-affinity TCR-ZAP70-mediated Runx3 activity in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
comparing gene expression of SKG and BALBc mice

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from terminal ileum of 8 naïve SKG and 3 naïve BALB/c mice using RNeasy kits (Qiagen). RNA from tissues selected for microarray (10 - 30mg, Bioanalyzer RNA Integrity Scores > 6) was amplified using the TotalPrep RNA amplification kit (Ambion). Amplified RNA was hybrized to Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChip arrays. Arrays were scanned on an Illumina iScan.

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
