TITLE
Gene expression of CD14- cells from RA, PsA and PsO patients with Infliximab treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
objection: The immune inflammatory disorders rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and psoriasis (Ps) share common pathologic features and show responsiveness to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents yet they are phenotypically distinct. The aim of this study was to examine if anti-TNF therapy is associated with divergent gene expression profiles in circulating cells and target tissues of patients with these diseases Method: Peripheral blood CD14+ and CD14- cells were isolated from 9 RA, 12 PsA and 10 Ps patients before and after infliximab (IFX) treatment.

DESIGN
Between April 2007 and June 2009, 31 patients with active RA, PsA and Ps who were naÃ¯ve to anti-TNF agents, were recruited from the Faculty Rheumatology Clinics at the University of Rochester Medical Center after informed, written consent was obtained in a protocol approved by the Research Subjects Review Board at the University of Rochester Medical Center.  Of the 31 subjects, 9 had active RA  and 12 had PsA  despite treatment with Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs). Also, 10 patients with extensive Ps ( > 5% BSA) documented by a dermatologist, were enrolled and they were examined by a rheumatologist to exclude the presence of inflammatory arthritis.  Nineteen healthy controls were also recruited.
