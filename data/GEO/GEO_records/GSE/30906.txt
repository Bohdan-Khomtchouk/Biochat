TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of lung antigen presenting cells gene expression from cigarette smoke exposed mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lung antigen presenting cells isolated from wild type but not Spp1-/- mice induce Th1 and Th17 cells differentiation. The goal of this study is to identify the genes differentially expressed by lung antigen presenting cells from cigarette smoke exposed mice. These genes may play crucial roles in directing Th1 and Th17 cells differentiation.

DESIGN
Lung antigen presenting cells were isolated from lungs of two groups of wild type and Spp1-/- mice that have been exposed to cigarette smoke for 4 months. Total mRNA was extracted from these samples.
