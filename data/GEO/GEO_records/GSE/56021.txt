TITLE
in vitro differentiated Th0, Th17, and Tr1 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of in vitro differentiated murine Th cell subsets. Flow cytometrically sorted naive Th cells (CD4+ CD44- Foxp3-) were polyclonally stimulated in vitro for 3 days using 4 µg/ml plate-bound antibody to CD3 (145-2C11) and 2 µg/ml soluble antibody to CD28 (PV-1). Th0 cells were cultured in the absence of exogenous cytokines. Th17 cells were differentiated with 50 ng/ml IL-6 plus 0.5 ng/ml TGF-β. Tr-1 cells were differentiated with 100 ng/ml IL-27 plus 0.5 ng/ml TGF-β.

DESIGN
Five biological replicates per Th subset (Th0, Th17, Tr1)
