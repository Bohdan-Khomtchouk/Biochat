TITLE
Gene expression profiles of TiPS, HDF-iPS, ES and T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To show the similarity among TiPSCs, HDF-iPSCs and ESCs and the differences between TiPSCs and T cells, this experiment was designed.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated TiPSCs, HDF-iPSCs and ESCs were collected. And stimulated peripheral circulating terminally differentiated T cells were collected. Then, they were applied in this experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
