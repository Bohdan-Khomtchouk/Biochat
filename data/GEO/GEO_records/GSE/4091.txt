TITLE
Histone turnover mediates epigenetic processes in Drosophila S2 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Histone H3 is assembled into nucleosomes during replication but is replaced by the H3.3 variant at sites of active transcription. Thus replacement levels provide a quantitative measure of histone turnover during transcriptional elongation and other active processes in dividing cells. Here we provide new insights into epigenetic regulation with the first genome-wide chromatin profile at 100-bp resolution, based on measurements of H3.3 levels throughout the Drosophila genome.  These data are unpublished. Keywords: Chromatin affinity-purification on microarray

DESIGN
Chromatin affinity profiling of histones H3 and H3.3 on Drosophila tiling arrays
