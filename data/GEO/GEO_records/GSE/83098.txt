TITLE
Gene expression analysis of RNAs isolated from WT and ZIP10-depleted human keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To reveal the mechanisms by which ZIP10 contributes to keratinocyte differentiation, we used mRNAs isolated from human wild-type (WT) and ZIP10-knockdown (KD) keratinocytes in gene expression microarray analyses

DESIGN
Duplicate experiments were performed for WT and ZIP10-KD human keratinocytes. Total RNA was isolated from the WT and ZIP10 KD keratinocytes using Qiazol (Qiagen) following the manufacturerâ€™s protocol
