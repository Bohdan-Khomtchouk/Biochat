TITLE
GSK3 inhibition Induces Glioma Cell Death through c-MYC, NF-kB and Glucose Regulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified GSK3 as a regulator of GBM cell survival using microarray analysis, small molecule and genetic inhibitors of GSK3 activity.  Various molecular and genetic approaches were then employed to dissect out the molecular mechanisms responsible for GSK3 inhibition-induced cytotoxicity. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
RNA extracted from U251 cells treated with DMSO or Enzastaurin for indicated time were hybridized to Affymetrix expression arrays (HG_U133-Plus_2) to detect changes in gene expression caused by Enzastaurin. Three replicates per sample were used.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
