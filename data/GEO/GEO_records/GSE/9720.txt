TITLE
Microarray expression profiling of C. elegans N2 L4 control(RNAi) vs. mdt-15(RNAi)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We previously showed that the C. elegans Mediator subunit MDT-15 impacts expression of select genes involved in fatty acid (FA) metabolism (Taubert et al, Genes & Dev, 2006). To comprehensively identify processes downstream of MDT-15 in an unbiased manner, we set out to globally discover new MDT-15-dependent genes. Keywords: Expression profiling, RNAi depletion
