TITLE
FOXM1 Cistrome Predicts Breast Cancer Metastatic Outcome Better Than FOXM1 Expression Levels or Tumor Proliferation Index [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FOXM1 is a key transcription factor regulating cell cycle progression, DNA damage response, and a host of other hallmark cancer features, but the role of the FOXM1 cistrome in driving estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) vs. ER- breast cancer clinical outcomes remains undefined.

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) coupled with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses was used to identify FOXM1 target genes in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) where FOXM1 expression was either induced by cell proliferation or repressed by p53 upregulation.
