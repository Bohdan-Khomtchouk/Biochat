TITLE
Expression data from human cell line infected by human cytomegalovirus with over-expression lncRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA2.7 is a long non-coding RNA encoded by HCMV, which has be reported related with apoptosis. We have found RNA2.7 can also affect virus replication. We used the microarrays to look for HCMV RNA2.7 related host transcripts.

DESIGN
We infected HELF cells by HCMV BAC HAN which was contructed from a HCMV clinical isolate, and BAC HAN^RNA2.7 which was a mutant of BAC HAN by deletion of RNA2.7. By running microarray and bioanalysis, we aimed to find RNA2.7 involvement in host and virus replication and transcription.
