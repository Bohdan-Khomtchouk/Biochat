TITLE
reversible and irreversible Thy-1 nephritis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To identify genes that play an important role in the irreversible progression of renal injury, we used microarray technology to identify differences in gene expression between these models. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Rats were intravenously injected with mAb 1-22-3 one week after unilateral nephrectomy (irreversible model) or a sham operation (reversible model), and rats were sacrificed on day 4, 7, 14, 42, and 56 after the injection. cDNA probes prepared from kidney mRNAs were hybridized with oligonucleotide microarrays containing 4854 rat genes.
