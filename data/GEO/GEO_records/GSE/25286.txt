TITLE
mRNA expression profile in a murine model of hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed miRNA and mRNA profiling at postnatal day 14 and day 29 to compare hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia  and wild type. We built potential miRNA-mRNA interaction networks specific to brochopulmonary dysplasia.

DESIGN
Replicated time course of mouse lung development at 2 time points (P14, P29). Three replicates per time point for bronchopulmonary dysplasia induced by hyperoxia mouse lung, and two replicates per time point for wild type mouse lung. This dataset represents the mRNA expression profiling component of the study.
