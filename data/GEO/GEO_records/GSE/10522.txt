TITLE
Expression data of Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes during chilling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To investigate the response of Arabidopsis thaliana plants to non-freezing, cool temperatures, we subjected four week old plants to various chilling temperatures at defined times during the diurnal cycle to control for diurnal effects on transcription. From the same plants, metabolites and enzyme activities were measured as well. Interestingly a gradual change could be observed over a wide range of temperatures. Some of which could be attributed to the CBF program. Keywords: time course, different temperatures

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes from 4 week old plants at a time point four hours into the light-period were transfered to various " chilling " temperatures (20 [control], 17, 14, 12, 10 and 8Â°C] and harvested after 6 or 78 hours (both 10 hours into the light period). 6 continuous treatments X 2 timepoints X 2 replicates
