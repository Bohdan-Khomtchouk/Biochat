TITLE
Identification of miRNA targets in breast cancer cells (DICER1 and DROSHA knockdown)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNAs regulate mRNA stability and translation through the action of the RNAi-induced silencing complex. In this study, we systematically identified endogenous miRNA target genes by using AGO2 immunoprecipitation (AGO2-IP) and microarray analyses in two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, representing luminal and basal-like breast cancer, respectively. The expression levels of ~70% of the AGO2-IP mRNAs were increased by DROSHA or DICER1 knockdown. In addition, integrated analysis of miRNA expression profiles, mRNA-AGO2 interaction, and the 3'-UTR of mRNAs revealed that > 60% of the AGO2-IP mRNAs were putative targets of the fifty most abundantly expressed miRNAs.

DESIGN
To identify mRNAs responsive to miRNA synthesis inhibition, total RNA was prepared from control cells and cells that stably express small hairpin RNA against DICER1 or DROSHA. Expression array analysis was performed with duplicates for each cell type.
