TITLE
Gene expression of murine STAT3-KO hearts vs WT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of heart tissue probes from a mouse model with a cardiomyocyte-restricted STAT3 deficiency in comparison to corresponding WT mice. (Hilfiker-Kleiner, D. et al. 2004)

DESIGN
Comparison of heart left ventricle tissue probes from STAT3-KO and WT mice. Each sample is a pool of 5 tissue probes from each genotype.
