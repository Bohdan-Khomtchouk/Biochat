TITLE
Gene expression in adipose tissue and liver from a spontaneous rat model of Type 2 diabetes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by hyperglycaemia and defects in insulin secretion and action at target tissues. Using the Illumina RatRef-12 v1.0 array, gene expression was assessed in two insulin-target tissues (liver and adipose tissue) from seven-month-old spontaneously diabetic (Goto-Kakizaki [GK]) and non-diabetic (Brown-Norway [BN]) rats. This study was performed in parallel with miRNA expression profiling of the same rats.

DESIGN
Experiment comparing GK and BN rat strains for two different tissues. Biological replicates: 4 GK and 5 BN for adipose tissue and 3 GK and 5 BN for liver (RNA extracted from both tissues per rat). One sample hybridised to each array.
