TITLE
HOXA3 expression in wound tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate how HOXA3 expression in wound tissue alters gene expression to control selective recruitment of bone marrow-derived cell populations, we utilized murine whole genome expression arrays (MEEBO arrays) to identify differentially expressed genes in cutaneous wounds from db/db (diabetic) mice treated with either CMV-HOXA3 or control plasmid.  In addition to unwounded control skin, we chose day 4 as the time point to harvest the wounds for RNA isolation, which represents the transition from inflammatory to proliferative phase of wound repair, and precedes the observed differences in BMDC mobilization and recruitment at day 7. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Disease State: cutaneous wound/control skin

DESIGN
unwounded skin, wounded skin treated with control plasmid, wounded skin treated with HOXA3
