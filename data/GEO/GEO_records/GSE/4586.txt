TITLE
Effect of caffeine on WT versus 3HA-TOR1 [I1954V + W2176R]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Comparing the effects of caffeine on cells expressing either WT 3HA-TOR1 or 3HA-TOR1 [I1954V + W2176R] Keywords: Dose response in wild type versus mutant

DESIGN
tor1 deletion cells in the W303a background were transformed with either p3HA-TOR1 or p3HA-TOR1 [I1954V + W2176R] and were treated with 0, 3, 6, and 9 mM caffeine.
