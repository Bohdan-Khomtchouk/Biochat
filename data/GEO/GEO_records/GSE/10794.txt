TITLE
Drosophila melanogaster small RNA sequence: cell lines and imaginal disc

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster small RNAs. total RNA, ~18-26nt RNAs isolated using PAGE, ligation to adapters requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH Keywords: High-throughput solexa sequencing

DESIGN
Small RNAs were sequenced from D. melanogaster S2 and KC cells. Raw sequences were clipped by 3' linker sequences recognition, and select clipped sequences longer than 18 nt
