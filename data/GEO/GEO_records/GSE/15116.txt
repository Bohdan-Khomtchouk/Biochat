TITLE
PIK3C A/B/D expression distinctions between LumA/LumB, and between PIK3CA mut/wt, breast cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This ER+ patient dataset was used to retrieve gene expression values for the PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and PIK3CD genes.  Patient data was separated into two groups for two separate analyses to determine statistical differences between means of the PIK3 genes between 1) LumA and LumB patients, and 2) PIK3CA mutant and wildtype patients. Keywords: Gene expression profiling

DESIGN
Patient tumors were profiled on Agilent's 1x44k Whole Human Genome array.  Patient tumor RNA was amplified and labeled in the cy5 channel and competitively hybridized with a reference control sample that was amplified and labeled in the cy3 channel. 75 patient experiments were included: 31 LumA and 44 LumB, 27 PIK3CA mutant and 47 PIK3CA wild-type.
