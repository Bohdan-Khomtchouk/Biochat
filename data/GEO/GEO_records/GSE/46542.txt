TITLE
Focal amplification of HOXD-harboring chromosome region is implicated in multiple-walled carbon nanotubes-induced carcinogenicity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Amplificaition of HOXD9 and HOXD13 genes was found in MWCNTs induced carcinogencity. By overexpression or silence of of HOXD9 and HOXD13 gene may alter tumorigenicity. To investigate the realted signaling pathways invovled in HOXD regulated tumorigencity, we analyzed the gene expression profile of the HOXD9 or HOXD13 overexpression HEK293 cells, which compared to vehicle expressing cells

DESIGN
HEK293 cells was transfected with HA-tag-HOXD9 and V5-tag HOXD13 vector, and further selected by G418. Three independnent clones and mix clones of each genes were selected, and compared to corresponding tag control cell. (HA-HOXD9-mix, a, b, c v.s HA-MOCK-1, 2, 3) (V5-HOXD13-mix, a, b, c v.s V5-MOCK-1, 2, 3)
