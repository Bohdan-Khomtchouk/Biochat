TITLE
Neoblast expression in head and tail regeneration

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
X1 neoblasts (G2/S/M cells) were isolated by FACS from injury site-proximal tissue in a timeseries during head (anterior) and tail (posterior) regeneration in Schmidtea mediterranea

DESIGN
24 samples: 2 treatments (head versus tail regeneration), 3 timepoints (0,24,48,72 hours post amputation), 3 biological replicates each condition

PLATFORM
GPL18464 Agilent-045271 Smed_v5_array_111412
