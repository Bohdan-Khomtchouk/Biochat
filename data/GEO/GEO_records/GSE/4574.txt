TITLE
Normal vs. Tumor Prostate miRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of miRNA expression profiles in a small set of prostate needle core biopsies or fine needle aspirates. Keywords: Expression profiling of prostate needle core biopsies

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression was compared between a pooled normal sample consisting of 10 separate normal adjacent to tumor prostate needle core biopsies, two prostate tumor cell lines (PC3 and LNCaP), two needle core biopsies, and a fine needle aspirate of a prostate tumor metastasis to the supraclavicular lymph node. MicroRNA was isolated from fresh frozen tissue sections of the needle core biopsies using the mirVana miRNA Isolation kit from Ambion per the manufacturer's instructions.  MicroRNA was amplified using 10 ng input and 750 ng of amplified material was subsequently labeled for hybridization.  All samples were normalized to the same normal prostate control.
