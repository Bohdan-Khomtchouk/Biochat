TITLE
Functional and evolutionary significance of human microRNA seed region mutations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Data for miR-429, miR-205, miR-200b, and miR-141 were each compared independently to the  same negative control data contained in the raw .CEL files nc-miR-1-1.CEL, nc-miR-1-2.CEL and nc-miR-1-3.CEL.  For each miRNA, the negative control data were re-normalized together with data only from that specific miRNA.  The experiment for M12 was performed at a later date and an independent set of negative control data was collected at that time. Therefore, only M12 data was compared to the negative control data contained in the raw .CEL files nc-miR-2-1.CEL, nc-miR-2-2.CEL, and nc-miR-2-3.CEL.
