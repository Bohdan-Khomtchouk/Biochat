TITLE
Human gastric mucosa: 3 paired hTERT-negative para cancerous tissue (Control) vs. hTERT-positive gastric cancer tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The lncRNA expression profiles in three pairs of hTERT-positive gastric cancer tissue sand hTERT-negative para-cancerous tissues. The para-cancerous tissue is at least 5cm away from the cancer tissue. The expression of hTERT of identified by immunohistochemistry before RNA extraction for lncRNA assay.

DESIGN
LncRNAs/mRNAs in 3 gastric cancer tissue and 3 paired para-cancerous tissue (Control) by microarray using Arraystar Human LncRNA Microarray v2.0

PLATFORM
GPL15314 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent_033010 Probe Name version)
