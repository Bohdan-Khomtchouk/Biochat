TITLE
Human airway inflammatory cell response to LPS and house dust mite antigen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Allergic asthmatic, allergy only, asthma only (no allergy), and non-allergic non-asthmatic (control) subjects underwent bronchoscopy with instillation of saline, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and house dust mite antigen in separate subsegmental bronchi. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected four hours later (three samples per subject). Inflammatory cells from each specimen were isolated and RNA was extracted for microarray analysis. Keywords: gene expression arrays (two-dye: sample against common 'universal' reference RNA)
