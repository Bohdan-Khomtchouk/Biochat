TITLE
The RNA helicase DDX39B regulates IL7R alternative splicing reducing the risk of Multiple Sclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goal of this study is to investigate the role of DDX39B in RNA splicing Methods: RNA-Seq splicing analysis of HeLa cells with experimentally induced DDX39B expression knockdown

DESIGN
DDX39B expression is reduced in HeLa cells by siRNAs. Effects on alternative RNA splicing are compared between knockdown and control cells.
