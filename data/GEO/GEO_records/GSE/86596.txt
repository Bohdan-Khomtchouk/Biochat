TITLE
Mafb lineage tracing marks macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Current systems for conditional gene deletion within mouse macrophage lineages are limited by ectopic activity or low efficiency; we generated a Mafb-driven Cre strain to determine whether any dendritic cells (DCs) identified by Zbtb46-GFP expression originate from a Mafb-expressing population

DESIGN
Ly-6C(hi) monocytes, Ly-6C(lo) YFP(-) monocytes, and Ly-6C(lo) YFP(+) monocytes were isolated by FACS from blood samples harvested from MafB-mCherry-Cre x R26-stop-YFP x Zbtb46-GFP lineage-tracing mice
