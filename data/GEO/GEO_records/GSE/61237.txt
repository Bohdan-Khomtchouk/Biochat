TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for high-grade serous ovarian cancer samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most aggressive histological type of epithelial ovarian cancer, which is characterized by a high frequency of somatic TP53 mutations. To provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of these cancers and to develop a risk classification system, we conducted profiling of the copy number alterations present in these tumors.

DESIGN
Thirty patients who were diagnosed as high-grade serous ovarian cancer were recruited in this study. Affymetrix SNP array were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from high-grade serous ovarian cancer tissues or peripheral blood samples.
