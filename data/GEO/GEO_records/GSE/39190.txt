TITLE
B-Raf activation cooperates with PTEN loss to drive c-Myc expression in advanced prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Anaysis of the response to different therapeutic agents at the transcriptional level. The design of the experiment allows to determine how the comnination target therapy (Rapamycin + PD0325901) treatment shifted the transcriptome towards a less aggressive or even a wild type phenotype. It also allows exploring the molecular changes involved in the transition from a non metastatic to a metastatic prostate cancer mouse model.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained form vehicle treated Nkx3.1CE2/+; Ptenf/f; BrafCA/+ (n=3), combinatorial Rapamycin and PD0325901 treated Nkx3.1CE2/+; Ptenf/f; BrafCA/+ (n=3) and vehicle treated intact Nkx3.1CE2/+; Ptenf/f (n = 6) prostate.
