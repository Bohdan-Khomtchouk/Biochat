TITLE
Expression data of NCI-H441 cells stably expressing hsa-mir-365-2 vs empty vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hsa-mir-365-2 is one of the two precursors that give rise to miR-365. We discovered that miR-365 directly regulates a lung cancer and developmental gene termed thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1 or NKX2-1). Hsa-mir-365-2 was transfected into NCI-H441 cells via retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Arrays hybridized: Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array.

DESIGN
A total of 4 samples were analyzed. The first two were H441 cells expressing hsa-mir-365-2 and the other two were H441 transfected with empty vector. The class comparison function (significant cutoff, 0.001) of BRB Array Tool (4.1.0 beta_3 release) was used to analyze for differentially expressed genes as a result of enforced expression of hsa-mir-365-2.
