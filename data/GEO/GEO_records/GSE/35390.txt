TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles of Adult Human Olfactory Bulb and Embryonic Neural Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression profiling was performed using RNA from human embryonic neural stem cells (hENSCs) and adult human olfactory bulb-derived neural stem cells (OBNSCs) to define a gene expression pattern and signaling pathways that are specific for each cell lineage. Subtractive gene expression profiling between both cell lineages provides a list of potential genes that are related to their multipotentiality, proliferation, migration, and alternative signaling pathways. To confirm the validity of our DNA microarray data, our results were compared with data from various databases.

DESIGN
The gene expression profile of adult olfactory bulb neural stem cells (n=6) was compared with that of human embryonic neural stem cells (n=3).
