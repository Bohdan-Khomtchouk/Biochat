TITLE
Identification of novel imprinted differentially methylated regions by global analysis of human parthenogenetic induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Parental imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon by which genes are expressed in a monoallelic fashion, according to their parent-of-origin. DNA methylation is considered the hallmark mechanism regulating parental imprinting. To identify imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we compared the DNA methylation status between multiple normal and parthenogenetic human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) by performing reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Our analysis identified over twenty previously unknown imprinted DMRs in addition to the known DMRs. These include DMRs in loci associated with human disorders, and a class of intergenic DMRs that do not seem to be related to gene expression. Furthermore, the study showed some DMRs to be unstable, liable to differentiation or reprogramming. A comprehensive comparison between mouse and human DMRs identified almost half of the imprinted DMRs to be species-specific. Taken together our data map novel DMRs in the human genome, their evolutionary conservation, and relation to gene expression.

DESIGN
RRBS profiles were generated from 6 parthenogenetic iPSC lines (hiPS A11, hiPS A20, hIPS A26, hiPS B34, hiPS B36, hiPS B41)  and fibroblasts from the 2 parents whose ovarian teratomas were used to derive the iPSC lines, for a total of 8 samples.
