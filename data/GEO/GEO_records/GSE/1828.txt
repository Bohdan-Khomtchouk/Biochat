TITLE
Comparison of Trypanosoma cruzi strains from patients with indeterminate and cardiac forms of Chagas disease

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma cruzi

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles in T. cruzi strains isolated from individuals presenting the indeterminate and cardiac forms of Chagas disease. Genetic markers differentially expressed may be of potential use in diagnostic/prognostic tests and could assist the understanding of pathogenesis of Chagas disease Keywords: other
