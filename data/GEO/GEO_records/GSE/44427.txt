TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of donor cells, low passage episomal stromal and non-stromal primed myeloid iPSC, and hESC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of (a) human embryonic stem cells, (b) low passage episomal stromal-primed iPSC derived from growth-factor activated CD34+ myeloid progenitors from cord blood or GCSF mobilized peripheral blood, and (d) samples of donor fibroblasts or myeloid progenitors

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from indicated donor cells, hESC, or iPSC. Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchips were used for all analyses in this series. A single sample of each cell line was used for this analysis.
