TITLE
Microarray analysis of mediastinal lymph node of pigs naturally affected by postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is one of the pig diseases with major economic impact worldwide. Clinical, pathologic and some immunologic aspects of this disease are well-known, but the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic mechanisms of the disease are still poorly understood. The objective of the present study was to investigate the global changes in gene expression in the mediastinal lymph nodes from pigs naturally affected by PMWS and healthy counterparts, using the Affymetrix Porcine GenechipÂ®.  This is the first study on gene expression in pigs naturally affected by PMWS. The present results allowed identifying potential mechanisms underlying the inflammation, lymphocyte depletion in lymphoid tissues and immune suppression, which are key features of PMWS.

DESIGN
A total of twenty-five conventional 13 to 15-week-old pigs were used in this study. Animals were selected from three farms with historical records of PMWS and free of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Pseudorabies virus (PRV) infections. Twelve out of the 25 pigs fulfilled the PMWS diagnosis and were selected as cases, and the remaining thirteen pigs were selected as healthy control animals. At least one case and one control were used from each farm. 25 microarrays were used in the experiment, corresponding to the RNAs from mediastinal lymph nodes of 12 PMWS-affected pigs and 13 healthy controls.
