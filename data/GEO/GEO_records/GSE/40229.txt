TITLE
Bbssk1 dependent gene expression in Beauveria bassiana

ORGANISM
Beauveria bassiana ARSEF 2860

SUMMARY
Ssk1-type response regulator proteins are the core elements of histidine-to-aspartate systems that mediate fungal stress tolerance, a determinant to the biocontrol potential of fungal entomopathogens. We characterized for the first time the functions of Beauveria bassiana Ssk1 (Bbssk1) by analyzing multi-phenotypic changes in DBbssk1 and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the digital gene expression (DGE) libraries of DBbssk1 and wild-type constructed under osmotic stress. The results revealed 1003 DEGs, of which many associated with conidiation, xenotics transport, cell wall integrity, and protein and carbohydrate metabolism were greatly down-regulated.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Bbssk1 disruption mutant subjected to 0.5 M NaCl for 30 minutes compared to the wild type strain under the same stress treatment.
