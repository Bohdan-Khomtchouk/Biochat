TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures of CTCF-expressing vs CTCF-depleted hepatocellular carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the functional role of CTCF in the oncogenesis of HCC, we constructed lentiviruses expressing control shRNA (shCont) or shRNA agains CTCF (shCTCF) and transduced them into PLC5 cells respectively. After 24 hours, cells were cultered in puromycin containing medium (5 ug) for another 24 hours. Cells were returned to normal medium for another 48 hours before total mRNAs were corrected for whole genome gene expression array analysis. Expression of FoxM1 gene from this signature was quantified in an independent set of RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming differntial expression of this gene in shCTCF expressing cells.

DESIGN
Gene expressions were measured in PLC5 cells transduced with lentivirues expressing non-targeting shRNA or shRNA against CTCF followed by growing in puromycin selection media for 24 hours.
