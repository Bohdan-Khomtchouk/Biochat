TITLE
Expression data from Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 wild-type and SMc03169 gene deletion mutant

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
Within this work we identified and characterized SMc03169 (hhrA) as a new Sinorhizobium meliloti gene product with relevance to biological nitrogen fixation symbiosis with leguminous plants. HhrA belongs to the TetR-family of repressors and its deletion from S. meliloti genome affected considerably gene expression as well as several phenotypic traits.

DESIGN
For expression profiling, triplicates of the wild-type Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 or the SMc03169 (delta hhrA) deletion mutant were grown in GMS liquid medium supplemented with 10 micromolar of luteolin for 4 hours at 30ÂºC and 180 rpm, followed by total RNA extraction.
