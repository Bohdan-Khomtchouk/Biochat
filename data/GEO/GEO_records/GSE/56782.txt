TITLE
Acrolein-mediated changes in HUVEC miRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acrolein is a major reactive component of vehicle exhaust, cigarette and wood smoke. It is also present in several food substances and is generated endogenously during inflammation and lipid peroxidation. Although previous studies have shown that dietary or inhalation exposure to acrolein results in endothelial activation, platelet activation and accelerated atherogenesis, the basis for these effects is unknown. Moreover, the effects of acrolein on microRNA (miRNA) have not been studied. Using AGILENT miRNA microarray high throughput technology, we have thus characterized the effects of acrolein exposure on miRNA expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).

DESIGN
2 condition, acrolein-exposed and vehicle exposed; 4 replicates of each
