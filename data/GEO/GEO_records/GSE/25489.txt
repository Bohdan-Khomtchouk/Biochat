TITLE
Gene expression changes in wild type, tga2tga3tga5tga6, and sid2-2 plants after treatment with the safeners mefenpyr and isoxadifen

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression changes in safener- or BF-treated wild type (Col0) or mutants (tga2tga3tga5tga6, sid2-2) of the salicylic acid signaling pathway.

DESIGN
Measurements of three biological samples were prepared for each genotype.
