TITLE
The effect of deficiency of BLT2 receptor on the gene expression in mouse skin during wound healing process

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Examination of gene expression in the skin of C57Black6 mice deficient in BLT2 receptor and control WT before and after skin punching.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from punch biopsies (5 mm in diameter) by using the Qiagen RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). In case of punched skin, the samples were taken after 2 days of skin punching. RNA from three mice per group was mixed and used for labeling. Probe cDNA was amplified and labeled with an Illumina total prep RNA amplification kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol and then used for hybridization with Illumina MouseWG-6 Expression BeadChip arrays. The signals were quantified by using the Illumina BeadStation with BeadArray technology, and the raw data were obtained by using Illumina BeadStudio software.
