TITLE
Expression analysis of RNAi mediated ALPPL2 knockdown in ALPPL2 expressing Panc-1 cells (Panc-1+ve)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentially expressing genes in whole genome wide analysis of ALPPL2 expressing Panc-1 cells (Panc-1+ve) via siRNA mediated knockdown of ALPPL2 Panc-1 +ve and Panc-1-ve cell lines were generated from  Panc-1 cell line based upon its hetergenous binding to aptamer SQ2. Detailed procedure of generation of these cell lines are described in Pooja Dua, Hye Suk Kang, Seung-Mo Hong, Ming-Sound Tsao, Soyoun Kim, and Dong-ki Lee. 2012 Alkaline Phosphatase ALPPL2 is a novel pancreatic carcinoma-associated protein. Cancer Research

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA recovered from Panc-1+ve cells transfected with siALPPL2-2, siALPPL2-3, siGFP control  and Lipofectamine 2000 treatament . Each chip measures 45,033 genes with three  60 mer probe pairs per target.
