NINDS Rat Hippocampus Seizures

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study aims to investigate age-specific, time-dependent changes in gene expression that may underlie the priming effect of early-life seizures by looking at the sequence of gene expression patterns in the hippocampus at various times following Kainate induced seizures at postnatal day (P) 15.
