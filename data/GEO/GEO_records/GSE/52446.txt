TITLE
Molecular Analysis of the Genes Involved in Aroma Synthesis in the Species S. cerevisiae, S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus var. uvarum in Winemaking

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Saccharomyces kudriavzevii ; Saccharomyces uvarum

SUMMARY
This research work investigates the hybridization of the genes of Saccharomyces bayanus var. uvarum CECT 12600 and S. kudriavzevii IFO1802 employing S. cerevisiae microarrays.

DESIGN
Two strains,one S. kudriavzevii and one S. bayanus var. uvarum were employed for the study. The S. cerevisiae strain S288C was used as control for microarray hybridizations. All experiments were performed using duplicate arrays, and Cy5-dCTP and Cy3-dCTP dye-swap assays were performed to reduce dye-specific bias.
