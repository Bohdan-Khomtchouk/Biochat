TITLE
Gene expression profiles in 786-O cells in response to glucose starvation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand gene expression profiling in glucose starvation, we treated 786-O cells with and without glucose, and then subjected to next generation sequencing.

DESIGN
RNA profiling of 786-O cells in two conditions

PLATFORM
GPL9520 AB SOLiD System (Homo sapiens)
