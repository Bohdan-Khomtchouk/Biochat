TITLE
Hypoxic MDA-MB-231 U133 Plus 2.0 array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiR-544 was inhibited by either a miR-544 antagomir or compound 1 under hypoxic conditions in MDA-MB-231 cells U133 Plus 2.0 microarray was utilized to examine the specificity of 1 for miR-544.

DESIGN
3 MDA-MB-231 samples treated with a miR-544 antagomir or compound 1 were subjected to hypoxia for a period of 5 days.  After 5 days, samples were pooled and subjected to gene level microarray analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL16686 [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
