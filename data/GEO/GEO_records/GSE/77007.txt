TITLE
Quantitative Analysis of mRNA expression in calvaria tissue from control and Med23-/-  vs. wild type and Runx2+/- mice through Next Generation Sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 12 single newborn mouse calvaria tissues ( from 3 control and 3 Med23-/- cKO mice from a litter; 3 wildtype and 3 Runx2+/- mice from another litter) to investigate the correlation between Med23 and Runx2 in terms of affect on the mRNA level by their deficiencies. We find there is a positiove correlation in gobal gene expression affected by defiencies of the two genes.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in individual newborn murine calvaria.
