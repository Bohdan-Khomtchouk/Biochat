TITLE
Gene expression analysis for Il13Ra2-positive and IL13Ra2-negative glioma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix expression profiling was used to evaluate the association between IL13RÎ±2 expression, and mesenchymal, proneural, classical and neural signature genes expression for glioma subclasses defined by Verhaak et al (Cancer Cell; 2010).

DESIGN
The goal of this study is to compare gene expression patterns between IL13Ra2-postive and IL13Ra2-negative glioma cell lines. IL13Ra2 status was determined by flow cytometry and confirmed by qPCR.
