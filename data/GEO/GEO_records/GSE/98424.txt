TITLE
Expression data from Hm mutant

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse Hammer toe (Hm) shows syndactyly. To reveal the molecular mechanisms of Hm phenotype, we performed microarray analysis to search differencially expressed genes in Hm limb.

DESIGN
Interdigital region from Wild type and Hm hind limb were dissected and total RNA was isolated. 3 sets of 5 littermates, totally 15 enbryos in each genotypes were hybridized on Affimetrix microarray.
