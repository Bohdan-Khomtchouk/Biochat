TITLE
RNAseq data from mouse beta-cells expressing mutant (GCK Y214C) versus wild-type Glucokinase

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare the transcriptome of mouse beta-cells expressing mutant constitutively active Glucokinase versus wild-type Glucokinase.

DESIGN
RNA profiles of pancreatic  islets from 5-6 week old transgenic mice expressing mutant GCK ( Y214C)  (Pdx1Cre-ER; Rosa-LSL-Y214C-GCK) and from their control littermates  (Rosa-LSL-Y214C-GCK) were generated by deep sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
