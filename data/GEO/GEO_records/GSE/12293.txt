TITLE
Evolution of neuronal and endothelial transcriptomes in primates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neurons and endothelial cells were identified by immunohistochemistry in human brains, isolated by laser-capture-microdissection and used to find genes preferentially expressed in the two cell types. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate approximately 1000 neurons and endothelial cells from 6 (for neurons) and 7 (for endothelial cells) human post mortem brain samples. RNA was isolated and amplified (3 linear amplifications) and genome wide expression was measured. This allowed the identification of genes that are differentially expressed between neurons and endothelial cells in the human brain.
