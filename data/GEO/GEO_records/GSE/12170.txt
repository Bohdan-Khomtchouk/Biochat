TITLE
Global Analysis of the Meiotic Crossover Landscape

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Using microarrays to genotype the parental origin of progeny resulting from a cross between S96 and YJM789 yeast strains, we mapped the distribution of crossovers that occurred during meiosis. Knowledge of the crossover distribution allowed us to assess changes in crossover control in wild type and mutant strains. The S96 strain is a S288 derivative and thus its DNA sequence has high homology to the oligo sequences used to create the S98 Affymetrix Gene chip.  The YJM789 strain is ~ 0.6% divergent from S288. Keywords: wild type and mutant analysis

DESIGN
Strains were allowed to undergo sporulation (meiosis) and progeny (spores) from 4-spore viable tetrads were grown and genomic DNA was extracted and hybridzed to S98 Affymetrix Gene chips.  Segregation patterns were analyzed for the location of crossovers which are represented by reciprocal exchange of DNA.
