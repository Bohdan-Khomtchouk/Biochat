TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of ex vivo gene expression of tumour pericytes and tumour endothelial cells obtained from 67NR mouse primary tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pericytes are integral components of the tissue vasculature and have essential functions in tumour angiogenesis. Endosialin (CD248) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed on pericytes in the tumour vasculature of most solid tumours, however it is low or negligibly expressed on normal tissue pericytes. Experiments using wild-type and endosialin-knockout mice has revealed that stromal endosialin expression facilitates intravasation of tumor cells from the primary tumor into the circulation, thereby promoting metastatic dissemination.

DESIGN
BALB/c Ub-GFP wild-type and endosialin-knockout mice were inoculated with 67NR tumor cells. Tumor pericytes and tumor endothelial cells were isolated from primary tumors by FACSorting and total RNA was extracted from freshly isolated (i.e. without in vitro culture) cell populations.
