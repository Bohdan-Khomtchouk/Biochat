TITLE
Advax, a delta inulin microparticle, potentiates in-built adjuvant property of co-administered vaccines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression data from mouse organs after Advax injection Advax, an inulin-derived microparticle, has been developed as an adjuvant for several vaccines. Advax is a unique class of adjuvant which can potentiate the endogenous adjuvant effect of the vaccines through a not yet fully-identified, unique mechanisms of action.

DESIGN
C57BL/6J mice (6 week old, male, n = 2 or 3) were injected i.d. or i.p. with a total volume of 1000ug of Advax in PBS. The vehicle-control mice (n = 2 or 3) were injected with the same volume of PBS. After 6 h, the inguinal LNs, liver, kidney and spleen were removed (within one hour for all samples) and grobal gene expression was obtained by Affymetrix GeneChip.
