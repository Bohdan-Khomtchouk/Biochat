TITLE
Effects of Escherichia coli global gene expression due to microfluidic processing

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli CFT073

SUMMARY
Investigation in bacterial transcriptomics is widely used to investigate gene regulation, bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics, host-pathogen interactions, and pathogenesis. Transcriptomics is crucially dependent on suitable methods to isolate and detect bacterial RNA. Microfluidic approaches offer ways of creating integrated point-of-care systems, analysing a sample from preparation, RNA isolation through to detection. Critical for on-chip diagnostics to deliver on their promise is that mRNA expression is not altered through the use microfluidic sample processing. Here, we investigate the impact on the use of a microfluidic sample processing system based on hydrodynamic separation upon RNA expression of bacteria isolated from blood to prove its suitability for further microfluidic test development.

DESIGN
A 10 array study using total RNA recovered from bacteria isolated using the microfluidic device and total RNA recovered from bacteria that were not separated using the device were compared. Arrays were performed in 5 biological replicates from each condition

PLATFORM
GPL3154 [E_coli_2] Affymetrix E. coli Genome 2.0 Array
