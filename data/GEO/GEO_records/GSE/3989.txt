TITLE
Microarray analysis of Rgg-dependent transcriptional regulation in NZ131 Streptococcus pyogenes strain

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
Streptococcus pyogenes growth-phase dependent and Rgg-dependent transcription was analyzed Keywords: transcriptional regulation

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed using RNA samples isolated from wild-type NZ131 strain during mid-exponential and early-stationary phases of growth as well as RNA isolated from NZ131 rgg isogenic mutant strain during mid-exponential, late-exponential and early-stationary phases of growth

PLATFORM
