TITLE
Normalization of whole-genome SNP data from non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients for copy number variation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
With the whole genome SNPs array information, we could evaluate the copy number variation of samples so as to find out specific DNA aberrations in non-Hodgkin lymphma comparing with reactive hyperplasia patients.

DESIGN
To find out lymphoma-related copy number variations in 45 non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients comparing with 8 reactive hyperplasia patients.
