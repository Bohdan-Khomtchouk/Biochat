TITLE
Effect of interleukin-1 and PDGF-DD on SMCs

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This experiment tests the hypothesis that interleukin-1 promotes SMC phenotypic modulation to a distinct inflammatory state relative to the growth factor PDGF-DD.

DESIGN
Cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells were treated with IL-1b (2.5 ng/mL) or vehicle (0.1% BSA and 10 mM acetic acid) or PDGF-DD (30 ng/mL) or vehicle (0.01% BSA) for 24 hours prior to harvest (n=1).
