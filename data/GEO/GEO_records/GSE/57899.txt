TITLE
Application of array-CGH for the detection of genomic rearrangements responsible for syndromic mental retardation of unknown cause

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we describe an interstitial pure duplication of 19p13.3 that was initially considered as a de novo alteration, in a patient with intellectual disability studied by array-CGH. The finding of the same chromosomal alteration in a first-degree cousin of this patient led us to investigate the presence of insertional translocations. An intrachromosomal insertional translocation was found in at least three generations. Three intellectually disabled patients with the same duplication and multiples abortions among translocation carrier family members were found. A review of other published cases has allowed us to find three other cases with a similar pure duplication and some clinical findings present in all patients as intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, motor and speech delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. These findings allow us to suggest the existence of a new microduplication syndrome in chromosomal region 19p13.3.

DESIGN
Whole genome array-CGH was performed on Agilent oligo-chip 44K (human genome CGH microarray G4410B from Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) as recommended. The patientsâ€™ DNA samples were tested against a pool of 10 sex-matched normal DNA samples, all of them (patients and normal controls) from our geographical area. Scanned images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v9.0). The results were analyzed using Agilent Genomic Workbench software. Annotations have been obtained from UCSC ( http://genome.ucsc.edu ) based on human genome build GRCh37/hg19.
