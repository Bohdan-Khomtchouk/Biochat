TITLE
Genome-Wide Transcription Responses to Synchrotron Microbeam Radiotherapy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that gene expression changes in EMT6.5 tumors after Microbeam Radiotherapy (MRT) are different from those seen after broad beam (BB) at 4-48 h postirradiation. Our findings demonstrate molecular differences in the tumor response to MRT vs. BB and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of MRT and BB.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated EMT6.5 tumours irradiated by MRT or BB at 4, 24 or 48 hours post-irradiation compared to unirradiated control tumours.
