TITLE
Expression data from CtBP knockdown MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CtBP is a global co-repressor by serving as transcriptional factor in multiple pathways. CtBP functioned as transcriptional factor by recruiting other cofactors such as G9a, HDAC1 and PcG proteins. CtBP is found to be over enriched in several type of tumor samples. To dipict the role of CtBP in globally regulating gene expression, we applied gene microarray technology to find out what subgroups of genes are mainly affected.

DESIGN
6 MCF-7 cell samples, 3 with CtBP knockdown and 3 with control knock down.
