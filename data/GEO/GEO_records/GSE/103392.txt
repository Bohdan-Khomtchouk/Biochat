TITLE
Integration of biochemical, biophysical and transcriptomics data for investigating the structural and nanomechanical properties of the yeast cell wall

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Identify the molecular cues (genes) which shape the biochemical composition and the nanomechanical properties of the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisae and the links between these two parameters represent a major issue in the understanding of the biogenesis and the molecular assembly of this essential cellular structure, which may have consequences in diverse biotechnological applications. Firstly, we compared the biochemical and biophysical properties of 4 industrial strains with the laboratory sequenced strain BY4743 and used transcriptome data of these strains to infer biological hypothesis about differences of these properties between strains. The second approach was to employ a multivariate statistical analysis to identify highly correlated variables among biochemical, biophysical and genes expression data.

DESIGN
Four diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (named as L69, L71, L62 and L60) were studied and compared to the Saccharomyces cerevsiaie strain BY4743 (from Euroscarf collection). Three independent biological cultures of each strain were carried out in YPD medium. Total RNA was extracted from these cultures. A total of 15 samples (5 strains made in triplicates) were spotted on Agilent slides.
