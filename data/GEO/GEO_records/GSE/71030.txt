TITLE
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq profiling in MCF7 cell lines under hypoxia and reoxygenation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Study hypoxia and reoxygenation induced changes in genome-wide H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 occupancy Methods: Using the MCF7 breast epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line as a model, we studied epigenomic reprogramming as a function of fluctuating oxygen tension. To this end, we combined chromatin-immunoprecipitation and deep-sequencing analysis to identify H3K4me3-marks and H3K27me3-marks in MCF7 cells subjected to changes in oxygenation (i.e. acute hypoxia, chronic hypoxia, reoxygenation). Results: H3K4me3 and H3K27me3-marks showed a rapid global increase at specific sites throughout the genome under hypoxia, both genic and inter-genic, that was partly restored upon reoxygenation. Conclusions: Our data show that oxygen availability dynamically regulates the epigenetic state of the genome.

DESIGN
Genome-wide H3K4me3-mark and H3K27me3-mark profiles were generated by combining ChIP analysis with deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx.
