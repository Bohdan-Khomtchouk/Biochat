TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs in Medicago truncatula

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Medicago truncatula endogenous small RNAs The dataset contains Medicago truncatula Gaertn. cv. Jemalong endogenous small RNA sequences in the range 18-28 nucleotides. High-throughput Solexa/Illumina sequencing was carried out at the Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich, UK. Please see www.illumina.com for details of the technology. Small RNA sequences were mapped to Medicago truncatula genome release 2.0 ( http://www.medicago.org/genome/ ), the number of matches to the unfinished genome, if any, is recorded in the Series supplementary file GSE13761_sequence_annotations.txt.gz.

DESIGN
Size fractionated small RNA from total RNA extracts was ligated to adapters, purified again and reverse transcribed. After PCR amplification the sample was subjected to Solexa/Illumina high throughput pyrosequencing. Please see www.illumina.com for details of the sequencing technology.
