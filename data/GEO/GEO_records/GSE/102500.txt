TITLE
Toxoplasma gondii hexokinase gene knock out mutant expression data

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
Mutant T. gondii parasites lacking the hexokinase gene were viable. We carried genome wide expression analysis to identify genes that are differentially expressed in the mutant parasite with reference to wild type parental line. For this microarray analysis, we used the Affymetrix Toxoplasma gondii Custom GeneChip (CDF: ToxoDB version 5); Further details for this array can be found in the GEO platform ID GPL10000

DESIGN
Wild type and Tghk mutant parasites were allowed to infect and proliferate within human foreskin fibroblast cells for 48 hours. Total RNA isolated from freshly harvested parasites were further processed by standard protocols for analysis by affymetrix microarray (gene expression data).
