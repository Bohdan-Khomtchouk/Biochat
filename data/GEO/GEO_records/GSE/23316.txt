SUMMARY
This data was produced by the Wold lab at Caltech as part of the ENCODE Project. RNA-Seq is a method for mapping and quantifying the transcriptome of any organism that has a genomic DNA sequence assembly. RNA-Seq is performed by reverse-transcribing an RNA sample into cDNA, followed by high throughput DNA sequencing. The resulting sequence reads are then informatically mapped onto the genome sequence.
