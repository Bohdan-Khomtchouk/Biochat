TITLE
Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs): Fibroblast vs. hMSCs from various origins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the key microRNAs (miRNAs) of hMSCs required for fate determination, miRNA profiling was performed with hMSCs from three different sources including adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), bone-marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs), and umbilical cord-derived stem cells (UCSCs) versus fibroblasts, a more differentiated mesenchymal cell types.

DESIGN
We compared the expression profiles of two different donors per hMSCs to that of fibroblasts. All hMSCs were used for profiling at passage 3-6.
