TITLE
Divergence in gene regulation in Shewanella baltica strains

ORGANISM
Shewanella baltica

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Shewanella OS185 and OS195 strains grown under aerobic, anaerobic thiosulfate and nitrate respiratory conditions.

DESIGN
The Shewanella OS185 and OS195 strains were grown under aerobic, anaerobic thiosulfate and nitrate respiratory conditions. Three replicates were included. Therefore, there were a total of 18 samples analyzed. All sample cDNAs were labeled with Cy5. The same reference cDNA pool was labeled Cy3, and were used in all arrays.The reference cDNA pool was constructed using RNA from cells of all four strains OS155, OS185, OS195 and OS223 grown in HEPES medium containing either 10 mM sodium fumarate, 5 mM sodium nitrate or 10 mM sodium thiosulfate under anaerobic condition, or 10 mM sodium chloride under aerobic condition.
