TITLE
Host pathogen interaction between Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 and murine RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages infected with S. aureus were subjected to gene expression profiling to undertake a complete understanding of the interaction induced gene expression changes in both, S.aureus and the RAW macrophages.

DESIGN
Agilent one-color experiment, Agilent-021933 Genotypic designed Custom Staphylococcus aureus and Mus musculus 8x15k

PLATFORM
GPL10765 Genotypic designed Agilent in situ synthesised Mus musculus & Staphylococcus aureus gene expression profiling microarray
