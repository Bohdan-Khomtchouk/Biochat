TITLE
Expression data from shlncTCF7 and shCtrl of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) clinical sample

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the target genes of long noncoding RNA lncTCF7, we established lncTCF7-silenced HCC primary CSC cells and conducted transcriptome microarray analysis. We used microarrays to identify distinct gene expression underlying shCtrl and shlncTCF7 of hepatocellular carcinoma sample stem cells.

DESIGN
We cultured shlncTCF7 and shCtrl cells from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) clinical sample, then hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to identify distinct target genes of lncTCF7 in liver cancer stem cells (CSCs).
