TITLE
KO comR vs. KO comX comparison

ORGANISM
Streptococcus thermophilus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mutant Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9 comR::lox72 (strain LF148) compared to mutant S. thermophilus LMD-9 DcomX (strain CB003) for the identification of the ComR regulon. Cells were grown in CDM medium supplemented with lactose 1% (CDML) and sampled at OD600 = 0.3~0.4 for mRNA extraction.

DESIGN
2 LF148 biological replicates (one used as a technical replicate for a dye swap), 2 CB003 biological replicates (one used as a technical replicate for a dye swap).

PLATFORM
GPL13365 UCL Streptococcus thermophilus 15K 60-mer array, Version 1, our ID Agilent-023342 LMD-9v2
