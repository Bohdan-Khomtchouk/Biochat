TITLE
PA1-regulated genes in mouse embryonic fibroblast

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PA1 has been identified as a component of a MLL3/4-containing histone methyltransferase complex. PA1 directly interacts with PTIP but not with other complex components. Since biological functions of PA1 are unknown, we used microarrays to determine which genes are regulated by PA1.

DESIGN
To identify PA1-regulated genes, immortalized PA1 conditional knockout PA1loxP/loxP MEFs were infected with retroviruses expressing either Cre recombinase or vector alone. We prepared duplicated RNAs from either vector or Cre infected cells (PA1+/+ or PA1-/-) for 4 affymetrix microarrays.
