TITLE
The Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) controls diacylglycerol kinase in neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we sought to identify the mRNAs associated to FMRP protein in mouse cortical neuron using a cross linking immunoprecipitation and microarray (CLIP-microarray). The mRNAs crosslinked at 254 nm to FMRP in mouse cortical neurons cultured 8 days in vitro (8 DIV) were immunoprecipitated with H120 anti-FMRP (Santa Cruz) and reverse transcribed to labeled cDNAs with Ovation Pico WTA system V2 (Nugen) and hybridized on Mouse Gene 1.0ST (Affymetrix)

DESIGN
We analyzed total RNA (Input) and FMRP-CLIPed RNA (Clip) from 10 primary cortical neuron mouse cultures (5 Wt Input,  5 FMR1-KO Input, 5 Wt Clip, 5 FMR1-KO Clip).  Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No technical replicates were performed.
