TITLE
Assessment of chemical mixtures and ground water effects on Daphnia magna transcriptomics

ORGANISM
Daphnia magna

SUMMARY
Small organisms can be used as biomonitoring tools to assess chemicals in the environment. Chemical stressors are especially hard to assess and monitor when present as complex mixtures. Here, Daphnia magna were exposed for 24 hours to five different munitions constituents 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT), trinitrobenzene (TNB), dinitrobenzene (DNB), or 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX) as well as to 8 different munitions mixtures and ground water contaminated with munitions constituents. To better understand possible mixture effects, gene expression changes from all treatments were compared using high-density microarrays. While mixtures and ground water exposures had genes and gene functions in common with single chemical exposures, unique functions were also affected, which was consistent with the non-additivity of chemical effects in these mixtures.

DESIGN
The study consisted of three different experiments: (1) exposure to a concentration corresponding to 70% of 1/10th of the LC50 value of six individual MCs (TNT, 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, DNB, TNB, RDX) and a control; (2) exposure to eight different laboratory mixtures of the previously mentioned MCs. Different combinations of MCs including four mixtures (Mixtures 5, 6, 7 and 8) representative of field collected groundwater from LAAP (Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant) were created; and (3) exposure to MC-contaminated ground water field-collected from 3 different wells (85, 108, and 141) at the LAAP. All exposures were conducted for 24h.
