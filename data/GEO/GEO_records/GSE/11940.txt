TITLE
Topoisomerase II inhibition involves characteristic chromosomal expression patterns: Doxorubicin study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A variety of important anticancer drugs kill cells by increasing cellular levels of topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex. The anthracycline anticancer drug doxorubicin forms a stable ternary complex with DNA and topoisomerase IIa, thereby inhibiting the normal function of the enzyme. In this study we found genes regulated by doxorubicin - induced and repressed - to be located much closer to each other than genes distributed randomly all over the genome ( < 100 kbp). Keywords: Doxorubicin-treated human hepatocytes versus non-treated human hepatocytes

DESIGN
We calculated specifically the probability by which particular genes which were deregulated by the treatment of human hepatocytes with doxorubicin will occur within DNA windows of different sizes as compared to the probability of all known mapped genes (RefSeq transcripts) of the human genome (NCBI RefSeq 19,360; build 36.2) to occur within the same DNA windows.
