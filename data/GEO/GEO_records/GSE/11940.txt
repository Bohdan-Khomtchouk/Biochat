TITLE
Topoisomerase II inhibition involves characteristic chromosomal expression patterns: Doxorubicin study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A variety of important anticancer drugs kill cells by increasing cellular levels of topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex. The anthracycline anticancer drug doxorubicin forms a stable ternary complex with DNA and topoisomerase IIa, thereby inhibiting the normal function of the enzyme. In this study we found genes regulated by doxorubicin - induced and repressed - to be located much closer to each other than genes distributed randomly all over the genome ( < 100 kbp). Keywords: Doxorubicin-treated human hepatocytes versus non-treated human hepatocytes
