TITLE
Gene expressions in normal breast duct vs lobule

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expressions were measured in 8 normal breast duct samples and 8 normal breast lobule samples from premenopausal patients using Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray. A total of 426 transcripts were identified as being significantly differentially expressed. Supervised hierarchical clustering based on the 426 differentially expressed genes showed distinct clustering of the duct and lobule samples.The significant enrichment analysis of GO terms for the differentially expressed genes using the R language package software demonstrated that these 426 differentially expressed genes were involved in many important biological processes, including negative regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor biosynthetic process, response to steroid hormone stimulus and oxidation reduction. 17 differential expressed genes identified by microarray were randomly chosen for further validation using quantitative RT-PCR. As results, fold changes measured by quantitative RT-PCR were closely correlated with those measured by microarray.

DESIGN
8 normal breast duct samples vs 8 normal breast lobule samples from premenopausal patients, unpaired
