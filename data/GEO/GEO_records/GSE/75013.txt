Microarray expression data from circulating blood monocytes

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens is carried out by classical DCs (cDCs) and monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs), but whether a similar or distinct program exists for this process is unknown.  In examining this issue, we discovered that only Ly-6ChiTremL4– monocytes, but not Ly-6ChiTremL4+ monocytes, can differentiate into Zbtb46+ Mo-DCs in response to GM-CSF and IL-4. However, Ly-6ChiTremL4+ monocytes were committed to Nur77-dependent development of Ly-6CloTremL4+ monocytes.  Further, differentiation of monocytes with GM-CSF required addition of IL-4 to generate Zbtb46+ Mo-DCs that cross-presented as efficiently as CD24+ cDCs, which was accompanied by increased Batf3 and Irf4 expression.  Unlike cDCs, Mo-DCs required only IRF4, and not Batf3, for cross-presentation.  Further, Irf4–/– monocytes failed to develop into Zbtb46+ Mo-DCs, and instead developed into macrophages.  Thus, cDCs and Mo-DCs use distinct transcriptional programs for cross-presentation that may drive different antigen-processing pathways. These differences may influence development of therapeutic DC vaccines based on Mo-DCs.
