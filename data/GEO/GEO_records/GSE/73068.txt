TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the therapeutic effect of NeuroD on irradiation-induced intestinal injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective was to investigate the therapeutic effect of NeuroD on irradiation-induced intestinal injury at gene expression level. Gene expression profilings between NeuroD and EGFP treated mice which were received 9 Gy total body irradiation were compared.

DESIGN
All mice were given 9 Gy radiation and divided into two groups (3 mice per group). After radiation, mice were immediately administered with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mM EGFP or NeuroD-EGFP. EGFP treated mice were served as controls. 12 hours post radiation, mice jejunum tissues were isolated. Total RNA obtained from jejunum tissues and subjected to gene expression profiling assays.
