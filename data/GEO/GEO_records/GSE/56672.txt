TITLE
Expression data from PPP3R1 cell line starved as compared to PPP3R1 cell line grown in Normal Medium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of starvation on the PPP3R1 cell line trascriptome, we performed Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridization experiments for the starved cells Transcriptome analysis of the starved PPP3R1 cell line

DESIGN
For the analysis on the starved PPP3R1 cell line, total RNA was extracted; RNA extracted from PPP3R1 cell line grown in Normal Medium was used as control
