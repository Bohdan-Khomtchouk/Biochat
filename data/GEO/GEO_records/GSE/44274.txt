TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Host Immune Responses in the UV inactivated SARS-CoV-immunized mice following Lethal SARS-CoV Infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand the biological pathways by which UV inactivated SARS-CoV-induced pulmonary eosinophilia occurs, we examined global transcriptional changes in mouse lungs.

DESIGN
Female BALB/c mice were used at 21 weeks of age.  Mice were subcutaneously immunized with UV inactivated SARS-CoV (UV-V) or UV-V and Toll like receptor (TLR) ligands at 6 and 1 weeks prior to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (n=6 per group).  PBS was used in three mice as control immunization.  Mice were intranasally challenged with 1E+6TCID50 in 30Î¼L.  Mice were sacrificed and collected lungs at 1 days after challenge. These mice were used for the analysis of microarray.
