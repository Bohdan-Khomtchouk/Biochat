TITLE
The impact of tacrolimus on hepatic mirnas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we aimed to evaluate the impact of tacrolimus on the expression of hepatic mirnas. HepG2 cells were treated with 0, 5, 20 ng/ml tacrolimus and RNA was extracted. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of mirna expression.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were treated with 0, 5, 20 ng/ml tacrolimus for 24 hrs and RNA was extracted. The expression of mirnas were compared between low-dose tacrolimus group and control, high-dose tacrolimus and control.
