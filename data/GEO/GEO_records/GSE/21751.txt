TITLE
Gene expression following CDK9 silencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the expression of genes in cells following silencing of CDK9 by siRNA. U2OS human osteosarcoma cell lines were utilized.

DESIGN
The cell lines were grown in previously described culture media in biological quadruplicates. Total RNA was isolated and array experiments were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
