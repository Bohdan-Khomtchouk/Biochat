TITLE
Gene expression profile of murine Flvcr-deleted and control CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genomewide microaarray analysis of murine DP thymocytes to determine the genes whose expression was altered by FLVCR loss Gene signatures from Flvcr+/+ DP thymocytes was compared to gene signatures from Flvcr-/- DP thymocytes

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from sort-purified Flvcr-/- and Flvcr+/+ DP thymocytes

PLATFORM
GPL17543 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 R2 expression beadchip
