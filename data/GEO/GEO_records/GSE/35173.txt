TITLE
Development of mRNA and lincRNA expression signatures of MEFs deficient in ER stress mediators for tunicamycin treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further development of our mRNA or lincRNA expression approach to ER stress, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify ER stress-responsible genes.   Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in each ER stress mediator (XBP1, ATF4, ATF6a or ATF6b) were treated with tunicamycin for 12 or 24 hrs. Genes responsible for tunicamycin in each mediator-dependent manner were extracted and categorized by Gene Ontology. Among them, expression of five ER-related genes (Derl1, Ssr3, Magt1, Bet1 and Mcfd2) was quantified in the RNA samples from COS7 cells by real-time PCR, confirming existence of similar mechanisms of trancriptional activation in ER stress by tunicamycin treatment.

DESIGN
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in each ER stress mediator (XBP1, ATF4, ATF6a or ATF6b) were treated with 2ug/mL tunicamycin for 12 or 24 hrs. Two independent experiments were performed for each mediator-deficient MEF at each time (untreated, 12 or 24 hrs). Genes responsible for tunicamycin in each mediator-dependent manner were extracted and categorized by Gene Ontology in GeneRanker program of Genomatix platform.
