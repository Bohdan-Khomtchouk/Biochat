TITLE
Stem cell and neurogenic gene-expression profiles link prostate basal cells to aggressive prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The prostate gland mainly contains basal and luminal cells constructed as a pseudostratified epithelium. Annotation of prostate epithelial transcriptomes provides a foundation for discoveries that can impact disease understanding and treatment. Here, we describe a whole-genome transcriptome analysis of human benign prostatic basal and luminal populations by using deep RNA sequencing. Combined with comprehensive molecular and biological characterizations, we show that the differential gene expression profiles account for their distinct functional phenotypes. Strikingly, in contrast to luminal cells, basal cells preferentially express gene categories associated with stem cells, neural and neuronal development and RNA processing. Consistent with their expression profiles, basal cells functionally exhibit intrinsic stem-like and proneural properties with enhanced ribosome RNA (rRNA) transcription activity. Of clinical relevance, the treatment failed castration-resistant and anaplastic prostate cancers molecularly resemble a basal-like phenotype. Therefore, we link the cell-type specific gene signatures to subtypes of prostate cancer development, and identify genes associated with patient clinical outcome.

DESIGN
Human total RNA profiles of 3 pairs of benign prostatic basal and luminal populations freshly purified from prostate tissues of three prostate cancer patients by deep RNA-seq.
