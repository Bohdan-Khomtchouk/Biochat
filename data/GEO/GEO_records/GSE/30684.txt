TITLE
Stem Cell Antigen-1 (Sca-1) Regulates Mammary Tumor Development and Cell Migration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1 or Ly6A) is a member of the Ly6 family of glycosyl phostidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface proteins. To determine the potential mechanisms by which Sca-1 regulates cell migration, adhesion, and tumor development; we performed an Affymetrix mouse genome 430A 2.0 array on cDNA comparing shLuc and shSca-1 from cells grown in vitro.

DESIGN
We performed an Affymetrix mouse genome 430A 2.0 array on cDNA comparing shLuc and shSca-1 from cells grown in vitro.  Experimental groups were profiled in biological triplicate.
