TITLE
Transcriptomic landscape of S. cerevisiae x S. kudriavzevii hybrids in low temperature winemaking.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces kudriavzevii

SUMMARY
Comparative genome-wide gene expression analysis between two industrial wine yeast hybrid strains belonging to the species S. cerevisiae x S. Kudriavzevii, in natural must fermentations.

DESIGN
RNA samples taken from wine fermentations at 12ºC and 28ºC at the beginning of exponential phase. Three biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL22734 UHNMAC Yeast 6.4 K array (Y6.4K) version 7 [Gene-level version]
