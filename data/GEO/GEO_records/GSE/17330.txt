TITLE
Transcriptomic alterations in Trypanosoma cruzi-infected cardiac myocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Trypanosoma cruzi infection is a major cause of cardiomyopathy. Gene profiling studies of hearts from infected mice have revealed prominent changes in gene expression within many functional pathways.  This variety of transcriptomic changes in infected mice raises the question of whether gene expression alterations in whole hearts are due to changes in infected cardiac myocytes or other cells or even to systemic effects of the infection on the heart. We employed microarrays to examine infected cardiac myocyte cultures 48 hr post-infection. Statistical comparison of gene expression levels of 2,258 well annotated unigenes in four independent cultures of infected and uninfected myocytes detected (p < 0.05) significant > 1.5 absolute fold changes in 221 (8.8%) of the sampled genes.  Major categories of affected genes included those involved in immune response, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion.  While changes in extracellular matrix and cell adhesion genes were anticipated, modulation of immune response genes in the infected myocytes was surprising.  These findings on infected cardiac myocytes in culture reveal that altered gene expression described in the heart in Chagas disease are the consequence of both direct infection of the myocytes and resulting from presence of other cell types in the myocardium and systemic effects of infection.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic alteration in neonatal mouse cultured cardiomyocytes induced by the parasite T.cruzi were detected by profiling and compared using AECOM mouse 32k oligonucleotide arrays hybridized in the " multiple yellow " strategy described in Iacobas et al,  Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 349(1):329-38.
