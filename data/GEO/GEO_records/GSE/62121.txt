TITLE
Charaterization of genetic alterations and gene expression signatures found in BCR-ABL inhibitor-resistant KCL-22 subpopulations and single clones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KCL-22 is a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line derived from a patient in blast crisis phase and harbors the BCR-ABL translocation. The catalytic (ATP-competitive) BCR-ABL inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib have dramatically improved CML patient outcome, but the development of resistance remains a clinical challenge. The recent identification of allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitors, such as GNF-2, which target the enzyme by binding to the myristoyl pocket rather than catalytic site of ABL1, may provide a strategy to broadly overcome resistance to the class of ABL1 ATP competitive inhibitors. We therefore wanted to use the ClonTracer barcoding system to compare the clonal responses of KCL-22 to imatinib, nilotinib and GNF-2. RNA-seq was employed to characterize genetic alterations and gene expression signatures in the pooled cell populations resistant to BCR-ABL inhibitors as well as single clones showing differential response to the three inhibitors.

DESIGN
