TITLE
Gene expression profiles of dental neural crest progenitor cells (dNC-PCs) and stem cells of exfoliated descidious teeth (SHED)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed gene expression profiles in dental stem cells before and after osteogenic differentiation day 7.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from dental stem cells at day 0 (before differentiation) and after 7 days of differentiation
