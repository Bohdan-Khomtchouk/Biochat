TITLE
Expression data from  Min6 cells maintained under different culture conditons that affect Hes3 expression and localization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor hairy and enhancer of split (Hes3) is a member of the Hes/Hey gene family that regulates developmental processes in progenitor cells from various tissues. We demonstrated the Hes3 expression in mouse pancreatic tissue, suggesting it may have a role in modulating beta-cell function. We employed the mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6 to perform gene expression profiles in conditions known to modulate Hes3 based upon our previous work using neural stem cell cultures.  In these conditions, cells showed elevated Hes3 expression and nuclear localization, grew efficiently and showed higher evoked insulin release responses, compared to serum-containing conditions. They also exhibited higher expression of the transcription factor Pdx1 and insulin.

DESIGN
Microarrays of RNA isolated from quadruplicate samples of Min6 cells grown under three different culture conditions.
