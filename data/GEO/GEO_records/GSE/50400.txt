TITLE
Suppression of molecular inflammatory pathways by Toll-like Receptor 7, 8, and 9 antagonists in a model of IL-23-induced skin inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Psoriasis is a complex inflammatory disease resulting from the activation of T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells.  Recent evidence suggests that abnormal activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7, 8 and 9 contributes to the initiation and maintenance of psoriasis.  We have evaluated the effects of TLR antagonists on the gene expression profile in an IL-23-induced skin inflammation model in mice.  Psoriasis-like skin lesions were induced in C57BL/6 mice by intradermal injection of IL-23 in the dorsum.  Two TLR antagonists were compared: IMO-3100, an antagonist of TLRs 7 and 9, and IMO-8400, an antagonist of TLRs 7, 8 and 9, both of which previously have been shown to reduce epidermal hyperplasia in this model.  Skin gene expression profiles of IL-23-induced inflammation were compared with or without TLR antagonist treatment.  IL-23 injection resulted in alteration of 5100 gene probes (fold change â‰¥ 2, FDR < 0.05) including IL-17 pathways that are up-regulated in psoriasis vulgaris.   Targeting TLRs 7, 8 and 9 with IMO-8400 resulted in modulation of more than 2300 mRNAs while targeting TLRs 7 and 9 with IMO-3100 resulted in modulation of more than 1900 mRNAs.  Both agents strongly decreased IL-17A expression ( > 12-fold reduction), normalized IL-17 induced genes such as beta-defensin and CXCL1, and normalized aberrant expression of keratin 16 (indicating epidermal hyperplasia). These results suggest that IL-23-driven inflammation in mouse skin may be dependent on signaling mediated by TLRs 7, 8, and 9 and that these receptors represent novel therapeutic targets in psoriasis vulgaris and other diseases with similar pathophysiology.
