TITLE
Expression data from cyclohexamide treated Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFFs) infected with type I Toxoplasma gondii and stimulated with interferon gamma.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pre-infection with Toxoplasma parasites inhibits induction of an interferon gamma responsive gene expression program.  In this study we aimed to determine what role host negative regulatory proteins that are induced by Toxoplasma infection, such as SOCS-1, have in this inhibition. We used Affymetrix microarrays to analyze host cell transcription after pre-treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide (CHX), Toxoplasma infection, and subsequent interferon-gamma stimulation.

DESIGN
Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were left untreated or treated with CHX for 40min.  Cells were infected, or not, with type I (RH) Toxoplasma parasites, for one hour, and subsequently stimulated with human IFN-Î³ for one hour.  Total RNA was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix Human U133A 2.0 gene chips.
