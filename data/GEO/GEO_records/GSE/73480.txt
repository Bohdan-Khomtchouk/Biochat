TITLE
Expression data for analysis of genes affected by CHD4 in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Rh4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CHD4 is an ATPase able to use the energy from ATP to shift or remove nucleosomes from specific sites in the chromatin, thereby affecting accessability of gene regulatory elements. It is part of the NuRD complex. The effect of CHD4 on global gene expression was evaluated in Rh4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells.

DESIGN
A Dox-inducible shRNA construct directed against CHD4 was stably transduced into Rh4 cells and used for silencing of CHD4.  A scrambled shRNA construct was used as control. RNA used for expression profiling was isolated from these Rh4 cells after 24, 48 and 72h of shRNA induction. Scrambled controls were performed in duplicate at each time point, whereas single expression profiles were measured for the CHD4 directed construct at each time point.
