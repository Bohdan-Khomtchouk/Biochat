TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of cardiac biopsies from mice subjected to ischemic preconditioning

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray profiling of cardiac biopsies from the area at at risk and remote myocardium of mice subjected to ischemic preconditioning.

DESIGN
Mice were subjected to ischemic preconditioning (IPC) through reversible ligation of the left coronary artery or a sham procedure. The procedure consisted of 4 minutes of ischemia followed by 4 minutes of reperfusion, repeated 4 times and then followed by a 30 minute reperfusion period. Biopsies were taken from the area at risk (AAR) and remote myocardium (RM) from two IPC mice and two sham control mice.
