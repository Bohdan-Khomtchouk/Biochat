TITLE
Different molecular complexes that mediate transcriptional induction and repression by FoxP3

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq profile of WT or mutant FoxP3 in CD4+ T cells

DESIGN
Activated CD4+FoxP3 retrovirally transduced with WT or mutant FoxP3 were single sorted based on Thy1,1 and ChIP-seq profiling was perfomed.
