TITLE
The long non-coding RNA transcriptome of Dictyostelium discoideum development

ORGANISM
Dictyostelium discoideum

SUMMARY
This study details the content and dynamics of the long non-coding transcriptome during D. discoideum development, providing an important compendium to the well-characterized protein coding transcriptome. Applying a novel sample preparation method, we isolated antisense and long intergenic non-coding RNAs in addition to mRNAs. We describe the behavior of these different classes of RNAs that have been shown to play important regulatory roles in numerous model systems. Our analyses contribute a wholly different perspective to the most widely appreciated and compelling aspect of Dictyostelium biologyâ€”the change in life style from solitary amoebae to differentiated multicellular organisms.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of rRNA-depleted (Ovation, Nugen)  libraries from Dictyosteloium discoideum developmental time course. Samples were collected every 2 hours during the 24-hour development cycle. Biological replicate 1 consists of all 13 time points. Bio rep 2 consists of 11 time points, with hours 16 and 22 failing to sequence properly. Additionally, hours 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 22 were reprocessed with a different rRNA-depletion method (RiboZero, Epictentre) and sequenced.
