TITLE
SAGE analysis reveals variation in midgut transcriptomes of dengue-2 susceptible and refractory Aedes aegypti mosquitoes

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
Oral susceptibility of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to dengue viruses varies between different Aedes species and strains. However, the midgut-specific transcriptional profile that may produce this variation is presently obscure and was the subject of our investigation. The variation in active expression between dengue-2 susceptible (SUS) and refractory (REF) mosquitoes was investigated during the first critical 96 hours after infection Transcriptional profiles were mined from respective guts using the serial analysis of gene expression technique (SAGE) and libraries constructed from midguts obtained from mosquitoes that received a dengue-2 infected blood meal (DENV-2), a non infected blood meal (naive) or a 5% sucrose meal (SM). Here we report that variation between DENV-2 infected libraries versus respective naïve libraries revealed very few transcripts that were common and statistically significant in DENV-2 infected libraries. In addition, the expression profiles among libraries displayed up regulation of antisense transcripts especially in the SUS strain. A strong proclivity towards strain-specificity in differential expression was observed, which suggested an exclusive transcription that is likely up-regulated after DENV-2 infection

DESIGN
Thirty Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes aged 4-5 days were transferred to 500 ml paper cups and offered a 5% sucrose meal (SM), a naïve blood meal or a dengue-2 (JAM 1409 strain) infectious blood meal, using standard artificial membrane feeders. Fully engorged females were isolated and maintained on a 5% sucrose solution ad libitum at 26oC and relative humidity till dissection
