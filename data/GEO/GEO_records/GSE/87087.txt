TITLE
AKT activation directs LPA-induced invasion of ovarian cancer cells through HIF1Î±-ETS-1 axis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced the global transcriptome of human ovarian cancer cell line treated Vs untreated to identify the pathways and genes that are regulating the metabolite-induced invasion in ovarian cancer cells.

DESIGN
Ovarian cancer cells were treated with LPA and in one set treatment was not given (Con). Total RNAs were isolated from the cellls and then sequenciung of the transcriptome was performed.
