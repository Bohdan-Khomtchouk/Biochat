TITLE
Gene expression study of leukemic and premalignant hematopoietic tissues from NUP98-PHF23 (NP23) mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NUP98-PHF23 is oncogenic and results in a Hoxa/b + Meis1 overexpression in NP23 leukemias and in premalignant (clinically healthy) hematopoietic tissues.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles from AML, pre-T LBL and B-ALL were compared to wild type bone marrow, thymus and spleen tissues respectively. Similarly, gene expression profiles from premalignant (clinically healthy) NP23 bone marrow, thymus and spleen were compared to wild type bone marrow, thymus and spleen tissues respectively. 106A and 748T lymphoblastic cell lines were compared to wild type thymic tissue.
