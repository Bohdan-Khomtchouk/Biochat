TITLE
A murine-ES like state facilitates transgenesis and homologous recombination in human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the gene expression profiles of different states of human pluripotent stem cells

DESIGN
The total gene expression profiles of human embryonic stem cells, human induced pluripotent stem cells and human LR5-iPS cells were analyzed by Agilent Human Whole Genome one-color microarray.
