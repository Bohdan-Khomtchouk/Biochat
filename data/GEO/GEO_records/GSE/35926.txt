TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis for Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578

ORGANISM
Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae MGH 78578

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed with the cells in exponential and stationary growth phases. Through these two growth status, 89.6% of currently annotated genes were expressed.

DESIGN
High-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays consisting of 379,528 50-mer probes spaced 30 bp apart across the whole Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578 genome was used (Roche NimbleGen).
