TITLE
Let-7c and miR-294 target identification in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
let-7c and miR-294 were transfected into Dgcr8 -/- miRNA deficient ES cells and RNA was harvested after 12 hours the goal of this study was to identify direct and indirect targets of the let-7c and miR-294 miRNAs, we chose to harvest RNA early at 12 hours to mimize secondary effects due to ES cell differentiation, prior to performing the array experiment we found that at this time point candidate miRNA targets were maximally downregulated by qPCR

DESIGN
9 samples were analyzed, 3 biological replicates each of mock transfected, let-7c transfected, and miR-294 transfected

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
