TITLE
Distinct roles for matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 in hematopoietic stem cell emergence, migration and niche colonization

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report gene expression data for FACS sorted zebrafish mpeg1:mCherry + and mpx:EGFP + cells collected from whole embryos at 72 hours post fertilization (hpf). We also report gene expression data for the remaining, transgene negative, portion of these embryos.

DESIGN
~1,000 mpeg1:mCherry+; mpx:EGFP+ transgenic embryos were homogenized, filtered, and sorted using FACS into PBS, collecting > 50,000 cells for each of the three populations: mpeg1:mCherry+, mpx:EGFP+ and double negative (no double positive cells were collected as there was almost no overlap between mCherry and EGFP expression).

PLATFORM
GPL18413 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Danio rerio)
