TITLE
The genome-wide effects of ionising  on mutation induction in the mammalian germline

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of genome-wide germline copy number mutations in mice after parental exposure to 3 Gy of acute X-rays The level of copy number mutations in offspring of exposed paternal mice was substantially increased when compared to the control

DESIGN
Overall 262 samples were used of which 93 were control samples and 169 treated samples. The control samples came from offspring of parents (C57BL6/J (male)  and  CBA/Ca (female)) with sham -ir while the treated samples were from offspring of 3 Gy whole-body acute irradiated paternal and non-exposed maternal. The treated samples classified into two groups: post-meiotic and pre-meiotic according to exposed status of the sperm that gave rise to the offspring. The reference sample for each offspring was equal mixture of paternal and maternal DNA.
