TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression of radioresistant prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By employing a global gene expression profiling, we performed analysis of the molecular pathways which are deregulated in DU145 ALDH+ prostate cancer progenitors and DU145-RR radioresistant cells.

DESIGN
Non-sorted, ALDH-negative, and ALDH-positive populations were analyzed, both for parental DU145 cell line and for its radioresistant sub-line. Three independent experiments were performed
