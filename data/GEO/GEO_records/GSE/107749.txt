TITLE
ChIP-seq Analysis of MCF7 Cells on Treatment with Estradiol with internal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A key challenge in quantitative ChIP-seq is the normalisation of data in the presence of genome-wide changes. Data-based methods often rely on assumptions that do not hold true. Misapplication of these methods to ChIP-seq data results in the suppression of the biological signal or erroneous measurement of differential occupancy. To develop methods that address this challenge, we generated two ChIP-seq datasets, measuring Estrogen Receptor-alpha (ER) binding and H4K12ac histone marks in MCF7 before and after 100 nm Estradiol treatment for 45 minutes and 2 hours respectively.

DESIGN
2 ER ChIP-seq experiments implementing internal normalisation strategies

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
