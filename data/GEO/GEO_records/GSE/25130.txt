TITLE
Novel virulence factors in host-adapted Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of the Cystic Fibrosis airways

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection is the primary cause of death in Cystic Fibrosis (CF). During early infection P. aeruginosa produces multiple virulence factors, which cause acute pulmonary disease and are largely regulated by quorum sensing (QS) intercellular signalling networks. Longitudinal clinical studies have observed the loss, through adaptive mutation, of QS and QS-related virulence in late chronic infection. Although the mechanisms are not understood, infection with QS mutants has been linked to a worse outcome for CF patients. By comparing QS-active and QS-inactive P. aeruginosa CF isolates, we have identified novel virulence factors and pathways associated with QS disruption. In particular, we noted factors implicating increased intra-phagocyte survival. Our data present novel targets as candidates for future CF therapies. Some of these targets are already the subject of drug development programmes for the treatment of other bacterial pathogens and may provide cross-over benefit to the CF population. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
