TITLE
Expression data from knock-down ES stable cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of the knock-down of the gene of interest on the mouse ES transcriptome, we performed Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridization experiments for the knock-down cell line. Transcriptome analysis of the knock-down transgenic mouse ES cell line. The knock-down cell line (shE13) was generated by stably expressing a specific short-hairpin RNA against E13 sequence thus knocking-down E13 expression in parental mouse ES cell line E14Tg2a.4 (E14, Hooper M et al., 1987). The specific mouse gene knocked down in the ES cell line is E130012A19Rik.

DESIGN
For the analysis on knock-down cell line, total RNA extracted from three different shE13 clones was compared to total RNA extracted from two shCTL clones
