TITLE
Interferon gamma down-regulates miR-3473b to promote macrophage activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages are major effector cells and antigen presenting cells of the innate immune system and classical activation of macrophage function requires interferon–γ (IFN-γ) pretreatment (priming) and TLR stimuli, which promotes inflammatory responses though high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lower level of the anti-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in microbicidal and tumoricidal effect. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of IFN-γ priming remains elusive. In this study, we explored the effect of IFN-γ on macrophages at miRNA level and discovered that miR-3473b, which was down-regulated after IFN-γ priming, could attenuate the priming effect of IFN-γ. Molecular study revealed that miR-3473b promoted Akt/GSK3 signaling and IL-10 production through directly targeting PTEN to suppress inflammatory response and tumor-suppressing capability of macrophages. In summary, our data demonstrate that IFN-γ beef up macrophage inflammatory response and tumor suppressing capacity by limiting miR-3473b-mediated PTEN suppression. Our work identified an IFN-γ/miR-3473b/Akt axis in the regulation of macrophage function and activation.

DESIGN
the assay was performed with 5 μg total RNA samples from both normal BMM (labeled by Cy3) and BMM primed by IFN-γ (100U/ml) for 4 h(labeled by Cy5), normal BMM serves as control.
