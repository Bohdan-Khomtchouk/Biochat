TITLE
ChIP-seq anlysis of Sox2, Tfap2c, and Cdx2 in trophoblast stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation by Sox2, we analyzed genome-wide binding sites of Sox2, Tfap2c, and Cdx2 in trophoblast stem (TS) cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).

DESIGN
ZHBTc4- and embryo-derived TS cell lines were maintained in the presence of FGF4 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).
