TITLE
Essential roles of Lamtor1 in CD4+ T cell-mediated autoimmunity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lamtor1 is a protein that is required for amino acid sensing and activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) at lysosomes. The critical role of Lamtor1 in macrophage polarization has been clarified recently. However, the role of Lamtor1 in adaptive immune system has not been investigated. Here we show that Lamtor1-deficient T cells showed markedly reduced IL-2 production, decreased mTORC1 activity, and decreased expression of purine-synthesis and lipid-synthesis enzymes.

DESIGN
The labeled cRNAs were hybridized on 4X44K ver.2 Agilent Whole Mouse Genome dual colour Microarrays (G4846A) in a dye swap experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL10333 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
