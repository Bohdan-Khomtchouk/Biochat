TITLE
Genes regulated by miR-145

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips to compare the transcriptome of miR-145-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells against negative control miRNA precursor-transfected cells.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with pre-miR-145 or a negative control pre-miRNA, and subsequently total RNA was collected and processed for analysis using Affymetrix microarrays. Three independent replicates were prepared for each comparison group.
