TITLE
Nucleosome positioning under perturbation conditions in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report nucleosome poisitioning under pertubation conditions such as heat shock, CHD1 deletion, and SET2 deletion

DESIGN
Mono-nucleosome DNA was prepared from wild type strain under normal or heat shock conditions, or CHD1 or SET2 deletion strain. The mono-nucleosome DNA was mapped.
