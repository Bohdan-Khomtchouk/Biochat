TITLE
A Restricted Role for Sperm-borne MicroRNAs in Mammalian Fertilization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prototypical micro RNAs (miRNAs) are 21~25-base-pair RNAs that regulate differentiation, carcinogenesis and pluripotency by eliminating mRNAs or blocking their translation, processes collectively termed RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi mediated by miRNAs regulates early development in zebrafish, and mouse embryos lacking the miRNA precursor processor, Dicer, are inviable. However, the role of miRNAs during mammalian fertilization is unknown. We here show using microarrays that miRNAs are present in mouse sperm structures that enter the oocyte at fertilization. Sperm contained a broad profile of miRNAs and a subset of potential mRNA targets were expressed in fertilizable, metaphase II (mII) oocytes. Oocytes contained transcripts for the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) catalytic subunit, EIF2C3 (formerly AGO3). However, levels of sperm-borne miRNA (measured by quantitative PCR) were apparently low relative to those of unfertilized, mII oocytes, and fertilization did not alter the part of the mII oocyte miRNA landscape that included the most abundant sperm-borne miRNAs. Coinjection of mII oocytes with sperm heads plus anti-miRNAs - to suppress miRNA function - did not perturb pronuclear activation or preimplantation development. Contrastingly, we provide evidence that nuclear transfer by microinjection alters the miRNA profile of enucleated oocytes. These data argue that sperm-borne prototypical miRNAs play a limited role, if any, in mammalian fertilization or early preimplantation development. Keywords: miRNA profiling
