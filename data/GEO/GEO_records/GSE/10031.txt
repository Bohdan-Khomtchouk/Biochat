TITLE
mRNA expression data in Δrsf1mutant during growth on, and transition to growth on glycerol as sole carbon source

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Rsf1p is a putative transcription factor required for efficient growth using glycerol as sole carbon source but not for growth on the alternative respiratory carbon source ethanol. We use microarrays to determine the differences in the transcriptional program between the Δrsf1 mutant and the wild type during respiratory growth on glycerol as well as the transition to growth on glycerol as sole carbon source. Keywords: Mutant analysis during timecourse following switching carbon source from dextrose to glycerol

DESIGN
Δrsf1or the isogenic parent strain were grown to early log (A600=0.6) in YPD and then washed twice in prewarmed YPG (30ºC) and returned to the air shaker in YPG for 15, 30 or 60 minutes. " Limit " conditions were provided by harvesting cells grown in YPD to early log phase without shifting to YPG and by harvesting cells grown in YPG to early log phase. Since the Δrsf1 mutant and its isogenic parent strain grow equally well on the respiratory carbon source ethanol, cells were also harvested after being grown in ethanol to early log phase.
