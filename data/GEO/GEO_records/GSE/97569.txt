TITLE
Gene expression analysis of undifferentiated and differentiated human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze gene expression profiles of differentiated and undifferentiated cancer cells, oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC-2 cells were cultured under normal or adhesion-restricted condition and subjected to cDNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
To induce differentiation, HSC-2 cells were seeded onto 24-well NanoCulture plate at a density of 5 Ã— 104 cells/ml for 72 hours. Total RNAs were isolated and subjected to cDNA microarray analysis. 4 replicates were examined on each condition.
