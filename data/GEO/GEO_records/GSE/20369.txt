TITLE
Binding site turnover produces pervasive quantitative changes in TF binding between closely related Drosophila species

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila yakuba

SUMMARY
[original title] Binding site turnover produces pervasive quantitative changes in transcription factor binding between closely related Drosophila species. We demonstrate extensive quantitative changes in binding of six factors that control early embryonic patterning between two closely related Drosophila species

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq based binding measurements of six transcription factors in embryos of two Drosophila species, D.melanogaster and D.yakuba.
