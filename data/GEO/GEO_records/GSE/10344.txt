Expression data from garlic-fed mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Garlic is a popular flavor enhancer in modern cuisines. Although anti-atherosclerotic, anti-proliferative, hypolipidemic and chemopreventative effects of garlic are known for a long time, the mechanisms of garlic as a dietary supplement ramain largely unknown. We used microarrays to analyze the global programme of gene expression in control (cellulose) and garlic-fed mice and identified erythropoietic and heme biosynthetic genes that could, in part, be responsible for the pleiotropic effects of garlic on health Keywords: diet, garlic

DESIGN
8-week old male C57BL/6J mice were divided into two diet groups and maintained at an SPF facility. Mice were fed (ad libitum) a special diet (Yeh and Yeh, 1994) with 4% cellulose (Control group, 3 mice) or 4% lyophilized raw garlic powder (Treatment group, 3 mice). At the end of the 15-week treatment, spleen organs were used for RNA isolation and arraying.
