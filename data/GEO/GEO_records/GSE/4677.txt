TITLE
Analysis of sex chromosomes effect on hybrid male sterility

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila sechellia ; Drosophila simulans ; Drosophila sechellia x Drosophila simulans

SUMMARY
Sex chromosomes and more particularely the X chromosomes are known to have a major effect on hybrid male sterility. In this experiment by making use of the reciprocal hybrids between D. simulans and D. sechellia, we are showing the effect of these chromosomes on gene expression in male hybrids Keywords: X chromosome, hybrid

DESIGN
Testes from for days old individuals (D. simulans, D. sechellia, hybrid D. simulans female x D. sechellia male, hybrid D. sechellia female x D. simulans male) were dissected and RNA was extracted and hybridized along with a reference RNA from the whole body of 4 days old D. melanogaster male. Gene expression in hybrids were compared to parental gene expression in order to isolate misexpressed genes in each hybrids. In order to reveal the cross effect misexpressed genes in hybrids were compared to identify genes commonly misexpressed and genes genes misexpressed in only one hybrid.
