TITLE
Gene expression profiling in the heart following exposure of rats to heat acclimation, its loss and re-induction.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To understand faster reinduction of heat acclimation,  in this investigation we studied global stress associated genomic response during acclimation, following its loss and re-induction. Nylon cDNA Atlas Array was used.  Collectively, the study comprised nine experimental groups of which six characterized experimental basal conditions: Controls-untreated, Short and Long term heat acclimated groups ( exposure to environmental heat at 34oC for 2 or 30 days respectively), Deacclimated group (24oC for 1mo) and Reacclimated groups (2d at 34oC following the deacclimation protocol). Three additional experimental groups: Controls, Short and Long term and Reacclimated rats (as above) were tested for genomic responses following subjection to heat stress at 41oC. Because of a dichotomy between genomic and physiological responses we hypothesize thst rapid reacclimation is linked to reprograming of gene expression. Keywords: heart, Left ventricle
