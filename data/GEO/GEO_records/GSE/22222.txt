TITLE
Expression profile of Chicken Early Embryonic Endodermal Tissues

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
In vertebrates the endoderm which gives rise to the epithelial lining of the digestive tract becomes regionalized along its antero-posterior axis after gastrulation. The molecular basis of the initial step of this regionalization has largely remained unclear. Using chick model, we generated high-quality transcriptomic datasets of different stages/regions of the endoderm and analyzed their molecular heterogeneity.

DESIGN
Total RNA from HH stage 4-5 entire definitive endoderm, HH stages 10-11 foregut endoderm and HH stages 8-10 mid/hindgut endoderm were purified.  5 Î¼g of RNA from each sample were used to screen Affymetrix Chicken Genome Array without an amplification step.
