TITLE
Differential gene regulation downstream of murine Tmem173 variants

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report positional cloning and characterization of a novel Sting allele that fails to activate IFN production in the wild-derived mice of MOLF/Ei strain in response to HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) and Listeria monocytogenes both in vitro and in vivo. We show that previously uncharacterized mutations in the N-terminal of STING are responsible for low levels of IFN due to failure of MOLF STING to respond to cytosolic STING agonists such as 2’3’cGAMP, 5,6-Dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) or poly(deoxyadenylic-deoxythymidylic) acid (dAdT). Using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for the analysis of DNA-responses in congenic C57BL6.StingMOLF/MOLF (MOLF STING) mouse macrophages, we show that these mutations in MOLF/Ei discriminate in responses between different STING agonists. Macrophages from C57BL6.StingB6/B6¬ (B6 STING), or B6 STING expressing littermates were stimulated as a positive control for STING activation, and STING -/- (STING KO) macrophages served as a negative control.

DESIGN
To examine differential gene regulation downstream of murine Tmem173 (STING) allelic variants. We stimulated macrophages from B6 mice congenic for MOLF STING; macrophages from B6 STING expressing littermates were stimulated as a positive control for STING activation, and STING -/- (STING KO) macrophages served as a negative control. One replicate of RNA-seq reads after each stimulation provided. Conditions are peritoneal macrophages from B6 congenic mice expressing: B6 STING, MOLF STING, or STING KO stimulated with 2’3’cGAMP, 5,6-Dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), poly(deoxyadenylic-deoxythymidylic) acid (dAdT), or no treatment. This constitutes a total of 12 reads analyzed in this data set.
