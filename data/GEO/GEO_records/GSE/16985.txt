TITLE
Neonatal Hydrocephalus: Saline Control vs. Kaolin-Induced

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the parietal cortex was performed in postnatal day 22 rats with obstructive hydrocephalus.  An intracisternal injection of kaolin was done on postnatal day one, and severe hydrocephalus developed over 3 weeks.  Hydrocephalic animals were compared to age-matched saline controls.  The goal was to determine the effects of kaolin-induced neonatal hydrocephalus on gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: kaolin-induced vs. saline-injected controls. Replicates: 5 treatment samples and 5 saline controls.
