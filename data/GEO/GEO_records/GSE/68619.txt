TITLE
Expression data from bone marrow cells of type 2 diabetic mice and wild type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
More and more studies pointed out that BM was the primary target of diabetes mellitus-induced damage. The aim of this study was to determine whether distinct gene expression profiles are associated with altered functions of bone marrow cells in diabetes mellitus type 2 mice. We performed global gene expression analysis in the bone marrow cells of 3 diabetic mice and 3 non-diabetic mice using Affymetrix Gene Chip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. The gene expression patterns of diabetic mice were compared with those of nondiabetic ones using fold change. Validity of microarray results was examined by quantitative RT-PCR.

DESIGN
The femurs and tibiae of type 2 diabetic mice and wild type mice were excised and the diaphyses flushed using a 25g needle and PBS. RNA was isolated for the collected cells and used for microarray analysis.
