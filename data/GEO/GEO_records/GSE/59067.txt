TITLE
Expression data from  15h-grown E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The production of lycopene in E. coli can be improved by mutated CRP.CRP is a well-known global transcription factor regulating the expression of more than 400 genes that belong to different functional groups of E. coli. During the accumulation of lycopene in E. coli, the engineered CRP alters the expression level of many genes, such as the genes belong to lycopene production pathway, which leads to the improved lycopene production. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression under the condition of engineered CRP and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
E. coli growed for 15h was selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. As we know that the biggest difference in lycopene production was at 15h during cultivation, so we chose 15h as the time-point.
