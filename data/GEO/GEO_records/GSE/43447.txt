TITLE
Evaluation of subsequent passaging on whole genome expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Heart diseases are as most leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. One of the promising approaches to cure these diseases is cell therapy using endogenous cardiac precursor cells resident in heart tissues. These cells are isolated from heart biopsies, cultured and passaged to reach to the desirable cell count necessary for transplantation. The process of cell propagation and subsequent passages may cause gene expression alteration unsuitable and dangerous for cell therapy; so in our study, we analyzed whole genome expression using microarray technology to compare expressed transcripts in 4 passages 6, 9, 12 and 15.

DESIGN
There were 4 different passage samples (6, 9, 12, and 15) each stage with three replicates. Replicates for passage 6 were determied as control group and the data was analyzed compaired to this passage.
