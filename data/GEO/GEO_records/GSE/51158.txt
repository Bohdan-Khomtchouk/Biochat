TITLE
Afghan Hindu Kush: where Eurasian sub-continent gene flows converge

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite being located at the crossroads of Asia, genetics of the Afghanistan  populations have been largely overlooked. It is currently inhabited by five major ethnic  populations: Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek and Turkmen. Here we present autosomal  from a subset of our samples, mitochondrial and Y- chromosome data from over 500  Afghan samples among these 5 ethnic groups. This Afghan data was supplemented  with the same Y-chromosome analyses of samples from Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia  and updated Pakistani samples (HGDP-CEPH). The data presented here was  integrated into existing knowledge of pan-Eurasian genetic diversity.  The pattern of genetic variation, revealed by structure-like and Principal Component  analyses and Analysis of Molecular Variance indicates that the people of Afghanistan  are made up of a mosaic of components representing various geographic regions of  Eurasian ancestry.  The absence of a major Central Asian-specific component indicates that the Hindu  Kush, like the gene pool of Central Asian populations in general, is a confluence of  gene flows rather than a source of distinctly autochthonous populations that have  arisen in situ: a conclusion that is reinforced by the phylogeography of both haploid  loci.
