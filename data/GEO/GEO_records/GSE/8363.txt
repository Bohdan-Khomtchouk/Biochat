ORGANISM
Picea

SUMMARY
As part of a larger conifer genomics project, we developed a new 21.8K cDNA microarray containing 21,843 spotted ESTs from spruce (Picea spp.).  To evaluate the performance of the array we conducted four technical replicate self-self hybridizations using untreated control bark RNA pooled from four biological replicates.  The objectives were to determine: 1) the linear dynamic range of expression detection of the array; 2) the level of non-specific hybridization to negative control elements on the array; and 3) the overall technical reproducibility of the array. Keywords: Array performance evaluation using self-self hybridizations.
