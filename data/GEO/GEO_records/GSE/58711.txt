TITLE
The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor modulates DNA repair and radio responsiveness

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we show that RB loss promotes sensitization to genotoxic stress through mechanisms distinct from cell cycle checkpoint control, and identify RB as a potent effector of the response to radiotherapy.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis was performed, validated, and mechanisms discerned and multiple mechanisms were interrogated including cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair.
