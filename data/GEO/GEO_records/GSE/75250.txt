TITLE
Genome-wide profilings of IFN-stimulated murine splenic B cells by ChIP-seq.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the IFN-induced dynamics in murine splenic B cells. Male C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously with 10,000U IFNa and spleens were removed at designated time. B cells were negatively isolated using magnetic beads and profiled for the binding of PolII and Stat2 by ChIP-seq analysis.

DESIGN
Profilings by PolII ChIP-seq over the time course (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48hrs, single replicate for each), Stat2 ChIP-seq (0 and 90min, biological duplicate for each).

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus) GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
