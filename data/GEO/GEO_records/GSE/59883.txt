TITLE
mRNA expression changes upon microRNA downmodulation in colorectal cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer cell lines were transduced with lentiviral antisense miRNA inhibitors (miRZIPs) targeting miR-429, miR-200b, miR-194 and miR-203. Global mRNA expression profiles were generated with Illumina arrays on transduced and control cells to identify mRNAs whose expression is regulated by the above microRNAs.

DESIGN
Colorectal cancer cell lines transduced with control vectors or with microRNA targeting vectors were profiled, together with wild-type cells, using two independent RNA extractions.
