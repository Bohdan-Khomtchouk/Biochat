TITLE
Expression analysis of control and KLF4-overexpressing podocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate podocyte gene expression and promoter methylation affected by KLF4, we examine about whole genome expression profiles using Agilent microarray and its correlation with promoter methylation profiles using Illumina DNA methylation array (GSE41689) as shown in supplementary data.

DESIGN
Genome wide expression profiling of control (vector-transfected n=1) and KLF4-overexpressing (n=1) human podocytes (parental cell line: Saleem et al. JASN 13:630, 2002) and DNA methylation profile of promoter regions were shown.
