TITLE
MT1-MMP induces malignant transformation in Mammary cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of the MT1-MMP gene induces a significant upregulation of of oncogenes and tumorignenic genes in 184B5-MT1 cells. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of untransfected Mammary cell line compared to MT1-MMP transfected Mammary cell line. Singel channel data from the illumina platform. After normalisation and t-tests differential gene expression was determined between the two groups using p-values and fold change.

PLATFORM
