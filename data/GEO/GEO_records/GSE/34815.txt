TITLE
Impact of miR-199-5p overexpression and CAV1 silencing on human lung fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify putative novel specific targets of mir-199-5p, we overexpressed miR-199a-5p as well as miR-21 and a siRNA targeted against CAV1 in  human HFL1 pulmonary fibroblasts (CCL-153)  by transfecting them with synthetic pre-miRNAs or a synthetic “negative” pre-miRNA as control (miR-Neg). RNA samples were harvested at 48 hours post-transfection and 2 independent experiments were carried out. Additional samples correspond to HFL1 cells  treated or not with 10ng/ml TGFbeta for 48 hours in the absence of serum (2 independent experiments).

DESIGN
2 independent experiments performed in a one color design, corresponding to 7 conditions (miR-Neg, miR-199-5p, miR-21, si-Neg, si-CAV1, control, TGFbeta) and a total of 14 samples.
