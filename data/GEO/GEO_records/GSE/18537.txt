TITLE
Analysis of human neurotrophins and receptors in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) treated with NGF or BDNF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BMSC gene expression profiling was completed to examine the baseline neurotrophin and receptor gene expression in BMSC and to evaulate changes in gene expression in response to NGF or BDNF stimulation

DESIGN
In the study, primary BMSC were treated with recombinant human NGF or BDNF for 24 hours.  Following treatment,  RNA isolated from the BMSC were analyzed using the Human Neurotrophin and Receptor Gene Array HS-018
