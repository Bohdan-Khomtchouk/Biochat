TITLE
Transcript abundance in A-T-derived iPSC: Comparing isogenic cells to unrelated individual

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) were prepared from multiple subjects with Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T).  iPSC were prepared from activated T-cells using commercial Sendai virus to deliver reprogramming factors.  ATM protein-expressing and non-expressing cultures would found in multiple sub-lines (sub-lines are generated from distinct founder colonies of cells) from a single subject (Q3).  Genetic analysis determined that all sub-lines originated from the same subject and were likely the product of spontaneous reversion by gene correction.  To compare gene expression profiles, three iPSC samples were assayed: (1) A reverted ATM+/- subline from subject Q3, (2) An ATM-/- subline from subject Q3, and (3) An iPSC line from an unrelated ATM-/- subject, Q1.  Analysis reveals that the majority of significantly-different genes between the unrelated ATM-/- line (Q1SA) and the reverted ATM+/- line (Q3SC) was due to genetic variation between individuals.  A more focused set of contrasting genes could be identified between the isogenic Q3-derived lines (Q3SA, ATM-/-, vs. Q3SC, ATM+/-).  The 206 transcripts that are significantly different point to a differential regulation of p53-associated pathways.

DESIGN
Total cellular RNA was prepared from each iPSC culture.  Different passage numbers or sister cultures were used as replicates (n=2).
