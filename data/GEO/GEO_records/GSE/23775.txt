TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the barley fast neutron mutants nec3

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
Affymetrix Barley1 GeneChip microarray was used to study the transcriptome of two fast neutron barley mutants FN362 and FN363 allelic to characterized necrotic leaf spot 3 (nec3) mutants. PCR screening of the 21 genes at least two-fold down-regulated in mutants did not show any deletions in the genome of mutants and, thus, failed to identify a gene responsible for the nec3 mutant phenotype suggesting that either probe set for the NEC3 gene is not on the Barley1 GeneChip, or that the expression of wt NEC3 is confined to specific developmental stage or tissue type.

DESIGN
Transcriptome of the two barley fast neutron mutants was compared to the transcriptome of parental variety Steptoe
