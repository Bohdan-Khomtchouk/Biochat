TITLE
Human thyroid adenomas, carcinomas, and normals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human samples of various thyroid carcinomas, adenomas, and normals, each from a different patient, had mRNA assays performed using Affymetrix HG_U133A arrays, with 22283 probe-sets.  The 99 samples consisted of 4 normals, 10 follicular adenomas, 13 follicular carcinomas, 7 oncocytic adenomas, 8 oncocytic carcinomas, 51 papillary carcinomas (each typed as having classical, follicular or tall cell morphology), 4 anaplastic carcinomas, and 2 medullary carcinomas.  Interesting additional information on common mutations are provided including RAS mutation, BRAF mutation, RET/PTC rearrangements, and PAX8/PPARG translocations.  Details of those assays are provided in our linked publications, as well as additional details on the specific mutations in a few special cases.  No survival data is provided.  Information for 93 of the 99 samples was previously made available on the web.  The anaplastic and medullary carcinoma data were not previously shared.  A supplementary Excel spreadsheet holding the same processed data as the series matrix file is provided and is more compact.  The raw (.CEL) files are also provided.
