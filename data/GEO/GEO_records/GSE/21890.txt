TITLE
A cDNA Microarray, UniShrimpChip, for Identification of Genes Relevant to Testicular Development in the Black Tiger Shrimp (Penaeus monodon)

ORGANISM
Penaeus monodon

SUMMARY
Comparisons of gene expression profiles from testis of wild and domesticated male brooders were made through a cDNA microarray in the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). Differentially expressed genes were identified through the microarray analysis, and the microarray results were confirmed by real-time PCR. Selected genes were further characterized.

DESIGN
A cDNA microarray was constructed from the EST libraries of P. monodon, consisting of 5,568 features. RNA samples were extracted from testes of pooled juveniles (4 month-old, pooled from n=114), broodstocks from West and East sides of Thailand, and domesticated broodstocks of 10-, 14-, and 18-month old. The RNA from testis of pooled juveniles was labeled with Cy3 dye as a reference and those of the broodstocks were labeled with Cy5 dye.
