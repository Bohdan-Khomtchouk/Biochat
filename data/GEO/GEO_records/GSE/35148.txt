TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of P15 dorsal root ganglion gene expression of control and Isl1-Cre//c-Maf mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The sense of touch relies on the detection of mechanical stimuli by specialized sensory neurons. Mechanosensory neurons are generated from neural crest cells, but the scarcity of molecular data has made it difficult to analyze their development and to define the basis of their diversity and function. The transcription factor c-Maf is crucial for mechanosensory function in mice and humans. In particular, c-Maf is required for the development and function of mechanosensory neurons terminating in lanceolate endings, Meissner corpuscles and Pacinian corpuscles. c-Maf is a key transcription factor directing the development and function of rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors and their end organs.

DESIGN
Total RNA of pools from L3,4,5,6 DRGs of 15-day-old control mice was compared to total RNA of pools from L3,4,5,6 DRGs of 15-day-old Isl1-Cre//c-Maf conditional mutant mice.

PLATFORM
