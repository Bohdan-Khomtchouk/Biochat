TITLE
Molecular Characterization of Breast Carcinoma Associate fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal breast fibroblasts, breast cancer associated fibroblasts, fibroblasts taken at least 2cm from cancer margins and femur-derived human mesenchymal stem cells were profiled for comparative purposes

DESIGN
Ex vivo cultured primary cells of different anatomical origin were expression profiled under low serum conditions: cancer-associated fibroblasts, fibroblasts from a distance of at least 2cm from the cancers' edge, fibroblasts from cancer-free breasts and mesenchymal stromal cells from the marrow of femurs.  Biological Replicates= 46.  Technical Replicates= 17

PLATFORM
