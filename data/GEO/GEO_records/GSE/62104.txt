TITLE
Follicular helper T cell signature in Type 1 Diabetes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study set out to examine CD4 T cell differentiation in a mouse model of diabetes based on transgenic expression of ovalbumin under the control of the rat insulin promoter and co-expression of the DO11.10 transgene (DO11 x rip-mOVA mice). The transcriptome of T cells isolated from the pancreatic lymph nodes (lymph nodes draining the site of self antigen expression) was compared with that of T cells isolated from inguinal lymph nodes (non-draining lymph nodes). T cells were sorted based on expression of CD4, DO11.10 TCR (KJ-126), CD25 and CD69.

DESIGN
Primary cells from 6 week old DO11 x rip-mOVA mice were isolated ex-vivo from the pancreatic lymph nodes or inguinal lymph nodes. Cells were sorted by flow cytometry using antibodies to CD4, DO11.10 TCR (KJ-126+), CD25 and CD69.  3-6 replicates were collected per experimental group with each replicate deriving from 14 mice. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen).
