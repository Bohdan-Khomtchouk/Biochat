TITLE
Gene expression data from gastrocnemius muscle (m.Gas) in young adult mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study examined the effects of castration and testosterone replacement on global differential gene transcription in the gastrocnemius muscle (m.Gas) in young adult mice over 14-days.

DESIGN
Each of the 3 treatment groups was composed of 3 independent biological replicates, totaling 9 arrays. Equal amounts of the highest quality total RNA (4 Âµg) from three animals were pooled for each biological replicate, totaling the use of 27 animals in the 9-array experiment.  The balanced design of this study enabled the use of a 1-way ANOVA, which was used to statistically determine which of the > 34,000 genes ( > 45,000 probes) were differentially expressed between groups. The three pair-wise comparisons were: Castration vs. Sham (castration (C) effect); Testosterone vs. Castration (testosterone replacement (T) effect); and Testosterone vs. Sham (overall effects).
