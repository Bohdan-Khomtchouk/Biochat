TITLE
Topoisomerase II inhibition involves characteristic chromosomal expression patterns: Trovafloxacin study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Trovafloxacin is a broad spectrum antibiotic that inhibits the uncoiling of supercoiled DNA in various bacteria by blocking the activity of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Specific members of this drug family display high activity against eukaryotic type II topoisomerase, as well as cultured mammalian cells and in vivo tumor models. Trovafloxacin seems to have a higher affinity for eukaryotic polymerase II system than the other quinolone agents tested. This effect coupled with other factors, such as an inflammatory response, might result in a hepatotoxic reaction seen with drug. In this study we found genes regulated by trovafloxacin - induced and repressed - to be located much closer to each other than genes distributed randomly all over the genome ( < 100 kbp). Keywords: Trovafloxacin-treated human hepatocytes versus non-treated human hepatocytes

DESIGN
We calculated specifically the probability by which particular genes which were deregulated by the treatment of human hepatocytes with trovafloxacin will occur within DNA windows of different sizes as compared to the probability of all known mapped genes (RefSeq transcripts) of the human genome (NCBI RefSeq 19,360; build 36.2) to occur within the same DNA windows.
