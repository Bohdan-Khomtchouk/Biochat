TITLE
affy_diversity_maize-Understanding the Diversity of Maize Cell Wall

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
affy_diversity_maize - affy_diversity_maize - Maize, Zea mays, is one of the most widely grown crops in the world as it provides cereal grain for human purposes and feedstock for cattle. Maize is increasingly used as a biomass fuel, such as ethanol. Studies have shown that maize stem is made up of different lignified cell types: epidermis, sclerenchyma (a few layers under the epidermis and surrounding vascular bundles in the rind), parenchyma (mostly lignified near the epidermis). One of the aims of this work is to find out if it is the proportion of these different cell types or their number (especially for vascular bundles) which influences the degree of digestibility of maize lines. For that the objective of our work is to develop a genomic strategic approach allowing an improvement of traits involved in cell wall degradability. The work will include the mapping of genes considered as strategic in the cell wall biosynthesis, the search of new genes of interest through bio-analysis, the functional analysis of genes suspected to be of importance in cell wall pathway, the search of candidate underlying QTL, and transcriptomic approaches in order to find genes co-regulation, transcription, and eQTL.-Comparison of two maize lines Cm484 (line of good digestibility) and F98902 (line of bad digestibility) at the same developmental stage (male flowering). Keywords: organ comparison
