TITLE
Expression data from stably-transfected KYSE150, transfected with shlncRNA625 or shscramble

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To delineate the putative biological functions for lncRNA625, We performed expression profile from stably-transfected KYSE150 transfected with shlncRNA625 or shscramble for functions of lncRNA625 in ESCC

DESIGN
Stably-transfected KYSE150, transfected with shlncRNA625 or shscramble, were collected and lysed in TRIzol (Life technologies). Microarray experiments were performed following the Affymetrix protocol at the Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation.
