TITLE
Effects of JNK on TGF-beta responses of mouse B lymphoma derived A20 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TGF-beta plays multiple functions in a board range of cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, motility and survival by activating several cellular signaling pathways, including Smads and MAP kinases (Erk, JNK and p38). In particular, TGF-beta can activate pro- or anti-apoptotic signals depending on the target cells. We found that blockage of JNK activation sensitized mouse B lymphoma derived A20 cells to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that TGF-beta activate JNK to inhibit the activation of death signal that is simultaneously activated by TGF-beta. We used microarrays to gain insight into the effects of JNK inhibition on gene expression in TGF-b-stimulated A20 cells and identified JNK-dependent TGF-beta inducible genes. Keywords: time course
