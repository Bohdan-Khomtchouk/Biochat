TITLE
RNA-seq for monitoring expression changes in absence of chromatin anchoring

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
RNA-seq for monitoring expression levels in mutants that do not anchor chromatin at the nuclear periphery.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of depleted rRNA samples of early embryo extracts for three different genotypes: wild-type, cec-4_delta and met-2 set-25_delta_delta, in two independent biological replicas

PLATFORM
