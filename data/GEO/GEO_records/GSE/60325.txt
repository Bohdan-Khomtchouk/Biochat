TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Schwann cell gene expression in LKB1-SCKO mutant mice prior to occurrence of axon degeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in LKB1(Stk11)-depleted sciatic nerves (LKB1-SCKO) vs control nerves from age-matched mice. Gene expression profiles are predominantly derived from Schwann cell glia and provide important information about the response of peripheral nerve Schwann cells to inactivation of the metabolic regulator protein LKB1(aka Stk11).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from  sciatic nerve segments from 6 LKB1-SCKO mutant mice compared to RNA from nerve segments from 6 control mice (floxed LKB1 mutant mice that do not express Cre recombinase).
