TITLE
Expression array analysis of MEC1, MEC2 and JeKo-1 cells 3h and 10h after overexpression of KLF4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a recent study we identified the transcription factor KLF4 as deregulated by DNA methylation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in comparison to healthy B-cells. To analyze the function of KLF4 in leukemia cells and to identify downstream targets of the transcription factor we overexpressed KLF4 in 3 different cell lines: the CLL cell lines MEC1 and MEC2 and in the mantel cell lymphoma cell line JeKo-1.

DESIGN
Cell lines MEC1, MEC2 and JeKo-1 were transfected with pcDNA3.1V5/HIS-KLF4 and pcDNA3.1V5/HIS-ctrl using the Amaxa nucleofector II device (Lonza), nucleofection solution V and program X-001. RNA was isolated from samples taken 3h and 10h after nucleofection using the DNA/RNA allprep Kit (Qiagen).
