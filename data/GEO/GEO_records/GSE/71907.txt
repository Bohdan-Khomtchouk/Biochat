TITLE
RNA-seq analysis determined the effect of pat or cobB mutation on transcriptional levels in Salmonella Typhimurium 14028s.

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. ATCC 14028

SUMMARY
Salmonella causes a range of diseases in different hosts, including enterocolitis and systemic infection. Lysine acetylation regulates many eukaryotic cellular processes, but its function in prokaryotes is largely unknown. Reversible acetylation in Salmonella Typhimurium depends on acetyltransferase Pat and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylase CobB. Here, we used cell and animal models to evaluate the virulence of pat and cobB deletion mutants in S. Typhimurium, and found that pat is essential for bacterial intestinal colonization, systemic infection and host inflammation response. Next, to understand the underlying mechanism, genome-wide transcriptome was analyzed. RNA-seq data showed the expression of Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 (SPI-1) is partially dependent on pat. In addition, we found that HilD is a substrate of Pat, which is essential for maintaining HilD protein level. Taken together, these results suggested that protein acetylation system regulates SPI-1 expression by controlling HilD in a post-translational manner to mediate S. Typhimurium virulence.

DESIGN
