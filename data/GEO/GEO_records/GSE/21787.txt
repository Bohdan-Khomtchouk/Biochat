TITLE
Control of chromatin structure by Spt6 has different consequences in coding and regulatory regions

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Spt6 is a highly conserved factor that carries out important functions in transcription and chromatin structure. To gain new insights into Spt6, we measured nucleosome occupancy along Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III in an spt6 mutant and found that the level of nucleosomes is greatly reduced accross some but not all coding regions. In addition, genome-wide location analyses of RNA polymerase II showed that the nucleosome loss in the spt6 mutant occurs over highly-transcribed genes. Unexpectedly, the effects of the spt6 mutation on nucleosome levels did not correlate with its effects on mRNA levels, suggesting that Spt6 plays distinct roles in controlling chromatin structure across coding regions and in transcriptional regulation. We studied one case of transcriptional regulation by Stp6, at the CHA1 gene, and showed that regulation likely occurs by Spt6 controlling the position of the +1 nucleosome. These results, along with previous studies, suggest that Spt6 regulates transcription by controlling chromatin structure over regulatory regions, and its effects on nucleosome levels over coding regions likely serve and independent function.

DESIGN
In order to examine the genome-wide localization of RNAPII and Spt6 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RNAPII and Spt6 along with associated DNA sequences were immunoprecipitated using anti-8WG16 and anti-HA antibodies, respectively. The RNAPII and Spt6 chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed in duplicate from WT cells as described below. The extracted DNA was hybridized to a DNA microarray containing an average of 4 probes per kilobase across the whole yeast genome. The combined datasets are available in the supplemental files of the related publication.
