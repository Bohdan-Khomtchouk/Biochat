TITLE
Anti-microbial peptides increase tolerance to oxidant stress in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
It is well appreciated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are deleterious to mammals, including humans, especially when generated in abnormally large quantities from cellular metabolism. Whereas the mechanisms leading to the production of ROS are rather well delineated, the mechanisms underlying tissue susceptibility or tolerance to oxidant stress remain elusive. Through an experimental selection over many generations, we have previously generated Drosophila melanogaster flies that tolerate tremendous oxidant stress and have shown that the family of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) is over-represented in these tolerant flies. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that overexpression of even one AMP at a time (e.g. Diptericin) allows wild type flies to survive much better in hyperoxia. In the current study, we used a number of experimental approaches to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying hyperoxia tolerance in flies with antimicrobial peptide overexpression. We demonstrate that flies with Diptericin overexpression resist oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and preventing an increase in ROS level after hyperoxia. Depleting the GSH pool using buthionine sulfoximine limits fly survival, thus confirming that enhanced survival observed in these flies is related to improved redox homeostasis. We conclude that a) AMPs play an important role in tolerance to oxidant stress; b) overexpression of Diptericin changes the cellular redox balance between oxidant and antioxidant, and c) this change in redox balance plays an important role in survival in hyperoxia.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of Drosophila melanogaster with anti-microbial peptide over-expression (experimental sample; n=3) and controls (UAS-AMP alone not crossed to da-GAL4; n=3) were determined using Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 Arrays.
