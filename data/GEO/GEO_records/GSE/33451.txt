TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene transcription in myocardium of mice transgenically expressing human cardiolipin synthase 1 (hCLS1) in cardiac tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptome of cardiac tissue from mice transgenically expressing human cardiolipin synthesis.  The hypothesis tested was that cardiac specific transgenic expression of cardiolipin synthase alters myocardial lipidomic flux resulting in compensatory metabolic gene transcriptional changes that will attenuate pathological environmental and dietary insults on bioenergetics.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from cardiac tissue from transgenic cardiac specific expressing human cardiolipin synthase 1 (hCLS1) mouse model at 4 months of age  compared to wildtype littermates

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
