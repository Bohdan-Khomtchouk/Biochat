TITLE
Expression data from B6C3F1 mice treated with reduced oxygen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice received decreasing oxygen concentrations from 21% to 6% O2 for ~ 30 minutes. Then, the mice remained an additional 120 minutes at 6% O2, control mice were placed insimilarchambers but recieved normal (21%) oxygen.

DESIGN
Mice were euthanased by cervical dislocation under ketamine / acepromazine (100 mg/kg / 5 mg/kg, I.P) anesthesia. The bone marrow from the right humerus, a portion of the left lateral liver lobe and half a cross-section of the spleen were harvested and the RNA was isolated from these tissues using standard Qiagen reagents. Standard Affymetrix protocols were used for GeneChip probe preparations. 39 arrays.
