TITLE
AMPK activation exerts anti-senescence effect in human follicle dermal papilla cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the role of AMPK activation in the progression of senescence in HFDPCs. The anti-senescence effects of adenine, a recently identified AMPK activator, were determined in a comparison with AICAR, a pharmacological AMPK activator, in HFDPCs. The results showed that either adenine or AICAR induced phosphorylation of Thr172 of AMPK in HFDPCs. As revealed by microarray analysis, significant changes of gene expression pattern were observed in the high-passage HFDPCs compared with that at lower passage level.

DESIGN
A chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of Human follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) and three separate cultures of a triple adenine-treated cells.
