TITLE
Silencing of cryptic prophages in Corynebacterium glutamicum

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum

SUMMARY
DNA microarrays were applied to investigate the transcriptome of C. glutamicum cells and to identify potential target genes under CgpS countersilencing conditions. The silencing activity of CgpS was reduced by overexpression of the N-terminal part, which was placed under the control of the inducible tac promoter in the pAN6 plasmid. The expression of the N terminal part was induced with 100 µM IPTG.

DESIGN
DNA microarray analysis were performed with three biological replicates. The transcriptome of C. glutamicum cells in which CgpS activity was downregulated by countersilencing was compared to the transcriptome of C. glutamicum wt cells containing the empty plasmid. Countersilencing was achieved by overexpression of the N-terminal part of CgpS with 100 µM IPTG.
