TITLE
Haemophilus parasuis F9 transcriptome in biofilm and planktonic cultures using RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
[Haemophilus] parasuis

SUMMARY
Purpose: Study transcriptome differences between biofilm, planktonic and stationary cultures. Methods: Total mRNA from in vitro cultures was extracted and sequenced using Ion Torrent PGM sequencer. Results: Characteristic transcriptomic profile was observed for biofilm, planktonic and stationary cultures. Biofilm and planktonic were similar biological states. Conclusions: Results suggest that H. parasuis F9 has more active metabolism during biofilm or planktonic growth when compared to stationary culture. Some identified membrane-related genes could play an important role in biofilm life.

DESIGN
RNA profiles of 36 hours biofilm or planktonic cultures were generated and compared with stationary culture profile.
