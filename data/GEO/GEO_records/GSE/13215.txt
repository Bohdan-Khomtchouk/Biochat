TITLE
Overexpression of Musashi1 (Msi1) in HEK293T cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of the Msi1 overexpression in HEK 293T cells.

DESIGN
There were two biological replicates of Msi1 and GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) as control, used in the experiment. Each slide includes 4 microarrays with one biological sample versus control. Samples were hybridized with dye-swap replica.
