TITLE
Role of microRNAs and microRNA machinery in the pathogenesis of Diffuse large B-cell Lymphomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed miRNA expression profiling in  a series of de novo DLBCLs, transformed DLBCLs and non-neoplastic lymph nodes using a microarray approach. Significant differentially expressed miRNAs among groups were identified using SAM analysis.

DESIGN
Agilent microarray platform containing 470 miRNAs was used to determine miRNA expression profiles in 45 DLBCL cases (32 de novo and 13 transformed) and 10 lymph nodes. To validate the microarray platform, the expression levels of selected miRNAs were evaluated using qRT-PCR.

PLATFORM
GPL9081 Agilent-016436 Human miRNA Microarray 1.0 G4472A (miRNA ID version)
