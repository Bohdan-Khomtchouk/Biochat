TITLE
Expression analysis of individual homoeologous wheat genome- and rye genome-specific transcripts in a 2BS.2RL wheat-rye translocation

ORGANISM
Secale cereale ; Triticum aestivum ; Triticum urartu ; Aegilops speltoides ; Aegilops tauschii

SUMMARY
To distinguish transcripts expressed from each of the three wheat genomes and those from the rye chromatins, genomic probes generated from diploid progenitors of wheat and rye were synthesized

DESIGN
Consensus sequences for probe design were generated from local unigene clusters. EST and cDNA sequences were downloaded from NCBI. A total of 52,589 pairs of probes were designed. Two 60 bp probes were designed from each consensus sequence. The array was manufactured by NimbleGen and synthesized on 12-plex arrays. Two independent biological replicates were used in separate hybridizations. Each biological replicate was a total RNA sample extracted from the whole tissue of two seedlings.
