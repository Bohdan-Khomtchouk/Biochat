TITLE
Wild dolphin PBL analysis

ORGANISM
Tursiops truncatus

SUMMARY
To determine what can the transcriptome tell us about populations of free-ranging bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus. Keywords: health assessment

DESIGN
A total of 151 individuals were sampled from 4 different geographic location in U.S. waters between June of 2003 and June of 2006. Of the 151 dolphins, 59 were from Charleston, 35 from Indian River Lagoon, FL, 32 from Sarasota Bay, FL and 25 from St. Josephs Bay FL. Total RNA extracted from blood leukocytes of wild dolphins was analyzed and different sets of genes were used as classifiers in a machine learning approach, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
