TITLE
Regulatory consequences of TARBP2 knock-down in Dicer-null MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
siRNA-mediated knock-down followed by transcriptomic profiling revealed that silencing of TARBP2 resulted in a significant up-regulation of sRSE-carrying transcripts.

DESIGN
Two independent siRNAs were used to knock down TARBP2 in metastatic Dicer-null cells. The cells were then subjected to transcripome profiling in comparison to mock-transfected cells.
