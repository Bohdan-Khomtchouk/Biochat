TITLE
Time-dependent global gene expression profile of RAW264.7 cells infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of RAW264.7 cells infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv at an MOI of 10 performed 4 and 24 hours post-infection.

DESIGN
RAW264.7 cells were infected with Mtb for 4 hours at an MOI of 10. Cells were washed and treated with gentamycin for 2 hours in order to remove adhered bacteria. Incubation was continued further for  4 and 24 hours followed by total RNA isolation. Total RNA was labelled with Agilentâ€™s quick-Amp labelling kit (p/n: 5190-0444) to generate fluorescent complementary RNA by using T7 promoter based linear amplification. The control sample was labelled with Cy3 while the infected samples were labelled with Cy5 and hybridized to an  Agilent oligo microarray kit.
