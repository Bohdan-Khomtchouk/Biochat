TITLE
Genome-wide microRNA expression profiles of rat hippocampus in a chronic temporal lobe epilepsy model induced by amygdala stimulation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to participate in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases including epilepsy. To date, the expression and functions of miRNAs in chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common type of refractory epilepsy in adults, have not been well characterized. Here, we adopted high-throughput sequencing to investigate miRNA expression profile in a chronic TLE model induced by amygdala stimulation

DESIGN
Hippocampus miRNA profiles of TLE group and control group were generated by deep sequencing, using Hiseq 2000.
