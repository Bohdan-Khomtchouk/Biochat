TITLE
Investigating gene expression changes in wildtype and TMPRSS2-ERG homozygous mouse prostate tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A transgenic TMPRSS2:ERG  mouse model was engineered in FVB background and compared to its wildtype counterpart in the absence of any treatment This experiment is designed to look at ERG-dependent changes in phenotype and gene expression

DESIGN
A loxP-GFP-loxP-hERG exon 4-11 cassette was inserted into a BAC clone containing the TMPRSS2 locus using a recombineering kit.  This modified BAC was used for pronuclear injection and generation of germline-transmitting mice. One line expressing high GFP was used for pronuclear injection of Cre protein and one sub-line that transmitted the TMPRSS2:ERG transgene into the germline  was subsequently bred to homozygosity.
