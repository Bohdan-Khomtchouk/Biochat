TITLE
HNF4α and TCF4 (TCF7L2) ChIPseq in Tet-On HCT116 inducible cell lines that express either the human HNF4α2 or HNF4α8 under the control of doxycycline (DOX) [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Aim of the study is to determine how many of the dysregulated genes in the RNAseq are direct targets of (P1) HNF4α2 and (P2) HNF4α8 and examine HNF4α and TCF4 binding in vivo. We performed ChIPseq on TCF4 in the absense or presence of DOX in the Tet-On inducible HCT116 HNF4α2 and HNF4α8 lines, and ChIPseq for HNF4α (a445 Ab) in the presence of DOX.  Methods: HNF4α2 and HNF4α8 lines were induced with 0.3 μg/mL DOX for 24 hours. Samples were generated by deep sequencing, using the NEXTflex ChIPseq. Result: There were more HNF4α2 peaks than HNF4α8 peaks, with some common peaks bound by HNF4α2 and HNF4α8. Binding patterns were observed between HNF4α and TCF4. Conclusion: HNF4α2 can displace TCF4 better than HNF4α8 on AP-1 bound sites.

DESIGN
Tet-On inducible HCT116 cell (HNF4α2 and HNF4α8) lines, treated with (0.3 μg/mL) or without DOX for 24 hours, were 50bp single-end sequenced using Illumina-compatible-NEXTflex ChIP kit (Bioo Scientific).
