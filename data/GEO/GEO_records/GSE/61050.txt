TITLE
Expression data of neural progenitor cells differentiation from human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mocetinostat (MGCD) which is a kind of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) promotes human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiation towards neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Application of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) increased the expression of neuroectodermal markers once neural differentiation was initiated, thereby leading to more NPC generation. We used  microarrays to detail the global gene expression during NPC differentiaton upon MGCD treatment and identified the transcript changes effected by MGCD during this process.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated H9 hESCs (D0), as well as H9 cells with or without MGCD treatment on day 3 (D3C and D3M) and on day 7(D7C and D7M) of NPC generation were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
