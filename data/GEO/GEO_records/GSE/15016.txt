TITLE
Ecotoxicogenomic analysis on the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to BPA, DEHP and NP

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis was conducted on the wildtype Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to bisphenol A (BPA), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and nonylphenol (NP) using whole genome microarray. The microarray study was conducted in an ecotoxicological context, by investigating the  response of global gene expression with that of classical toxicological endpoints, such as, mortality, growth, reproduction and development. Results provide insight into global transcription response of C.elegans to these endocrine disrupting chemicals exposure and also contribute to enhance the potential of C.elegans microarray in ecotoxicology (ecotoxicogenomics). key word : ecotoxicogenomics

DESIGN
Young adults of wildtype C.elegans from age-synchronized population were exposed to NP, DEHP and BPA at the concentrations equivalent to 1/100 of 24h LC50 of each chemical, for 24 h and RNA extraction and hybridization were subsequently conducted using C.elegans Genome array (Affymetrix).
