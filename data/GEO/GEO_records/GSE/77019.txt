TITLE
The non-CG methylation is cell-type specific and conserved between human and mouse [Third-party reanalysis]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The non-CG methylations are abundant in several mammalian cell types, while their biological functions are largely unknown. We gathered 51 DNA methylomes in both human and mouse, covering brain neuron cells, embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, primordial germ cells (PGC) and oocytes. Then a two-dimensional comparison on non-CG methylation was carried out across cell types and species. We employed an unbiased sub-motif prediction method and identified CW (W can be A or T) as the representative non-CG methylation context. We further showed mCW was significantly distinct from CC methylation (mCC) in both context and genomic distribution. Our studies on sequence preferences and genomic region enrichment revealed that mCW was cell-type specific and conserved between human and mouse. We reported young long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (LINE-1) elements tended to be deprived of mCW in brain for both species. Interestingly, both human Alu elements and mouse B1 elements were found to prefer high mCW at specific loci during evolution. Additionally, we reported a peak of CG methylation (mCG) at the promoter of young LINE-1 element in PGC, in contrast to the global CG demethylation. Lastly, we confirmed strand-skewed non-CG methylation in mouse ES intronic region, and showed the strand-specific distributions of mCW in LINE elements are also cell-type specific and conserved. Our findings indicate that mCW is conserved in species, dynamically regulated during development, and likely to guide the evolution of transposon elements.
