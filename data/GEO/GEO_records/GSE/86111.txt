TITLE
Time course profiling of IEC and total colonic tissue transcriptome in T.mu colonized animals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this experiment we profiled the transcriptome of intestinal colonic epithelium and total colonic tissue of animals colonized with T.mu  versus na√Øve littermate controls at different time points

DESIGN
Groups of three mice were inoculated with 2x106 highly purified Tritrichomonas musculis. Total tissue and epithelial cells were collected at 3 days, 14 days and 48 days after inoculation from three different mice. RNA was isolated and sequenced
