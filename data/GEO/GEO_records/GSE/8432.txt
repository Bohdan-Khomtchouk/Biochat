TITLE
Expression survey of Rpp1 soybean line PI200492 resistant to P. pachyrhizi

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Affymetrix soybean genome arrays were used to identify genes differentially expressed in the immune resistance response at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after inoculation with Phakopsora pachyrhizi isolates TW72-1 or HW94-1 soybean + HW94-1 = resistant;  soybean + TW72-1 = susceptible Keywords: time course

DESIGN
For each of 4 time points (6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post inoculation) a soybean PI200492 plant was inoculated with 2 treatments: HW94-1, or TW72-1.  A mock inoculation was performed and sampled at time 0.    There were three biological replicates of the entire experiment, for a total of 27 samples.  During data analysis two samples failed the quality control metrics and were removed from the analysis, leaving 25 samples in the final data set.
