TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Follicular Lymphoma (FL) cultured in the presence or absence  of the Follicular Dendritic Cell (FDC) line  HK

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cells from 2 FL patients and 1 FL cell line were cultured for up to 48h, with no stroma or on top of HK cells pre-establised layers. RNA from FL cells was isolated after 24 and 48h of culture The aim of this study was to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the FL-FDC crosstalk

DESIGN
Global RNA expression in FL cells that have been in contact or not with the FDC cell line HK
