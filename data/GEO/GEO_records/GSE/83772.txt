TITLE
The FAM46C gene encodes a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase and acts as an onco-suppressor in multiple myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FAM46C is one of the most frequently mutated genes in multiple myeloma (MM) and encodes a protein of unknown function. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that FAM46C encodes an active cytoplasmic non-canonical poly(A) polymerase, which enhances mRNA stability and gene expression. Moreover, we also found that the reintroduction of active FAM46C into MM cell lines, but not its catalytically-inactive mutant, leads to broad polyadenylation and stabilization of mRNAs strongly enriched with those encoding endoplasmic reticulum-targeted proteins and induced cell death. This is, to our knowledge, the first report that directly associates cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase with carcinogenesis. Furthermore, our data suggest that the human genome encodes at least eleven non-canonical poly(A) polymerases with four FAM46 family members. Since FAM46 proteins are differentially expressed during development, these proteins may positively regulate transcript stability and translational rate in a tissue-specific manner.

DESIGN
The H929 and SKMM1 MM cells were transduced with lentiviruses carrying FAM46CWTGFP (WT) or FAM46CD90A,D92AGFP (catalitic mutant). 72h after transgene delivery total RNA was extracted and RNA-seq libraries were prepared.
