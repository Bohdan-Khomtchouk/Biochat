TITLE
miRNA profilng in IL-2 induced CD4+T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate role of miRNAs in proliferation and death of T cell, we performed miRNA profiling in activated CD4+T cells after IL-2 induction and depletion. Proliferation rate of IL-2 induced cells was measured by MTT assay. Then quantitative RT-PCR arrays on 739 miRNAs revealed up- and down-regulation of 170 miRNAs in IL-2 induced CD4+T cells relative to IL-2 depleted ones.

DESIGN
For miRNA profiling, total RNA from activated CD4+T cells in the presence and the absence of IL-2 (0.75 n/ml) after 3 days was extracted. RNA isolation was carried out using miRCURYTM RNA isolation kit. cDNA synthesis and Q-RT-PCR were performed with miRCURY LNATM universal RT microRNA PCR kit. Both kits were purchased from Exiqon (Vedbaek, Denmark). According to manufacturer’s instructions, to synthesize cDNA, total RNA was added to enzyme mix, reaction buffer, and RNA spike-in (control RNA). Then, the mixture was incubated 60 min at 42 °C and 5 min at 95 °C. To perform Q-RT-PCR array, cDNA was added to SYBR green master mix and was dispensed into the 384-well plates (by a specific LNATM primer pair/ well); then the reaction was performed using a real-time PCR cycler (Roche LC480, USA) according to this program: 95°C for 10 min, 45 cycles at 95˚C for 10 sec, 60˚C for 1 min. For miRNA profiling, two 384-well plates (human panel I & II) were used and each reaction was performed twice. Each panel contained 6 reference primer sets as well as one control primer set (that targeted a synthetic spike-in RNA) and an inter-plate calibrator in triplicate. To analyze Q-RT-PCR data, GenEx software and ΔΔCT method were used. By Normfinder, SNORD49A (snoRNA U49) gene was identified as optimal reference gene for normalization. Fold change of each miRNA was calculated by the equation 2−ΔΔCT and logarithmically transformed (base 2). P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Dunn-Benferroni correction.
