TITLE
Stem cell therapy of murine liver cirrhosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of the liver and hepatic inflammatory cells in murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis models by treatment with adipose tissue derived stem cells

DESIGN
Cirrhotic C57Bl/6 female mice fed by atherogenic high fat diet for 40 weeks were treated with adipose tissue-derived stem cells twice every two weeks. Two weeks later, gene expression of the liver and intrahepatic inflammatory cells were examined by DNA microarray.
