TITLE
Caveolin-1 promotes the human trophoblasts cells invasion through FAK signaling pathway in the early placental development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA expression profiles in the placenta tissues from different developmental stages in mice were analyzed by Arraystar Mouse LncRNA Microarray V3.0.

DESIGN
The placenta tissues of mice were divided into three groups, including group A ( E7.5 d ),group B ( E14.5 d ) and group C ( E19.5 d ).Three  independent tissues samples were repeated at each time point.
