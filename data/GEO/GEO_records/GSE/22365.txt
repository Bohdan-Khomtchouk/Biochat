TITLE
miRNA expression data from A549 exposed to formaldehyde

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are investigating the miRNA expression profiles of human lung cells to gaseous formaldehyde We used microarrays to detail the global programme of miRNA expression upon response to formaldehyde

DESIGN
A549 cells were grown to confluency and exposed to formaldehyde or mock-treated. RNA was collected 9 hrs after exposure.
