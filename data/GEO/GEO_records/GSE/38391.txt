TITLE
Next generation sequencing facilitates quantitative analysis of GATA2 binding profile in LNCaP cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We find  36,797 high-confidence (p < 1E-8) GATA2 binding sites and  GATA2 bound primarily to distal elements in LNCaP cells.

DESIGN
Examination of GATA2 binding sites in biological duplicate LNCaP samples.

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
