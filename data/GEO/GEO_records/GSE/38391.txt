TITLE
Next generation sequencing facilitates quantitative analysis of GATA2 binding profile in LNCaP cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We find  36,797 high-confidence (p < 1E-8) GATA2 binding sites and  GATA2 bound primarily to distal elements in LNCaP cells.

DESIGN
Examination of GATA2 binding sites in biological duplicate LNCaP samples.
