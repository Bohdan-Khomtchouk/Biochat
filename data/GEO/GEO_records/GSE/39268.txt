TITLE
Rosette iron deficiency transcript profiling in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Kas-1 and Tsu-1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Iron (Fe) is an essential plant micronutrient, and its deficiency limits plant growth and development on alkaline soils.  Under Fe deficiency, plant responses include upregulation of genes involved in Fe uptake from the soil.  However, little is known about shoot responses to Fe deficiency.  Using microarrays to probe gene expression in Kas-1 and Tsu-1 ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed conserved rosette gene expression responses to Fe deficiency. Fe regulated genes included known metal homeostasis-related genes, and a number of genes of unknown function.

DESIGN
Kas and Tsu Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on complete media for 24 d, and then put on complete or -Fe media and collected after 24 and 48 h.
