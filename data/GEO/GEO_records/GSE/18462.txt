TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles between paired primary and metastasis colorectal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Paired tissues (normal colon, primary colorectal carcinoma, normal liver, liver metastasis of colorectal carcinoma) from 2 colorectal carcinoma patients in Taiwan were processed to generate total RNA, which was subsequently analyzed for gene expression using Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays.
