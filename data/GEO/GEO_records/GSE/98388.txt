TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing measuring Nod-like receptors mRNA expression in intestinal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intestinal epithelisal cells were obtained by EDTA isolation of ileum from WT mice followed by facs sorting (EpCAM + CD45 – 7AAD – ). Raw sequencing reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) with Tophat , and gene expression levels were measured by Cufflinks .

DESIGN
Ileum epithelisal cells mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using illumina HiSeq 2000.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
