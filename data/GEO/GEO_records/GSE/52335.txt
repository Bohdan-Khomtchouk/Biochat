TITLE
Differential gene expression between WT MARC-145 cells and MARC-145 cells stably expressing Non-Structural Protein 11 of Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome Virus

ORGANISM
Chlorocebus aethiops

SUMMARY
Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a virus infecting swine and causes swine abortion. Previously, non-structural protein 11 (Nsp11) from PRRSV was shown to have inhibitory function to type I IFN signaling. In this project, we want to see in addition to type I IFN, whether other cellular pathways are influenced by Nsp11 systemtically. A cell line stably expressing PRRSV Nsp11 was established, designated as MARC-Nsp11 cells, and an RNA microarray was conducted using these cells and WT MARC-145 cells

DESIGN
MARC-145 and MARC-Nsp11 cells were seeded one day prior to experiments and total cellular RNAs were extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and purified by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The quantity and quality of RNA were determined using an Align 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo, Alto, CA, USA), and the RNA integrity was determined above 7. The RNA samples were then subjected to microarray using Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix UK Ltd, High Wycombe, UK) at the Keck Biotechnology Center, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). The microarray was repeated twice in duplicates each.
