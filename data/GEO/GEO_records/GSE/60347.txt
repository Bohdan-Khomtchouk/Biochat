TITLE
Neisseria gonorrhoeae drg::cm versus wild type and Neisseria gonorrhoeae drg::dam versus wild type

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of N. gonorrhoeae comparing wild type cells to cells with inactivated by chloramphenicol cassette (cm) dam replacing gene (drg) or wild type cells comparing to cells with inserted dam gene. The Goal was to study the role of drg or dam presence in overall expression profile.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild type cells vs. mutant cells . Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 mutant replicates.
