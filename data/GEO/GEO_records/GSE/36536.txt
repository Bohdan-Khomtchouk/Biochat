TITLE
MeCP2-R270X and MeCP2-G273X ChIP-Seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MECP2-R270X transgenic mice (TG) and MECP2-G273X TG mice were generated in the Zoghbi Lab. These mice express the respective truncated form of MeCP2 tagged with GFP at the C-terminus from a transgenic human PAC containing all known regulatory sequences. These transgenes were maintained on a wild-type pure FVB background. For experiments each transgenic line was crossed by Mecp2 null mice (Mecp2 tm1.1Bird)  on a pure 129SvEv background and the resulting male F1 hybrid progeny (FVB;129SvEv) that lacked endogenous MeCP2 expression but expressed either transgene (Mecp2 -/y; MECP2-R270X TG or Mecp2-/y; MECP2-G273X TG) were used for ChIP-Seq analysis. Whole brain from either the R270X mice (Mecp2 -/y; MECP2-R270X TG) or the G273X mice (Mecp2 -/y; MECP2-G273X TG) was formaldehyde crosslinked and purified chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody (Abcam ab6556).

DESIGN
2 samples: R270X (Mecp2 -/y; MECP2-R270X TG) and G273X (Mecp2 -/y; MECP2-G273X TG) both on an F1 (FVB;129SvEv) hybrid background
