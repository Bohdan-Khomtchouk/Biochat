TITLE
Edema Toxin-treated Macrophage Study

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Edema toxin (EdTx), which is a combination of edema factor and a binding moiety (protective antigen), is produced by Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax. EdTx is an adenylyl cyclase enzyme that converts adenosine triphosphate to adenosine-3’,5’-monophosphate, resulting in interstitial edema seen in anthrax patients. We used GeneChip analysis to examine global transcriptional profiles of EdTx-treated RAW 264.7 murine macrophage-like cells at 3 and 6 hr. Keywords: Toxin response

DESIGN
RAW 264.7 cells were treated with EdTx (2.5 µg/ml of protective antigen and 0.625 µg/ml of Edema factor), PA (2.5 µg/ml), or LPS (1 ng/mL) for 0, 3, and 6 hr. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, generating a total of 21 arrays (biological replciates).
