TITLE
Functions of BET proteins in GATA1-mediated transcription [expression array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Role of bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) proteins in GATA1-null erythrolbasts (G1E) and in differentiation induced by activation of conditional GATA1 tested by addition of BET inhibitor JQ1 (250nM) Array protocols were conducted as described in the Ambion WT Expression Manual and the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual by the University of Pennsylvania Molecular Profiling Core.

DESIGN
Two-factor design (+/- JQ1, +/- GATA1). External RNA spike-in controls (ERCC controls, Ambion) added to each sample in proportion to cell number at the time of RNA harvest.
