TITLE
Gene expression in three stages of ripening tomato fruit

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Gene expression in three stages of ripening tomato fruit (variety Ailsa Craig) was determined with the EUTOM3 Affymetrix array in order to compare with degradrome sequencing data from study GSE42661, treated as RNAseq.

DESIGN
three replicates of each stage (MG, mature green; T, turning/breaker; RR, red ripe) were hybridized; Expression values were normalized for each sample and reported by iTAG2.3 cDNA identifier in the accompanying matrix table.
