TITLE
Mapping of H4-acetylated chromatin modifications in differentiating human primary myoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assessed the genomic distribution of H4-acetylated chromatin by ChIP using SNP chips and an antibody specific to four acetylated lysine residues of H4. Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization
