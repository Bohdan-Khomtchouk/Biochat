TITLE
Mapping of H4-acetylated chromatin modifications in differentiating human primary myoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assessed the genomic distribution of H4-acetylated chromatin by ChIP using SNP chips and an antibody specific to four acetylated lysine residues of H4. Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Triplicate Affymetrix 10K ax13339 SNP chips were hybridized to DNA extracted from myoblasts and myotubes. One replicate set was hybridized to total DNA extracted from myoblasts. Another replicate set was hybridized to DNA extracted from myotubes after CHiPping with H4-acetylated chromatin. The final replicate set was hybridized to DNA extracted from myoblasts after CHiPping with H4-acetylated chromatin.
