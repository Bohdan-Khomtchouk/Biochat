TITLE
Fetal lung development

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Fetal lung development is a complex biological process, which involves temporal and spatial regulations of many genes. To understand molecular mechanisms of this process, we investigated gene expression profiling of lungs at gestational day 18, 19, 20, 21, new born, and adult rats using in-house rat DNA microarray containing 6,000 known genes and 4,000 ESTs. 1,512 genes passed SAM test and 583 genes (402 known genes and 181 ESTs) had a 2-fold change at least at one time point. K-means cluster analysis revealed 7 major expression patterns. Furthermore, using GeneMapp, we identified 3 regulatory pathways: TGF beta signaling pathway, cell cycle, and G-protein signaling; and 2 metabolism pathways:  proteasome degradation and glycolysis. Our results suggest a complex regulatory pathway for fetal lung development. Keywords: Time course
