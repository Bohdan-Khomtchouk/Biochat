TITLE
Changes in transcription patterns in BoMac cells in response to PDD spirochetes

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Papillomatous digital dermatitis (PDD) is a polymicrobial infection in soft tissue adjacent to the hoof and is the leading cause of lameness in dairy cattle. Treponema phagedenis-like (TPL) spirochetes are a constant feature of PDD lesions and are localized deep in infected tissue.  Host-cell response mechanisms to TPL bacteria are poorly understood. To assess how bovine macrophages respond to cellular constituents of TPL spirochetes, changes in transcription were analyzed using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and real time RT-PCR.  This analysis revealed that bovine macrophages responded to stimulation with TPL-lysates by induction of several pro-apoptotic genes. Although several proinflammatory cytokines (eg. IL-6 and IL-8) are induced in treated macrophages, receptors and their accessory proteins for IL-1, IL-6, and IL-11 are either down regulated or unchanged.  Surprisingly, IL-1beta is not induced and IL-18 is suppressed in treated macrophages. Two genes encoding proteins having negative effects on NFκB, IκB and Siva-1, are significantly induced in stimulated cells.  Combined, these data suggest that the innate immune response of bovine macrophages exposed to TPL cellular constituents are impaired thereby enabling bacteria to resist clearance and induce lesion formation.
