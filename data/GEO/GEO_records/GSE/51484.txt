TITLE
Expression data from human hair follicle after doxorubicin treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chemotheraputic drugs are able to affect both neoplastic and normal rapidly proliferating cells. We used microarray analysis to identify molecular signatures of the early phase in the response of human hair follicles to chemotheraputic drug, doxorubicin.

DESIGN
Human hair follicles were cultured in Williams E medium and were treated with 1 uM Doxorubicin HCl or vehicle control solution for 1 hour. 3 hours after treatmnet hair bulbs were disected for RNA isolation and RNA was analysed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 array.  processing 3 hours after completion of the DXR treatment. Total RNA was isolated from the hair follicle bulbs using TriIzolÂ® Reagent (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). All experiments were performed using at least three replicates, and RNA isolated from three experimental and control samples was pooled and processed for microarray analyses using one sample of pooled RNA per experimental and control group.
