TITLE
Microarray Coverage of Universal Human Reference RNA on microarrays with yeast controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray coverage of UHRR was determined by counting the number of spots with intensities exceeding the 1% and 5% false positive rates defined using the yeast negative control spots. Seven microarrays from different print runs were used. In four experiments, the UHRR was labeled with Cy5 and in three experiments with Cy3. Labeled UHRR was co-hybridized with Common Reference RNA (CRF) developed at Stanford University (8) labeled with the alternate dye. A reference experiment design type is where all samples are compared to a common reference. Keywords: reference_design
