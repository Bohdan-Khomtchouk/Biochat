TITLE
Exposure of cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE 41 o-) to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA01) biofilms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the clinical setting, mutations in the CFTR gene enhance the inflammatory response to P. aeruginosa (PA01) infection, but measurements of the inflammatory response to pathogen stimulation by isolated airway epithelia can yield variable results. In this series, we exposed CFBE41o- cells over-expressing ∆F508/∆F508 CFTR and CFBE41o- cells rescued with wt-CFTR to P. aeruginosa  biofilms. P. aeruginosa elicited a more robust increase in cytokine and chemokine expression (e.g., IL-8, CXCL2,  CXCL3, CXCR4 and TNF-α) in CFBE-wt-CFTR cells compared to CFBE-∆F508-CFTR cells. These results demonstrate that CFBE41o- cells complemented with wt-CFTR mount a more robust inflammatory response to P. aeruginosa than CFBE41o- ∆F508/∆F508-CFTR cells.

DESIGN
CFBE41o- cells generously provided by Dr. J.P. Clancy (University of Alabama). The series involved 4 treatment groups: unexposed wild type CFTR cells, unexposed ∆F508/∆F508 CFTR cells,  wild type CFTR cells exposed to PA01, and  ∆F508/∆F508 CFTR cells exposed to PA01. Each treatment group involved 4 replicate polarized monolayers. PAO1 was added to the apical side of exposed monolayers at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 30:1 for 1 hour in the absence of antibiotics, and then planktonic PAO1 was removed by replacing the apical medium with MEM supplemented with 0.4% arginine (2). Control monolayers were treated identically except that vehicle only (medium used to grow PAO1, MEM supplemented with 0.4% arginine) was added to the apical side of cells. Five hours after washing planktonic P. aeruginosa from the cell monolayers mRNA was isolated.
