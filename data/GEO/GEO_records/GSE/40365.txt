TITLE
Comparison of genomic H3K9ac status in CD4 T cells with diverse progress of chronic hepatitis B

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) at transcription initiation sites is a well known marker for actively initiating and transcribing genes.The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between H3K9ac and diverse progress of HBV infection. We employed chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray (ChIP-chip) technology to profile and compare the variations of genes H3K9ac in CD4 T cells of the CHB patients at the different clinic phases. The results showed there were lots of different genes with H3K9ac among the study groups.
