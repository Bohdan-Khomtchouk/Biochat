TITLE
Global gene expression in muscle from fasted/refed trout reveals up-regulation of genes promoting myofibre hypertrophy but not myofibre production

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
To learn more about the contribution of genes regulating hypertrophy (increase in muscle fibre size) and hyperplasia (generation of new muscle fibres) in the compensatory muscle growth response in fish, we used high-density trout microarray to investigate the global gene expression in trout muscle during a fasting-refeeding schedule and in control-fed trout displaying normal growth.

DESIGN
global gene expression in trout muscle during a fasting-refeeding schedule and in control-fed trout displaying normal growth

PLATFORM
GPL15840 Agilent-030893 Rainbow_trout_60KV2 [Probe Name version]
