TITLE
Expression analysis of Linum usitatissimum 25-mers and 60-mers arrays

ORGANISM
Linum usitatissimum

SUMMARY
Performances of flax gene expression analyses were compared in two categories of Nimblegen microarrays (short 25-mers oligonucleotides and long 60-mers oligonucleotides) Results obtained in this study are described in Intra-platform comparison of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) high-density Nimblegen DNA microarrays submitted to Journal of Computational Biology

DESIGN
We compared two categories of flax target probes: short (25-mers) oligonucleotides and long (60-mers) oligonucleotides in identical conditions of target production, design, labelling, hybridization, image analyses, and data filtering. This comparison was realized with two different flax samples and each RNA sample was used for the two categories of arrays. Experiments were realized in order to discriminate specific gene expression profiles of two different flax tissues (outer and inner stem tissues).
