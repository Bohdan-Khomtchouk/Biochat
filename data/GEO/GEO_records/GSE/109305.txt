TITLE
Affymetrix OncoScan FFPE Microarray data for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For establishing a live-cell biobank of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) samples, cultures of two MPM patients were compared to the original tumor tissue using Affymetrix OncoScan Microarrays for genome-wide CNV and LOH detection.

DESIGN
Affymetrix OncoScan FFPE Microarrays were performed according the manufacturer's protocol on DNA extracted from FFPE tissue or primary cell cultures
