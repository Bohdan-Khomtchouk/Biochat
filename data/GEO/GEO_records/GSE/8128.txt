TITLE
E14 ES cells and Embryoid bodies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in murine ES cells Using the association of gene length and gene expression with gene-trap likelihood, we constructed spline-based regression models that characterize which genes are susceptible and which genes are resistant to gene-trapping techniques. Keywords: mouse E14 embryonic stem cells

DESIGN
We used E14 murine ES celss to determine genomewide expression characteristics
