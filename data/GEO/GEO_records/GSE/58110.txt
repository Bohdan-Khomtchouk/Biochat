TITLE
Probing the RyhB-2 regulon in Salmonella Typhimurium

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. 14028S

SUMMARY
Typically, the expression of sRNAs is activated in response to environmental stimuli in order to regulate gene expression through post-transcriptional mechanisms. In the present work we show that the Salmonella Typhimurium paralog sRNAs RyhB-1 and RyhB-2 are induced in response to the nitrosating agent S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Inactivation of these sRNAs decreased S. Typhimurium resistance to GSNO and increased the levels of nitrosylated proteins. These results prompted us to evaluate a possible role of these sRNAs in nitrosative stress resistance. RNA profiling was used as a screening to identify novel RyhB-1 and RyhB-2 regulated targets, and a subset of genes was filtered based on their potential role in the response to nitrosative stress. To confirm our observation, expression of the candidate targets was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in a wild type, single and double mutant strains (ΔryhB1, ΔryhB2 and ΔryhB1 ΔryhB2) treated with GSNO. In response to GSNO RyhB-1 and RyhB-2 negatively regulate the expression of the genes cyoABC (cytochrome o oxidase complex), cydB (cytochrome d oxidase complex), cybC (cytochrome b-562), and positively regulate the nirBCD operon (nitrite reductase system). Together, these results suggest that RyhB-1 and RyhB-2 finely tune the expression of genes coding for cytochrome and the nitrate reductase system, allowing the cell to cope with GSNO-induced stress.

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from two biological replicates of wt S. Typhimurium overexpressing the sRNA RyhB-2 grown in LB medium, in order to identify RhyB-2 targets that might be implicated in reactive nitrogen stress resistance.
