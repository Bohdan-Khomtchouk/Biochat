TITLE
Snd1-Mtdh interaction regulates cell survival under camptothecin-induced replication stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PyMT tumor cells with indicated status of Mtdh and Snd1 were treated with camptothecin (CPT) and the transcirptome profiles were determined and compared

DESIGN
two sets of experiments: (1) vector control vs Snd1-KD under CPT treament (2) PyMT/Mtdh-KO cells reconstituted with either WT or Snd1-binding deficient mutant Mtdh (W391D) under CPT treatment

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
