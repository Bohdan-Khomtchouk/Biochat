TITLE
Gene expression regulation by angiotensin II in late gestation fetal sheep

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
We undertook a transcriptome-wide discovery approach to provide information on the involved gene regulatory responses to change in fetal cardiac mass in response to chronic infusion of angiotensin II or losartan.

DESIGN
One of each of 8 twin fetus pairs was infused with either angiotensin II or losartan daily for five days in utero.  A portion of the left ventricular free wall of treatment and control fetuses was excised, homogenized in a reagent, and then total RNA was then isolated and assayed on the agilent microarray
