TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data of 35 multiple myeloma patients from UZ Leuven (Belgium)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosomal region 1p22 is deleted in ~20% of multiple myeloma (MM) patients, suggesting the presence of an unidentified tumor suppressor gene. Using high-resolution genomic profiling, we delimit a 58 kb minimal deleted region (MDR) on 1p22.1 encompassing only two genes: ectopic viral integration site 5 (EVI5) and ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5). Although mutations in 1p22 genes are rare in MM, the tumor suppressor role of EVI5 and RPL5 may be supported by the fact that these genes show the highest frequency of mutations predicted to impair protein function on 1p22.

DESIGN
Samples were selected among patients that were diagnosed with MM in UZ Leuven (Belgium) based on plasma cell infiltration of the bone marrow. Only bone marrow samples with at least 70% plasma cells were used in this study to achieve an optimal signal to noise ratio. In total, 36 samples of 35 patients were hybridised to the arrays; for one patient (MM10), also a remission sample was analysed.
