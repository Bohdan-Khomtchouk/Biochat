TITLE
Myoz3 overexpression and knockdown CEFs

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To identify novel pathways and genes that are respond to chMyoz3’s expression level change, we knock-down and over-expressed Myoz3 in chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF, stem cell that is wildly used to study chicken gene functions), respectively. RNA-seq and following analyses were then performed to identify genes and pathways involved in the process of Myoz3’s expression level change. We found multiple pathways and genes that were regulated by Myoz3, providing evidence for furhter study.

DESIGN
CEFs RNA sequencing under Overexpression, siRNA knockdown and their respectively control.

PLATFORM
GPL23499 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Gallus gallus)
