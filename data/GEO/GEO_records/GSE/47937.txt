TITLE
Gene expression changes due to influenza virus induced miRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to determine gene expression changes during influenza A virus infection as the result of expression influenza virus inducible miRNAs in A549 cells.

DESIGN
The gene expression profiling experiment was performed with 4 groups (mock infected, influenza A virus infected, influenza A virus infected in the presence of exogenous miR-141, miR-374b, miR-449b, miR-518b, and miR-1263, and influenza A virus infected in the presence of exogenous miR-147b, miR-190b, miR-199a, miR-512-5p, and miR-874 with 3 biological replicates for each group. Total RNA was purified from A549 cells that were mock infected or infected with influenza A virus (A/WSN/33, 5pfu/cell) alone or in the presence of miRNA mimics 10 hours after treatment.
