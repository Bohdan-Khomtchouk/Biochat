TITLE
Genome-Wide Specificity of DNA-Binding, Gene Regulation, and Chromatin Remodeling by TALE- and CRISPR/Cas9-Based Transcription Factors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Use DNase-seq to assess genome-wide chromation remodeling which occurred in CRISPR/Cas9 and TALE genome engineering systems

DESIGN
Determining  chromatin structural changes in transfected cells vs. the parent HEK293T cells
