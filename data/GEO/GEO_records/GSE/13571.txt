TITLE
human MRC-5 cells' gene expression difference compared with that of the adult cells including CCD-1079sk and IMR90

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
human somatic cell MRC-5 had different gene expression level compared with that of the adult cells including CCD-1079sk and IMR90. This difference gave the human somatic cell MRC-5 unique characteristics which could then be compared with the human ES cells by genes comparison to show the gene expression difference between human somatic cells and human ES cells.
