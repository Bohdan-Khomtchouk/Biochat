TITLE
human MRC-5 cells' gene expression difference compared with that of the adult cells including CCD-1079sk and IMR90

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
human somatic cell MRC-5 had different gene expression level compared with that of the adult cells including CCD-1079sk and IMR90. This difference gave the human somatic cell MRC-5 unique characteristics which could then be compared with the human ES cells by genes comparison to show the gene expression difference between human somatic cells and human ES cells.

DESIGN
There were two replicates sample of the Human MRC-5 cells named 1, 2. And the control cells were the mixture of CCD-1079sk and IMR90 named mix2. Human MRC-5 cells samples were labled with Cy3 and the mix2 were labled with Cy5. The data was process to show the human MRC-5 cells' gene expression difference compared with that of mix2.
