TITLE
Vibrio vulnificus : biofilm cells vs. planktonic cells

ORGANISM
Vibrio vulnificus

SUMMARY
The profiles of transcripts from the planktonic cells and biofilm cells of V. vulnificus were compared by using a V. vulnificus whole-genome microarray

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment,  planktonic cells vs. biofilm cells. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 experimental, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array. For transcriptome analysis, the V. vulnificus whole genome TwinChip, manufactured and kindly provided by the 21C Frontier Microbial Genomics and Applications Center (Daejeon, South Korea), was used.

PLATFORM
GPL17798 Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6 whole genome TwinChip
