TITLE
The Epigenetic Landscape of T Cell Exhaustion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used ATAC-Seq to define the accessible chromatin landscape in exhausted CD8+ T cells, showed that it is distinct from functional memory CD8+ T cells, and identified an exhaustion-specific enhancer of PD-1. In addition to the murine T cell data, we will provide the ATAC-Seq data used from human T cells in the paper.

DESIGN
10 ATAC-Seq samples from mouse CD8+ cells, two replicates for each of the following conditions [Naive, 8 days after acute LCMV infection, 27 days after acute LCMV infection, 8 days after chronic LCMV infection, 27 days after chronic LCMV infection]. 2 ATAC-Seq samples from EL4 cell line. 19 ATAC-Seq samples of T cells from human patients will be made available in an appropriate NCBI database.
