TITLE
Differential gene expression in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum among crossbred beef steers with divergent gain and feed intake phenotypes.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Steer small intestine transcriptome Evaluation of the naturally occurring transcriptome variation among beef steers with divergent gain and feed intake phenotypes.

DESIGN
The transcriptome of three sections of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) were examined for expression differences that contribute to cattle feed efficiency.
