TITLE
Gene changes of CD4+ T cells infiltrating human breast cancer in the absence of tumor environment (Confirmation Set 24h)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD4+ helper T (Th) cells are critical regulators of immune responses but their role in breast cancer is currently unknown. This work aims to characterize Th cells infiltrating invasive primary human breast tumors, analyze the influence by the tumor microenvironment and identify Th cell specific prognostic gene signatures.  CD4+ T cells isolated from the tumor (TIL), axillary lymph node (LN) and blood (PB) of 10 patients were analyzed on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. A confirmation set of 60 patients were studied by flow cytometry, qRT-PCR or immunohistochemistry and analyzed according to the extent of the tumor immune infiltrate. Gene expression profiles of freshly isolated TIL were also compared with TIL that had been rested overnight or with CD4+ T cells [non-stimulated (NS) or stimulated (S)] from healthy donor PB treated with tumor supernatant (SN). Analysis of CD4+ TIL with or without 24h ex-vivo rest, including donor blood memory CD4+ T cells treated in the same conditions as control

DESIGN
CD4+ T cells isolated from primary tumors of 2 patients and memory CD4+ T cells from a healthy donor blood were immediately analyzed or incubated for 24h without stimulation before being analyzed on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays
