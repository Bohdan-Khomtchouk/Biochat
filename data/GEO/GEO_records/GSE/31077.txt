TITLE
Expression data from rice seeds during low temperature treatment

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
As a species mostly planted in tropical and subtropical regions, rice is sensitive to chilling temperature, especially at reproductive stage. However, the effect of low temperature on seed development has not been well characterized. The transcriptome of two rice cultivars Zhonghua11 and Hanfeng were analyzed to characterize the gene regulatory networks of rice seed during low temperature treatment.

DESIGN
Whole plants of two rice cultivars Zhonghua11 (low temperature sensitive) and Hanfeng (low temperature tolerance) were treated at 14Â°C for 2 days during seed development stage. The plants without treatment serve as controls. Rice seeds were harvested for RNA extraction.
