TITLE
Genome-wide expression microarray analysis of SOX2-deficient TCam-2 cells in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina expression microarray analysis of seminoma-like TCam-2 cells depleted for SOX2 by CRISPR/Cas9. Cells were xenografted in nude mice. 2120EP embryonal carcinoma and parental TCam-2 cells were xenograted as controls. Tumors were recovered after 1 (1w) and 6 weeks (clone 1 - 5) of in vivo growth. Additionally, in vitro cultivated TCam-2 were analyzed as control. The data set is part of the study 'SOX2 is essential for in vivo reprogramming of seminoma-like TCam-2 cells to an embryonal carcinoma-like fate' (Nettersheim et al., 2016, Oncotarget).

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from in vitro cultivated TCam-2 and from tumors of TCam-2 (parental and SOX2-deficient clones) and 2102EP cells xenografted for 1 or 6 weeks. 1x10^7 cells were xenografted in 500 microliter Matrigel. RNA was analyzed by an Illumina HT12 expression bead chip. For more details see the related publication.
