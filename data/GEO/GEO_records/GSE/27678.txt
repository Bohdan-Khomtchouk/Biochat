TITLE
Gene expression analysis in a variety of normal, premalignant and squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to apply the technologies of gene expression profiling to detect genes significant in the aetiology of cervical carcinoma .  We investigated 14 normal (NAD), 11 low grade squamous intrapepithelial lesions (LSIL), 21 high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and 28 squamous cell carcinomas by Affymetrix GeneChip whole transcriptome profiling.  Two SCC cell lines were also included in the cohort.  Normal and SILS were profiled using the Affymetrix U133A platform, while SCCs and Cell lines were profiled using the Affymetrix U133A plus 2.0 array.

DESIGN
This submission describes the transcriptional profiles of  a cohort totalling 77 cervical normal, premalignant lesions, and squamous cell carcinomas
