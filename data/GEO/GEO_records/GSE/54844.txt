TITLE
Dynamic mRNA gene expression during a nutritional upshift from proline to glutamine

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Dynamic mRNA gene expression from the wildtype YSBN6 during a nutritional upshift from proline to glutamine. Glutamine was added to yeast cells growing exponentially on proline as the sole nitrogen source.

DESIGN
A sample was taken at steady-state 10 minutes before the shift, and then 3, 7, 10, 14, 24, 56 and 120 minutes after the glutamine addition. Biological triplicate gene expression was measured for samples -10, 7 and 24 minutes after shift, for a total of 14 chips. Changes were generally evaluated relative to the steady-state point (-10 minutes). Biological variability can be assessed from the replicates time points. Other dynamic omics data are associated with this dataset. Consult the publication for more details.
