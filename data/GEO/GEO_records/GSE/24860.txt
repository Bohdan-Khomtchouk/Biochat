TITLE
Expression analysis of Streptococcus pyogenes NZ131 serR-

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes NZ131

SUMMARY
Whole genone expression profile comparing wild-type NZ131 to serR deletion mutant, grown in C-medium Mutants and interpretation are described further in the manuscript to be submitted: LaSarre and Federle, 2010. Title: Regulation and Consequence of Serine Catabolism in Streptococcus pyogenes.

DESIGN
A two chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of Streptococcus pyogenes NZ131 and three separate mutant cultures of Streptococcus pyogenes NZ131 seR-, pooled following RNA extraction
