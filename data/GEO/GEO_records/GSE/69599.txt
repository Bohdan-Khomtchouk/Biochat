TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of PC9 cells with gefitinib or/and hypoxia treatment and comparison with gefitinib resistant PC9 cells and ALDH positive PC9 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inevitable gefitinib resistance and relapse of the disease was the biggest hurdle to NSCLC treatment. Importantly, the role of hypoxia in solid tumor tissues in vivo in gefitinib acquired resistance and its relationship to lung cancer stem cells (LCSCs) has not been fully elucidated. Here, the PC9 cells were treated with short term gefitinib or/and hypoxia, also, PC9 gefitnib resistant (PC9-GR) cell line was established and ALDH positive PC9 cells were sorted by FACs. Transcriptome analysis among those PC9 cell groups revealed the important role of hypoxia in gefitinib acquired resistance and signaling transduction change, which may critical for NSCLC disease progression and recurrence.

DESIGN
The PC9 cells were treated with 0.1 uM gefitinib or/and hypoxia for 1 week, also, PC9 geifitnib resistant (PC9-GR) cells and ALDH positive PC9 cells were anlyzed by RNA-seq technology.
