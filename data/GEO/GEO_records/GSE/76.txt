TITLE
Pressure-Overload Induced Cardiac Hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aortic banding is an excellent model system to evaluate the process of development of left ventricular hypertrophy in response to hemodynamic stress.  The Affymetrix GeneChip MgU74Av1 was used to analyze expression profiles of mice at different time points after surgical intervention for pressure-overload induced hypertrophy.
