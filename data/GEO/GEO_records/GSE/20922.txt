TITLE
Gene expression comparison between the murine T-cell hybridoma 6-13-64 ICOS(-) population and ICOS(+) population

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ICOS (Inducible Costimulator) is a T cell costimulatory molecule. We found that the cloned T-cell hybridoma 6-13-64 consists of two populations, ICOS expressing and non-expressing. The aim of this study is to screen for candidate genes that regulate ICOS gene expression by transcriptional profiling and comparison of the ICOS-positive and ICOS-negative subpopulations isolated from the 6-13-64 T-cell hybridoma.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, ICOS(-) vs. ICOS(+) cells. Independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
