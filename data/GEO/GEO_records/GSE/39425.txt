TITLE
Continuous gene expression profile of root at nighttime throughout the entire growth of rice in the field

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
A continuous gene expression profiling of roots was performed during nighttime at regular interval from transplanting until harvesting to characterize the transcriptional and physiological changes in the root system of rice throughout the entire growth under natural field conditions.

DESIGN
Roots were sampled at nighttime (24:00) at 7-day intervals encompassing 14 different growth stages. All samples were obtained from rice plants grown in the field during the 2008 cultivation season.
