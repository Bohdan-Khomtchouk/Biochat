TITLE
The effect of genotype and in utero environment on inter-individual variation in neonate DNA methylomes (methylomes)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We surveyed the genotypes and DNA methylomes of 237 neonates and found 1423 punctate regions of the methylome that were highly variable across individuals, termed variably methylated regions (VMRs), against a backdrop of homogeneity. Although methQTLs were readily detected in neonatal methylomes, genotype alone did not explain the majority of the VMRs. We found that the best explanation for 75% of VMRs was the interaction of genotype with different in utero environments, including maternal smoking, maternal depression, maternal BMI, infant birth weight, gestational age and birth order.

DESIGN
We surveyed the genotypes and DNA methylomes of 237 neonates and included 32 technical replicates
