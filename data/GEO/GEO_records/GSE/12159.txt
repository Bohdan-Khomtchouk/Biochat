TITLE
D4Z4-located miRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used a tiled microarray based on the D4Z4 sequence, and hybridized amplified transcripts from facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and control (CTRL) samples to detect D4Z4 related expression.

DESIGN
Microarrays were analyzed by GenePix Pro 6 (Axon). Local background corrected, median spot intensities were normalized using VSN in R. Due to this normalization strategy, we have treated the microarrays as single channels. The normalized values are uploaded with each sample. Hybridizations were performed in a dye-swap fashion. Samples GSM306099 and GSM306100 are on a single array, and so are GSM306101 and GSM306102, GSM306103 and GSM306104, GSM306105 and GSM306106.
