TITLE
Expression data from Col-0 and pil5 imbibed seeds after far-red or far-red/red light irradiation.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
PIL5 is a key negative regulator of phytochrome mediated seed germination and PIL5 protein is degraded by red light irradiation through phytochrome. The microarray aimed to find various red light-regulated genes and PIL5-regulated genes in the imbibed seeds. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Col-0 and pil5 seeds were irradiated by far-red light or far-red/red light and then, incubated in the dark for 12 hours. Total three biological replicates were used for the microarray.
