TITLE
Increased SRF Transcriptional Activity is a Novel Signature of Insulin Resistance in Humans and Mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is a key phenotype associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is even present in offspring of diabetic parents. However, molecular mediators of insulin resistance remain unclear. We find that the top-ranking gene set in expression analysis of muscle from humans with T2D and normoglycemic insulin resistant subjects with parental family history (FH+) of T2D is increased expression of actin cytoskeleton genes regulated by serum response factor (SRF) and its coactivator MKL1. Furthermore, the SRF activator STARS is upregulated in FH+ and T2D and inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity. These patterns are recapitulated in insulin resistant mice, and linked to alterations in two other regulators of this pathway: reduced G-actin and increased nuclear localization of MKL1. Both genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of STARS/MKL1/SRF pathway significantly alter insulin action: 1) Overexpression of MKL1 or reduction in G-actin decreased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation; 2) reduced STARS expression increased insulin signalling and glucose uptake, and 3) SRF inhibition by CCG-1423 reduced nuclear MKL1, improved glucose uptake, and improved glucose tolerance in insulin resistant mice in vivo. Thus, SRF pathway alterations are a signature of insulin resistance which may also contribute to T2D pathogenesis and be a novel therapeutic target.

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle samples were obtained from 10 subjects with type 2 diabetes, 25 subjects with a family history of type 2 diabetes (one or both parents), and 15 subjects with no family history of type 2 diabetes. In this analysis RNA was isolated for cRNA preparation and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays.
