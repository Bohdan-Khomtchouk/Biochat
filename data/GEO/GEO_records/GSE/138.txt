TITLE
Effect of serotonergic hallucinogen in mouse somatosensory cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the gene program activated by serotonergic hallucinogens in mouse somatosensory cortex, the effects of the 5-HT2A agonist (±)2,5-dimethoxy 4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) on gene expression was studied. The 5-HT2A serotonin receptor is a member of the 5-HT2 receptor subfamily of G protein–coupled receptors. The 5-HT2A receptor is thought to modulate processes related to cognition, appetite, mood, anxiety, sleep, and sexual behavior. Abnormal function of this receptor has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depression and schizophrenia. In particular, the 5-HT2A receptor has been implicated in the modulation of the mechanisms related to psychosis. We compared gene response patterns in the somatosensory cortical brain area, which has a high density of 5-HT2A receptors and has been implicated in the action of hallucinogenic drugs. Mice (strain 129Sv) were injected with DOI (2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) or vehicle, animals were sacrificed after 1 h, and somatosensory cortex samples dissected on ice for RNA extraction. Seven independent microarray hybridizations from seven different DOI- or vehicle-treated mouse pairs were performed. Keywords: other
