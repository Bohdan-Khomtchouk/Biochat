TITLE
A comparative transcriptome analysis of hybrid necrosis-showing plants in diploid and hexaploid wheat

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum ; Triticum monococcum subsp. aegilopoides x Triticum urartu

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes to alter the transcript accumulation levels in two types of hybrid necrosis-showing plants; one was derived from interspecific crosses of two diploid wheat species Triticum monococcum ssp. aegilopoides and Triticum urartu, and another from intraspecific hybrids of common wheat. Of the up-regulated genes, defense-related and carbohyfrate metabosim-related genes were frequently found, whereas photosythesis-related genes down-regulated in the hybrid necrosis-showing plants. These observations strongly suggests that autoimmune responses might be triggered by Ne1-Ne2 interaction in common wheat and by Ned1-Ned2 interaction in the wild diploid wheat, and that genetically programmed cell death could be regarded as a hypersensitive response-like cell death similar to that observed in other wheat hybrid necrosis such as type III necrosis in the ABD wheat triploids crossed between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii.

DESIGN
Expression patterns were compared between a wild-type wheat hybrid plant (as a reference) and a hybrid necrosis-showing hybrid plant in each of common and wild diploid wheat. Total RNA samples were isolated from leaf tissues. Two independent experiments were conducted in each expriment.
