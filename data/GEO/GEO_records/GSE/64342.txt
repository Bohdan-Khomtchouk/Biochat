TITLE
A comparative transcriptome analysis of hybrid necrosis-showing plants in diploid and hexaploid wheat

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes to alter the transcript accumulation levels in two types of hybrid necrosis-showing plants; one was derived from interspecific crosses of two diploid wheat species Triticum monococcum ssp. aegilopoides and Triticum urartu, and another from intraspecific hybrids of common wheat. Of the up-regulated genes, defense-related and carbohyfrate metabosim-related genes were frequently found, whereas photosythesis-related genes down-regulated in the hybrid necrosis-showing plants. These observations strongly suggests that autoimmune responses might be triggered by Ne1-Ne2 interaction in common wheat and by Ned1-Ned2 interaction in the wild diploid wheat, and that genetically programmed cell death could be regarded as a hypersensitive response-like cell death similar to that observed in other wheat hybrid necrosis such as type III necrosis in the ABD wheat triploids crossed between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii.
