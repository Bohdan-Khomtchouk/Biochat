TITLE
Expression data from 205432- or 206381-treated BE(2)-C cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcription response of undifferentiated human BE(2)-C neuronal cells to stimulation with novel indole-2-carboxamide antivirals 205432 or 206381.

DESIGN
Independent sets of BE(2)-C cells were treated with 25 uM of either 205432 or 206381, or DMSO as control.  Total RNA was harvested at 24 h after stimulation and analyzed with Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 chips.
