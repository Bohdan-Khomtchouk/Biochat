TITLE
Whole genome expression microarray analysis in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, Huh7 cells, treated with siRNA targeting for nuclear factor 90 (siNF90)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes regulated by complex of NF90 and nuclear factor 45 (NF45) in hepatocellular carcinoma, we performed comprehensive analyses of mRNA expression in Huh7 cells depleted of NF90.

DESIGN
mRNA expression profile in Huh7 cells depleted of NF90.
