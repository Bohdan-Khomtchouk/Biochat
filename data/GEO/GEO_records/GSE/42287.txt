TITLE
Depth Distribution of Ammonia Oxidation Rates and Ammonia-Oxidizer Community Composition in the Sargasso Sea

ORGANISM
synthetic construct ; uncultured ammonia-oxidizing archaeon

SUMMARY
Ammonia oxidizer community structure were examined in a depth profile from 20 to 2000 m at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study using a functional gene microarray to look at amoA diversity

DESIGN
Two color array (cy3 and cy5): the universal standard 20 bp oligo (fluoresced with cy5) is printed to the slide with a 70-mer. Environmental DNA sequences (fluoresced with Cy3) within 15% of the 70-mer will bind to it.  Signal is the cy3/cy5. Two replicate arrays were run on duplicate targets.
