TITLE
Analyses of the GlnR- and AmtR- dependent nitrogen regulatory network of Mycobacterium smegmatis.

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
Total transcriptome analyses were carried out to investigate changes in transcript patterns in the Mycobacterium smegmatis wild type strain SMR5 due to nitrogen starvation and to expand the knowledge about the role of the two transcriptional regulators of nitrogen metabolism, namely GlnR and AmtR, in these processes. A first experiment revealed enhanced transcript levels of 284 genes and reduced transcripts of 231 genes in the wild type under nitrogen starvation compared to nitrogen surplus. When glnR deletion strain MH1 was compared to the wild type under nitrogen starvation, decreased transcript levels of 125 genes were detected, indicating that these are activated by GlnR due to nitrogen limitation. Comparing amtR deletion strain YL1 to the wild type under nitrogen starvation, enhanced transcript levels of 2 genes were found, indicating that they are repressed by AmtR under nitrogen surplus. A comparison of YL1 and wild type under surplus, as well as a comparison of YL1 under nitrogen surplus and starvation and of MH1 under nitrogen surplus and starvation were carried out as additional control experiments. It can be concluded that GlnR is the master regulator of nitrogen control in M. smegmatis and that AmtR fulfills only a small, subordinate role in the regulation of an operon. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
