TITLE
RNA-sequencing profiles of e12.5 transcriptomes in WT and Itgb1-/- mouse pituitaries.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to understand how integrin beta1 expressed in epithelial cells directs developmental angiogenesis. Integrin beta1 was deleted specifically in the pituitary glands of embryonic mice. RNA was isolated from knockout and WT control pituitaries dissected at e12.5, one day prior to the initiation of developmental angiogenesis.

DESIGN
RNA from the e12.5 pituitaries of 3 WT and 2 KO littermate embryos was profiled.
