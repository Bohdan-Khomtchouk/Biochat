TITLE
Transcriptome of ESCs, EpiSCs and reverted ES by MM401 (Mll1 inhibitor) #2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study describes the transcriptome profiling of: 1) mouse ES cells in LIF/KSR medium; 2)EpiSCs in bFGF/serum-free (KSR) medium; 3) EpiSCs treated with MM401/LIF KSR  at D3 and D6 (P2); 4) rES reverted form EpiSC by MM401/LIF KSR treatment at P6, P30 with or without MM401 .

DESIGN
RNA-Seq profiling on mouse pluripotent cells. Biological duplicates of each sample are labled as rep1/2.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
