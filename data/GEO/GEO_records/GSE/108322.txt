TITLE
RNA deep sequencing analysis of glioma stem cells(GSCs) and non-GSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying the temporal process of DNA damage and repair in CSCs, we utilized deep RNA sequencing to analyze the expression of DNA damage and repair-associated genes at the transcriptome level. Our gene set analysis of CSCs and matched non-CSCs revealed a stemness-associated upward trend of global gene expression, particularly in NHEJ, mismatch excision repair (MMR) and HR pathways.

DESIGN
The RNA profiles of IN528, T3961, and T4121 CSCs and matched non-CSCs were generated by deep sequencing.
