TITLE
Expression data from human oral epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A majority of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have inadequate access to antiretroviral therapy and ultimately develop debilitating oral infections that often correlate with disease progression.  Our study evaluates the impact of chronic exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon gamma, on the growth and barrier functions of the oral epithelium. Microarrays were used to characterize changes in gene expression in the TR146 oral epithelial cell line that occur in response to constitutive exposure to interferon gamma in the growth media.

DESIGN
TR146 epithelial cells were grown to confluence in two 6-well culture plates in the presence (plate 1) or absence (plate 2) of interferon gamma and used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
