TITLE
RNA Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Primary Microglia Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq, we report here that primary microglia (PM) cells have a distinct transcriptomic signature and express a unique cluster of transcripts in response to 4 hrs LPS.

DESIGN
Examination of effects of LPS-stimulated PM microglial cells, were generated by deep sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000(101 cycles PE lane).

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
