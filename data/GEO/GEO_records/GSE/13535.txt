TITLE
Rat lung gene expression during acute pulmonary embolism

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rats were given pulmonary embolism by i.v. injection of 25 micron polystyrene microspheres or 0.01% Tween20 solution as vehicle control Embolism of microspheres is irreversible and causes dose dependent pulmonary hypertension Keywords: time course and dose response

DESIGN
Rats received one of three treatments: 0.15 ml/100 grams weight of 0.01% Tween20 as " vehicle " control; 0.10 ml/100 grams of 10% microsphere suspension in 0.01% Tween20 = 1.3 million/100 grams = " PE1.3 " dose; 0.15 ml/100 grams of 10% microspheres = 2.0 million/100 grams = " PE2.0 " dose; rats were euthanized at either 2 hours or 18 hours after treatment
