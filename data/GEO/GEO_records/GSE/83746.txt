TITLE
MatA S. cerevisiae cells exposed to Iztli peptide 1 for 3.5, 7, 15 and 30 minutes

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of MatA yeast cells exposed to a cationic antimicrobial peptide (Iztli peptide 1) for 3.5, 7, 15 and 30 min is compared with MatA yeast cells without the peptide

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MatA cells with peptide (P) and without it (C). Biological samples: 4 control, 4 treatment, independently grown and harvested. Two replicates per array. Please  note that [1] there is one raw data file per two replicates, as indicated in the sample description field [2] the Columns 10 and 11 (in the raw data file), labeled as Raw intensity (mean) T1C and  Raw intensity (mean) T1P, correspond to the raw intensities for each spot. T1C correspond to control and T1P correspond to treatment with a peptide named Iztli Peptide 1 [3] The replicates can be located by sorting the column standard_name. Each row corresponds to a different gene, two rows for each gene, the first row corresponds to the replicate 1 and the second to the replicate 2.

PLATFORM
GPL22086 Yeast 50-mer oligo library from MWGBiotech Oligo Sets (http:/www.mwgbiotech.com)
