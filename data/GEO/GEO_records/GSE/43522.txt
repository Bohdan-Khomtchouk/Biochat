TITLE
Chromothripsis in AML

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset contains data from two acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) specimens processed with the Illumina CytoSNP-12 SNP array platform. SNP array data showed evidence of chromothripsis in these two specimens. Each deletion in the mosaic specimen was present in the same proportion of cells, which supports the view that the many breaks occur as a single event. Complementary FISH studies highlighted the inclusion of centromeres from different chromosomes during the formation of the new chromosomes.

DESIGN
Residual bone marrow specimens were chosen from patients who were determined to have a complex karyotype which included abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 17, by routine cytogenetic examination.
