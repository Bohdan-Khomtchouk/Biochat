TITLE
Differential Expression of miRNAs: Implication in Colon Cancer Racial Health Disparity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have demonstrated that the miR-182 level, in addition to being significantly increased in colon cancer compared to adjacent normal colon tissue, is also significantly increased in African American(AA) compared to Caucasian American (CA) colon cancer. Since miR-182 has been previously associated with decreased survival in colon cancer patients and with increased liver metastases, this observation supports the concept that biological differences between AA and CA colon cancers may contribute to AA disparities in colon cancer survival.

DESIGN
We aimed to identify miRNAs that were associated with effects of both tumor and race by generating Agilent miRNA expression profiles on paired colon cancer and adjacent normal colon collected from AA and CA colon cancer subjects. For the 30 paired Stony Brook University (SBU) colon cancer and adjacent normal colon samples, attempts were made to control for other covariates such as age, colon cancer location, stage, BMI and smoking in the selection of the CA samples .  However no attempt was made to control for the other covariates in the 30 paired Washington University (WU) colon cancer and adjacent normal colon samples.
