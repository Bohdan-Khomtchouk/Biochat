TITLE
Phenotypic, genomic and functional characterization reveals no differences between CD138++ and CD138low subpopulations in multiple myeloma cell lines (Copy Number)

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite recent advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), it remains an incurable disease potentially due to the presence of resistant myeloma cancer stem cells (MM-CSC). Although the presence of clonogenic cells in MM was described more than 30 years ago, the phenotype of MM-CSC is still a matter of debate, especially with respect to the expression of syndecan- 1 (CD138). Here, we demonstrate the presence of two subpopulations - CD138++ (95-99%) and CD138low (1-5%) - in eight MM cell lines. To find out possible stem-cell-like features, we have phenotypically, genomic and functionally characterized the two subpopulations. Our results show that the minor CD138low subpopulation is morphologically identical to the CD138++ fraction and does not represent a more immature B-cell compartment (with lack of CD19, CD20 and CD27 surface expression). Moreover, both subpopulations have similar gene expression and genomic profiles. Importantly, both CD138++ and CD138low subpopulations have similar sensitivity to bortezomib, melphalan and doxorubicin. Finally, serial engraftment in SCID mice shows that CD138++ as well as CD138low cells have self-renewal potential and they are also phenotypically interconvertible. Overall, our results differ from previously published data which attribute a B-cell phenotype to MM-CSC and urge the need to explore more reliable markers to discriminate true clonogenic myeloma cells.

DESIGN
To compare the Copy Number Abnormalities of the subpopulations CD138++ and CD138low within the MM cell line, RPMI-8226. DNA was isolated from CD138++ (n=3) and CD138low (n=3) RPMI-8226 cells. The detection of CNA was investigated using the CytoScan HD array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) which includes more than 2.6 million copy number markers and 750.000 SNPs. Briefly, genomic DNA was digested with Nsp I restriction endonuclease, ligated to adaptors that recognize the cohesive four base pair overhangs and amplified by PCR. PCR product was purified and fragmented with DNAse I and then end-labeled using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and hybridized to the CytoScan HD array. The arrays were processed using the Fluidics Station 450, GeneChip Scanner 3000 7 G and AGCC (AffymetrixGeneChip Command Console Software).   For the analysis we employed the AffymetrixÂ® Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) Software v2.0 and Nexus Copy Number Software Version 7.0 (BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA, USA).  The complete data set was analyzed by visual inspection using ChAS software. CNA were reported when the three following criteria were achieved: minimum of 50 markers per segment, 200 Kb minimum genomic sizes and 50% overlap with known copy number variants (Database of Genomic Variants).
