TITLE
Expression data from postharvest Ponkan (Citrus reticulata Blanco) fruit under cold storage

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Low temperature storage of citrus fruits are susceptible to chilling disorder symptoms that impact fruit quality. Understanding the molecular frame underlying the cold storage process will provide a basic guidance for practical control. We used Affymetrix Citrus GeneChip to examine the transcriptional changes in cold-stored Citrus reticulata Blanco cv. ‘Ponkan’ pulp tissue for three successive months.
