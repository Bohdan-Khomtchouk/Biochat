TITLE
Expression data from postharvest Ponkan (Citrus reticulata Blanco) fruit under cold storage

ORGANISM
Citrus reticulata

SUMMARY
Low temperature storage of citrus fruits are susceptible to chilling disorder symptoms that impact fruit quality. Understanding the molecular frame underlying the cold storage process will provide a basic guidance for practical control. We used Affymetrix Citrus GeneChip to examine the transcriptional changes in cold-stored Citrus reticulata Blanco cv. ‘Ponkan’ pulp tissue for three successive months.

DESIGN
Ponkan postharvest fruits were under cold storage for three successive months. The pulp tissue was used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Citrus Genome microarrays.
