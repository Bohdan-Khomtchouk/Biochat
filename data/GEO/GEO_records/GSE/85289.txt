TITLE
Gene expression profiles from human splenic Marginal Zone and Naive (Follicular) B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Splenic Marginal Zone B cells mount innate-like T cell-independent (TI) antibody responses to blood-borne antigens upon receiving activation signals from TACI-engaging factors BAFF and APRIL. The transcriptome analysis of splenic Marginal Zone (MZ) B cells was performed to verify which transcriptional programs are enhanced in the innate-like MZ B cell subset and to study the involvement of mTOR in MZ B cells activated via TACI.

DESIGN
Unstimulated human Marginal Zone and Follicular/Naive B cells were FACSorted from spleens of seven (MZ) and three (FO) adult healthy subjects for RNA isolation and Agilent analysis. Moreover, APRIL (500ng/ml) and Rapamycin (10nM) were used to dissect the involvement of mTOR in the induction of Class Switch Recombination and antibody production in MZ B cells activated through TACI.
