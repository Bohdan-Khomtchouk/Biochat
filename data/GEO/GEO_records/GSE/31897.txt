TITLE
ChIP with anti-H3K27me3  to compare binding in salivary glands of WT and SuUR Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
ChIP was performed to identify regions of gDNA bound by H3K27me3 in third instar salivary glands of Drosophila WT and SuUR mutants.  This demonstrated that H3K27me3 binds differently in under-replicated in SuUR mutant third instar salivary glands.

DESIGN
Comparison of H3K27me3 ChIP sample relative to input DNA or control IgG pulldown for two different Drosophila strains
