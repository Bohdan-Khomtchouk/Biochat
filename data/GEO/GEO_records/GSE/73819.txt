TITLE
Comparison of alternative decapping enzymes to map transcription start sites genome-wide

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The production of Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (TAP), an enzyme commonly used for the removal of the 5’cap of eukaryotic mRNAs, has been recently discontinued. Here we performed a comparison of current alternatives for the mapping of 5’cap mRNAs and the associated transcription start sites in Sacharomyces cerevisiae. Specifically we compared TAP with Cap-clip and a Decapping Pyrophosphohydrolase. Our results suggest that Cap-clip is a good alternative for TAP.

DESIGN
We used two biological replicates of S. cerevisiae that was grown to exponential phase (OD600 ~1) in rich media (YPAD). Samples where processed until the dephosphorylation step (CIP treatment). After that each sample was split in 4 aliquots: TAP treatment, Cap-Clip treatment, Decapping Pyrophosphohydrolase treatment or no treatment (negative control). From that step all samples are processed in parallel.
