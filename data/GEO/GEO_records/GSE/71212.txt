TITLE
Expression data from Jurkat cells treated with SB225002 for 6h and 9h.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In our efforts to evaluate the function of the IL-8 receptor CXCR2 in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cells, we made use of SB225002 (N-(2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)-Nâ€™-(2-bromophenyl)urea), a drug initially described as a CXCR2 antagonist. Although the CXCR2 receptor was found to be non-functional in ALL, B- and T-ALL cell lines were sensitive to SB225002. We used microarray analysis to identify a transcriptional profile of genes that mediate SB225002's effects in acute lymphoblastic leukemia  cells.

DESIGN
Jurkat cells were treated for 6h or 9h with SB225002 [12.5 uM] or 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control).
