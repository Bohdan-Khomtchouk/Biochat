TITLE
Cotton Fiber Development Time-course Analysis

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
To get glance to the events of the fast elongation and second cell wall synthesis stages of developing cotton fiber cells, we examined expression patterns of over 5000 genes by cDNA array from 3 to 18 DPA in a 3-day interval. Keywords: Time Course

DESIGN
RNAs from the 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 18-DPA fibers were compared to the 9-DPA fiber RNA for time-course analysis. Four biological repeats were carried out including two dye-swap ones.

PLATFORM
GPL3641 SIPPE Gossypium hirsutum 5K cDNA fiber and ovule array
