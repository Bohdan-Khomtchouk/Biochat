TITLE
Gene expression profiling of THP-1 cells on treatment with vitamin C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The present study reports the temporal transcriptional response of THP-1 cells to physiological levels (100 Î¼M) of vit C treatment. An extensive modulation of gene expression occurs from early to late time-points, which is reflected in a gamut of functional responses regulated by vit C, as determined by enrichment analysis. The study reveals the pleiotropic activity of vit C with diverse implications on biological processes. vit C mediates responses that encompass a range of cellular processes, and span regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, cell cycle, immune system, cAMP metabolic process and signaling and ion homeostasis. Thus vit C modulates a plethora of physiological functions, that emphasize its key role in maintaining equilibrium.
