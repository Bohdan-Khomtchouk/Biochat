TITLE
Partial urethra obstruction in rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Urethra was partially ligated and the urinary bladder was removed 10 days or 6 weeks after obstruction. Sham operated rats were used as controls. An addtitonal group of rats were repoerated 6 weeks after surgery and the obstruction was removed. These rats were then sacrificed 10 days after deobstruction. The bladder (including the urothelium) was frozen and used for RNA extraction.
