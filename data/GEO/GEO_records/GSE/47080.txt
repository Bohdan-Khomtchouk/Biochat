TITLE
Partial urethra obstruction in rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Urethra was partially ligated and the urinary bladder was removed 10 days or 6 weeks after obstruction. Sham operated rats were used as controls. An addtitonal group of rats were repoerated 6 weeks after surgery and the obstruction was removed. These rats were then sacrificed 10 days after deobstruction. The bladder (including the urothelium) was frozen and used for RNA extraction.

DESIGN
Urinary bladders from sham-operated, 10 days and 6 weeks after obstruction and rats 10 days after deobstruction were compared. mRNA and microRNA were both analyzed.
