TITLE
Mouse models of cardiac remodeling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We employed the Affymetrix GeneChip technology to evaluate the patterns of expression in two different in vivo models of cardiac remodeling and in two different regions (left ventricle free wall and septum) of the heart. Mice underwent transverse aortic constriction (TAC); myocardial infarction (MI) or Sham operation and RNA from the left ventricle free wall and the septum was isolated 1 week later. Keywords: other
