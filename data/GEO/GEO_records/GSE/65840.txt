TITLE
Root transcriptome of ninja-1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A major role of NINJA is to repress root jasmonate signalling and allow normal cell elongation. To further characterize the transcriptional changes occurring in the root in the absence of a NINJA-dependent repression mechanism, we conducted a microarray analysis of ninja-1 versus WT roots.

DESIGN
Root transcriptome of Col-0 (WT) versus ninja-1, both carrying the JAZ10pro-GUSPlus (JGP) reporter, grown in basal aseptic conditions. Biological replicates: 3 for the WT control and 3 for the ninja-1 mutant.
