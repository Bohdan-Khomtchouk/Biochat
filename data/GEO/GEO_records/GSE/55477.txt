TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of Fusarium graminearum isolate PH-1 in spores and mycelium

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum PH-1

SUMMARY
Using RNA-Seq data from the mycelium of Fusarium graminearum, we found weakly expressed regions on all of the four chromosomes that exactly matched with non-conserved regions. Comparison of gene expression between two different developmental stages (spores and mycelium) showed that the expression of genes in conserved regions is stable, while gene expression in non-conserved regions is much more influenced by developmental stage.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression in two developmental stages (spores and mycelium). Three biological replicates were performed for each stage.
