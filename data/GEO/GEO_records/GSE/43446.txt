TITLE
Influenza peptide reactivity within a cohort of age-stratified individuals pre and post vaccination with the 2008/2009 trivalent influenza vaccine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that peptide array reactivity will reveal patterns that can be associated with poor or effective neutralization response to seasonal influenza vaccine We diluted patient sera 1:80 and incubated dilutions on a streptavidin-coated glass surface that was printed with biotinylated peptides derived from seasonal strains of influenza hemagglutinin included in the 2008/2009 trivalent influenza vaccine

DESIGN
In this study, serum from 76 study participants, subsetted into young (≤30 years old) and elderly (≥60 years old) categories were profiled for IgG/IgM antibody reactivity to influenza hemagglutinin peptudes. Using multivariate linear regression and correcting for multiple hypothesis testing by cross-validation, ee found that patterns of peptide reactivity associated with a poor or effective neutralization response to H1N1 and B strains of influenza.
