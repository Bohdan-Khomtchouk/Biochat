TITLE
Gene expression in a three dimensionally cultivated human hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The development of more complex but reliable systems for compound testing in a pharmaceutical context is a challenging task to date. Three dimensional (3D), organ mimetic cell culture is aiming to become an alternative to common two dimensional (2D) cell culture or animal testing in that field. We developed a biocompatible 3D cell culture environment for a 3D hepatocyte cell culture that enables cellular maintenance in a polycarbonate scaffold structure.  Our data indicate that an actively perfused three dimensional cell culture displays a more pronounced metabolic genotype than statically cultivated hepatocytes.

DESIGN
Human hepatocytes of three donors were cultivated for five days under 2D and 3D statical and perfused conditions. Cultivation was started with 0.25 x106 in 2D and with 1x 106 vital cells for the 3D experiments. The day of seeding was defined as d0. The groups were classified as follows: 2D i.e.monolayer cultures,  3D i.e. statical 3D culture and BR denotes perfused 3D culture of hepatocytes. The perfusable bioreactor system was operated using a peristaltic pump. It houses the MatriGrid, a polycarbonate based microporous cellular support. For 3Dstatic cultivation, cell- inoculated MatriGrids were placed in wells of a 24 wells plate. Microarray experiments of three 2D (i.e. control), three 3D statically and three actively perfused 3D cultivations, respectively, were performed at SIRS-Lab GmbH (SIRS-Lab GmbH, Jena, Germany) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Altogether, 8 RNA samples of hepatocyte cultures and an internal control RNA were hybridized on two HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips.
