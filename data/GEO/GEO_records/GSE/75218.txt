TITLE
Autophagy enforces functional integrity of regulatory T cells by coupling environmental cues and metabolic homeostasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulatory T (Treg) cells respond to immune and inflammatory signals to mediate immunosuppression, but how the functional integrity of Treg cells is maintained under activating environments is unclear. Here we show that autophagy is active in Treg cells and supports their lineage stability and survival fitness. Treg cellâ€“specific deletion of Atg7 or Atg5, both essential genes in autophagy, leads to loss of Treg cells, greater tumor resistance and development of inflammatory disorders. Atg7-deficient Treg cells show increased apoptosis and readily lose expression of the transcription factor Foxp3, especially after activation. Mechanistically, autophagy deficiency upregulates mTORC1 and c-Myc and glycolytic metabolism, which contributes to defective Treg function. Therefore, autophagy couples environmental signals and metabolic homeostasis to protect lineage and survival integrity of Treg cells in activating contexts.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to explore the gene expression profiles differentially expressed in CD4+Foxp3-YFP+ Treg cells from untreated and rapamycin-treated Atg7+/- (Atg7-het; Atg7 +/fl crossed with Foxp3-Cre) and Atg7-/-  (Atg7-KO; Atg7 fl/fl mice crossed with Foxp3-Cre) mice
