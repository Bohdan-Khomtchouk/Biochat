TITLE
Expression data from sorted humanized TREM2 murine microglia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The R47H variant of TREM2 is associated with higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. We generated mice expressing the common variant or R47H variant of human TREM2 in the absence of murine TREM2 on the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

DESIGN
CD45+ CD11b+ microglia were sorted from brains of 8.5-month-old mice expressing common variant, R47H, or no human TREM2 on a background of murine TREM2 deficiency and the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
