TITLE
DNA damage signaling gene array on SMA mouse skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A commercially available gene array (SABiosciences array PAMM-029ZD-12) was used to assay gene expression in skeletal muscle of SMA mice and control littermates. The Taiwanese severe SMA mouse model was used (Hsieh-Li et al. 2000). The array included 84 genes associated with DNA damage detection, DNA repair, apoptosis, cell cycle, and other functions.

DESIGN
SMA group (n=3) vs. control group (n=3) - single technical replicates, triple biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL18359 Sabiosciences RT2 Profiler DNA Damage Signaling Pathway PCR Array
