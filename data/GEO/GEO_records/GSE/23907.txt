TITLE
Histone H3K27ac separates active from poised enhancers and predicts developmental state (gene expression data)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Developmental programs are controlled by transcription factors and chromatin regulators, which maintain specific gene expression programs through epigenetic modification of the genome. These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. While enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications, and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements, thus providing clues to current cell state and further developmental potential.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed in mouse ES, NPC, liver, and pro-B
