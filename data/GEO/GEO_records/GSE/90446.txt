TITLE
Microbiota regulate intestinal epithelial gene expression by suppressing the transcription factor Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (zebrafish RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq from 6 days post fertilization hnf4a-/- and hnf4a+/+ zebrafish larval digestive tracts raised in the absence (Germ Free, GF) or presence (Conventionalized, CV) of microbiota.  We found that zebrafish hnf4a activates almost half of the microbiota-suppressed genes, indicating that the microbiota supress Hnf4a trans-activity.  We also provide evidence suggesting that microbial suppression of Hnf4a may contribute to IBD pathogenesis.

DESIGN
Generation and analysis of RNA-seq from hnf4a-/- and hnf4a+/+ zebrafish larvae in the absence (Germ Free, GF) or presence (Conventionalized, CV) microbiota.
