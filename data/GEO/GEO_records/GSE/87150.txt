TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of human HT1080 cells overexpressing full length or soluble nucleoplasmic fragment of NET29/TMEM120A, NET39/PPAPDC3 and NET47/TM7SF2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The nuclear transmembrane proteins (NETs) NET29/TMEM120A, NET39/PPAPDC3 and NET47/TM7SF2 are able to reposition chromosomes towards/away from the nuclear envelope when overexpressed or knocked down in HT1080 cells. In this study we wanted to investigate the transcriptome changes after transfection of the full length NETs or a nucleoplasmic soluble fragment that does not localise to the nuclear envelope.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from HT1080 fibroblasts either untreated or expressing stably each NET-GFP fusion. In addition, total RNA was also extracted from HT1080 fibroblasts that were transiently transfected with either a NLS-GFP control or a soluble nucleoplasmic fragment for each NET, fused to GFP.
