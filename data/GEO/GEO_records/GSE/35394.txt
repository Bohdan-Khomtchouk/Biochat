TITLE
Rescue Of Dysfunctional Autophagy By Peptide IDR-1018 Attenuates Hyperinflammatory Phenotype Of Cystic Fibrosis Cells (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) after treatment in vitro with the flagellin protein fliC, and/or synthetic peptide IDR-1018 to assess patterns of gene expression. The patterns of gene expression suggest that CF cells have a hyperinflammatory phenotype including dysfunctional autophagy processes. The synthetic peptide IDR-1018 attentuates this hyperinflammatory phenotype.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from PBMCs obtained from CF patients after treatment with the fliC flagellin protein (that is known to play a role in CF lung inflammation), and/or the peptide IDR-1018 that has anti-inflammatory properties. Comparison of genes and pathways affected by these treatments indicated the role of autophagy process in CF disease.
