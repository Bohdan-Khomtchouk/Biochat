TITLE
Expression data from Bmi1-null common myeloid progenitor (CMP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bmi1 is a component of polycomb repressive complex 1 and its role in the inheritance of the stemness of adult somatic stem cells has been well characterized.  Bmi1 maintains the self-renewal capacity of adult stem cells, at least partially, by repressing the Ink4a/Arf locus that encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16Ink4a, and a tumor suppressor, p19Arf 14.  Deletion of both Ink4a and Arf in Bmi1-deficient mice substantially restored the defective self-renewal capacity of HSCs and neural stem cells.

DESIGN
Purified CMP from BM of recipient mice repopulated with wild-type, Ink4a-/-Arf-/-, and  Bmi1-/- Ink4a-/-Arf-/- BM cells were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
