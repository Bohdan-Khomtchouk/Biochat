TITLE
DNA methylation in hESC derived brain organoids and iPSC derived neurons, astrocytes and neural progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the impact of ZIKA virus infection on DNA methylation in whole organoids, organoid derived astrocytes, neurons neural progeniotors and  hESC or iPSC derived astrocytes, neurons, neural progenotor cells

DESIGN
Examination of differences in DNA methylation upon ZIKV infection in whole organoid samples or specific cell types

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
