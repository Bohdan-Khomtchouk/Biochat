TITLE
Expression data from D.melanogaster larvae with a constitutively active Imd in the fat body

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Activation of innate immune responses in the Drosophila larval fat body affects the physiological host responses. In order to characterize the effect of the activated immune responses in the fat body on the Drosophila, we used whole-genome microarray analysis and found that activation of the immune deficieny pathway (Imd) in the fat body alters the transcriptional profiles of Drosophila larvae. As we expected many of genes involved in regulation of antimicrobial peptides were upregulated in the larvae with elevated Imd activity in the fat body. Notably, we found activatioan of Imd in the fat body negatively affects expression of genes involved in glycolysis, energy production and insulin signaling pathway. Overall, our analysis showed that activation of innate immune signaling in the larval fat body significantly affects cellular pathways that regulate metabolism.

DESIGN
Genotype control larvae and larvae with a constitutively active Imd in the fat body were raised on regular food until they reached third instar larvae stage. Whole larvae were used for RNA extraction and RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChipÂ®Drosophila Genome 2.0 arrays in order to investigate the effects of activation of innate immune responses in the fat body on the transcriptional profile of Drosophila larvae.
