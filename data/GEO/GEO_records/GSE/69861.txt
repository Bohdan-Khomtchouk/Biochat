TITLE
The histone H3 lysine 4 presenter WDR5 induces N-Myc target gene transcription and promotes neuroblastoma [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
WDR5 is an important co-factor for N-Myc-regulated transcriptional activation and tumorigenesis We analysed whether WDR5 siRNAs modulate gene expression

DESIGN
Neuroblastoma BE(2)-C cells were treated with control siRNA, WDR5 siRNA-1, and WDR5 siRNA-2 for 40 hours, and subjected to differential gene expression studies with Affymetrix microarrays.
