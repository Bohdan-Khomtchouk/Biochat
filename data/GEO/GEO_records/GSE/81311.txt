TITLE
Murine mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPC): Ptpn11+/+ MSPC vs. Ptpn11E76K/+ MSPC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPC) comparing control Ptpn11+/+ MSPC with Ptpn11E76K/+ MSPC. By obtaining 20 million reads of sequence from two pair, we confirmed our cytokine/chemokine array data and quantitative ELISA data from both mouse and patient-derived specimens. CCL3, CCL12, CCL4, and CXCL12 (SDF-1) were aberrantly produced by Ptpn11 mutated MSPCs

DESIGN
Examination of mouse  Ptpn11E76K/+ mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPC) transcriptional profiling compared to control Ptpn11+/+ MSPC, freshly isolated from Ptpn11E76K/+/Nestin and Ptpn11+/+/Nestin mice. Two replicate per array.

PLATFORM
