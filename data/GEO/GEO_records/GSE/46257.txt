TITLE
Deep sequencing of endogenous mRNA from Caenorhabditis elegans in the presence and absence of arsenite

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Background: Arsenite is one of the most toxic chemical substances known and is assumed to exert detrimental effects on viability even at lowest concentrations. By contrast and unlike higher concentrations, we here find that exposure to low-dose arsenite promotes growth of cultured mammalian cells. In the nematode C. elegans, low-dose arsenite promotes resistance against thermal and chemical stressors, and extends lifespan of this metazoan, whereas higher concentrations reduce longevity. While arsenite causes a transient increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in C. elegans, co-exposure to ROS scavengers prevents the lifespan-extending capabilities of arsenite, indicating that transiently increased ROS levels act as transducers of arsenite effects on lifespan, a process known as mitohormesis. The RNA-seq data comprises 2 biological replicates for worms exposed to 100nM Arsenite 48h after L4 and 2 biological replicates of the same age as controls Jena Centre for Systems Biology of Ageing - JenAge (www.jenage.de)

DESIGN
4 samples: 2 mRNA profiles of C.elegans 48h after L4 exposed to Arsenite; 2 mRNA profiles of C.elegans 48h after L4 as controls (H20). The N2 wild type (var. Bristol) strain was used.
