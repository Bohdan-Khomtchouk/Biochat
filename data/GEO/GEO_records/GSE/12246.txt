TITLE
Identification of COX-2 as a major actor of transcriptomic adaptation of endothelial and tumor cells to cyclic hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor hypoxia is not a stable phenomenon but cycles between periods of deep hypoxia and reoxygenation. Cyclic hypoxia originates from heterogeneities in red blood cell flux and from the permanent remodelling of the angiogenic vascular network. Endothelial cells lining tumor blood vessels are therefore also influenced by cyclic hypoxia. The gene expression pattern promoted by cyclic hypoxia differs from those observed under normoxia and even continuous hypoxia. PTGS2 is one gene exquisitely up-regulated in endothelial cells (and tumor cells) in response to cyclic hypoxia. Elevated COX-2 (the PTGS2 gene product) expression and activity account for cyclic hypoxia-driven increase in endothelial cell survival and angiogenesis.

DESIGN
In vitro culture of HUVEC submitted to hypoxia (oxygen rate less than 0.5%)
