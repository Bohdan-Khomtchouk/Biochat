TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression patterns by osteosarcoma tumor cells with different mtDNA genotypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression patterns in 143B osteosarcoma tumors that formed from 143B cells that harbor different background of mtDNA or no mtDNA. The hypothesis tested in this study was that mtDNA genotypes exert influence on chromosomal gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from 143B osteosarcoma tumors that harbor mtDNA from human neural stem cells and glioblastoma multiforme (HSR-GBM1) cells compared to 143B tumors (with their own mtDNA) and 143B rho 0 tumors (without mtDNA)
