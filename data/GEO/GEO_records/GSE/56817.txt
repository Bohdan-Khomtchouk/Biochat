TITLE
Gene expression analysis of epidermis of skin equivalent model by treatment of BIPBIPU and CGS27023A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Increase of differentiation markers and barrier function in response to BIPBIPU and CGS27023A Gene expression in epidermis of skin equivalent model was measured by treatment of BIPBIPU, CGS27023A, BIPBIPU and CGS27023A and control. Four independent experiments were performed at Day 4.

DESIGN
Total 16 samples are analyzed. (control sample;4 samples, treatment of BIPBIPU;4 samples, treatment of CGS27023A; 4 samples, treatment of BIPBIPU and CGS27023A; 4 samples)

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
