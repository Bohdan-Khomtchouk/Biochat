TITLE
Gene expression profiles after traumatic brain injury

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Time dependent-profiles in the gene expression level following lateral moderate fluid percussion injury in the rat brain We used microarray to elucidate relationship between the alteration of gene expression levels and the progression of brain damages following traumatic brain injury.

DESIGN
To examine the levels of gene expression in the early phase of traumatic brain injury, we analyzed the gene expression at 3, 6, 12, and 48 h after trauma using the lateral moderate fluid percussion TBI model. The ratios of the gene expression level were compared between chips corresponding to the 3, 6 and 12 h fluid percussion groups and the sham group chips. On the other hand, the rations of gene expression level after 48 h FPI were compared with 48 h sham chip, because the gene expression levels of 48 h sham chip were distinct from sham group chips (3, 6 and 12 h) in the cluster and principal components analyses.
