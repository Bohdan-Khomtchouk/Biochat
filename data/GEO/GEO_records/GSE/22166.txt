TITLE
Oxidoreductase transcript data from human umbilical vein endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oxidoreductase enzymes are critical to redox regulation of intracellular proteins within human cells. We used microarrays to identify which oxidreducatse genes are expressed in unstimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

DESIGN
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were grown under optimal conditions and then RNA extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
