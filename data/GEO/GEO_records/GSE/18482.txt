Arabidopsis thaliana tetraploid transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of autotetraploidy on gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana by comparing diploid versus tetraploid transcriptomes. In particular, this included the comparison of the transcriptome of different tetraploid A. thaliana ecotypes (Col-0 vs. Ler-0). The study was extended to address further aspects. One was the comparison of the transcriptomes in subsequent generations. This intended to obtain information on the genome wide stability of autotetraploid gene expression. Another line of work compared the transcriptomes of different diploid vs. tetraploid tissues. This aimed to investigate whether particular gene groups are specifically affected during the development of A. thaliana autotetraploids. Samples 1-8: Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 tetraploid transcriptome. Transcriptional profiling and comparison of diploid vs. tetraploid Col-0 seedlings. The experiment was carried out with pedigree of independently generated and assessed tetraploid Col-0 lines. Samples 9-12: Arabidopsis thaliana Ler-0 tetraploid transcriptome. Transcriptional profiling and comparison of diploid vs. tetraploid Ler-0 seedlings. The experiment was carried out with pedigree of independently generated and assessed tetraploid Ler-0 lines. Samples 13-24: Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 tetraploid transcriptome. Transcriptional profiling and comparison of diploid vs. tetraploid Col-0 leaves (6th - 8th). The experiment was carried out with pedigree of independently generated and assessed tetraploid Col-0 lines. Samples 25-32: Arabidopsis thaliana Ler-0 tetraploid transcriptome. Transcriptional profiling and comparison of diploid vs. tetraploid Ler-0 leaves (6th - 8th). The experiment was carried out with pedigree of independently generated and assessed tetraploid Ler-0 lines. Samples 33-36: Arabidopsis thaliana Ler-0 tetraploid transcriptome. Transcriptional profiling and comparison of tetraploid vs. tetraploid Ler-0 seedlings from the second (F2) and third (F3) generation after induction, respectively. The experiment was carried out with pedigree of independently generated and assessed tetraploid Ler-0 lines. Samples 37-40: Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 tetraploid transcriptome. Transcriptional profiling and comparison of tetraploid vs. tetraploid Col-0 seedlings from the second (F2) and third (F3) generation after induction, respectively. The experiment was carried out with pedigree of independently generated and assessed tetraploid Col-0 lines. Samples 41-44: Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0/Ler-0 diploid transcriptome. Transcriptional profiling and comparison of diploid Col-0 vs. diploid Ler-0 seedlings. The experiment was carried out with pedigree of esrablished lines. Samples 45-48: Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0/Ler-0 tetraploid transcriptome. Transcriptional profiling and comparison of tetraploid Col-0 vs tetraploid Ler-0 seedlings. The experiment was carried out with pedigree of independently generated and assessed tetraploid Col-0 and Ler-0 lines.

DESIGN
Samples 1-8: Comparison of diploid vs tetraploid seedling material (ca. 100 each) of four different tetraploid lines (no. 1326-28, -26, -19 and , -12) each with repetition with different seedling batches; eight biological replicates. 4 replicates with Cy3-label of tetraploid and Cy5-label of diploid material and 4 replicates with reversed label. Samples 9-12: Comparison of diploid vs tetraploid seedling material (ca. 100 each) of four different tetraploid lines (no. 1026-41, -40, -10 and , 3116-6); four biological replicates. Samples 13-24: Comparison of diploid vs tetraploid (6-8th) leaves material of four different tetraploid lines (no. 1326-28, -26, -19 and , -12). This was repeated with leaves of four different individual plants from line 1326-28 and 1326-26 each; twelve biological replicates. Samples 25-32: Comparison of diploid vs tetraploid (6th-8th) leaves material of four different tetraploid lines (no. 1026-41, -40, -10 and , 3116-6). This was repeated with other plants of the same lines; eight biological replicates. Samples 33-36: Comparison of tetraploid-F2 vs tetraploid-F3 seedling material (ca. 100 each) of four different tetraploid lines (no. 1026-41, -40, -10 and , 3116-6); four biological replicates. Samples 37-40: Comparison of tetraploid-F2 vs tetraploid-F3 seedling material (ca. 100 each) of four different tetraploid lines (no. 1326-28, -26, -19 and , -12); four biological replicates. Samples 41-44: Comparison of diploid Col-0 vs Ler-0 seedling material (ca. 100 each) of established lines; 2 X 2 biological replicates with reversed label. Samples: 45-48: Comparison of seedling material (ca. 100 each) of tetraploid Col-0 lines (no. 1326-28, -26, -19 and , -12) vs seedling material (ca. 100 each) of tetraploid Ler-0 lines (no. 1026-41, -40, -10 and , 3116-6); four biological replicates.
