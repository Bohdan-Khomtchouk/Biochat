TITLE
A TAF4 coactivator function for E proteins that involves enhanced TFIID binding

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The multisubunit TFIID plays a direct role in transcription initiation by binding to core promoter elements and directing preinitiation complex assembly. Although TFIID may also function as a coactivator through direct interactions with promoter-bound activators, mechanistic aspects of this poorly defined function remain unclear. Here biochemical studies show a direct TFIID-E protein interaction that (i) is mediated through interaction of a novel E protein activation domain (AD3) with the TAF homology (TAFH) domain of TAF4, (ii) is critical for activation of a natural target gene by an E protein and (iii) mechanistically, acts by enhancing TFIID binding to the core promoter. Complementary assays establish a gene-specific role for the TAFH domain in TFIID recruitment and gene activation in vivo. These results firmly establish TAF4 as a bona fide E protein coactivator, as well as a mechanism involving facilitated TFIID binding through direct interaction with an E protein activation domain.
