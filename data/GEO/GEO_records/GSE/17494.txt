TITLE
KDM7 is a dual demethylase for histone H3 lysines 9 and 27 and functions in brain development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The roles of histone demethylase KDM7 in gene expression were analyzed by gene expression profiling experiments with the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A.

DESIGN
In order to examine the effect of KDM7 in gene expression, we generated stable KDM7 knockdown cell lines in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A. Total RNAs were extracted from 5 cell lines and analyzed for gene expression profiles using the Affymetrix platform. Cell lines: Parental cells: Neuro2A (N2A) empty vector: Neuro2A transfected with empty vector EGFP KD: Neuro2A transfected with vector for EGFP knock down KDM7 KD1: Neuro2A transfected with vector 1 for KDM7 knock down KDM7 KD2: Neuro2A transfected with vector 2 for KDM7 knock down
