TITLE
IRF8-regulated genes in primary CD11 b cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of IRF8-regulated genes in mouse CD11b-positive primary cells. CD11b-positive cells were isolated from spleens of age-matched wt and IRF8 KO mice, the compared for their gene expression profiles. The objective is to identify genes that are regulated by IRF8 in CD11b-positive primary cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiments. Wt vs IRF8 KO cells. Biological replicates: 2 replicates for the comparison.
