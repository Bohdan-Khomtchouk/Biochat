TITLE
Whole genome transcriptomic experiments in mice heart development system

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to understand genes expressed during posterior second heart field (pSHF) development, we performed microdissections of the region for transcriptomic analysis at mouse embryonic day 9.5.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of microdissected posterior second heart field samples at mouse embryonic day 9.5 from 5 wildtype samples.
