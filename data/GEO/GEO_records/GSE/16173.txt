TITLE
Gene expression profiling of grape-bud response to two alternative dormancy-release stimuli.

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
A grape-bud-oriented genomic platform was produced for a large-scale comparative analysis of bud responses to two stimuli of grape-bud dormancy release, hydrogen cyanamide (HC) and heat shock (HS). The results suggested considerable similarity in bud response to the stimuli, both in the repertoire of responding genes and in the temporary nature of the transcriptome reprogramming. Nevertheless, the bud response to HC was slower, more condensed and stronger, as reflected by a higher number of regulated genes and a higher intensity of regulation compared to the response to HS.

DESIGN
To facilitate large-scale comparative analysis of early changes in the bud transcriptome by cDNA microarray, HC and HS were applied to canes collected from three vineyards, located in different regions, in three different years. This experimental scheme resulted in two true biological replicates for each treatment, differing in both timing and location, and loop design of technical replicates within time series. Consistent with our previous studies, both application of 5% Dormex (HC) and incubation for 1 h in 50oC water (HS) resulted in increased bud-break rates compared to respective controls. Bud break of HS-treated and HC-treated buds started 10 to 12 days after treatment. Three weeks after treatment, HS-treated buds exhibited 100% bud break while HC-treated buds had reached 80% bud break. The control showed significantly lower levels of bud break during this period. Bud material was collected from control, HC- and HS-treated cuttings at six time points (3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h) after the treatments and used to prepare total RNA samples.
