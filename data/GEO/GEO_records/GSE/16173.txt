TITLE
Gene expression profiling of grape-bud response to two alternative dormancy-release stimuli.

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
A grape-bud-oriented genomic platform was produced for a large-scale comparative analysis of bud responses to two stimuli of grape-bud dormancy release, hydrogen cyanamide (HC) and heat shock (HS). The results suggested considerable similarity in bud response to the stimuli, both in the repertoire of responding genes and in the temporary nature of the transcriptome reprogramming. Nevertheless, the bud response to HC was slower, more condensed and stronger, as reflected by a higher number of regulated genes and a higher intensity of regulation compared to the response to HS.
