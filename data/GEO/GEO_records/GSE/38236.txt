TITLE
RNA-seq data of si-Snai1, si-Snai2, si-Snai1/2 and si-Scrambled treated mouse primary myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In skeletal myogenesis, the transcription factor MyoD, activates distinct transcriptional programs in progenitors compared to terminally differentiated cells. Using ChIP-seq and gene expression analyses, we show that in primary myoblasts, Snai1/2-HDAC1/2 repressive complex bind and exclude MyoD from its targets. Notably, Snail binds E-box motifs that are G/C-rich in their central dinucleotides, and such sites are almost exclusively associated with genes expressed during differentiation. By contrast, Snai1/2 does not bind the A/T-rich E-boxes associated with MyoD targets in myoblasts. Thus, Snai1/2-HDAC1/2 prevents MyoD occupancy on differentiation-specific regulatory elements and the change from Snail1/2- to MyoD-binding often results in enhancer switching during differentiation. Furthermore, we show that a regulatory network involving Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRFs), Snail/2, miR-30a and miR-206 acts as a molecular switch that controls entry into myogenic differentiation. Together, these results reveal a regulatory paradigm that directs distinct gene expression programs in progenitors versus terminally differentiated cells.

DESIGN
In vivo depletion of transcription factor with siRNA followed by whole transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) to identify target genes.
