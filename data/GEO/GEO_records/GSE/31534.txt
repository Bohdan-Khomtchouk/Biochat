TITLE
Gene expression profile in A375 melanoma cells after 45 functionally important molecules were knocked down using siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix microarray data were generated from A375 melanoma cells treated in vitro with siRNAs against 45 transcription factors and signalling molecules.

DESIGN
45 functionally important molecules were knocked down in A375 melanoma cells by siRNA. Then the gene expression profiles of these A375 cells, along with untreated cells and sRNA control treated cells were analysed by microarrays.
