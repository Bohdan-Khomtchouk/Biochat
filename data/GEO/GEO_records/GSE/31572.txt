TITLE
DNA methylation analysis by MeDIP-on-chip in mouse E13.5 PGCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic reprogramming, characterized by loss of cytosine methylation and histone modifications, occurs during mammalian development in primordial germ cells (PGCs). Here we provide a detailed map of cytosine methylation on a large portion of the genome in developing male and female PGCs isolated from mouse embryos.

DESIGN
We mapped DNA methylation in E13.5 PGCs isolated by FACS sorting from Oct4-GFP male and female embryos. As a control, we also mapped DNA methylation in E7.5 epiblasts from wich PGCs derive from. MeDIP and Input samples were hybridized to Nimblegen HD2 MM8 promoter deluxe arrays covering 12 kb of all gene promoters. Experiments were performed in duplicates for E7.5 epiblasts and triplicates for E13.5 PGCs.
