TITLE
DNA methylation analysis by MeDIP-on-chip in mouse E13.5 PGCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic reprogramming, characterized by loss of cytosine methylation and histone modifications, occurs during mammalian development in primordial germ cells (PGCs). Here we provide a detailed map of cytosine methylation on a large portion of the genome in developing male and female PGCs isolated from mouse embryos.
