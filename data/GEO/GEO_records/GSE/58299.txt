TITLE
Time-course analysis of transcriptomes of human long-term (LT) and short-term (ST) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) after xenotransplantation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we tracked transcriptional changes in LT, ST-HSC and MLP after transplantation into immunocompromised mice. We show that LT- and ST-HSC activate similar pathways upon transplantation but they modulate distinct sets of genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from flow-sorted populations of human LT-, ST-HSC and MLP isolated from cord blood or immunocompromised mice transplanted with human at hematopoeitic progenitors at different time points after transplantation.
