TITLE
Gene expressioin signatures in human lymphoblastoid cell lines with different ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) genotypes post sham- or IR-treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human lymphoblastoid cell lines  with different ATM genotypes 6h post sham- or 1.5 Gy IR-treatmentl was compared to extract IR-related gene expression signatures that can identify ataxia telangiectasia (AT) carries from non AT carries and AT patients.

DESIGN
Biological replicates: 6 or 4;  Technical replicates: 2 with C3 and C5 dye swap.
