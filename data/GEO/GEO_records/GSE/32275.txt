TITLE
Analysis of DNA methylation profiles in colorectal cancer cells treated with boswellic acids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of colorectal cancer cell lines treated with acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) or 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (DAC). The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in the colorectal cancer cell line SW48. Samples included non-treated, AKBA-treated, and DAC-treated SW48 cells.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 3 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
