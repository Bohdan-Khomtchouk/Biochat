TITLE
Comparative microRNA profiling of sporadic and BRCA1 associated basal-like breast cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of miRNA expression in grade 3 luminal, sporadic and BRCA1 associated basal-like breast cancers

DESIGN
44 primary grade III breast cancer (11 BRCA1 basal, 16 sporadic basal, 17 luminal) and 13 normal breast FFPE (formalin fixed, paraffin embedded) specimens, plus 7 controls and 5 cell lines were analysed. The aim of the study was to derive grade-specific miRNA signatures for sporadic and BRCA1 basal-like breast cancers, and to ascertain an immunohistochemical profile regulated by BRCA1 specific miRNAs for potential diagnostic uses.
