TITLE
Wild type and Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4) knockout mouse livers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nrg4 is a brown fat-enriched adipokine that binds to the liver and preserves metabolic homeostasis during chronic energy excess. Adipose tissue Nrg4 expression is reduced in mouse and human obesity. Nrg4 deficient mice develp more severe insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation upon high-fat diet feeding. We used microarrays to elucidate the metabolic pathways that are regulated by Nrg4 in the liver.

DESIGN
Wild type and Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4) knockout mice were fed high-fat diet (Research Diets D12492) for eight weeks. Tissues were harvested under ad lib condition for RNA isolation and microarray hybridization using Affymetrix Mouse MG-430 PM Strip arrays. Three independent pools of WT and KO mouse liver RNA were included in the study.
