TITLE
Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 limits Epstein-Barr virus lytic-activation in B lymphocytes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed in EBV-infected human B cells supporting lytic replication vs. those refractory to EBV lytic replication.

DESIGN
We used serum from EBV-positive subject (compared to serum from EBV-negative subject) to FACS-separate lytic and refractory cells following treatment of HH514-16 cells with NaB, a lytic cycle inducing agent. RNA from sorted-lytic and sorted-refractory cells were hybridized to microarray.
