TITLE
Drug screening and genomic analyses of HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines reveal predictors for treatment response [CGH]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Thirteen HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines were screened with 22 commercially available compounds, mainly targeting proteins in the ErbB2 signaling pathway, and the molecular mechanisms related to treatment response were sought. To search for response predictors, genomic and transcriptomic profiling, PIK3CA mutations and PTEN status were associated to the drug responses and several genes involved in the response of the compounds were identified. Array-CGH experiments of HER2+ breast cancer cell lines grown under standard conditions.

DESIGN
DNA from four HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines was isolated and hybridized on Agilent arrays.
