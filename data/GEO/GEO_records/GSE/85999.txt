TITLE
Determining Neurovirulance host expression patterns in diverse genetic backgrounds [brain]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To accurately identify the unique transcriptional signatures in collaborative cross mice after exposure to West Nile Virus (or mock/no virus) , RNA isolated from Brain tissue and was analyzed using the nanostring immunology panel.

DESIGN
We screened RNA from 95 spleen samples over 8 different CC backgrounds. Across the 8 CC lines. Samples were captured at 4, 7, and 12 days post infection of West Nile Virus (WNV).
