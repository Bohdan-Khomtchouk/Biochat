TITLE
Systems-wide RNAi analysis of CASP8AP2 / FLASH

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used a combination of RNAi based functional and molecular genomic approaches to investigate in detail two proteins required for the survival of CRC cells.

DESIGN
Set1 has 22 samples, 10 siNeg controls, 6 siRNA transfections for FLASH and NUP62 each. Set2 has 67 samples, siNeg controls at timepoint: 10hrs (5), 24hrs (6), 48hrs (6), 72hrs (5), siRNA FLASH at timepoint:  10hrs (8), 24hrs (8), 48hrs (8), 72hrs (8), untreated controls at timepoint:  10hrs (3), 24hrs (3), 48hrs (4), 72hrs (3).

PLATFORM
