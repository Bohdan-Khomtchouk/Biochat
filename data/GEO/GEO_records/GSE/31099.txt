TITLE
Expression data from treatment-induced senescence in mouse Emu-myc B-cell lymphoma model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Treatment induced senescence (TIS) is a terminal cell cycle arrest program, increasingly recognized as a tumor suppressor mechanism complementing apoptosis in response to standard chemotherapy regimens. In particular cells with blocked apoptotic pathways rely on senescence as the only remaining failsafe mechanism to keep the neoplastic growth in check. However, little is known about biological properties, long-term fate of senescent tumor cells and their impact on the microenvironment. We used global gene expression profiling by microarrays to gain insight in the molecular programme underlying the treatment-induced senescence in Emu-myc transgenic B-cell lymphomas (apoptosis protected by Bcl2 overexpression), which robustly enter senescence in response to DNA-damaging anticancer agents such as Adriamycin (ADR).

DESIGN
Primary lymphoma cells isolated from lymph nodes of Emu-Myc transgenic mice were used. In this model the the c-Myc oncogene is constitutively expressed in the cells of B-cell lineage, leading to spontaneous development of aggressive B-cell lymphomas, resembling Burkitt lymphoma in humans. In order to bring up the senescence as the main failsafe mechanism, primary lymphoma cells are protected from apoptosis by retroviral over-expression of a strong antiapoptotic protein Bcl2. These cells (Myc;Bcl2) massively undergo senescence upon DNA-damaging treatment. Adriamycin (ADR) is a cytostatic drug, used as a standard part of several lymphoma treatment regimens. In this study, transcriptional profiles of matched pairs of untreated vs. 5 days ADR treated Myc;Bcl2 lymphomas were analysed.
