TITLE
Mapping of HNF4α binding sites, acetylation of histone H3 and expression in Caco2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background & Aims: The role of HNF4α has been extensively studied in hepatocytes and pancreatic β cells, but emerging evidence indicates that HNF4α is a key regulator of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation as well. The aim of the present work is to identify HNF4α target genes in the intestine in order to elucidate the role of HNF4α in differentiation of the intestinal epithelial cells.    Results: One thousand one hundred and seventy-six genes were identified as HNF4α targets, many of which have not previously been described as being regulated by HNF4α. The 1,176 genes contributed significantly to gene ontology (GO) pathways categorized by lipid and amino acid transport and metabolism. A thorough analysis of Cdx-2, trehalase, and cingulin promoters verified that these genes are regulated by HNF4α. In each case we were able to identify a functional HNF4α binding site in their promoters.  Conclusions: HNF4α regulation of the Cdx-2 promoter unravels a transcription factor network also including HNF1α and β, all of which are transcription factors involved in intestinal development and gene expression. Keywords: ChIP-CHIP and expression data

DESIGN
Methods: We have performed a ChIP-chip analysis of the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 in order to make a genome-wide identification of HNF4α binding to promoter regions. The HNF4α ChIP-chip data was matched with gene expression and histone H3 acetylation status of the promoters in order to identify HNF4α binding to actively transcribed genes with an open chromatin structure.
