TITLE
Role of PTH on Gene Expression in Osteocytes of Cortical Long Bone from Mature Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Femur and Tibia of Mice 3 months of age were dissected, growth plate removed, and serial digested with collagenase-trypsin to remove endosteal and periosteal cells. The cortical bone tubes, highly enriched in osteocye in their natural bone matrix environment where then cultured with and and with out PTH at 250nM for 24hr, RNA extracted and biotinylated cDNA prepared, and hybrized to Illumina MouseWG-6_V2 arrays.  Data was analyzed using Genome Studio-Gene Expression Module from Illumina.

DESIGN
The design was to explore gene expression in osteocytes as they reside in their bone matrix with normal lacunar-canalicular structure, and the role of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on changes in gene expression due to hormone treatment.
