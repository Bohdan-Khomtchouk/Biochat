TITLE
Grasses suppress shoot-borne roots to conserve water during drought

ORGANISM
Setaria viridis

SUMMARY
Setaria viridis, the wild ancestor of millet, exhibits strong repression of crown root growth in drought. We compare  in gene expression in the S. viridis crown between drought vs watered treatments.

DESIGN
RNA from Lower region (crown) or Upper region (stem) of watered (W) or drought (D) treated Setaria plants were harvested at 6 or 9 days after sowing; there are 8 samples per biological repeat, 3 biological repeats.
