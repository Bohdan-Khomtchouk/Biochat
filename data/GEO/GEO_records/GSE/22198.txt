TITLE
Absolute expression level of Kluyveromyces lactis genes

ORGANISM
Kluyveromyces lactis

SUMMARY
Total RNA versus genomic DNA hybridization on custom arrays designed for all Kluyveromyces lactis genes

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected in mid-log phase from Kluyveromyces lactis cells grown in rich medium (abbreviated CM, in house recipe).   RNA was then converted to cDNA, Cy3-labeled and hybridized competitively against Cy5 labeled genomic DNA from Kluyveromyces lactis.
