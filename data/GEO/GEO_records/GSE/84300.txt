TITLE
Expression data from Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim to the study was to elucidate the character of Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma cell line in comparison with mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line by carrying out a geome-wide expression analysis.

DESIGN
Total RNA from human clear cell odontogenic carcinomal cell line, CCOC-T and human mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line, NCI-H292 was hybridized on AffymetrixÂ® GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST arrays. The key findings were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR).
