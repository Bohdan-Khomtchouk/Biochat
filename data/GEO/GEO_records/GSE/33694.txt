TITLE
Activation of cyclic AMP signaling leads to different pathway alterations in lesions of the adrenal cortex caused by germline PRKAR1A defects versus those due to somatic GNAS mutations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PRKAR1A inactivating mutations are responsible for primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) whereas somatic GNAS activating mutations cause macronodular disease in the context of McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS), ACTH-independent hyperplasia (AIMAH) and, rarely, cortisol-producing adenomas (CPA). The whole-genome expression profile (WGEP) of normal (pooled) adrenals, PRKAR1A- (3) and GNAS-mutant (3) was studied.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from adrenal tumors were compared to those samples obtained from normal adrenal pools
