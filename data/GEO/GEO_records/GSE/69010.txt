TITLE
Expression data from -Pi treatment between WT, phr1, phr3 and phr1phr2phr3 triple mutant

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Fourteen days plants growth under hydroponic +P condition (200 μM) were treated under –P (no phosphate) condition for another 7 days, shoot of plants from 3 biological repeats were sampled for Affymetrix microarray analysis.  We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying -Pi condition among WT and mutants of phr1, phr3 and triple mutant of phr1phr2phr3.

DESIGN
Fourteen days plants growth under hydroponic +P condition (200 μM) were treated under –P (no phosphate) condition for another 7 days, shoot of plants from 3 biological repeats were sampled for Affymetrix microarray analysis.
