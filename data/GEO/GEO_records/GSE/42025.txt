TITLE
Chromatin proteins linked to dosage compensation in Drosophila captured by ChIP-mass spectrometry

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report the usage of ChIP-mass spectrometry in identifying proteins and histone modifications involved in Drosophila dosage compensation. We identified a chromatin targeting factor, CG4747, that is involved in recognition of H3K36me3 and robust recruitment of the Drosophila MSL complex to its correct targets on the male X chromosome.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq with PAP antibody of Drosophila larvae expressing C-terminally TAP-tagged CG4747.

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
