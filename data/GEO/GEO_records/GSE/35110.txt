TITLE
Gene expression profiling in WT and Hif1a-/- HSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the underlying mechanism by which the Hif1a gene is required by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we performed a comparative DNA microarray analysis using total RNA isolated from wild type Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ cells and Hif1a-/- Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ cells. The result was validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of wild type Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ and Hif1a-/- Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ cells.

DESIGN
We compared the gene profile of HSCs between WT mice and Hif1a-/- mice.
