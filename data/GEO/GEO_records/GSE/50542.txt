TITLE
Network Analysis Reveals a Novel Role for the AP-1 Transcription Factor JUNB in Classical and Alternative Macrophage Activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone marrow-derived macrophages were generated from wild type and Junb knockout mice and tested for their responses to LPS treatment.

DESIGN
Independent replicate wells from wild type and knockout bone marrow-derived macrophages were mock-treated or LPS-treated. RNA was isolated at 4 h post-treatment, amplified, and hybridized to Agilent Mouse 8x60k microarrays as a single color experiment.
