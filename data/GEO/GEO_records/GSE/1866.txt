Human Reticulocyte

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Reticulocytes were purified from fresh blood samples obtained from 10 healthy adult volunteers (5 women and 5 men) after informed consent. The donors had normal blood cell counts, blood smears, hemoglobin electrophoresis, red cells membrane resistance tests and no biological evidence of hemolysis. Whole blood samples were centrifuged, the supernatant and the buffy coat containing white blood cells (WBC) and platelets were removed. The red cells pellet was then purified using the method described by Brun et al. Purity, assessed by Hematology Flow Cytometer was 1 leukocyte per 15 millions RBC and efficiency of purification process was 99.8% and 1 platelet per 10 000 RBC. Keywords: other
