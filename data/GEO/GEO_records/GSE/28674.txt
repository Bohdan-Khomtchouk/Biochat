TITLE
Hippocampal CA3 Transcriptome Signature and Dentate Gyrus MRI Features Correlate with Initial Precipitating Injury in Refractory Temporal Lobe Epilepsy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptomic profile of CA3 explants surgically obtained from patients with refractory MTLE (mesial temporal lobe epilepsy) and HS (hippocampal sclerosis) in order to investigate if the initial precipitating injury (IPI) influences the molecular mechanisms underlying this condition. CA3 transcriptomic profile was found to be significantly different in cases with prolonged febrile seizures as the IPI (identified here as FS) when compared to correspondent data from cases without febrile seizure history (NFS).

DESIGN
CA3 transcriptomic profiles of FS and NFS were compared in order to identify differentially expressed transcripts
