TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of anti_GBM antibody responsive gene expression in the kidney of different mouse strains using Illumina microarrays

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Different mosue strains showed different sensitivity to anti-GBM antibody induced glomerulai nephritis. By analyze the renal gene expressin profiles in different mouse stains after challenging with anti-GBM antibody, we will be able to identify the genes and pathway underlining the anti-GBM nephritis.

DESIGN
5 mice strains (BALB/C and B6 strains are resistant to anti-GBM nephritis, DBA1, 129/svj and NZW are anti-GBM sensitive strains) were challenged by anti-GBM antibody. Total RNA were extracted from kidney cortex of each mice and subject to microarray analysis using Illumina Mouse WG-6 v1 Beadchips. Data was analyzed using BeadStudio.
