TITLE
Effect of neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR) over-expression on the miRNAome of human umbilical vein endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein-coding RNAs that are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and inhibit gene expression by regulating the stability and/or the translational efficiency of target mRNAs. p75NTR, which is scarcely present in healthy endothelial cells (ECs), becomes strongly expressed by capillary ECs after induction of peripheral ischemia in type-1 diabetic mice. p75NTR expression promotes endothelial cells apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis. In order to identify miRNAs sub-sequentely modulated by p75NTR, miRNA expression profiles of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) over-expressing p75NTR were generated, allowing the identification of miRNAs modulated upon p75NTR up-regulation.

DESIGN
HUVEC over-expressing p75NTR or Null (empty vector) were generated by adenoviral infection. miRNA expression profiles were then measured and miRNAs modulated upon p75NTR up-regulation were identified.
