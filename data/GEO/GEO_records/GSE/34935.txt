TITLE
Expression data from BDC2.5 TCR Tg thymocytes on B6g7 and NOD background

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of NOD genetic vatiation on the transcriptional programs induced by the alpha beta-TCR at the DN to DP transition in the BDC2.5 TCR Tg model

DESIGN
CD4 and CD8-complement mediated depletion followed by FACS Experiment type: BDC2.5 TCR Tg or polyclonal B6g7 versus NOD

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
