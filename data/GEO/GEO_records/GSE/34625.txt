TITLE
Genetic ablation of Rest leads to in vitro-specific derepression of neuronal genes during neurogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rest (RE1 silencing transcription factor, also called NRSF) is involved in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of neuronal stem/progenitor cells in vitro by preventing precocious expression of neuronal genes.  However, the function of Rest during neurogenesis in vivo remains to be elucidated because of the early embryonic lethal phenotype of the conventional Rest knockout mice.  In the present study, we have generated Rest conditional knockout mice, and the effect of genetic ablation of Rest during the embryonic neurogenesis can be examined in vivo.  We herein show that Rest plays a role in suppressing the expression of neuronal genes in cultured neuronal cells in vitro, as well as in non-neuronal cells outside of the central nervous system, but that it is dispensable for the embryonic neurogenesis in vivo.  Our findings highlight the significance of extrinsic signals for the proper intrinsic regulation of neuronal gene expression levels in the specification of cell fate during embryonic neurogenesis in vivo.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from E13.5 limbs and brains were analyzed for global gene expressions by Agilent microarray.
