TITLE
Effect of PIAS1 on gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the effect of PIAS1 on transcriptional regulation, we establishedstable PIAS1 shRNA knockdown cells in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231. By comparing the expression profiles of control vs PIAS1 knockdown cells, we can identify potential PIAS1 target genes involved in breast tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
MDA-MB231 Control shRNA and PIAS1 shRNA2 cells were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS (DMEM) or SCM for 30 h, and total RNA was used for microarray.
