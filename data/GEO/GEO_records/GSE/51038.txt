TITLE
Expression data from Sf3b1 heterozygous Lineage-c-Kit+Sca-1+ (LSK) bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent studies have shown that multiple components of the mRNA splicing machinery are mutated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients.  SF3B1 is frequently mutated in refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS)-MDS patients, however, the pathophysiological role of SF3B1 mutations has not been elucidated yet.  In this study, we examined the function of Sf3b1 in murine hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
Since Sf3b1 null homozygotes died during preimplantation development, in this study, we utilized Sf3b1 heterozygous mice showing grossly normal growth.  We harvested bone marrow stem/progenitor (LSK) cells from wild type (WT) and Sf3b1+/- mice (n=4) at 20 weeks old.  In addition, to exclude the possibility of indirect effect from bone marrow environment, we transplanted total bone marrow cells from WT or Sf3b1+/- (CD45.2+) mice into lethally irradiated CD45.1+ recipient mice, and then harvested (CD45.2+) LSK cells from the recipients (n=5) at 9 months-post transplantation.
