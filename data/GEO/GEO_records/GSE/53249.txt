TITLE
Transcriptomics analysis of gene expression in normal and FTO, METTL3 deficient Mouse embryo fibroblast 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from control and FTO,METTL3 deficient mouse 3T3-L1 cells using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent by following the company manual.Total RNA was isolated from transiently transfected cells with TRI® Reagent (Sigma). mRNA was extracted using biotinylated poly(dT) oligo, followed by further removing of contaminated rRNA using RiboMinus Transcriptome Isolation Kit (K1550-02, Invitrogen). mRNA quality was analyzed by NanoDrop. Approximately 2.5 µg of total RNA was then used for library preparation using a TruSeq™ RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.The libraries were sequenced using HiSeq2000 (Illumina) in single-read mode, creating reads with a length of 101 bp. Sequencing chemistry v2 (Illumina) was used and samples were multiplexed in two samples per lane.
