TITLE
Identification of target genes of the DELLA protein RGL2 during the repression of seed germination

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To shed light on the genetic events downstream of DELLA proteins, we have employed a microarray expression profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds to identify target genes of the DELLA protein RGL2. Seeds of the germinating ga1-3 rga-t2 rgl2-1 and the non-germinating ga1-3 rga-t2 mutant were stratified, and RNA was extracted after five days. Transcript profiles of the non-germinating seeds closely resemble profiles of dormant seeds, and several transcription factors involved in light- and phytohormone-regulated signalling pathways appear to be up-regulated, suggesting that RGL2 controls various physiological aspects to inhibit seed germination.

DESIGN
Gene expression  five days after stratification was measured in ga1-3 rga-t2 seeds, using seeds of the ga1-3 rga-t2 rgl2-1 mutant as reference. Two biological replicates were performed for each sample.
