TITLE
Gene profiling of young rats susceptible to malaria infection

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The study was performed in order to determine molecular markers potentially involved in the susceptibility of young rats to the infection with Plasmodium berghei Anka

DESIGN
In this study, we compared the microarrays of spleens (using the rat Codelink developed by Amersham Biosources) obtained from young rats infected by Plasmodium berghei Anka  with those of uninfected age matched controls.
