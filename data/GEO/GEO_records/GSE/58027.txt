TITLE
miRNA expression profile of cells and exosomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that miRNAs in the bone maroow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC)-derived exosomes contributed to the phenotype change of breast cancer cells through exosome transfer. We analyzed the miRNA expression signature in BM-MSC-derived exosomes. We compared the miRNA expression levels in exosomes between BM-MSCs and adult fibroblasts (as a control).

DESIGN
In this study, miRNA expression including in bone-marrow mesenchymal cell (BM-MSC)-derived exosomes was examined, and compared with that of exosomes derived from adult fibroblast cells or the BM-MSC cells. In addition, miRNA expression of BM-MSC exosomes was also compared with that of breast cancer cells with or without cancer stem cell marker.
