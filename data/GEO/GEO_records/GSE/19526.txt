TITLE
DNA damage repair gene expression profiles in cervical cancer cells radioresistant to 252Cf neutron and X-rays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
[original title] Microarray analysis of DNA damage repair gene expression profiles in cervical cancer cells radioresistant to 252Cf neutron and X-rays. The aim of the study was to obtain stable radioresistant sub-lines from the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa by prolonged exposure to 252Cf neutron and X-rays. Radioresistance mechanisms were investigated in the resulting cells using SuperArray Oligo GEArrayÂ® Human DNA Damage Signaling Pathway Microarray.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were treated with fractionated 252Cf neutron and X-rays, with a cumulative dose of 75 Gy each, over 8 months, yielding the sub-lines HeLaNR and HeLaXR.Gene expression patterns of the radioresistant sub-lines were studied through microarray analysis
