TITLE
AMC tubular and serrated adenomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Profiling project of a panel of tubular adenoma and serrated adenoma patient material collected in the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The aim of the study was to compare the expression profiles of different types of colon cancer precursor lesions (tubular versus serrated adenomas) and determine their correspondence with a set of colon cancer patient-derived profiles that have distinct clinical outcomes.

DESIGN
6 serrated adenomas and 7 tubular adenomas are profiled in this study.
