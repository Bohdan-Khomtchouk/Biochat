TITLE
Fgf8 E18.5 hypomorph versus control mouse fetal lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We set out to look for genome wide gene expression changes due to deficiency of Fgf8 in the lung.

DESIGN
RNA from 3 lungs from each genotype  (mutant and littermate wild type control) are pooled for each cDNA synthesis and hybridized to individual array for a quadruple biologic repeat of the  experiment

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
