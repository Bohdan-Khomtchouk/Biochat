TITLE
Analysis of a N-6 adenosine methylation deficient plant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The embryo lethal adenosine methylase tDNA knockout line SALK_074069 was partially complemented with its cDNA driven by the embryo specific ABI3 promoter (A6 lines). The plants have reduced adenosine methylation and show pleiotropic phenotypes. Rosette leaves were harvested from 3 week old plants, both wild-type and mutant plants in triplicate and analysed using the Affymetrix ATH1 array.

DESIGN
The 3rd to 6th rosette leaves were harvested in triplicate from 3 week old wild-type and mutant plants (A6). Total RNA was extracted and hybridised to the Affymetrix ATH1 array.
