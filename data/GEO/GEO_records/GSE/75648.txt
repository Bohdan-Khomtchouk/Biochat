TITLE
RNA-Seq of Lgr6 positive and negative cells in mouse mammary gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lgr6-positive cells have been shown to label stem/progenitors cells in several tissues including tongue and skin. However their role in mammary gland has never been investigated. Here we used Lgr6-eGFP-IRES-CreER2 mice to isolate and characterize Lgr6-positive population in mammary gland of 5-week old female mice.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptional differences between Lgr6 positive and negative cells

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
