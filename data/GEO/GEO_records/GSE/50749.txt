TITLE
Drug Synergy Screen and Network Modeling in Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma (DDLS) part 1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression levels in two DDLS tumor-derived cell lines DDLS8817 and LPS141 growing in culture in basal conditions The goal of this gene transcript study was to determine the expression level of genes used in signaling network modeling in DDLS

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from asynchronously growing DDLS8817 and LPS141 cultures growing in basal conditions using the Qiagen RNEasy kit. Three replicates of each cell line

PLATFORM
GPL6947 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip
