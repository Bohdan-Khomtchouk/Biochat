TITLE
COLO 320 (Human colorectal cancer cell line) xenograft: Control (Xenograft without rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)) vs Xenograft with rat MSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of COLO 320 xenograft tumor cells comparing control COLO 320 xenograft without co-implanted rat MSCs with COLO 320 xenograft with co-implanted rat MSCs. The latter makes co-implanted MSCs visualization possible by using MSCs labeled by GFP under FACS and single cell microscopy.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, COLO 320 xenograft without rat MSCs [COLO320 MSC(-)] vs. COLO 320 xenograft with rat MSCs [COLO320 MSC(+)]. Biological replicates: 1 control, 1 sample, paired xengraft tumor cells grown and harvested from the same mouse host. One replicate per array.
