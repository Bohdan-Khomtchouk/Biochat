TITLE
UV-B induced genes in wild-type Arabidopsis versus mutants uvr8-1 and hy5-1 using Affymetrix ATH1 array

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This experiment tests the effect of physiological dose of UV-B radiation on wild-type and uvr8-1 (UV Resistance Locus 8) and hy5-1 transcription factor mutants of Arabidopsis. Keywords: strain, stress response

DESIGN
The experiment is done using Affymetrix ATH1 array (GPL198). Three biological replicates for wild type and uvr8-1 mutant were subjected to white light and to UV-B light whilst three biological replicates of hy5-1 mutant were subjected to UV-B light only (15 samples in total).
