TITLE
WT vs Hypomethylated Forebrain Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is a major epigenetic factor regulating genome reprogramming, cell differentiation, developmental gene expression.  To understand the role DNA methylation in CNS neurons, we generated conditional Dnmt1 mutant mice that possess ~90% hypomethylated cortical and hippocampal cells in the dorsal forebrain from E13.5 on.   The mutant mice were viable with a normal lifespan, but displayed severe neuronal cell death between E14.5 to 3-weeks postnatally.   Accompanied with the striking cortical and hippocampal degeneration, adult mutant mice exhibited neurobehavioral defects in learning and memory in adulthood.  Unexpectedly, a fraction of Dnmt1-/- cortical neurons survived through postnatal development, so that the residual cortex in mutant mice contained 20-30% of hypomethylated neurons throughout the life.  Hypomethylated excitatory neurons exhibited multiple defects in postnatal maturation including abnormal dendritic arborization and impaired neuronal excitability.  The mutant phenotypes are coupled with deregulation of those genes involved in neuronal layer-specification, cell death, and the function of ion channels.  Our results suggest that DNA methylation, through its role in modulating neuronal gene expression, plays multiple roles in regulating cell survival, neuronal migration and maturation in the CNS.

DESIGN
We compared gene expression patterns in Wildtype and DNA methylation deficient (Emx1-cre; Dnmt1 mutant) mouse dorsal cortex. We performed 3 replicates using different each individual mouse strain. The Sample GSM350992 table is the average log ratio for the 3 replicatesArrays were performed in triplicate.
