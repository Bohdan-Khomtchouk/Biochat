TITLE
Cell-specific methylation patterns in TB patients and household contacts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocytes and granulocytes were isolated from blood of TB patients and household contacts. DNA was isolated and methylation profile was measured using Illumina HumanMethylation450.

DESIGN
House-hold contacts were matched to TB patients by gender and age. From each subject, two profiles (monocytes and granulocytes) were collected.
