TITLE
Gene expression profiling of gastric early-stage carcinoma and precancerous lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigated the molecular distinction and functional correlation among different histopathological types of gastric neoplasia, the whole genome expression profiling of gastric early-stage carcinoma(EGC) and high-grade and low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN and LGIN) were explored. This research will provide biological evidence for the clinical application in different gastric early-stage neoplasia.

DESIGN
Human gastric tissue samples were collected for the microarray research, which included 19 LGIN, 20 HGIN, 19 EGC and 19 chronic gastritis tissue samples. EGC are confined to mucosa or submucosa by surgery or ESD(Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection).
