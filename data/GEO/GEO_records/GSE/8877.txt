SUMMARY
ra03-05_clubroot - club root response - Characterisation of the transcriptional changes (host genes up- and down-regulated) during the P. brassicae / A. thaliana interaction. - The objective of the study was to identify the genes up and down-regulated during the interaction of P. brassicae with a partial resistant genotype of Arabidopsis. The transcriptome pattern of inoculated and non-inoculated plants of Arabidopsis was compared at three time points after inoculation (24 hours, 48 hours and one-week ai). Sixty plants were studied by comparison (inoculated-non inoculated) and by kinetic point. RNAs of the 30 inoculated plants and the RNAs of the 30 non-inoculated plants were pooled to eliminate variability between individual plants and thus to target for genes for which differences in expression were linked to the inoculation by the pathogen. Five comparisons have been performed: inoculated-non inoculated at 24 hours ai; inoculated-non inoculated 48 hours ai; inoculated-non inoculated one-week ai; inoculated 24h ai-inoculated 48h ai; inoculated 48h ai- inoculated one-week ai. The entire experiment was repeated (biological repetition) and each comparison was performed in two independent hybridisations (technical repetition).
