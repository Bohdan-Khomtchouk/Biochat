TITLE
Genome wide mapping of chromatin binding sites of GATA2, GATA3, TFAP2A, TFAP2C transcription factors in trophoblast progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) can be differentiated into progenitors resembling trophoblast upon exposure to BMP4. Among the earliest transcription factors that are activated after the BMP4 stimulation are GATA2, GATA3, TFAP2A and TFAP2C. Using trophoblast progenitors at day 3 of BMP4-induced differentiation, here we profile the chromatin binding landscape of these 4 early transcription factors to analyse their putative targets and cross-connectivity in regualtion of trophoblast commitment.

DESIGN
hESC cell line H9 was differentiated towards trophoblast lineage using treatment with BMP4 for 3 days. The cells were used to perform ChIP using anti-GATA2, anti-GATA3, anti-TFAP2A and anti-TFAP2C antibodies followed by next generation sequencing.
