TITLE
Distinct Brca1 mutations differentially reduce hematopoietic stem cell function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mgbemena et al report that hematopoietic stem cells have an absolute requirement for Brca1 to survive. They also show that humanization of the mouse Brca1 e with a knocked-in BRCA1 cDNA, but not a mutant BRCA1/5382insC cDNA, fully substitutes for the mouse Brca1 during both embryonic development and hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
Enlarged spleens from 2-3 mo. old Brca1∆/∆ mice and Brca1+/+ mice were taken for RNA extraction and processed for paired-end RNA seq.
