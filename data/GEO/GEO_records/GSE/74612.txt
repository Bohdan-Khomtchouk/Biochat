TITLE
Oviduct-Embryo Interactions in Cattle: Two-Way Traffic or a One-Way Street? [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to examine the effect of the presence of a single or multiple embryo(s) on the transcriptome of the bovine oviduct. In Experiment 1, cyclic (non-bred, n = 6) and pregnant (artificially inseminated, n = 11) heifers were slaughtered on Day 3 after estrus, and the ampulla and isthmic regions of the oviduct ipsilateral to the corpus luteum were separately flushed. Oviductal epithelial cells from the isthmus region, in which all oocytes/embryos were located, were snap-frozen for microarray analysis. In Experiment 2, heifers were divided into cyclic (non-bred, n = 6) or pregnant (multiple embryo transfer, n = 10) groups. In vitro-produced presumptive zygotes were transferred endoscopically to the ipsilateral oviduct on Day 1.5 post estrus (n = 50 zygotes per heifer). Heifers were slaughtered on Day 3 and oviductal isthmus epithelial cells were recovered for RNA sequencing. Microarray analysis in Experiment 1 failed to detect any difference in the transcriptome of the oviductal isthmus induced by the presence of a single embryo. In Experiment 2, following multiple embryo transfer, RNA sequencing revealed 278 differentially expressed genes of which 123 were up- and 155 were down-regulated in pregnant heifers. Most of the down-regulated genes were related to immune function.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiles of oviductal isthmus epithelial cells from cyclic and pregnant heifers were generated by sequencing of total RNA on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform

PLATFORM
GPL19172 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Bos taurus)
