TITLE
Diurnal cycle effect on whole leaf, mesophyll and vasculature: time course

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Many organisms acquired circadian clock system to adapt daily and seasonal environmental changes. Mammals have the master clock in the brainsâ€™ suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that synchronizes other circadian clocks in the peripheral tissues or organs. Plants also have circadian clock in their bodies, but the presence of the tissue-specific functions of circadian clock is remained elusive. The aim of this experiment is to compare tissue-specific gene expression profile using gene expression Microarray.

DESIGN
The study was designed to compare the tissue-specific regulation of gene expression between tissues and between day lengths.  All experiments were performed in 9-day-old wild type (Col-0) grown under long day and short day conditions. Whole leaf, mesophyll and vasculature were isolated every four hours over two days. The total numbers of used arrays were 72 Affymetrix Arabidopsis Gene 1.0 ST arrays.  We detected cyclling genes with an FDR < 3% using HAYSTACK ( http://haystack.mocklerlab.org ).
