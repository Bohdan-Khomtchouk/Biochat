Expression data from mouse tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of p53 in assuring longevity through prevention of cancer is well established, but how it specifically regulates aging is still controversial. Our assumption is that distinct p53-pathways regulate tumor suppression and aging and that p66Shc is one of the master regulators of the p53 aging function. p66Shc longevity determinant protein acts as a downstream target of p53 and it is indispensable for the ability of activated p53 to induce elevation of intracellular oxidants and apoptosis. We used microarray  to gain insight into the mechanism of the physiological activation of p53-p66Shc pathway

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from  freshly isolated thymus, liver, heart and lung of two months old mice (pool of four mice for each genotype)
