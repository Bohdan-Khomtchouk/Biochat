TITLE
Whole mouse genome analysis of LCMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells throughout acute and chronic LCMV infection.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD4 and CD8 T cells display functional defects during chronic infection such as loss of certain cytokines. Recent studies have suggested that CD4 T cells may actually gain other functions, however. Here, we analyzed gene expression profiles from LCMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells throughout the response to either acute LCMV or chronic LCMV infection. This alllowed us to identify CD4-specific changes during chronic infection compared to acute infection but also revealed shared core regulators between CD4 and CD8 T cells.

DESIGN
LCMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were isolated 6, 8, 15 and 30 days post infection with LCMV Armstrong or LCMV clone 13. Naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells were also isolated from naïve mice as comparisons. Four replicates of each sample were hybridized. The only exception is LCMV-specific CD4 T cells isolated 6 days post infection with LCMV-Arm where only three replicates were hybridized.
