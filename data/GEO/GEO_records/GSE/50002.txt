TITLE
Effect of Twist-box mutation on gene expression induced by Twist1 overexpression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Twist1 is a transcription factor that induces EMT and drives metastasis in prostate cancer. We examined global gene expression in Myc-CaP mouse prostate cancer cells following overexpression of Twist1 and the Twist1 mutants F191G, AQA, and DQD.

DESIGN
15 total samples were analysed, with 3 replicates of 5 groups: Twist1-WT, Twist1-AQA, Twist1-DQD, Twist1-F191G, and vector control. We performed the comparisons: WT > VEC, F191G > VEC. Samples were normalized by Twist1 expression in addition to normal
