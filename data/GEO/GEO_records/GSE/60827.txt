TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis comparing p53-null versus ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53-null or ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53-null thymic lymphoma tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed an RNA-Seq analysis comparing thymic lymphoma tissues from the p53-null(n=2) and ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53-/- (n=3) or ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53-/-(n=3). Mice at 10 weeks of age were injected with either Ad-mCherry or Ad-CRE-mCherry to delete ΔNp63/ΔNp73 in the thymic lmyphomas. We aimed to test by deleting the DNp63/DNp73 in these p53-deficient tumors will mediate tumor regression and analyze the expression profile of the genes

DESIGN
Examination of thymic lymphoma tissues in 3 different genotypes (p53-/- vs ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53-/- or ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53-/-)

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
