TITLE
An alternative pluripotent state confers interspecies chimaeric competency [WGBS]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we show that by simple modulation of extrinsic signaling pathways, a new class of pluripotent stem cells, referred to as region selective epiblast stem cells (rsEpiSCs), could be efficiently derived from different stages of the early embryo. rsEpiSCs share features of primed pluripotency yet are distinct from EpiSCs in their molecular characteristics and ability to colonize post-implantation embryos. We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) experiments to compare the DNA methylation landscapes of conventional EpiSCs and rsEpiSCs.

DESIGN
Compare the DNA methylation profiles in 2 pluripotent stem cell types (LP-EpiSCs and conventional EpiSCs) in mouse. Two replicates are examined for each cell type.
