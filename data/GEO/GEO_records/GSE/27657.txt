TITLE
Human subcutaneous adipose tissue and perithyroid adipose tissue gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Different human adipose tissue depots may have functional differences. Subcutaneous human adipose tissue has been extensively studied, but less is known about other depots. Perithyroid (PT) adipose tissue contains not only white adipocytes but also brown adipocytes. The aim of this study was to compare the expression of brown adipocyte containing perithyroid adipose tissue with s.c. adipose tissue.role in the development of obesity. Expression profiling of adipose tissue may give insights into mechanisms contributing to obesity and obesity-related disorders.

DESIGN
Expression analysis of paired biopsies from s.c and perithyriod (PT) adipose tissue from nine subjects undergoing surgery in the thyroid region.
