TITLE
small RNA-seq of Ler. WT and Ler; 35S-HA-RICE1 D52A transgenic plant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We examined global miRNA profiles of 3-weeks old 35S-HA-RICE1 D52A transgeneic plants compared to Ler wild-type using illumina sequencing. We conclude that, in general, both miRNA and miRNA* expression levels are downregulated in catalytically-defective RICE1 transgenic plants compared to Ler wild type.

DESIGN
miRNA profiles of 3-week-old Ler wild-type and 35S-HA-RICE1 D52A transgeneic plants were generated in triplicate by illumina sequencing

PLATFORM
