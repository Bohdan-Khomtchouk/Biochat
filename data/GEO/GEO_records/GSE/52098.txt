TITLE
Identification of cell cycle-regulated genes periodically expressed in U2OS cells and their regulation by FOXM1 and E2F transcription factors [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the genome wide DNA binding patterns of wild type FOXM1 in asynchronous HeLa cells using chromatin precipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).  We find that FOXM1 is bound to the promoter of a number of cell cycle genes including PLK, AURKB, and CCNB1.
