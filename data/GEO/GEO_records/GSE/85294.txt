TITLE
Profiles of Long Noncoding RNAs in Human Naive and Memory T Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We employed whole-genome RNA-sequencing to profile mRNAs and both annotated and novel long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human naive, central memory, and effector memory CD4+ T cells. Loci transcribing both lineage-specific annotated and novel lncRNA are adjacent to lineage-specific protein-coding genes in the genome. Lineage-specific novel lncRNA loci are transcribed from lineage-specific typical- and supertranscriptional enhancers and are not multiexonic, thus are more similar to enhancer RNAs. Novel enhancer-associated lncRNAs transcribed from the IFNG locus bind the transcription factor NF-κB and enhance binding of NF-κB to the IFNG genomic locus. Depletion of the annotated lncRNA, IFNG-AS1, or one IFNG enhancer-associated lncRNA abrogates IFNG expression by memory T cells, indicating these lncRNAs have biologic function.

DESIGN
We extracted RNA from CD4+ naïve, central memory, and effector memory cell populations in healthy control subjects to assess expression levels of protein-coding and non-coding genes.
