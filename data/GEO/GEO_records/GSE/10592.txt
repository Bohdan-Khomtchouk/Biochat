TITLE
Differential gene expression from azithromycin and SMM treated human airway epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to evaluate the effects of azithromycin and an inflammatory stimulus (SMM) on human airway epithelium. Effects of azithromycin treatment were evaluated at 6, 24 and 48 hours. Effects of SMM were evaluated at 6 and 24 hours. In addition, pretreatment with azithromycin was used to evaluate the modulatory effects on SMM-induced inflammation. SMM=supernatant from microcorpulent material from human cystic fibrosis airways. Keywords: timecourse, treatment comparisons.
