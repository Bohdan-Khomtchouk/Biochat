TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis stigmatic papilla cells

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was performed for stigmatic papilla cells isolated by laser microdissection, to discover the genes abundantly expressed in this tissue.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis papillary cells were fixed and embedded in paraplast. Laser microdissection was used to separate papillary cells from the styles. Three independent experiments were performed
