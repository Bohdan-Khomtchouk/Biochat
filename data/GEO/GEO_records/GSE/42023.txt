TITLE
Genome wide expression profiling of anterior tongue cancer with no history of tobacco and alcohol use

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We employed high-throughput gene expression profiling to understand gene expression differences between habits-associated tongue cancers and non-habits tongue cancers. Expression data from 22 tumors were used to identify a set of 18 differentially expressed genes that can, with high precision, distinguish the two etiologically diverse oral tumors. Results from the study provide insights into molecular carcinogenesis of tongue cancers without a history of tobacco and alcohol use.

DESIGN
We used RNA from 22 samples that included 10 tumor biopsies from habits-associated cancers and 12 from non-habits associated cancers.
