TITLE
Expression Data from Brucella abortus strain 2308 and isogenic mucR mutant cells

ORGANISM
Brucella abortus

SUMMARY
MucR is one of the few transcriptional regulatory proteins that has been linked to Brucella pathogenesis. We used custom-made Affymetrix B. abortus strain 2308 derived GeneChips to copare the gene expression properties of wild type and isogenic mucR mutant cells.

DESIGN
B. abortus strain 2308 or mucR mutant cells were grown to stationary phase growth, total bacterial RNA was isolated and subjected to GeneChip hybridization and analysis.  We sought to determine the regulatory effects of MucR.
