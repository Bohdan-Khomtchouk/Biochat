TITLE
Expression data from tumor-associated endothelial cells of hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary uncultured CD31+ and CD105+ tumor endothelial cells (TEC), non-tumor endothelial cells (NEC) ,remnant cells from tumor (TC) and non-tumor liver tissue (NTC)of HCC tissues from patientswere isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Affymetrix Human Gene ST Arrays were used to determine gene expression profiles of HCC cells and matched TEC and NEC cells. We use the gene expression profiling of the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) to identify distinct genes of TEC and NEC.

DESIGN
Patient specimens were collected immediately after removal from patients with pathologically proven HCC and positive alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), then washed 3 times by phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Single cell suspension was obtained from separated tumor and non-tumor liver tissues of surgical specimens following the protocol ( http://www.miltenyibiotec.com ), then CD31+ cells or CD105+ cells were isolated using CD31 antibody or CD105 antibody conjugated magnetic beads in autoMACSpro (Meltenyi biotec).After the sample preparation, the gene expression profiling was performed using the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to manufacturerâ€™s protocols at ShanghaiBio Corporation (Shanghai, China).
