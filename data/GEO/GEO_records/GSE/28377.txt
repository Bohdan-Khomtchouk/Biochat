TITLE
Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation of miRNA genes in HMEC and HMF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal cell type specific histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation of miRNA genes. HMEC and HMF represent two distinct differentiated cell type present in mammary gland each with a distinct phenotype, a distinct epigenotype as well as distinct miRNA expression pattern. The aim of the study was to determine how epigenetic modifications including histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation affect miRNA expression.

DESIGN
Two cell types HMEC vs. HMF. Biological replicates: 3 pairs of HMEC-HMF of 3 distinct genotypes. Immunoprecipitation using anti-histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (05-745, Upstate).
