TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana:seedlings treated by cis-cinnamic acid derivatives versus control seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with cis-cinnamic acid derivatives constructed by Nishikawa et al. (2013) Phytochemistry ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2013.08.013 ), evaluating the candidate of herbicide chemicals by observing early response of gene expressions in Arabidopsis seedlings.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, cis-CA analogue-treated seedlings vs. control seedlings. Biological replicates:2 control replicates, 2.

PLATFORM
GPL9020 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Feature Number version)
