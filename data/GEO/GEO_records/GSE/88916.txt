TITLE
ChIP-Seq analysis C57BL/6 thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we show that in addition to regulating DP thymocytes survival, RORgT also controls genes that regulate thymocyte migration, proliferation, and T cell receptor (TCR) selection. Strikingly, pharmacological inhibition of RORg skews TCR gene rearrangement, limits T cell repertoire diversity, and inhibits development of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Thus, targeting RORgT not only inhibits Th17 cell development and function but also fundamentally alters thymic-emigrant recognition of self and foreign antigens.

DESIGN
Examination of RORgT-bound genomic sites in C57BL/6 mouse thymocytes.
