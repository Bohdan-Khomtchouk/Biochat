TITLE
Expression data from human mesenchymal stem cells (six batches)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which are multipotent cells to differentiate into several cell types, are expected to be a useful tool for cellular therapy. In some clinical settings, hMSCs have immuno-suppressive effects for GVHD (Graft-versus-host disease) and are expanded in vitro before application. To find biomarkers that indicate the culture stage of hMSCs, we performed microarray analysis for hMSCs derived from bone marrow, using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 (54,613 probe sets). Keywords: mesenchymal stem cells, culture stage

DESIGN
We profiled the gene expression in 6 different batches of hMSCs. The cells were cultured and subjected to total RNA extraction. We performed microarray analysis using 6 batches provided by 6 different individuals in early stage (passage #4 or 5), middle stage (#7 or 9) or senescing stage (#22, 24, or 28).
