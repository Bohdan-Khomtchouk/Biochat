TITLE
Systematic identification and comparison of expressed profiles of lncRNAs and circRNAs in male and female germline stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Male and female germline stem cells are critical for passing genetic information from generation to generation. Accumulating evidences indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in self-renewal and differentiation of germline stem cells. However, the mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we explored the mRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs expression profiles of male and female germline stem cells through high-throughput sequencing.

DESIGN
mRNA, lncRNA and circRNA profiles of the mouse spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and  female germline stem cells (FGSCs) by strand- specific RNA- seq

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
