TITLE
Expression profiling of small RNAs in wild type and Osaba1-1 rice seedlings

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify putative ABA-regulated miRNAs expressed in rice by using a deep sequencing approach developed by Solexa (Illumina). Two small RNA libraries were constructed from Osaba1-1 and wild type rice leaves, and more than ten million small RNA sequence reads were generated for each library. We identified 13 ABA-regulated miRNAs via expression profiling of the miRNAs based on a comparative miRNAomic analysis in combination with experimental validation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a systematic investigation of ABA-regulated miRNAs and their targets in rice.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different small RNA expression profilings in the wild type and Osaba1-1 rice samples.
