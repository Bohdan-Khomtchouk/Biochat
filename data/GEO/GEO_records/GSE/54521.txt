TITLE
Genes induced during sebocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was designed to evaluate the transcriptional changes during linoleic acid-induced differentiation and lipid synthesis in a sebocyte cell line (SZ95, Zouboulis et al., J. Invest. Dermatology, 1999).

DESIGN
The treatment consisted of adding linoleic acid (10-4 M) or vehicle (ethanol) to the cells for 6, 18, or 36 hours. Two independent experiments were performed at each time point and for each treatment.
