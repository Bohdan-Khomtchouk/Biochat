TITLE
Myc regulates gene expression in P493-6 cell lines which carry a Myc tet-off system

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to study the Myc-regulated gene, we have employed whole genome mRNA/ncRNA microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to be regulated by Myc. Furthermore, we studied whether some Myc-regulated ncRNAs mediated the function of Myc.

DESIGN
Noncoding RNA gene and protein-coding gene expression levels in P493-6 were measured after treated with 1Î¼g/mL doxcycline for 0 or 24 hours. Three independent experiments were performed at each time (0 or 24 hours).

PLATFORM
GPL16956 Agilent-045997 Arraystar human lncRNA microarray V3 (Probe Name Version)
