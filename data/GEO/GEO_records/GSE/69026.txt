TITLE
Human Calu-3 cell transcriptome response to a wild type infectious clone of H7N9 Influenza virus and mutant H7N9 viruses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA, miRNA, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and histopathology analysis in human Calu-3 cells infected with WT A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9; 'AH1'), AH - NS1-103F/106M, and AH1 - 691 (ferret adapted virus).

DESIGN
Human Calu-3 cells were seeded at 1 x 10^6 cells per well on 6 well plates 2 days before infection. Prior to infection, washed cells 2 times with PBS, and then infected with a multiplicity of infection of 1.  Infected samples were collected in quintuplet; time-matched mocks were collected in quintuplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 0, 7, 12 and 24 h post-infection
