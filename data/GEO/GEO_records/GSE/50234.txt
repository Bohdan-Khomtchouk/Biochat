TITLE
Hes1 is responsible for Notch signaling-mediated suppression of acute myeloid leukemia development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In leukemogenesis Notch signaling can be up- and down-regulated in a context-dependent manner. Here we report that deletion of hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) promotes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development induced by the MLL-AF9 fusion protein. Subsequently, the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) was up-regulated in mouse cells of a Hes1- or RBP-J-null background. MLL-AF9-expressing Hes1-null AML cells showed enhanced proliferation and ERK phosphorylation following FLT3 ligand stimulation. FLT3 inhibition efficiently abrogated proliferation of MLL-AF9-induced Hes1-null AML cells. Furthermore, an agonistic anti-Notch2 antibody induced apoptosis of MLL-AF9-induced AML cells in a Hes1-wild type but not a Hes1-null background. These observations demonstrate that Hes1 mediates tumor suppressive roles of Notch signaling in AML development by down-regulating FLT3 expression.

DESIGN
4 samples are analyzed,  two pairs of MLL-AF9/Hes1-/- and MLL-AF9/Hes1+/+ leukemic bone marrows.
