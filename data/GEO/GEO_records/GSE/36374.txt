TITLE
Histone Phosphoacetylation ChIP-seq of Kc167 cells from Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq was performed using Drosophila Kc167 cells using antibodies against H3K4me3 to identify active promoters and H3K4me1 to identify active enhancers. H3K27ac ChIPseq was performed to identify active promoters and enhancers. Once enhancers and promoters were identified, JIL-1 and histone phosphorylation, H3K9acS10ph and H3K27acS28ph, ChIP-seq was performed to look at binding trends. JIL-1 and phosphoacetlation is found at low levels at inactive enhancers and shows increase at active enhancers and promoters.

DESIGN
Here we examine histone phosphorylation by JIL-1 and acetylation of H3K27ac by CBP at transcriptionally active vs. inactive promoters and enhancers. ChIP-seq is performed in Kc167 Drosophila cells using antibodies against JIL-1, H3K27acS28ph, H3K9acS10ph, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac.
