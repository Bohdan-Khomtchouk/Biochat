TITLE
Effect of overexpression of the OsWRKY53 or phospho-mimicking mutant of OsWRKY53 in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To see the effect of phosphorylation of OsWRKY53, we compared the gene expression profiles in the rice plants overexpressing native OsWRKY53 or a phospho-mimicking mutant of OsWRKY53.

DESIGN
Expression profiling in wild-type, OsWRKY53- or phospho-mimicking mutated OsWRKY53-overexpressing rice leaves was analyzed using one-color method with four biological replicates.
