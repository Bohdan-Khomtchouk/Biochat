TITLE
Elucidating the effects of the macrophage environment on the efficacy of anti-mycobacterial drugs

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
We examined the transcriptional responses of intracellular M. tuberculosis exposed to different front-line drugs during macrophage infection. Our data reveal that Mtb experiences amplification of multiple host-derived pressures following drug exposure. The stresses from the host environment have a dominant impact on Mtb gene expression to the extent that the transcriptional profiles cluster according to environment, ie. broth vs host cell, rather than drug.
