TITLE
Altered modulation of WNT-β-catenin and PI3K/Akt pathways in IgA nephropathy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To uncover new molecular mechanisms involved in IgAN pathogenesis, we compared the genomic profiles of 12 IgAN patients with 8 healthy subjects, We included addiotional disease controls 3 FSGS(Focal Segmenal glomerulosclerosis) patients and 3 membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis type I (MPGN-I) controls in our study to evaluate if the  WNT-β-catenin and PI3K/Akt pathways were specfic to IgAN.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile comparison between 12IgAN patients and 8 Healthy Subjects. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) performed on the additional disease controls determined that the a priori defined set of genes and the pathways generated were specific to the IgAN
