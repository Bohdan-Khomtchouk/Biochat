TITLE
Marine and freshwater three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) gene expression differences

ORGANISM
Gasterosteus aculeatus

SUMMARY
In order to identify gene expression difference between marine and freshwater stickleback populations, we compared the transcriptomes of seven adult tissues (eye, gill, heart, hypothalumus, liver, pectoral muscle, telencephalon) between a marine population sampled from the mouth of the Little Campbell river in British Columbia (LITC) and a freshwater population (Fishtrap Creek, FTC) from northern Washington.   For each population, the sampled individuals were the lab-reared progeny of a single pair of wild-caught parents.

DESIGN
Four to five fish from each population were used as biological replicates for each of the seven tissues. For each population, the sampled individuals were the lab-reared progeny of a single pair of wild-caught parents. All fish were of similar age and were raised in the same aquarium (salinity: 3.5 ppt), with a plastic divider separating the marine and freshwater groups. One male and four females were sampled from each population. Microarray experiments were performed in a 2-color format on custom Agilent arrays: experimental RNA samples were labeled with Cy5, and the common reference RNA sample was labeled with Cy3. The reference RNA was total RNA isolated from a large number of 7-day-post-hatch embryos from the freshwater population of Bear Paw Lake, Alaska (BEPA). One technical replicate was used for each array, and one of the hypothalamus samples (Hyp_FTC#3) was excluded from further analysis due to poor quality indicators. FTC#1 liver and LITC#2 pectoral muscle samples did not yield RNA of sufficient quality for the microarray experiment, and were also excluded from hybridization.
