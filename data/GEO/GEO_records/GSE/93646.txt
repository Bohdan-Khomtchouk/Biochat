SUMMARY
Identification of novel molecular subgroups Background: International consensus recognises four medulloblastoma molecular subgroups - WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4  - each defined by their characteristic genome-wide transcriptomic and DNA methylomic profiles.  Subgroups harbor distinct clinico-pathological and molecular features, underpin current disease sub-classification and initial subgroup-directed therapies are underway in clinical trials (i.e. reduced risk-adapted treatments for favorable-risk WNT patients; SMO inhibitors for SHH patients). However, significant biological heterogeneity and differences in survival are apparent within each subgroup, which remain to be resolved. Methods: We undertook comprehensive molecular profiling and unsupervised class discovery (non-negative matrix factorization, t-SNE) of test and validation cohorts to identify consensus primary molecular subgroups within childhood medulloblastoma ( < 16.0 years), and characterize their clinical and biological significance. Survival modeling was performed in clinically-annotated centrally-reviewed patients ( > 3.0 years). Findings: Seven robust and reproducible primary molecular subgroups of childhood medulloblastoma were identified, characterized by distinct biological/clinical features. For instance, SHH comprised two age-dependent subgroups, while Grp3 and Grp4 each split into two subgroups with significantly different survival rates. Survival analysis identified secondary features predictive of outcome. Cross-validated subgroup-dependent models incorporating these novel subgroups along with secondary features and established disease risk-factors, outperformed current disease risk-stratification schemes. These schema stratified patients into four clinical risk-groups - favorable-risk (91% 5-year survival, 25% of patients), standard-risk (81%, 23%), high-risk (42%, 38%) and very high-risk (28%, 13%)  - to be considered for treatment reduction, intensification or novel therapies respectively. Interpretation: The discovery of seven novel, clinically-significant, subgroups significantly improves disease risk-stratification and provides a new foundation for future research and clinical investigations.
