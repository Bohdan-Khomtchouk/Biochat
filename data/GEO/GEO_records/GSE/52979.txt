TITLE
Response to different N-acyl homoserine lactones and N-acyl homoserine lactones-pretreated plants to secondary challenge with flg22.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In order to gain coherent insights into plant responses we performed transcriptional analysis of Arabidopsis seedling after treatment with three different AHLs: N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL), N-3-oxo-decanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (oxo-C10-HSL), and N-3-oxo-tetradecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (oxo-C14-HSL).  Furthermore, we analyzed the transcriptome of oxo-C14-HSL pretreated plants after a secondary challenge with 100 nM flg22 for 2 and 24 hours after treatment.

DESIGN
Gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were measured after a 3-days-pretreatment with 6 ÂµM of three different N-acyl homoserine lactones in comparison to plants treated with the coresponding volume of acetone (solvent control). Plants pretreated with oxo-C14-HSL were in addition treated with 100nM of flg22 to induced defense response. Three independent experiments were performed (replicates).
