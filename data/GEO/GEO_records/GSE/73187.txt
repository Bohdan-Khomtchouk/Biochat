TITLE
Aberrant epigenetic regulation in clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylation array analyses of 30 CCSKs in comparison with 18 Wilms tumours and normal non-malignant kidneys (2 foetal kidneys and 6 adult kidneys) revealed CCSK tumour DNA to be globally hypermethylated. Four CCSKs, two WTs, two foetal kidneys and 2 adult kidneys were analysed as technical duplicates on different arrays.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA was hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27k array at the SCIBLU Lund University Sweden ( ). The samples were analysed on three different arrays.
