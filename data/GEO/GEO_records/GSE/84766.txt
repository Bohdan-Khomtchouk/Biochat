TITLE
Paf1 modulates Piwi/piRNA silencing capacity in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To test whether the RNA Polymerase II factor PAF1 affects PIWI silencing, we examined the transcriptome expression levels in Drosophila OSS cells following siRNA knockdown of these factors.

DESIGN
The total RNAs from OSS cells were extracted after siRNA knockdown of GFP negative control, PAF1, PIWI, and a double knockdown of both PAF1 and PIWI.  The RNAs were then converted into strand-specific sequencing libraries with the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina.
