TITLE
Epigenetic mapping and functional analysis in a breast cancer metastasis model using whole genome tiling arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used a human gene promoter tiling microarray platform to analyze a cell line model of lymph node metastasis comprised of a poorly metastatic MDA-MB-468GFP human breast adenocarcinoma cell line and its highly metastatic variant (468LN). Gene networks and pathways associated with metastasis were identified and target genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was validated with respect to DNA methylation effects on gene expression. We integrated data from the tiling microarrays with targets identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software and observed epigenetic variations in genes implicated in EMT and with tumor cell migration. We identified widespread genomic hyper- and hypo- methylation events in these cells and we confirmed functional associations between methylation status and expression of the CDH1, CST6, EGFR, SNAI2 and ZEB2 genes by quantitative RealTime PCR. Our data also suggest that the complex genomic reorganization present in cancer cells may be superimposed over promoter-specific methylation events that are responsible for gene-specific expression changes. Keywords: Lymph node metastatic vs non metastatic

DESIGN
DNA derived from three biological replicates of a highly metastatic (via Lymph Nodes) Breast cancer cell line (468GFP-LN) was compared to 3 biological replicates of DNA prepared from the parental cell line, 468GFP.
