TITLE
antimycine a-The cytochrome pathway and cytochrome C biogenesis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs04-01_cytc - antimycine a - Is there a retrograde regulation of mitochondrial cytochrome pathway ? - Presence of an inhibitor of the cytochrome pathway (antimycine A). This treatment induces the expression of a gene coding for an alternative oxydase (AOX1a) and one of the two genes coding for apocytochrome c (CYTc-a). Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
