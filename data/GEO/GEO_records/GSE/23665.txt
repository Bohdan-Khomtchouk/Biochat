TITLE
Human THP-1 Cells: Uninfected vs. Coxiella burnetii NMII infected compared to Uninfected with Chloramphenicol vs. Coxiella burnetii NMII infected with Chloramphenicol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comparison was made between the THP-1(Human monocytic leukemia cells - TIB-202; ATCC) transcriptional responses of; (i) uninfected versus Coxiella burnetii NMII infected and (ii) uninfected versus Coxiella burnetii NMII infected THP-1 cells transiently treated with bacteriostatic levels (10μg/ml) of chloramphenicol (CAM). Briefly, infections were initiated and cultured in parallel with uninfected cells. At 48 hours post infection (hpi), media containing CAM (10μg/ml) was added to one set of cells (uninfected and infected THP-1 cells) and culturing was continued. The other set of cells were mock treated with normal media. Total RNA was isolated at 72 hpi from all conditions. Microarrays were performed for both condition sets and the results from each of the two microarrays were compared to define the host genes modulated by de novo C. burnetii NMII protein synthesis.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Human THP-1 cells: Uninfected vs. Coxiella burnetii NMII infected compared to Uninfected with Chloramphenicol vs. Coxiella burnetii NMII infected with Chloramphenicol. Biological replicates: 3, Technical replicates: 2 for both Microarrays - Uninfected vs. Coxiella burnetii NMII infected and Uninfected with Chloramphenicol vs. Coxiella burnetii NMII infected with Chloramphenicol. One Technical replicate per array. One Biological replicate per 2 arrays.
