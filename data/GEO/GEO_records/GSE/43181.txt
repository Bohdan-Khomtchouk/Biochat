TITLE
Expression data of mouse preoptic region 5 h after LPS-administration comparing wt and mPGES-1 KO mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
WT mice and mPGES-1 KO mice were treated with 120 mikrogram/kg LPS and sacrificed 5 h later. The preoptic region was dissected by LCM and analyzed using GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix).

DESIGN
Groups: WT LPS-treated versus mPGES-1 KO LPS-treated mice.
