TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of long non-codign RNAs transcripts in non-end stage heart failure patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Left ventricle (LV) cardiac biopsies from patients affected by non-end-stage dilated hypokinetic ischemic cardiomyopathy (HF) where collected during Surgical Ventricular Restoration procedure.

DESIGN
Total RNA from tissues was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) expression profiles were measured using primers from the Disease-related human lncRNA Profiler (System Biosciences) in 13 HF patients and in 12 age- and sex-matched controls, not affected from CVDs .1 µg total RNA was retro-transcribed using the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNAs were analyzed using the SYBR-GREEN qPCR method (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
