TITLE
ChIP-seq of H3K27ac in lung cancer, endometrial carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using H3K27ac ChIP-seq profile to map active enhancers in lung cancer, endometrial carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of H3K27ac was done in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (NCI-H358 and NCI-H2009), squamous cell lung carcinoma cell lines (HCC95), endometrial carcinoma cell lines (Ishikawa) and head and neck squamous cell lines (BICR-31)
