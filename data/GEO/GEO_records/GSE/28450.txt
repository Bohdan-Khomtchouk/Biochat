TITLE
aCGH analysis of familial Alzheimerâ€™s disease with presenilin 2 mutation patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established two clones of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with the presenilin 2 mutation, N141 (PS2-1 iPSC and PS2-2 iPSC) by retroviral transduction of primary human fibroblasts. To detect the copy number dependent gene expression profiles in primary fibroblast carrying the presenilin 2 mutation N141(before reprogramming) and PS2-1 iPSC and PS2-2 iPSC(after reprogramming), this experiment was designed.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA of primary fibroblasts carrying the presenilin 2 mutation N141 and undifferentiated PS2-1 iPSC and PS2-2 iPSC were collected. Then, they were applied in this experiment.
