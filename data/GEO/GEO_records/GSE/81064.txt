TITLE
MCF7 cells: empty vector  (Neo) vs. PAR4 overexpression vector transfected before and after 100nM docetaxel treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was evaluate the transcriptome changes in the comparison between MCF7 cells with increased expression of PAR-4 and the control cells before and after docetaxel treatment . The results generated could be of particular interest for the understanding the action of PAR-4 in chemosensitivity, especially to increase the specificity and effectiveness of drug treatment and overcoming resistance to chemotherapy.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, MCF7 Neo vs. MCF7 over PAR4 cells before (control) and after 100nM docetaxel treatment. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates (Neo and over PAR4 before treatment) and 4 docetaxel treated replicates (2 Neo and 2 over PAR4 100nM).

PLATFORM
GPL10332 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
