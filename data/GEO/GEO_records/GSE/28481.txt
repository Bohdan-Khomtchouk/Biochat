TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the zebrafish embryonic host response to Edwardsiella tarda infection using a static immersion systems [experiment A]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In this study we analyzed the zebrafish embryonic host response induced by E. tarda (FL6-60) immersion. The E. tarda induced transcriptome profile was compared to those induced by either E. coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa immersion using the same experimental setup.

DESIGN
All infection experiments were performed using mixed egg clutches of Albino strain zebrafish. At 24 hpf embryos were dechorionated using 2mg/ml pronase and left to recover for one hour in egg water. Subsequently embryos were immersed in a bacterial suspension (E. tarda (1E8 CFU/ml), E. coli (1E8 CFU/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (1E9 CFU/ml) or P. aeruginosa PA14 (1E9 CFU/ml)) and incubated for 5 hours at 28 ËšC. After the incubation period the embryos were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All treatment groups were analyzed using a common reference approach.
