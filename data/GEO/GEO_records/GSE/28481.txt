TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the zebrafish embryonic host response to Edwardsiella tarda infection using a static immersion systems [experiment A]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In this study we analyzed the zebrafish embryonic host response induced by E. tarda (FL6-60) immersion. The E. tarda induced transcriptome profile was compared to those induced by either E. coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa immersion using the same experimental setup.
