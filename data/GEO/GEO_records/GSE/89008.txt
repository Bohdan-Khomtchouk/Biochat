TITLE
Human tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cell transcriptome response to infection with H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 influenza virus.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells are considered to serve as a good correlate of influenza virus infection in the human respiratory tract. mRNA-Seq analysis was used to profile the cellular transcriptome of HTBE cells at multiple time points in response to infection with influenza A/California/04/09 (H1N1), A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2), and A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) HALo virus. The Influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) HALo mutant virus is an attenuated H5N1 virus generated from wild-type Influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) virus as described in Steel, J., et al. J Virol. 2009 Feb; 83(4):1742-53.

DESIGN
Human tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells that have been isolated from normal donor airway epithelial tissue were infected with influenza A/California/04/09 (H1N1), A/Wyoming/03/03 (H3N2), and A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) HALo virus at an MOI of 5. H3N2- and H5N1-infected samples and time-matched mock-infected samples were collected in duplicates at 3, 6, 12, and 18 hrs post infection for mRNA-Seq analysis. Sample from H1N1-infected cells and mock controls were collected at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hrs.
