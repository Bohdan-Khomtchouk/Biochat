TITLE
Messenger RNA transcript expression in the pig (S. scrofa)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
90K Combimatrix gene expression microarrays were composed by 17,048 replicated probes and 963 not replicated specific for the Ensembl (Ver. 56) Transcripts (protein coding + pseudogenes + retrotransposed elements), 11,363 replicated probes specific for the UniGene clusters (Ver. 38) of length comprised between 778 nt and 1,348 nt, and 28,790 single probes specific for the remaining UniGene clusters. These microarrays were used to study gene expression in 14 different pig tissues (Atrium Sinister; Skin; Liver; W_B_A: White Blood Cells from Arteriosum blood; W_B_V: White Blood Cells from Venosum blood; Lymph Node; Tongue; Spleen; Skeletal Muscle; Lung; Kidney; Stomach; Adipose Tissue; Ventricle Sinister). Gene expression was correlated with the micro-RNA expression in the same tissues.

DESIGN
14 different samples were analyzed. Each experiment with a different sample was replicate two times. We performed a total of 28 experiments and correlated them with 28 experiments of micro-RNA gene expression.
