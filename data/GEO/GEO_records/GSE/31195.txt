TITLE
Study of the consistency, comparability and identity of different Dendritic cells productions for clinical use

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of monocyte-derived Dendritic cells manufactured several times from one healthy donor and one single time from 8 different healthy donors to test the sources of variability Sources tested: Assay-related variability (8 samples), Manufacture-related variability (5 samples), Intra-donor-related variability (5 samples), inter-donor-related variability (9 samples)

DESIGN
4 different levels of variability were accounted: Assay, manufacture, intradonor, and interdonor

PLATFORM
