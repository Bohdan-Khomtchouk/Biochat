TITLE
Organ-Derived Dendritic Cells Have Differential Effects on Alloreactive T Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional response of murine allogeneic T cells (B10.BR) after stimulation with different organ-derived (spleen, liver, peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes) dendritic cells (C57BL/6) in vitro Keywords: gene expression array-based, count

DESIGN
We stimulated B10.BR T cells with dendritic cells derived from different C57BL/6 organs for four days and then performed array experiments on the T cells.
