TITLE
Expression data from SSEA1+  differentiated murine embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SSEA1+ cells sorted from mouse embryonic stem cells differentiated for 4 days in 10uM Retinoic acid do not form teratomas when transplated into SCID mice while Pten-/- cells do. We used microarrays to identify genes and pathways besides Pten that could explain this difference in tumorigenicity. Keywords: wild type vs Pten-/-

DESIGN
Wild type and Pten mutant SSEA1 positive differentiated cells were compared as the wild type cells were non-tumorigenic upon transplant to SCID mice and the Pten-/- cells were tumorigenic.
