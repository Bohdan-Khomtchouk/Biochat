TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of enriched male germ cell populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNA  is essential for the process of spermatogonesis, however analysis of its change in expression within germ cells during this process has been limited. We set out to examine the change in the miRNA expression profile of highly enriched mouse germ cell populations in vairous developmental stages.These inlcuded postnatal gonocytes, day 7-9 spermatogonia as well as pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids from adult mice

DESIGN
Gonocytes (day1) and spermatogonia (day 7-9), pachytene spermatocytes and round spermadits (adult) were enrichged by 2-4% BSA gradient sedementation. Three biological replicates of each cell type were included.
