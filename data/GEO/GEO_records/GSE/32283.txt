TITLE
Mutations in IDH1 are associated with DNA hypermethylation in glioblastomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the DNA methylation profiles of 26 glioblastomas harboring mutations in IDH1 with 36 glioblastomas without these mutations on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from fresh frozen tumors was bisulfite converted with the Zymo Research EZ DNA Methylation kit, then hybridized to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip
