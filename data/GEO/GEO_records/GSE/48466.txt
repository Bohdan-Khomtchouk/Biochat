TITLE
Expression data from well-differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells infected with H1N1 Influenza isolates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compare the  gene expression profiles of different H1N1 isolates (seasonal and pandemic) in lung epithelial cells in vitro.

DESIGN
Well-differentiated primary human lung, bronchial epithelial cells (wd-NHBE) were infected with two pandemic and one seasaonl H1N1 influenza viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 3.0. The cells were then collected, in triplicate, at 36 hours after infection. This timepoint was selected as we saw significant differences in soluble cytokine and chemokine protein levels at this time point in the supernatant.
