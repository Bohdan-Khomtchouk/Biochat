TITLE
Screen of differential expressed genes from residual MHCC97H treated by POSTN or not

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Incomplete thermal ablation may induce invasiveness of hepatocellur carcinoma, however, the mechasim is not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether activated hepatic stellate cells would accelerate the progression of residual HCC after sublethal heat treatment via the secretion of POSTN. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of up-regulated genes of residual HCC cells induced by POSTN.

DESIGN
Residual MHCC97H pre-treated by POSTN or not for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain differential expression profiles. To that end, we prepared six samples of two groups, and three replicates for each group.
