TITLE
wt-col0_flagellin

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au09-01_mpk_flagellin - wt-col0_flagellin Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are key regulators of cell proliferation, differentiation and stress effectors. The core of the MAP kinase signal transduction cascade is composed of a three-kinase module consisting of a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), and a MAP kinase (MAPK). The signaling pathway is activated upon stimulation by a phosphorylation cascade. Flagellin is a protein present in the flagellum of almost all bacteria and triggers Innate Immunity in plants, mediated by a MAPK phosphorylation signal cascade. To better understand the changes occuring in wt-Col0 flagellin treatment at the gene expression level, we would like to perform a microarray transcriptomic analysis.
