TITLE
Epigenetic profiling of histone H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3ac, H4ac, CBP and P300 using ChIP-chip

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The clustered homeobox proteins play crucial roles in development, hematopoiesis and leukemia yet the targets they regulate and their mechanisms of action are poorly understood.  Here, we identified the binding sites for Hoxa9 and the Hox cofactor Meis1 on a genome-wide level and profiled their associated epigenetic modifications and transcriptional targets. Hoxa9 and the Hox cofactor Meis1 co-bind at hundreds of highly evolutionarily-conserved sites, most of which are distant from transcription start sites.  These sites show high levels of histone H3K4 monomethylation and CBP/P300 binding characteristic of enhancers. Furthermore, a subset of these sites shows enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. Many Hoxa9 and Meis1 binding sites are also bound by PU.1 and other lineage-restricted transcription factors previously implicated in establishment of myeloid enhancers.  Conditional Hoxa9 activation is associated with CBP/P300 recruitment, histone acetylation and transcriptional activation of a network of proto-oncogenes including Erg, Flt3, Lmo2, Myb and Sox4. Collectively this work suggests that Hoxa9 regulates transcription by interacting with enhancers of genes important for hematopoiesis and leukemia.

DESIGN
Enriched Hoxa9 and Meis1 regions and a selected set of the nearest 360 TSSs were tiled onto Nimblegen custom arrays (Mus musculus 8, Feb 2006) with 50-mer probes (average spacing of 35bp), along with 60 negative control sequences that were selected randomly from the mouse genome
