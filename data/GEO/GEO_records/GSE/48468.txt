TITLE
Ectopical expression of miR-125b by lentiviral-vector in neuroblastoma cell line SKNDZ

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential expression of mRNA were conducted in neuroblastoma cell line SKNDZ, which successfully transduced human miR-125b

DESIGN
MYCN-amplification SKNDZ neuroblastoma cell line was transduced with MIRN125B2 gene with lentiviral vector (pLKO.1-puro), and selected by puromycin for 48 hours. Then the total RNA was extracted and analyzed the differential expression of a total of 29,187 genes by Oligonucleotide DNA microarray.
