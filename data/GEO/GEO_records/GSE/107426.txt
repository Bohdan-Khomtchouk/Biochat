TITLE
Results of differentially expressed lncRNAs in COPD and healthy smoker using the Arraystar Human LncRNA Microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 3,359 lncRNAs revealed by microarray analysis have been differentially expressed between the two groups, 1,995 lncRNAs identified to be up-regulated in COPD, whereas 1,364 lncRNAs have been down-regulated. Meanwhileï¼Œa total of 3,283 mRNAs have been differentially expressed, 2,589 mRNAs identified to be up-regulated in COPD, whereas 694 mRNAs were down-regulated.

DESIGN
Differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in blood samples from COPD patients(n=3) and healthy controls (n=3) with smoking history by human microarray analysis.  Samples from individual patients were pooled and are represented by a single COPD sample and a single Healthy Smoker sample.
