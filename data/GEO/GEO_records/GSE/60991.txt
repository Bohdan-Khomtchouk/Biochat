TITLE
Profiling of iPSC-derived keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our goal was to demonstrate the similarity between the original keratinocytes and iPSC-derived keratinocytes from the same individual Profiles of original keratinocytes, iPSCs, IPSC-derived keratinocytes, iPSC-derived fibroblasts from a single individual and normal fibroblasts from a second individual were compared

DESIGN
Three technical replicates were prepared for revertant-iPSC-FB, two technical replicates for normal FB and one for iPSC, revertant-iPSC-KC and the original keratinocytes
