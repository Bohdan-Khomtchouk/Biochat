TITLE
Differentially expressed long noncoding RNA expression between periodontal ligament stem cells from healthy periodontal tissue and periodontal ligament stem cells from inflammatory periodontal tissue.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Periodontitis can impair the osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal mesenchymal stem cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to play significant roles under both physiologic and pathological conditions. We performed comprehensive lncRNAs profiling by lncRNA microarray to identify differentially expressed long noncoding RNA expression between Periodontal ligament stem cells from healthy Periodontal tissue and periodontal ligament stem cells from inflammatory periodontal tissue. Our analysis identified 233 lncRNAs and 423 mRNAs that were differently expressed (fold change > 2.0, p-value < 0.05) between the two groups of cells. The GO analysis revealed that the significantly down-regulated biological processes included multicellular organismal process, developmental process and multicellular organismal development and the significantly up-regulated biological processes included cellular process, biological regulation and response to stimulus in periodontal ligament stem cells from inflammatory periodontal tissue. The Pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed mRNAs may involved in Focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, Long-term depression, Circadian entrainment and HIF-1 signaling pathway.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, periodontal ligament stem cells from healthy periodontal tissue (hPDLSCs) vs. periodontal ligament stem cells from inflammatory periodontal tissue (pPDLSCs), Biological replicates: 3 control replicates (hPDLSCs), 3 testing replicates (pPDLSCs).
