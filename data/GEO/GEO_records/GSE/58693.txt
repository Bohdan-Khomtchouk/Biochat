TITLE
MicroRNA (miRNA) expression of IMCD tubule suspension

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
miRNA plays a role as post-transcriptional regulator. However, miRNAs in the kidney collecting duct cell have not been well understood. So we aimed to profile miRNAs in the kidney inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells, and to identify the vasopressin-responsive miRNAs in the kidney IMCD cells. The microarray assay revealed that relative expression of miRNAs in the kidney IMCD cells was changed by desmopressin (dDAVP) stimulation.

DESIGN
Fresh IMCD tubules were prepared from rat kidney and incubated in the medium in the absence or presence of dDAVP (1 nM, 2 h). Total RNA purified from IMCD tubules was used to analyze miRNA expression by GeneChipÂ® miRNA 3.0 Array (Affymetrix).
