TITLE
Ethanol effect on myoblast differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of C2C12 myoblast cells treated with ethanol during differentiation. Ethanol inhibits C2C12 differentiation. Results provide insight into signaling pathways altered by ethanol during differentiation.

DESIGN
When C2C12 cells reached 70% confluence in growth medium containing 20% FBS, culture medium was changed to differentiation medium containing 2% horse serum with and without 100mM ethanol. Samples were harvested from day zero (just prior to differentiation) as well as days 1, 2 and 3 following onset of differentiation with and without alcohol treatment. RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNA mini-kit.
