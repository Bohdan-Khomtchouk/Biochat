TITLE
Role of SMARCAD1 and H3R26Cit in Maintenance of the Na√Øve Pluripotent State

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide maps of SMARCAD1 binding and histone modification H3R26Cit in mouse ES cells, histone modification H3K9me3, H3K4me3, H3K27Ac in Smarcad1 KD mouse ES cells, and histone modification H3K9me3 in mouse ES cells after PADI inhibition. Together with RNA-seq data for mouse ICM, blastocyst, embryonic stem cells and Smarcad1 KD cells.

DESIGN
We used the strategies of ChIP-Seq to detect the epigenetic pattern of SMARCAD1 and H3R26Cit in E14 cells to describe the colocalization of the two. We also used the strategies of ChIP-Seq to detect the epigenetic pattern in E14 and Smarcad1-knock down cells. Together with RNA-seq data for mouse ES cells, Smarcad1 KD cells, mouse ICM and blastocyst, we described the fuction of Smarcad1 in switch pluripotent states.
