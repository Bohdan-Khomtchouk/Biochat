TITLE
DNA methylation (5mC) and DNA 5-hydroxy methylation (5hmC) analysis in WT murine ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA methylation in murine WT ES cells was investigated by MBD domain mediated pull down of methylated DNA followed by chip analysis. For examination of 5hmC, hydroxymethylated DNA was enriched by Click-chemistry mediated pull down. Because of the lower amount of 5hmC, two different approached were adopted. The first approach was based on direct labeling of 5hmC DNA, and in the second method DNA was labeled after amplification with vitro transcription (IVT) .

DESIGN
Microarray based hybridization (chip) analysis of epigenetic modifications, namely, 5mC and 5hmC for murine WT ES cells.

PLATFORM
GPL10324 Agilent-015279 Mouse CpG Island ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 2x105K  (Probe Name version)
