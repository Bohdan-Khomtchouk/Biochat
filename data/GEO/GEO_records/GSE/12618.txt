TITLE
Gene expression profiles of E13 bladder compartments. (GUDMAP Series ID: 24)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing bladder.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of microdissected tissues and FACS sorted cells plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing urogenital system. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. The data submitted here delineates the gene expression profiles of the mesenchymal and epithelial compartments of the e13 mouse bladder. Keywords: Mouse embryonic day 13 bladder mesenchyme and epithelium.
