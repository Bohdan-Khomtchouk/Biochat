TITLE
Comparison of Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514 grown on different xylose concentrations

ORGANISM
Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514

SUMMARY
Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514 was grown on 1, 10, 50 and 200 mM xylose in order to identify pathways and transporters responsible for xylose transport and conversion to ethanol.

DESIGN
In this study, X514 cells were grown in difeined medium supplemented with 1, 10, 50 or 200 mM xylose as the sole carbon substrate. Each sample was harvested at mid-log phase.  Each sample was run in triplicate using genomic DNA as the control.
