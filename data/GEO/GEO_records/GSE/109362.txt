TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild type and RBM3 knockout cortex Transcriptomes during maternal hypothermia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of gene expression. The goals of this study are to compare the different transcripts between Wild type and RBM3 knockout cortex Transcriptomes during maternal hypothermia

DESIGN
Methods:the maternal hypothermia was induced at E14, and the embryonic brain cortex were isolated from E16 WT and RBM3 knockout mice. RNA used for global transcriptome analysis were extracted from the embryonic brain cortex and sequenced by Hiseq 2500. Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified when we compared Normalized Reads Count between groups with p < 0.05 and |Log2FoldChange| > 1.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
