TITLE
Expression data from PVTT control cells and PVTT hPCL3s overexpressing cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our previous studies have clearly demonstrated the roles of hPCL3s (PHF19) in the migration, invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. The microarray analysis was performed to screen the differentially expressed genes in the PVTT/hPCL3s

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from PVTT/con and PVTT/hPCL3s cells and the gene expression microarray was performed to investigated the genes regulated by hPCL3s.
