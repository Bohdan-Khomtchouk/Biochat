TITLE
Phasevarion of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae R2866

ORGANISM
Haemophilus influenzae

SUMMARY
H. influenzae R2866 contains a phase-variable DNA methylase modA10, by virtue of 16 tetrameric repeats present after the start codon. Gain or loss of repeats during replication by slipped-strand mispairing can result in a non-functional reading frame. Microarray analyses of wild-type and insertionally inactivated modA were performed to determine genes affected by phase variable modification.
