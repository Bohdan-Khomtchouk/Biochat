TITLE
mRNA changes following induction of LEC1 activity in Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), an atypical subunit of the NF-Y CCAAT binding transcription factor, is a central regulator that controls many aspects of seed development including the maturation phase during which seeds accumulate storage macromolecules and embryos acquire the ability to withstand desiccation.    To define the gene network and developmental processes controlled by LEC1, genes regulated directly by and downstream of LEC1 were identified.   In this part of the study, we identified the genes regulated by LEC1 by overexpressing an inducible form of LEC1 in Arabidopsis seedlings and identifying the mRNAs induced EARLY (1h) after induction of LEC1 activity.

DESIGN
Shoot apices from Arabidopsis thaliana 35S:LEC1-GR 8 day old seedlings were incubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of Dexamethasone to induce LEC1 activity.  Two biological replicates per treatment were analyzed.
