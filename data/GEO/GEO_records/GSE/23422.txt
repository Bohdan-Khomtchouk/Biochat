TITLE
Environmental functional genes for soil microbes in South East Queensland, Australia

ORGANISM
synthetic construct ; uncultured microorganism

SUMMARY
Custom made functional gene micoarray (E-FGA) consisting of 13,056 mRNA-enriched anonymus microbial clones from dirverse microbial communities to profile microbial gene transcript in agricultural soils with low and high flux of N2O. A total of 96 genes displayed expression that differed significantly between low and high N2O emitting soils. Creation and validation of an cDNA microarray from environmental microbial mRNA, to use as a monitoring tool for microbial gene expression

DESIGN
Microbial expression profiles comparing two high N2O-emitting sites (3 soil replicates and microarrays each) and two low N2O-emitting sites (3 soil replicates and microarray each) from sugarcane site in Mackay, Australia

PLATFORM
GPL10762 AGRF Environmental functional gene microarray (E-FGA)
