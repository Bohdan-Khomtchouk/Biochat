TITLE
Transcript profiling in rice stem base of wild type and crown root less 1 mutant after auxin treatment

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Lateral Organ Boundary Domain (LBD) transcription factors are specific of plants and are involved in the control of development. One LBD clade is related to the control of root development (Coudert et al., 2013, Mol. Biol. Evol. 30, 569-572). Belonging to this clade, CROWN ROOT LESS 1 controls the initiation of crown roots in rice and its expression is induced by auxin (Inukai Plant Cell, 17, 1387-1396, Liu et al., 2005, Plant J., 43, 47-56). The aim of this study was to identify CRL1-dependant auxin responsive genes. Transcriptome analysis in wild-type and crl1 mutant stem bases after exogenous auxin treatment of plantlets revealed 126 CRL1-dependant auxin responsive genes including a large part of genes encoding proteins involved in signal transduction pathways that may be related to cell division, expansion and differentiation, and root development.

DESIGN
8 days old seedlings cultivated in vitro of wild type or crl1 mutant were treated by auxin. Transcriptome profiling were conducted just before, 2h and 4h after auxin treatment to identify CRL1-dependant auxin responsive genes. Two independent repetitions of the experiment were done.
