TITLE
PADI4 acts as a coactivator of Tal1 by counteracting repressive histone arginine methylation at the IL6ST (gp130) promoter

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of common genes regulated by Tal1 and PADI4

DESIGN
2 controls + 2x3 knockdown samples HEL cells were transduced with lentiviruses harboring shconstructs against the transcription factor Tal1 and PADI4 respectively, in biological triplicates. Two control samples with a control lentivirus with an shRNA against LacZ were included. RNA was prepared 6 days after transduction.
