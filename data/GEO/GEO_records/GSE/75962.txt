TITLE
RNA-seq Generated Transcriptional Profile of H2O2 Treated HCT116 vs. Untreated HCT116

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oxidative stress, is considered to be a key risk state for a variety of human diseases, which can upregulate transcriptional expression of DNA repair genes. However, it remains elusive whether all or just a portion of DNA repair genes can be upregulated in response to oxidative stress. Therefore, the changes in expression pattern of DNA repair genes and how they are regulated in response to oxidative stress need to be elucidated. In this study, we performed RNA-seq to generate expression profile and identified subsets of induced and repressed DNA repair genes in colorectal cancer cell line exposure to hydrogen peroxide.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from H2O2-treated HCT116 and untreated HCT116 cells with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). Quality control was performed using Bioanalyser 2100 (RNA nano kits, Agilent). mRNA-Seq libraries were generated from total RNA with polyA+ selection of mRNA using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and then subjected to transcriptome sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq 2000
