TITLE
DUSP1/MKP1 promotes angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DUSP1 is involved in different cellular pathways including cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and resistance to chemotherapy. To understand more about the cellular responses regulated by DUSP1 in NSCLC cells, we interfered DUSP1 expression in the NSCLC cell line H460 and studied the changes in gene expression differentially regulated by this phosphatase. Keywords: Expression profiling by array in cells with genetic modification

DESIGN
The human non small lung cancer cell line H460 used in this study was from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). The cell line was maintained in RPMI (Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine serum and transfected by Lipofectamine Plus Reagent from Life Technologies as directed by the manufacturer. The DUSP1 pSuperRetro-derived vectors were constructed as described (Chattoppadhyay et al., 2006). Clones expressing siRNA for DUSP1 were selected for their ability to grow in the presence of puromycin  and kept for selection. Stable transfection was confirmed by Western blotting. RNA was extracted and quality control was checked before hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
