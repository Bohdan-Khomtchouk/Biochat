TITLE
De novo DNA methylation by Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b is dispensable for nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are generated from somatic cells by the transduction of defined transcription factors and involves dynamic changes in DNA methylation. While the reprogramming of somatic cells is accompanied by de-methylation of pluripotency genes, the functional importance of de novo DNA methylation has not been clarified. Here, using loss-of-function studies, we generated iPSCs from fibroblasts that were deficient in de novo DNA methylation mediated by Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. These iPSCs reactivated pluripotency genes, underwent self-renewal and showed restricted developmental potential which was rescued upon re-introduction of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b.  We conclude that de novo DNA methylation by Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b is dispensable for nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells.

DESIGN
RNA levels of Dnmt3ab deficient iPSC cell lines were compared to control iPSC cell lines
