TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis pifq seedlings grown in short days (SD) and in free running (LL) conditions.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Members of the PIF quartet (PIFq) (PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5) collectively contribute to induce growth in Arabidopsis seedlings under short day (SD) conditions, specifically promoting elongation at dawn. Their action involves the direct regulation of growth-related and hormone-associated genes. The objective of this genomic analysis was to define a comprehensive set of SD-regulated genes at dawn compared to free-running (LL) conditions in the wild type, followed by identification of those SD-regulated genes whose expression depends on the presence of PIFq. By using this sequential strategy, our aim was to identify PIF/SD-coregulated genes.

DESIGN
Two genotypes [wild type Columbia (Col-0) and pifq mutant] and two treatments [SD and LL] were included. Each sample had three biological replicates. Seedlings were grown under SD (8h white light + 16 h of darkness) for 2 days and then either mantained in SD (SD samples) or kept under white light (LL) for an additional day. Samples were collected at the end of the night in SD (ZT24) or the end of the subjective night in LL (CT24).
