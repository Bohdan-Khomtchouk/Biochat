TITLE
Expression data from AID-silenced mouse plasmacytoma J558 (BALB/c, H-2Ld)cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the potential mechanisms by which AID-elimination facilitate better J558 tumor rejection by P1CTL, we performed cDNA microarray analysis to compare AID-silenced J558 cells and their relative controls.

DESIGN
The mouse Affymetrix Mouse Genechips 430-2.0 arrays were hybridized to RNA derived from control and AID-silenced J558 cells according to manufacturerâ€™s directions. Two different pairs of cells (C4 vs AID 2.27 (a) and C5 vs AID 2.13 (b)) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
