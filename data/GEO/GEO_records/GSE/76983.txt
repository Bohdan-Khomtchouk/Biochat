TITLE
Single-cell RNA-seq of sorted and micro-dissected mouse bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We here systematically studied the interaction network of bone marrow cells. To this end, we micro-dissected many small interacting structures (cell doublets, triplets etc.) into single cells, and sequenced their mRNAs, to infer cell identity. After grouping the cells into cell types (based on the single-cell transcriptomes), we identified actual physical interactions that occurred more, or less, than what would be expected by chance. We compared the micro-dissected data to sorted hematopoietic stem cells.

DESIGN
After mild dissociation of the bone marrow, we micro-dissected many small interacting structures (cell doublets, triplets etc.) into single cells, and sequenced their mRNAs. In addition, single hematopoietic stem cells were sorted (Lineage- Kit+ Sca1+ CD150+ CD48-) to sequence their transcriptome. In detail, the bone marrow was mildly flushed. Structures composed of about 10 to 20 cells were set apart. With needles and a micro-dissection microscope, we trimmed of smaller structures from these big structure. These smaller structures are mainly two to four cells attached together. These small structures were then further micro-dissected to single cells. The goal of doing these sequential dissections was to keep track of which cells were interacting with which. Each micro-dissected cell sample contains RNA-seq data for 96 single cells. Each single cells received a different barcode that allow us to entangle them, and to produce the processed .coutt.csv file. Each sorted hematopoietic stem cell sample represents a single cell. The processed data file expdata_BMJhscC.csv contains transcript counts for all analyzed cells.
