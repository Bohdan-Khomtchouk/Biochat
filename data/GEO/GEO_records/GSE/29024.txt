TITLE
Insight into the response of Bacillus cereus towards the polysaccharide chitosan

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus

SUMMARY
Comparison of chitosan-treated B. cereus ATCC 14579 cells with non-treated B. cereus ATCC 14579 cells. 2 chitosans with similar molecular weight (Mw) but different degrees of acetylation (Fa) were used: chitosan B (Mw: 28.4 kDa, Fa: 0.16) (samples 1-3) and chitosan A (Mw: 36.0 kDa, Fa: 0.01) (samples 4-6).

DESIGN
One-condition design comparision of treated vs. non-treated control. 3 biological replicates, including a dye swap.
