TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of gliotactin (Gli)-knockdown Drosophila melanogaster posterior midguts enterocytes (EC)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to analyze changes in gene expression produced in posterior midguts after knocking down Gli in enterocytes (EC) during 9 days. Gli was depleted from ECs using a drug-inducible version of the binary GAL4-UAS system in combination with UAS-GLI-RNAi. Targeted gene expression using the 5966GS-GAL4 driver is observed in adult ECs when flies are fed the progesterone analog RU486 (RU+); addition of ethanol is used as a control (RU-), providing cohorts of isogenic individuals with or without induction of the Gli-RNAi transgene.

DESIGN
Seventy-five female 5966GS-GAL4 Gli-RNAi posterior midguts per condition (RU+ and RU-) were dissected. Each condition was sequenced in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
