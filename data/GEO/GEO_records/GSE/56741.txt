TITLE
Gene expression profile of collagen VI deficient human fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to gain insight into the molecular pathogenesis of collagen VI defects we have performed gene expression microarray analysis of dermal fibroblasts. We have compared the transcriptome of fibroblasts, treated or untreated with ascorbic acid, from UCMD patients (n = 6) and aged-matched healthy children (n = 5).

DESIGN
We analysed the gene expression profile of fibroblasts obtained from healthy control and ucmd children (23 in total). RNA was extracted and processed for further hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (AffymetrixÂ® Human Genome U219 Array Plate)
