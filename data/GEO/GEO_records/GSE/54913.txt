TITLE
mRNA expression in blood of 18 schizophrenia patients and 12 healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study profiles genome-wide mRNA expression in blood from 18 early-onset SZ (EOS) cases and 12 healthy controls. A total of 1070 mRNAs were detected by the microarrays in our samples.

DESIGN
18 schizophrenia samples and 12 healthy controls were used to acquire blood expression profiles
