TITLE
Homeostatic skin contains two different subsets of resident macrophages with distinct origin and gene profile.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have found the existence of two independent populations contributing to the skin-resident macrophage pool based on their different origin. We have analyzed their gene profile by deep-sequencing (RNA-Seq). Analysis of RNA-Seq data revealed a differential expression signature between both subsets of skin macrophages for 744 of 17741 genes compiled (198 of them showing similar normalized expression levels across replicates). We have further characterized their specialized functions related to their different gene profiles.

DESIGN
Examination of gene profile of 2 different macrophage subsets coexisting in skin under steady state.
