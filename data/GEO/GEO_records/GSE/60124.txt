TITLE
Examination of gene expression in human breast cancer cells exposed to the HDAC inhibitor SAHA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The identification of proteins that change in response to a drug perturbation can shed light on the molecular mechanisms of the drug and its potential use in therapies. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are targets for cancer therapy. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is an FDA approved HDAC inhibitor used for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. ING2 is a non-catalytic component of the Sin3/HDAC complex. To obtain a better mechanistic understanding of the Sin3/HDAC complex in cancer, we extended its protein-protein interaction network and identified a mutually exclusive pair within the complex. We then assessed the effects of SAHA on the disruption of the complex network through six homologous baits. SAHA perturbs multiple protein interactions and therefore compromises the composition of large parts of the Sin3/HDAC network. A comparison of the effect of SAHA treatment on gene expression in breast cancer cells to a knockdown of the ING2 subunit indicated that a portion of the anticancer effects of SAHA may be attributed to the disruption of ING2's association with the complex.

DESIGN
Cells from human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 were treated with the HDAC inhibitor drug SAHA in duplicate and compared to a DMSO vehicle control in triplicate, for a total of 5 samples.
