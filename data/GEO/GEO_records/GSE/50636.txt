TITLE
Genome-wide profiling  of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 enrichment and mRNA levels in young leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Chromatin and RNA were extracted from young A. thaliana Col-0 rosette leaves. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using commercially available antibodies and analyzed by Illumina sequencing (ChIP-seq). Transcriptome data were generated by RNA-seq.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 enrichment profiles in 2 biological replicates. RNA-seq analysis of mRNA levels in 1 biological replicate.

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana)
