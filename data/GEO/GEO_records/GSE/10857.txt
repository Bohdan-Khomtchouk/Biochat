TITLE
Gene expression of rice root tips before, at and buckled by a hard layer in two rice varieties

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine the changes in gene expression of rice root tips when they came in to contact with a hard layer (60% wax layer). Three categories of root tips were sampled; tips before the hard layer, tips that had come into contact with the hard layer and root tips which had buckled after coming into contact with the hard layer. Two genotypes (Azucena and Bala) that vary in there ability to penetrate a hard layer were selected for a genotype comparison of gene expression at the hard layer. Keywords: Genotype comparison, root impedance response
