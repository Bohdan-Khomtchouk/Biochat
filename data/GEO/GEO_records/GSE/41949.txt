TITLE
mRNA oxidation data from dry dormant and after-ripened wheat seeds

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
After-ripening induced seed dormancy release in wheat is associated with mRNA oxidation. We used Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array to identify mRNAs differentially oxidized by after-ripening

DESIGN
Dormant and after-ripened seeds in dry state were used for isolating oxidized mRNAs and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChip. After-ripened seeds were generated by storing dormant seeds at room temperature for 10 months.
