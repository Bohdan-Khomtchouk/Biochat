TITLE
Identification of tumor immune evasion mechanism using P0 and P3 cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The emergence of immune resistance variants during immunotherapy is poorly understood.  We generated a highly immune resistant cell line (P3) from a susceptible cell line (P0) by subjecting it to 3 rounds of in vivo immune selection.  Subsequently, microarray analysis of P0 and P3 was performed to identify genes that may contribute to the increase in immune resistance. Keywords: cell type comparison
