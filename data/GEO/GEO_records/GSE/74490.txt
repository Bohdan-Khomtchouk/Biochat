TITLE
Transcriptome of cancer associated fibroblasts before and after triptolide treatment in pancreatic cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pancreatic cancer is characterized by heavy desmoplasia. Triptolide and its water-soluble pro-drug Minnelide are extremely efficient against pancreatic cancer in animal models.  However, the effects of triptolide on pancreatic cancer stromal cells are largely unknown. The aim of this project is to indentify potential cellular functions that are affected by triptolide in pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Cancer associated fibroblasts were isolated from pancreatic tumor of KPC mouse model. Cells were either untreated or treated with 100nM triptolide for 6h or 24h before RNA isolation. The RNA was quality tested using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). cDNA was created by reverse transcription of oligo-dT purified polyadenylated RNA and fragmented, blunt-ended, and then ligated to barcoded adaptors. Then, the library was size selected, and the selection process was validated and quantified by capillary electrophoresis and qPCR, respectively. Samples were load on the HiSeq 2500 (Illumina Inc., CA, USA) to generate around 25 million paired-end 50bp reads for each sample.
