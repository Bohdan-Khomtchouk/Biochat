TITLE
Isolation and in vitro expansion of human colonic stem cells [Expression profile]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the surface marker EPHB2, we have FACS-purified and profiled stem cell-enriched cell fractions from normal human mucosa, crypt proliferative progenitors and late transient amplifying cells to define a gene expression program specific for normal human colon epithelial stem cells

DESIGN
We FACS purified human colonic crypt cells according to their EPHB2 surface abundance. We used Affymetrix chips to hybridize 3 samples from EPHB2-high, 3 samples from EPHB2-medium, 3 samples from EPHB2-low, and 2 samples from EPHB2-negative cells
