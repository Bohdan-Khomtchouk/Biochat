TITLE
mRNA profiling of LNCaP cells treated with miR-31

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the altered microRNA expression signature in human prostate cancer compared to benign prostate tissue. To determine the altered mRNA expression signatures upon overexrpession miR-31 in prostate cancer cells.

DESIGN
Two condition experiments:1) Total RNA from 21 pairs of prostate cancers and matched benign prostate tissues were collected and processed for microRNA detection. 2) In LNCaP prostate cancer cells, miR-31 was overexpressed and compared to control miR-NC.
