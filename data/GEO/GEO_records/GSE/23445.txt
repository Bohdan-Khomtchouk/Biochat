TITLE
Effect of JMJD2B depletion on the ER signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
JMJD2B is expressed in a high proportion of human breast tumors, and the expression levels significantly correlate with estrogen receptor (ER) positivity. To assess the effect of JMJD2B depletion on the ER signaling pathway, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array.
