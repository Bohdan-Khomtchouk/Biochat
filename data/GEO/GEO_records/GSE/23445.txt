TITLE
Effect of JMJD2B depletion on the ER signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
JMJD2B is expressed in a high proportion of human breast tumors, and the expression levels significantly correlate with estrogen receptor (ER) positivity. To assess the effect of JMJD2B depletion on the ER signaling pathway, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from steroid-depleted control MCF-7 cells (control E2(-)), control MCF-7 cells treated with E2 (control E2(+)), steroid-depleted JMJD2B-depleted MCF-7 cells (siJ2B E2(-)), and JMJD2B-depleted MCF-7 cells treated with E2 (siJ2B E2(+)).
