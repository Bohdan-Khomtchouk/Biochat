TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Ppr1 gain of function mutant Candida albicans strains

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Metabolic pathways are largely conserved in eukaryotes, but the transcriptional regulation of these pathways can sometimes vary between species; this has been termed rewiring. Recently it has been established that in the Saccharomyces lineage starting from Saccharomyces castelli, genes involved in allantoin breakdown have been genomically relocated to form the DAL cluster. The formation of the DAL cluster occurred along with the loss of urate permease (UAP) and urate oxidase (UOX), reducing the requirement for oxygen and bypassing the candidate Ppr1 inducer, uric acid. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae this allantoin catabolism cluster is regulated by the transcription factor Dal82, which is not present in many of the pre-rearrangement fungal species. We have used ChIP-Chip analysis, transcriptional profiling of an activated Ppr1 protein, bioinformatics, and nitrogen utilization studies, to establish that in Candida albicans the zinc cluster transcription factor Ppr1 controls this allantoin catabolism regulon. Intriguingly, in S. cerevisiae the Ppr1 ortholog binds the same DNA motif (CGG(N6)CCG) as in C. albicans, but serves as a regulator of pyrimidine biosynthesis. This transcription factor rewiring appears to have taken place at the same phylogenetic step as the formation of the rearranged DAL cluster. This transfer of the control of allantoin degradation from Ppr1 to Dal82, together with the repositioning of Ppr1 to the regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis, may have resulted from a switch to a metabolism that could exploit hypoxic conditions in the lineage leading to S. castellii and S. cerevisiae.

DESIGN
2 samples were analyzed. Cells were grown in YPD media at 30 degrees celcius to OD 0.8. Ppr1 gain of function mutant strain (SCPPR1GAD1A) vs wild type (SC5314) were hybridized, dye swap was done. One replica per array.
