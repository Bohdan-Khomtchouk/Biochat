TITLE
Expression analysis of Lactococcus lactis NIAI712 and its plasmid cured variant

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis

SUMMARY
L. lactis NIAI712 carries five different plasmids, including an 8.7-kb plasmid designated pAG6. In this study, genome-wide expression profiles of the pAG6-cured variant was compared to the wild-type strain.
