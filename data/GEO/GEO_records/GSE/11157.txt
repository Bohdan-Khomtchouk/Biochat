TITLE
Microarray analysis of rice plants fumigated with ozone

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
In this study, integrated transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics approaches were applied to investigate the molecular responses of O3 in the leaves of two-weeks old rice (cv. Nipponbare) seedlings exposed to 0.2 ppm O3 for a period of 24 h.  Based on the morphological alteration of O3-exposed rice leaves, transcript profiling of rice genes was performed in leaves exposed for 1, 12 and 24 h using rice DNA microarray chip, proteomics and metabolomics. This systematic survey showed that O3 triggers a chain reaction of altered gene, protein and metabolite expressions involved in multiple cellular processes in rice. Also investigated were the molecular responses in the leaves of two-weeks old rice (cv. Nipponbare) seedlings under continuous light and pure air (as a positive control for ozone exposure experiments) for a period of 24 h. Transcript profiling of rice genes was performed in leaves exposed for 1, 12 and 24 h using rice DNA microarray chip, proteomics and metabolomics. This systematic survey showed that continuous light and growth for 24 h also triggers a chain reaction of altered gene expressions involved in multiple cellular processes in rice, but different from those against ozone, in general.
