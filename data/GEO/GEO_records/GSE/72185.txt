TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of ZH11 and OsNF-YB1 RNAi plants Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that OsNF-YB1 is specifically expressed in aleurone layer of developing endosperm and suppressed expression of OsNF-YB1 results in a reduced grain-filling rate and small grains. Of the down-regulated genes, the enrichment of transmembrane transport and ATP biosynthetic process is consistent with the decreased grain-filling rate.

DESIGN
Aleurone layer mRNA profiles of 8 DAF ZH11 and OsNF-YB1 RNAi plants were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina Hiseq 2500 (Oryza sativa).
