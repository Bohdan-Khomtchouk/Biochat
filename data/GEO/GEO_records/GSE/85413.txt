TITLE
Liver miRNA profile of PiZ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic PiZ mice have been genetically engineered to express ATZ and have been a valuable experimental model for liver disease due to AAT polymerization. ATZ accumulates in these mice within the ER of hepatocytes in a nearly identical manner to livers of affected patients.   MiRNAs play a key role in a wide range of biological processes and regulate gene expression mainly at the translational level. To search for miRNA with altered expression in AAT liver disease, we analyzed by miRNA next generation sequencing (NGS) the livers of 6-week-old PiZ mice and strain-, age-, and gender-matched wild-type mouse controls. This analysis revealed 70 miRNAs with differential expressions.

DESIGN
Liver miRNA profiles of 6 week-old wild-type (WT) and PiZ mice were generated in dupicate by next generation sequencing
