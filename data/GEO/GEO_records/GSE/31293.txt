TITLE
MicroRNA Expression Data From Sham or BDL CD1 Mouse Liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Endothelial cells from normal or cirrhotic CD1 mice were screened for changes in microRNA expression using an Affymetrix array.

DESIGN
Total RNA (including microRNA) was extracted from whole liver tissue of CD1 mice, and microRNA expression was assessed using an Affymetrix array.  N=1 for each condition (cirrhosis induced by bile duct ligation, control).
