TITLE
Human whole blood samples: disease discordant twins and healthy controls.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to utilize disease discordant twins and a novel viral-human gene microarray assay using whole human genome microarray in combination with a set of over 6,000 probes, which correspond to the majority of known viral genesrole of shared viral infections and the activation of shared antiviral signaling pathways in the development of SAID

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, probands vs. unaffected twins vs healthy controls. Microarray replicates: two replicates for each gene probe
