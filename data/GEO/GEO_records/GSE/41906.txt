TITLE
Analysis of prebiotic carbohydrate utilization by Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04 using differential transcriptomics

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04

SUMMARY
The global transcriptome of the Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 was analyzed during exponential growth on 11 prebiotic carbohydrates and glucose to identify the specific gene cluster differentially upregulated in response to each carbohydrate.

DESIGN
Affymetrix hybridization experiments were performed to compare the differential transcriptional profiles of the B. lactis Bl-04 at the early-log (OD600nm 0.3-0.5) phase. 12 carbohydrates were tested with two technical replicates to each condition for a total of 24 hybridizations.
