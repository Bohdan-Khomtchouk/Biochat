TITLE
Expression data from mouse heart with and without GATA4 S105A mutation; with and without adrenergic stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Serine 105 phosphorylation of GATA4 is necessary for stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo. We used microarrays to detail global gene expression program alterations that arise in response to the ablation of the Gata4 S105 phosphorylation site in basal and adrenergic-stressed heart ventricles.

DESIGN
Wildtype and genetically engineered mice were subjected to control or pseudoephedrine treatment and heart ventricle RNAs were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Comparisons consisted of identifying treatment- and genotype-affected gene expression patterns.
