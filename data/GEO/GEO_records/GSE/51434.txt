TITLE
Zebrafish gonadal transcriptome analysis in response to heat

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
High temperature can induce masculinization in many fish species including zebrafish (Ospina-Alvarez & Piferrer PLoS One 3:e2837). Juvenile zebrafish exposed to high temperature during gonad differentiation period will result in male bias adult sex ratio. This experiment compared the zebrafish gonadal transcriptome between fishes that were exposed to high (36 oC) and control (28 oC) temperatures. Gene expression analysis using microarray were performed at juvenile (37 dpf) and adult (90 dpf) stages.

DESIGN
Juvenile zebrafish (18 dpf) were exposed to either high (36 oC) or control (28 oC) temperature treatment for 14 days. After the treatment both groups of fish were reared at 28 oC until 37 or 90 dpf. For analysis of the juvenile (37 dpf) 10 biological replicates (unknown sex) from each temperature treatment groups were compared. For the adult (90 dpf) female, 4 biological replicates from each temperature treatment groups were compared. For the adult (90 dpf) male, 10 biological replicates from each temperature treatment groups were compared.
