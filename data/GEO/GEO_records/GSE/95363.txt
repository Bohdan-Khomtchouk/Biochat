TITLE
A  Comparison of the Sexually Dimorphic Dexamethasone Transcriptome in Mouse Cerebral Cortical and Hypothalamic Embryonic Neural Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RNA-Seq analysis to identify the sexually dimorphic dexamethasone regulated gene expression profile in primary mouse embryonic cerebral cortical and hypothalamic neural progenitor/stem cells.

DESIGN
RNAseq on primary E14.5 mouse cerebral cortical and hypothalamic (hypo) neurosphere cultures. 8 conditions - Male Cortex Dex, Male Cortex Ethanol vehicle (EtOH), Female Cortex Dex, Female Cortex EtOH, Male Hypo Dex, Male Hypo EtOH, Female Hypo Dex and Female Hypo EtOH. There are 3 biological replicates for each condition and all the 24 samples were run on two lanes (technical duplicates).
