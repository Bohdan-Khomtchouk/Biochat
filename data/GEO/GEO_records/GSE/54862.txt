TITLE
affy_med_2013_05-Comparison between nodules of WT, NF737 and MS240 lines

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
affy_med_2013_05 - affy_med_2013_05 - The experiment is designed to detect transcriptome differences between wild type and two fix minus (NF737 and MS240) mutant lines.-Medicago truncatula WT (R108) and two mutant lines (NF737 and MS240/dnf2) were nodulated using WSM419 Sinorhizobium medicae symbiotic bacteria. Plants were grown in vitro on BN medium and the nodules harvested 14 days post inoculation (dpi). RNA was extracted using the plant RNA extraction kit from Thermo Scientific followed by a DNAse I treatment (TurbO DNAse I Ambion).

DESIGN
9 arrays - Medgene -1.0stv1; gene knock out

PLATFORM
GPL18240 [MedGene-1_0] Affymetrix Medicago Gene 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
