TITLE
Whole genome expression after  modulation of miR-30a expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A subset of breast cancer cells displays increased ability to self-renew and reproduce breast cancer heterogeneity (so called, breast tumour-initiating cells or BT-ICs). As microRNAs (miRNAs) control developmental programs in stem cells, BT-ICs may also rely on specific miRNA profiles for their sustained activity. We analyzed miRNA expression in a model of putative BT-ICs and found that miR-30 family regulates growth under “stemness” conditions. A target screening revealed that miR-30 family modulates the expression of apoptosis and proliferation-related genes. The importance of miR-30 in tumour progression and breast cancer stemness was demonstrated in vivo using a mouse mammary cancer model. This is the first analysis of target prediction in a whole family of microRNAs potentially involved in survival of putative BT-ICs.

DESIGN
Total RNA from cells transfected with Pre-miR-30 and KD-miR-30 family and control KD-miR-159 was extracted and reverse-transcribed and hybrized on HT12 Human bead chips

PLATFORM
