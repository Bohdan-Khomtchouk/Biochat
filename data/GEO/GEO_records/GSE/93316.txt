TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of mycobacteria in sputum samples of pulmonary tuberculosis patients

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Sputum expectorated by the pulmonary tuberculosis patients still remains a primary diagnostic specimen. The expression pattern of mycobacteria  in sputum will lead to an insight of bacterial adaptation at the most highly transmissible stage of infection and can also help in identifying newer diagnostic as well as drug targets. Further, the identification of crossreactive gene targets from the sputum samples of  other lung diseases will help to find the diagnostic candidates which will be highly specific to pulmonary tuberculosis.
