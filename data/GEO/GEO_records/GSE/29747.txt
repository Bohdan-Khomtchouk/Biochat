TITLE
Sporisorium reilianum Infection Changes Inflorescence and Branching Architectures of Maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
S. reilianum triggered loss of organ and meristem identity, and loss of meristem determinacy in male and female inflorescences and flowers. Microarray analysis showed that these developmental changes were accompanied with transcriptional regulation of genes proposed to regulate floral organ and meristem identity, and meristem determinacy in maize.

DESIGN
Infected ears were compared with mock infected ears. Each treatment had 3 biological replicates Disease: S. reilianum-infected ears with elongated kernel: Zm_Sr5_15_2_Leafy ears4weeks_I, Zm_Sr5_15_2_Leafy ears4weeks_II, Zm_Sr5_15_2_Leafy ears4weeks_III Disease: Mock infected ears at: Zm_Sr5_15_2_Mock4weeks_I, Zm_Sr5_15_2_Mock4weeks_II, Zm_Sr5_15_2_Mock4weeks_III biological replicate:  Zm_Sr5_15_2_Leafy ears4weeks_I, Zm_Sr5_15_2_Leafy ears4weeks_II, Zm_Sr5_15_2_Leafy ears4weeks_III biological replicate: Zm_Sr5_15_2_Mock4weeks_I, Zm_Sr5_15_2_Mock4weeks_II, Zm_Sr5_15_2_Mock4weeks_III
