TITLE
MicroRNA 19a replacement partially rescues fin and cardiac defects in zebrafish model of Holt Oram syndrome [array]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The regulative role of miRNAs in Holt-Oram Syndrome is investigated in a zebrafish model.

DESIGN
The zebrafish gene Tbx5a was silenced with antisense morpholino oligonucleotide MO-Tbx5a against the Tbx5a translational start site. 1,5 ng of MO-Tbx5a were co-injected in 1-cell stage embryos with 0,25 ng of miR-Ct (hts phenotype) or with 0,25 ng of miR-19a mimics (rescue phenotype). Embryos coinjected with 1,5ng of MO-CT and 0,25 ng of miR-Ct mimic were used as controls. At 24 hpf total RNA was extracted from 50 embryos for each thesis. The Zebrafish wild-type AB strain line was used.
