TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish during development and homeostasis

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Sequencing libraries were generated from total RNA samples following the mRNAseq protocol for the generation of single end (16-36 hpf, 5 day larvae, adult head and adult tail) or paired end (24 hpf) libraries (Illumina). Single end reads of 36 nucleotides and paired end reads (2 x 76 nucleotides) were obtained with a GAIIx (Illumina). Gene expression at the different stages/tissu was assessed by cufflinks and HTseq.

DESIGN
RNAseq on 5 differents samples:  24hpf embryos, pool of 16 hour to 36 hour embryos, 5 days old larvea, adult head and adult tail
