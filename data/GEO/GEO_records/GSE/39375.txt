TITLE
Polysome profiling in liver identifies dynamic regulation of endoplasmic reticulum translatome by obesity and fasting

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obesity-associated metabolic complications are generally considered to emerge from abnormalities in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, whereas the status of protein metabolism is not well studied. Here, we performed comparative polysome and associated transcriptional profiling analyses to study the dynamics and functional implications of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein synthesis in the mouse liver under conditions of obesity and nutrient deprivation.

DESIGN
lean wild type and genetically obese (ob/ob) mice with or without overnight fasting were sacrificed with their liver tissues removed.  ER-associated polysomes were purified and analyzed by microarray.
