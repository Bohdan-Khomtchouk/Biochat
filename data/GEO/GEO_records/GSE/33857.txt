TITLE
miRNA analysis is useful to diagnosis of liver disease, and evaluation of the grade of liver disease.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNAs have been found to circulate in the blood in a cell-free form; their potential as readily accessible disease markers is currently evaluated. Here, we investigated if miRNA expression profile in peripheral blood can be useful as disease parameter in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), chronic hepatitis B (CHB), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and normal liver (NL). RNA from exosome rich fraction was extracted from serum of patients with 64 CHC, 4 CHB, 7 NASH, and 12 healthy volunteers. miRNA expression profile was analyzed by microarray. Histological evaluation for the degree of inflammation and fibrosis in liver disease patients was also performed. miRNA expression profile according to the degree of liver fibrosis and inflammation was established. Diagnosis of fibrosis, inflammation by using miRNA expression pattern was shown with accuracy 67.2~89.1%, 67.2~76.5%, respectively. Moreover, miRNA expression profile in several liver diseases was also established. Classification among CHC, CHB, NASH, and NL was well tolerated and reproducible. The expression pattern of miRNA in peripheral blood showed not only the useful parameter of the grade and stage of liver disease, but also diagnostic tool for liver disease.
