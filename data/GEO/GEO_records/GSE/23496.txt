TITLE
Expression data from osteocytes in virgin,lactating and post lactation mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have previously shown that during lactation, osteocytes directly remodel their perilacunar and pericanalicular matrix, thereby mobilizing calcium and contributing to maternal bone loss. To identify genes potentially responsible for perilacunar remodeling, microarray analysis was performed on osteocytes from CD-1 virgin and lactating mice and mice sacrificed on day 7 post weaning. By comparing how gene expression changes in osteocytes among virgin, lactation and post lactation, the goal is to identify the genes osteocytes use to remodel their perilacunar matrix
