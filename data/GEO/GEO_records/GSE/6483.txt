The vacuolar-vesicular protein sorting (vps) factors are involved in vesicular trafficking in eukaryotic cells. The wobbler mouse is an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Motoneuron survival and spermiogenesis are severely compromised in the wobbler mouse. Keywords: dual colour hybridisation on cDNA microarrays, Wobbler, Vps54, spinal cord, testis
