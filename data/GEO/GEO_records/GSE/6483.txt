TITLE
Wobbler: Spinal cord and testis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The vacuolar-vesicular protein sorting (vps) factors are involved in vesicular trafficking in eukaryotic cells. The wobbler mouse is an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Motoneuron survival and spermiogenesis are severely compromised in the wobbler mouse. Keywords: dual colour hybridisation on cDNA microarrays, Wobbler, Vps54, spinal cord, testis

DESIGN
DNA chip technology has been exploited for RNA expression profiling analyses. Close to genome-wide microarrays were used for identification of changes in gene expression levels in spinal cord and testis of 10 wr/wr mice. Spinal cord: Pooled RNA of 4 individual mutant mice were hybridised in repetitions against a pool of 10 reference animals. In total 10 chip hybridisations were performed including 50% dye swap experiments. Testis: Individual mutant mice were hybridised in repetitions against a pool of 10 reference animals. In total 40 chip hybridisations were performed including 50% dye swap experiments.

PLATFORM
