TITLE
ChIP-chip analysis of CspC binding in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
We performed Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and microarray hybridization analysis of CspC binding in Salmonella Typhimurium strain SL1344 which has been genetically engineered to express a 3xFLAG tagged CspC protein.

DESIGN
Chromatin samples were prepared from SL1344 CspC 3xFLAG grown to exponential phase (OD600nm = 0.2). CspC FLAG ChIP and mock normal mouse IgG ChIP reactions were carried out. The purified ChIP DNA samples were hybridized to SL1344 tiling microarrays.
