TITLE
Gene expression data from sorted IL-7Rhi/lo effector CD8 T cells on day 6/7 after LCMV armstrong infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
At the peak of the CD8 T cell response to acture viral and bacterial infections, expression of the Interleukin-7 Receptor (IL-7R) marks Memory Precursor Effector CD8 T Cells (MPECs) from other Short-Lived Effector CD8 T cells (SLECs), which are IL-7Rlo. This study was designed to determine the gene expression differences between these two subsets of effector CD8 T cells. Keywords: expression comparison
