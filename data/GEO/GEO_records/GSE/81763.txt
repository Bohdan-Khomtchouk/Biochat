TITLE
Genome wide RNAi screen for regulators of mRNAs silenced in African trypanosome slender forms and expressed in stumpy forms

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma brucei

SUMMARY
Bloodstream forms of T brucei s427 2T1 T7  p’5neo5’-ESAG9 3’UTR (long form) bloodstream forms were grown in vitro. They contained the NeoR gene under the control of the ESAG9 gene 3'UTR. Selection was based on increased resistance to G418 through the silencing of an ESAG9 repressor, leading to increased neoR expression

DESIGN
RNA library insert amplicons were analysed by ion torrent sequence analysis of the selected populations
