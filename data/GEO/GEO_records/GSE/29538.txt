TITLE
Expression data of small intestine crypts and villi from mice with nutritional and genetic risk factors for intestinal tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nutritional and genetic risk factors for intestinal tumors are additive on mouse tumor phenotypes, demonstrating that diet and genetic factors impact risk by distinct combinatorial mechanisms. We analyzed expression profiles of small intestine crypts and villi from mice with nutritional and genetic risk factors. The results advanced our understanding of the mechanistic roles played by major risk factors in the pathogenesis of intestinal tumors.
