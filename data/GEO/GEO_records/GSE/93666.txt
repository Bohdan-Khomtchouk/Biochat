TITLE
Expression data from human  melanoma cell lines with or without GNAQ/11 mutation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray to compare global gene expression profiles between 5 GNAQ/11 mutant uveal melanoma cell lines (GNAQ mutant: 92-1, omm1.3, mel270; GNA11 mutant: omm-gn11 and upmd-1) and 5 GNAQ/11 wild type melanoma cell lines(sk-mel-2, mm415, mm485, sk-mel-5 and mum2c). Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular tumor that mainly metastasizes to the liver in about 50% patients. Over 80% of UMs harbor GNAQ or GNA11 activating mutation. Currently there is no effective treatment available for UM patients. Results provide insights into downstream signaling of oncogenic GNAQ/11 and identification of therapeutic targets in UM.

DESIGN
We extracted total RNAs from human melanoma cell lines with or without GNAQ/11 mutation. Purified RNAs were performed for amplification, fragmentation and biotin-labeling. The labeled cDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
