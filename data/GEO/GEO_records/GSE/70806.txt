TITLE
Molecular Response of Chorioretinal Endothelial Cells to Complement Injury: Implications for Macular Degeneration

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common, blinding disease of the elderly in which macular photoreceptor cells, retinal pigment epithelium, and choriocapillaris endothelial cells ultimately degenerate. Recent studies have found that degeneration of the choriocapillaris occurs early in this disease and that this endothelial cell dropout is concomitant with increased deposition of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) at the choroidal endothelium. However, the impact of MAC injury to choroidal endothelial cells is poorly understood. To model this event in vitro, and to study the downstream consequences of MAC injury, endothelial cells were exposed to complement from human serum, compared to heat inactivated serum which lacks complement components. Cells exposed to complement components in human serum showed increased labeling with antibodies directed against the MAC, time and dose dependent cell death as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase assay, and increased permeability. RNA-Seq analysis following complement injury revealed increased expression of genes associated with angiogenesis including matrix metalloproteases (MMPs)  3 and 9, and VEGF-A. The MAC-induced increase in MMP9 RNA expression was validated using C5 depleted serum compared to C5 reconstitited serum. Increased levels of  MMP9  were also determined using Western blot and zymography. These data suggest that, in addition to cell lysis, complement attack on choroidal endothelial cells promotes an angiogenic phenotype in surviving cells.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq of RF/6A (cultured choroidal endothelial cells from Rhesus macaque) treated with either 50% heat-inactivated human serum ([CONTROL], n=3) or 50% normal human serum (active complement membrane attack complex [MAC], n=3)
