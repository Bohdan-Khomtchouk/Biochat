TITLE
Positional proteomics reveals differences in N-terminal proteoform stability

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the impact of alternative translation initiation on a proteome, we performed the first study on protein turnover using positional proteomics and ribosome profiling to distinguish between N-terminal proteoforms of individual genes. Overall, we monitored the stability of 1,941 human N-terminal proteoforms, including 147 N-terminal proteoform pairs that originate from alternative translation initiation, alternative splicing or incomplete processing of the initiator methionine.

DESIGN
Ribosome profiling of lactimidomycin and cycloheximide treated human Jurkat T-lymphocytes
