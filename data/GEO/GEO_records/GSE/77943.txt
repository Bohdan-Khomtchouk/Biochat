TITLE
Expression data from an outbred model for type 2 diabetes development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the development mechanisms of type 2 diabetes, we examined multi-tissues' expression profiles of outbred mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) or regular chow at week 1, 9, and 18 and performed a novel dual eigen-analysis.

DESIGN
We initiated a project on the development process of T2D using a mouse model. Unlike the knockout approach commonly seen in other literatures, we took an outbred model to mimick the natural human population. The mice of 5-week-old were fed with regular chow (RC) or a high fat diet (HFD). At week 1, week 9 and week 18, we collected tissue samples from both diet groups and measured their mRNA abundances of the adipose, the liver and the pancreas respectively using the Affymetrix Mouse430-2.0 Array.
