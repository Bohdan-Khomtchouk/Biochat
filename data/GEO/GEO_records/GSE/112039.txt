TITLE
Gene expression in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy and healthy cultured cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a vision impairing pathology affecting the endothelial cells of the cornea. To better understand the disease, we developed a method to cultivate FECD cells isolated from surgical specimens. Using gene profiling, we compared the mRNA profiles of passage 2 FECD cells with passage 2 non-pathological corneal endothelial cells isolated from eye bank donor corneas.

DESIGN
Six Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy and six healthy eye bank corneal endothelial cells at passage 2 are analyzed by gene profiling
