TITLE
Expression data of yeast with and without ribosomal protein Rpl12ap or Rpl12bp

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Ribosomal protein Rpl12p is encoded by duplicated genes RPL12A and RPL12B.  The gene products have identical primary protein sequence but reportedly cells harboring either Rpl12ap or Rpl12bp exhibit subtle functional differences. We use microarrays to screen for genes which might express differently in the presence of Rpl12ap or Rpl12bp.
