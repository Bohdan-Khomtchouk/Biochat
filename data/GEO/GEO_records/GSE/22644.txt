TITLE
Expression data of yeast with and without ribosomal protein Rpl12ap or Rpl12bp

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Ribosomal protein Rpl12p is encoded by duplicated genes RPL12A and RPL12B.  The gene products have identical primary protein sequence but reportedly cells harboring either Rpl12ap or Rpl12bp exhibit subtle functional differences. We use microarrays to screen for genes which might express differently in the presence of Rpl12ap or Rpl12bp.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from W303 (wild type control), 6EA1 (cells with both RPL12A and RPL12B deletion), and 6EA1 transformed with high copy number plasmids carrying either RPL12A or RPL12B. These samples were hybridized to Affymetric microarrays, and up- or down-regulated genes were identified.
