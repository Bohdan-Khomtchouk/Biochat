TITLE
Transcriptoma comparison of mantle cell lymphoma of c-myc-3'RR/Cdk4R24C mice and c-myc-3'RR/p53+/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B cell malignancy characterized by a monoclonal proliferation of lymphocytes with co-expression of CD5, CD43 but not CD23. We have developed two murine models of MCL-like lymphoma.  Breeding Cdk4R24C mice (a knock-in strain that express a Cdk4 protein resistant to inhibition by p16INK4a and other INK4 family members) with c-myc-3’RR transgenic mice (prone to develop aggressive Burkitt lymphoma-like lymphoma) leads in c-myc/Cdk4R24C mice to development of clonal blastoid MCL-like lymphoma. Breeding p53+/- mice with c-myc-3’RR transgenic mice lead to the development of several mature B cell lymphomas including MCL. In this study we compare MCL transcriptomas of c-myc-3'RR/Cdk4R24C mice and c-myc-3'RR/p53+/- mice.

DESIGN
B splenocytes from 2 c-myc/Cdk4R24C lymphoma mice and 2  c-myc-3'RR/p53+/- mice were investigated
