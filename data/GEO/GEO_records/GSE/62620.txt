TITLE
Expression study between dental pulp cells from TRPC6-mut individual and control individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As TRPC6 channel induces CREB-mediated trancription, Dental pulp cells from TRPC6-mut patient and from 6 controls were analyzed in order to verify if the disruption of TRPC6 leads to transcriptional changes.

DESIGN
Cells were grown until reach 80-90% of confluency in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, TX), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids and maintained under standard conditions (37Â°C, 5% CO2). RNAs samples were extracted from cells in passage 5 to 7.
