TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of pancreatic tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis in the PDAC-CAM model

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were grafted on the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Human and chicken GeneChips were used simultaneously to study gene regulation during PDAC cell invasion.

DESIGN
Pooled RNA from T1 (n=3) and T6 (n=3) CAMs were extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). T6 was compared to T1 on human GeneChips and in parallel, on chicken GeneChips.
