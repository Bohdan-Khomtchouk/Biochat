TITLE
RNA-SEQ E18.5 Ret-positive (EGFP-labeled) Nav1.8 dorsal root ganglia neurons.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this set is to build expression data using FACS isolated Ret-positiveNaV1.8 cells harvested from RetFloxedEGFP;NaV1.8Cre embryos (embryonic day E18.5 male or female). These can be used as a time point in comparative analysis of ontogeny of genes expressed at various developmental time points in Ret nociceptors.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from E18.5 FACS isolated dorsal root ganglia dissected from RetFloxedEGFP:NaV1.8Cre mice (EGFP conditionally expressed in Ret population that express Cre from the NaV1.8 locus) and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. Refer to protocols on the GUDMAP website under Jain.
