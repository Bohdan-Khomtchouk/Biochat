TITLE
An Integrated Fingerprinting platform for the study of Chinese Medicineal Herb Cordyceps sinensis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The traditional Chinese medical formulas have been in clinical use for thousands of years and their therapeutic effects were documented in ancient Chinese pharmacopoeias. High-throughput biological analysis on cell line models has been demonstrated as a useful alternative to elucidate intricate molecular mechanisms associated with drug actions in a number of pharmacogenomic studies. This microarray study is aimed to provide a reliable and feasible means to explore the healing philosophy of Chinese herbalism. Keywords: Pharmacogenetics

DESIGN
Loop-designed microarray experiments were performed in our study. Eight samples are arranges as a double loop, with eight microarray slides for each loop. Four technical replicates were performed for each sample and the dye assignments were balanced. One sample was duplicated as an internal control. This set of loop-designed microarray experiment contains a control untreated sample and seven herbal drug-treated samples that include a repeated sample as internal control.
