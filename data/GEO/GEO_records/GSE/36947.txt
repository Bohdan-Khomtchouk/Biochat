TITLE
Elevating Sox2 levels deleteriously affects the growth of glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Induction of the transcription factor Sox2 from a doxycycline-inducible promoter in iSox2-DAOY medulloblastoma cells. Affymetrix microarrays were used to characterize the gene expression profile of iSox2-DAOY cells in the absence and presence of doxycycline.

DESIGN
Human DAOY medulloblastoma cells were engineered to express epitope tagged Sox2 under the control of a doxycycline inducible promoter, to produce iSox2-DAOY cells. iSox2-DAOY cells were FACS sorted into CD133 low and high populations. The CD133 low population was cultured in the absence and presence of 0.5 Âµg/mL doxycycline for 24 hours. RNA was extracted from cells cultured without and with doxycycline, and was used for microarray analysis.
