TITLE
whole lungs: TAZ-deficient mice and their littermates

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
TAZ-deficient mice have the abnormalities in the lung development. We expect the comparison of the gene expression profiles of TAZ-deficient and wild-type lungs would reveal the underlying mechanisms. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Four total RNA samples from E15.5 lungs were mixed for each group.
