TITLE
xray induced expression profile change in sensitive vs resistant embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
stage 9-11 embryos are sensitive to x-ray induced cell death, while stage 13-15 embryos are highly resistant.  The gene expression changes induced by x-ray in sensitve vs resistant embryos appear to be qualitatively different. Keywords: repeat sample
