TITLE
Comparison between mRNAs of how germ-line clones embryos and WT embryos at 3-5 h AEL

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Mutant embryos lacking maternal and zygotic HOW exhibit defects in mesoderm development. How is an RNA binding protein that regulates the levels of mRNAs by controling RNA metabolism. To gain an insight as to the profile of mRNAs regulated by HOW during early mesoderm development we analyzed the array of mRNAs whose levels are altered in the how mutant embryos. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Embryos lacking both maternal and zygoic HOW were selected using a GFP balancer. The mRNA of 5 collections of 3-5 hrs old WT or how mutant embryos were pooled and used for each microarray experiment. Two microarray experiments were performed from independent samples.
