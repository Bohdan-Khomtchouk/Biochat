TITLE
Cell autonomous roles for AP-2alpha in lens vesicle separation and maintenance of the lens epithelial cell phenotype.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This is a comparative microarray analysis of LE-AP-2a mutants vs. wild-type P0 littermate lenses. This analysis revealed differential gene expression of 415 mRNAs, including reduced expression of genes important for maintaining lens epithelial cell phenotype, such as E-cadherin. Keywords: Differential gene expression

DESIGN
Biological triplicates of mouse lenses were analyzed (three wild-type lens samples and three Le-AP-2 mutant samples)
