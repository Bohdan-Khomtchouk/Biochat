SUMMARY
Analysis of cervical carcinomas and cervical cell lines privides insight into gene expression profiling in mexican women

DESIGN
The invasive carcinomas samples were squamous cell carcinomas. Normal cervix tissues were from women who underwent hysterectomy for non-malignant condition or for non-cervical cancer were included. All samples were taken after informed consent from the patients and were confirmed by phatology. The cervical cell lines included in this study were: Casky, SiHa, Hela, Inbl, CaLo, Rova, MS-751, Vipa, C-4 I, C-33A and keratinocyte cell line Hacat. These cell line were cultured in Dulbecco´s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco Life Technologies Carlsbad, CA USA), suplemented with 10% Fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco) at 37°C and 5% CO2. All cells were cultured at 70-80% of confluence.
