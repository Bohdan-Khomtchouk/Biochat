TITLE
Complete Haplotype Phasing of the MHC and KIR Loci with Targeted HaploSeq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rapid advances in biochemical technologies have enabled several strategies for typing candidate HLA alleles, but linking them into a single MHC haplotype structure remains challenging. Here we have developed a multi-loci haplotype phasing technique and demonstrate its utility towards phasing of MHC and KIR loci in human samples. We accurately (~99%) reconstruct the complete haplotypes for over 90% of sequence variants spanning the 4-megabase region of these two loci. By haplotyping a majority of coding and non-coding alleles at the MHC and KIR loci in a single assay, this method has the potential to assist transplantation matching and facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of human immunity and disease.

DESIGN
Complete haplotype phasing of 2 loci (MHC and KIR) in 1 human cell line.
