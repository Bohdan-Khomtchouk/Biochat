TITLE
Urinary miRNA biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Currently, the majority of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) present with locally invasive and/or metastatic disease, resulting in five-year survival of less than 5%. The development of an early diagnostic test is, therefore, expected to significantly impact the patientâ€™s prognosis. In this feasibility study, we demonstrate for the first time the utility of miRNA biomarkers for non-invasive, early detection of PDAC in urine specimens.
