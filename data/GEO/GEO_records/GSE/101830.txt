TITLE
overexpression of a newly truncated FMRP isoform with 297 amino acid

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA microarray was used to analyze the differentialy expressed genes between stably transfected HEK293T cells of the overexpression of the new FMRP isoform with 297 amino acid and stably transfected HEK293T cells of empty lentiviral vector. we constructed the lentiviral vector of exons 1-9 together with the sequence of 140bp fragment of human FMR1 gene to overexpress the truncated FMRP with 297 amino acid, and transfected cells with the void plasmid pLEX-MCS were regarded as control group.

DESIGN
stably transfected HEK293T cells of empty lentiviral vector and the overexpression of the new FMRP isoform were for RNA extraction and hybirdization on Affymetrix microarrays.
