TITLE
Deep-sequencing of endogenous microRNAs from human endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia and normoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Umbelical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) were cultured in vitro and exposed to 1% oxygen or normoxia for 24 hours. Then, small RNA libraries were prepared and sequenced using sequencing-by-ligation technique (Solid3 Plus Sequencer platform). Alignment versus miRBase v14.0 identified > 400 different microRNA/microRNA* species expressed in HUVEC. A complex repertoire of isomiR was also observed. For novel miRNA discovery, reads were mapped against the human genome. We identified 511 candidate new microRNAs and we validated 18 of them with independent techniques.
