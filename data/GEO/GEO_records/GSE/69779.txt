TITLE
RNA-seq profiling of cortical collecting ducts in rats undergoing vasopressin escape

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNAs in cortical collecting ducts microdissected from rats undergoing vasopressin escape.

DESIGN
Rats were given subcutaneous DDAVP for 5 days via subcutaneous osmotic minipumps. Rats in treatment group (n=3-4) were given high water load (50 mL/day) and rats in control group were given normal water load (25 mL/day). After 1, 2, and 4 days, rats were sacrificed and cortical collecting ducts were microdissected and collected from collagenase-digested left kidney for RNA-seq profiling of mRNAs.
