TITLE
To evaluate the change in gene expression profile of Sertoli cells after busulphan treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to evaluate whether chemoablative busulphan treatment alters the expression profile of Sertoli cells in testis, adult male Swiss mice were treated intraperitoneally with 25mg/Kg body weight of busulphan. 1 month post busulphan treatment, the isolated Sertoli cells were evaluated for gene expression profile and compared to expression profile of Sertoli cells from age matched normal adult Swiss mice.

DESIGN
Gene expression of isolated Sertoli cells 1 month after busulphan treatment from adult male Swiss mice

PLATFORM
GPL14152 Genotypic Technology designed " Custom Agilent Mus Musculus 8x15k GE Microarray (AMADID-016270) "
