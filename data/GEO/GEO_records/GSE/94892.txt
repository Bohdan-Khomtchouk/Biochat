TITLE
Transcriptome analysis for identification of novel biomarker for disease progression in Dengue patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the early transcriptional signature in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a large number of clinically and virologically well characterized patients with mild and severs dengue infection and establishes their correlation with disease progression

DESIGN
mRNA profiling of Dengue fever(DF), Dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF], Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and Disease control.
