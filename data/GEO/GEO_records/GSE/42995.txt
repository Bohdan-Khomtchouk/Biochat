TITLE
V. salmonicida wild type strain LFI1238 and isogenic DlitR mutant grown as statical biofilm in SWT medium

ORGANISM
Aliivibrio salmonicida

SUMMARY
Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell density regulated communication system that bacteria use to coordinate activities, including biofilm formation, involved in colonization and pathogenesis. We have previously shown that inactivation of the QS master regulator LitR attenuates the Vibrio (Allivibrio) salmonicida strain LFI1238 in a fish model. In this work we show that LFI1238 as well as a panel of naturally occurring V. salmonicidia strains are poor biofilm producers. Inactivation of litR strongly enhances medium and temperature dependent adhesion, rugose colony morphology and biofilm formation. Chemical treatment and scanning electron microscopy of the biofilm identified an extracellular matrix consisting mainly of protein filaments and polysaccharides. Further, microarray analysis of planktonic and biofilm cells identified a number of genes regulated by LitR, and among these were homologues of the Vibrio fischeri symbiosis polysaccharide (syp) genes. Disruption of syp alleviated the different phenotypes regulated by LitR in V. salmonicida. Hence, LitR is a repressor of syp expression that is necessary for rugose colony morphology, adhesion and biofilm formation, three phenotypes of the DlitR mutant that are expressed at temperatures below 12ÂºC. The DlitR mutant mimics low cell density behavior suggesting that these phenotypes are important during the initial steps of colonization. Although the syp operon in V. salmonicida shows identical gene synteny to the one in the squid symbiont V. fischeri, its regulation is probably more related to vibrio polysaccharide (vps) expression in the human pathogenic Vibrio cholera which is controlled by the LitR homologue HapR.
