TITLE
TET2 loss-of-function mutations associate with a DNA hypermethylation signature in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DNA methylation)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of patient samples with TET2 mutations and Wild type TET2 status . The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450_15017482_v.1.1 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 482,421  CpGs in fresh frozen lymphoma  samples. Samples include 19 TET2 wild type and 12 TET2 mutant samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 31 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HM450K Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
