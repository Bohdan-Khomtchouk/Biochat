TITLE
Tumor-independent host gene expression changes induced by VEGFR2 antibody

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis was used to identify tumor-independent changes after treatment with mouse VEGFR2 neutralizing antibody.

DESIGN
8 week old Balb/c mice were treated for 7 days with anti-VEGFR2 clone DC101 (800ug/mouse every 3 days). Lung tissue was collected and total RNA was isolated for whole genome expression analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL21581 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip (Gene version)
