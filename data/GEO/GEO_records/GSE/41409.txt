TITLE
Sense and antisense exon profiling across human, mouse, and rat

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of sense and antisense transcripts of 10 tissues each from human, mouse, and rat. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
We profiled the sense and antisense transcription level of 10 tissues each from human, mouse, and rat. Only Affymetrix core probesets were used. Two technical replicates per sample.
