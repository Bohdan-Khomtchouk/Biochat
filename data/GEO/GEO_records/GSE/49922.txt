TITLE
Primary term human trophoblasts exposed to ionizing irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary term human trophoblasts were derived from placentas after a healthy pregnancy, and exposed to ionizing irradiation (vs sham) in vitro

DESIGN
Primary human trophoblasts were irradiated 24 h after initial plating, defined as time zero. Cells were irradiated at 10 Gy using a Clinac 600C (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) with a 6 MV photon beam and a dose rate of 250 cGy/min. The flasks containing the cells were placed on 1.5 cm of bolus (a tissue equivalent material) since the maximum irradiation depth was 1.5 cm, which corresponded to the plated cell layer. Cells were analyzed 4, 8, and 24 h after irradiation or sham.
