TITLE
RNA profiling of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 exposed to acrylic acid

ORGANISM
Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002

SUMMARY
Cyanobacteria are valuable organisms for studying the physiology of photosynthesis and carbon fixation as well as metabolic engineering for the production of fuels and chemicals. This work describes a novel counter selection method for the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 based on organic acid toxicity. The organic acids acrylate, 3-hydroxypropionate, and propionate were shown to be inhibitory towards PCC 7002 and other cyanobacteria at low concentrations. Inhibition was overcome by a loss of function mutation in the gene acsA. Loss of AcsA function was used as a basis for an acrylate counter selection method.  DNA fragments of interest were inserted into the acsA locus and strains harboring the insertion were isolated on selective medium containing acrylate. This methodology was also used to introduce DNA fragments into a pseudogene, glpK. Application of this method will allow for more advanced genetics and engineering studies in PCC 7002 including the construction of markerless gene deletions and insertions. The acrylate counter-selection could be applied to other cyanobacterial species where AcsA activity confers acrylate sensitivity (e.g. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803).

DESIGN
Cultures were grown in medium modified with 5mM acrylic acid at pH 8 and compared to cultures grown in unmodified medium. Samples were processed in duplicate.
