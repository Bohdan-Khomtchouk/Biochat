TITLE
Expression data from stimulated or unstimulated human CD4+ T cells incubated with edelfosine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cytotoxic drug edelfosine is a synthetic analog of 2-lysophosphatidylcholine. Edelfosine is incorporated by highly proliferating cells, e.g. activated immune cells. It is unknown if the described mechanisms for edelfosine action attained by in vitro approaches exclusively contribute to the observed EAE-amelioration or if edelfosine may exert additional, probably more general and possibly immunoablative effects within the setting of autoimmunity. We used microarray analysis in order to confirm proposed mechanisms of edelfosine action, but also to discover novel effects of edelfosine in the context of immune cells.

DESIGN
For gene-expression analysis enriched CD4+ T cells obtained from Buffy Coats were plated at 200,000 cells/well in 96-well plates. Cells were cultured for 30 h in X-Vivo 15 medium or X-Vivo 15 medium supplemented with 3.3 µg/ml edelfosine, 10 µg/ml edelfosine, bead particles coated with antibodies against CD2, CD3, and CD28 (Miltenyi), or 3.3 µg/ml edelfosine in combination with bead particles coated with antibodies against CD2, CD3 and CD28, respectively.
