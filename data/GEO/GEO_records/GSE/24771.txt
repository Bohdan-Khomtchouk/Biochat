TITLE
Heterochronic Evolution Reveals Modular Timing Changes in Budding Yeast Transcriptomes (Natural Strain Timecourse)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Saccharomyces paradoxus

SUMMARY
Multi-genome, time series transcriptome measurements across the budding yeast cell cycle 378 genome-wide microarray measurements, 18 timepoints, nine strains of S. cerevisiae and one strain of S. paradoxus

DESIGN
Dye-swap technical replication at each strain,timepoint pair in a common reference design
