TITLE
Salmonella Typhimurium: control vs. Deoxynivalenol (DON) treatment

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of log and stationary phase S. Typhimurium, comparing untreated controls with Deoxynivalenol treated samples.

DESIGN
Each array used labelled cDNA against a common genomic DNA reference. Triplicate arrays were carried out for each of the 4 conditions: untreated log phase, untreated stationary phase, DON treated log phase and DON treated stationary phase

PLATFORM
GPL13609 SALSA 2 IFR Salmonella 8K Arrays
