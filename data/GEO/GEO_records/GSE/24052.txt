TITLE
Expression data in whole Arabidopsis seedlings after treatment with the herbicide dicamba

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Dicamba is an auxin-like herbicide that can stimulate the production of ethylene and ABA biosynthesis.  The subsequent stomatal closure and build-up of reactive oxygen species is hypothesized to contribute to plant death. In order to further understand the herbicide dicamba's mode of action at the molecular level, we used microarrays to dissect global gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings 10 hrs after dicamba treatment.

DESIGN
4 day old Arabidopsis seedlings (a Columbia line containing a -800GSTF8::LUC reporter) were flooded with water or 7mM dicamba  for 40 minutes before the treatment was poured off.  Ten hours after the start of the treatment, whole seedlings were collected
