TITLE
Response to elevated pCO2 in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus larvae

ORGANISM
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) larvae cultured under three different seawater CO2 concentrations 400, 800, 1200 µatm. The goal was to determine the effects of CO2, an important climate change variable, on global gene expression

DESIGN
Larvae were cultured under three different seawater CO2 concentrations 400, 800, 1200 µatm, each with four replicate cultures, and sampled at two developmental stages (gastrula and pluteus)

PLATFORM
GPL15767 Agilent-033937 Strongylocentrotus purpuratus 105K v2 (Probe version)
