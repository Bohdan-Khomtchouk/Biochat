TITLE
The In Vitro Interaction of Aspergillus fumigatus and Human immature Dendritic Cells

ORGANISM
Aspergillus fumigatus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DC) play an important role in host immunity by acting as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems.  They are antigen presenting cells that obtain microbial antigens by direct phagocytosis of the microbe or by cross presentation of antigens taken up from the surrounding environment.  Monocyte derived DC were co-cultured with resting conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus at an MOI of 5 for 12 hours, cells were sampled every three hours.  RNA was extracted from both organisms at each time point and hybridised to micro-arrays, whole genome Aspergillus fumigatus array (JCVI) and a custom immune array for DC.      The genes up-regulated by DC in the presence of A. fumigatus indicated that the cells were producing a pro-inflammatory response.  There was an increase in IL8 expression over time confirming its association with germ tube emergence.  Over the course of the experiment there was increased expression of 210 genes by A. fumigatus, GO analysis indicated significant up-regulation of the following biological processes: fermentation, drug transport, pathogenesis, transport, tyrosine catabolism and response to oxidative stress.  There were two clusters of temporally regulated genes showing up regulation before 6hr and after 6 hrs.  This may be related to the increased mortality exhibited in DC at 6h.  The initial analysis of A. fumigatus gene expression in response to DC shows similarity to its response to neutrophils with an up-regulation in catabolism and response to oxidative stress.

DESIGN
A. fumigatus AF293 cells were grown in the presence and absence of human dendritic cells for 0h - 12h.  Hybridizations were performed with biological replicates and flip-dye pairs.
