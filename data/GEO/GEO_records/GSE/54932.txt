TITLE
Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type(wt) and Setd2 knockout(ko) mESCs Transcriptomes [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: This study aimed at exploring the deregulated genes in setd2 knockout mESCs compared with wt, more particularly to find the mechanism controlled by setd2,which was required for endoderm differentiation. Methods: Setd2 wt and ko mESCs were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina GAIIx. Using Avadis NGS (version:1.3) software to analyze the sequence reads that passed quality filter to acquire the expression level of all genes. qRTâ€“PCR validation was performed usingSYBR Green assays. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 80 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 17,827 transcripts in the sted2 wt and ko mESCs. About 2,516 genes were deregulated in setd2 ko mESCs, more than 10 genes were validated using qRT-PCR. Conclusions: Through RNA-seq,we noticed that a subset of genes that related to MAPK signaling pathways were down-regulated in ko mESCs. This provided a bridge to connect setd2 and mESCs endoderm differentiation.

DESIGN
