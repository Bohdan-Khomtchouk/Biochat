TITLE
miRNA-seq of lung in two kinds of pig breeds after PCV2 injection

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in pigs has devastated the swine industry since the 1990s. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the primary cause of this disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in regulating gene expression, especially at the post-transcription level. The expression profiles of miRNAs have been reported in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, porcine parvovirus, and other pig diseases; however, the miRNA expression profiles in pigs infected with PCV2 have not been reported so far. The Laiwu pig (a Chinese indigenous pig breed) has different meat quality, adipogenesis, and disease-resistance from western commercial pig breeds. In this study, four small RNA libraries were constructed from the lung tissue of uninfected and infected Laiwu and Yorkshire/Landrace crossbred (YL) pigs. High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics were used to determine the abundance and differential expression of miRNAs in the four libraries

DESIGN
miRNA-seq of four groups as PCV2 infected Laiwu pig (Lw-i), uninfected Laiwu pig (Lw-un), infected western commercial (YL-i) and uninfected western commercial pigs (YL-un)

PLATFORM
GPL11429 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Sus scrofa)
