TITLE
Human CEM Cells: Control vs. 2h or 4.5h Cluvenone Treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human CEM cells comparing control untreated CEM cells with either 2h or 4.5h cluvenone-treated CEM cells.

DESIGN
Two-timepoint experiment, CEM vs. Cluvenone-Treated CEM (2h and 4.5h). Biological replicates: 4 control, 4 2h-treated, 4 4.5h-treated, independently grown and harvested. Pooled controls. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
