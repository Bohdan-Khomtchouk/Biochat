ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra04-07_pgpr - profiling of the pgpr induced systemic resistance (isr) - Experiment 1 : Which genes are up- or down-regulated in Arabidopsis thaliana cultivated in vitro with increased lateral root development in response to Phyllobacterium STM196 inoculation. Experiment 2 : Which genes are up- or down-regulated during the ISR triggered by a rhizobacteria, in comparison with those affected by a pathogenic interaction. Experiment 3 : which genes are specifically induced or repressed in Arabidopsis thaliana by inoculation of the soil with a PGPR vs a bacteria that has the ability to trigger nodule formation in a Legume.  - Seeds were sawn on 0.8% (W/V) agar mineral medium (see below). 4 days after storage in the dark at 4degreeC, seedling were cultivated 6 days in a growth chamber (16 h daily, 20-22degreeC) and then transferred on soil inoculated or not with 107 cfu.g-1 of Bradyrhizobium strain ORS278. Three weeks later, 3 leaves per plant were infiltrated with a suspension of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (2.105 cfu.ml-1) or with MgSO4 10 mM alone for control plants. Infiltrated leaves were collected 24h later. Keywords: normal vs rnai mutant comparaison,treated vs untreated comparison
