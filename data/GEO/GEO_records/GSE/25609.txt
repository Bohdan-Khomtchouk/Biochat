TITLE
Plasma microRNA profiling by microarray elucidates several candidate biomarkers for colorectal cancer screening

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules which function as negative gene regulators. The tissue expression profile of miRNAs shows great promise as a novel biomarker for diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. In addition, some recent reports have demonstrated that are present in human serum and plasma which could make them an ideal non-invasive biomarker for diagnosis of cancer. The aim of this study is to analyze the value/efficacy of the expression profile of plasma miRNAs in differentiating between patients with advanced adenomas and CRC and healthy individuals.

DESIGN
The microRNA profiling study comprises serum plasmas from 20 Control, 21 colorectal cancer,20 advanced adenomas.The study also include some samples from patients after treatment.
