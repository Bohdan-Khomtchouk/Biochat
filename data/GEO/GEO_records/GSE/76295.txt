TITLE
Isolation and comparative analysis of mesenchymal stem cells from human umbilical cord II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A non-controversial and non-invasive source of adult stem cells (ASCs), particularly hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is human umbilical cord blood.  HSCs derived from cord blood have been used for treating leukemia and other blood disorders for the last 30 years.  While the presence of MSCs in cord blood is limited, umbilical cord has been found to be promising source of MSCs.  However, the cord is an anatomically complex organ and potential isolation of MSCs from its various parts has not been fully explored. In this study we dissected the cord into cord placenta junction (CPJ), cord tissue (CT), and Whartonâ€™s jelly (WJ) and isolated stem cells.  These cells exhibited fibroid morphology, expressed MSC-specific markers including CD90, CD73, CD105, CD44, and CD29 and differentiated into chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic lineages.   In addition, they all expressed pluripotency genes, OCT4, Nanog, Sox2 and KLF4 but expression of these markers was highest in CPJ followed by WJ and CT. CPJ-MSCs also had higher rate of proliferation compared to WJ- and CT-MSCs.  Proliferation of WJ- and CT-MSCs was markedly decreased upon passaging with concomitant decrease in expression of MSC and pluripotency markers.  Based on their greater self-renewal potential, CPJ-MSCs could be superior to WJ- and CT-MSCs for the applications in therapeutic and regenerative medicine.

DESIGN
Human umbilical cord derived MSCs were isolated from different anatomical segments and cultured in vitro. Gene expression of cells originating from each of cord-placenta junction and Wharton's jelly were compared to cells originating from cord tissue.
