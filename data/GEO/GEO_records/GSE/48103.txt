TITLE
RNA-seq Analysis Reveal Global Differential Transcritomes of Mesorhizobium huakuii 7653R between Bacteroids and Free-living Cells

ORGANISM
Mesorhizobium huakuii 7653R

SUMMARY
Mesorhizobium huakuii 7653R is an Î±-proteobacterium that occurs either in a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with its host plant, A. sinicus, or free-living in the soil. We performed RNA-Seq on free-living cells grown in rich media and in bacteroids isolated from root nodules to understand how M. huakuii 7653R responds to alterations in its environment and to the physiological changes that occur during bacteroid differentiation. Understand how M. huakuii 7653R responds to alterations in its environment and to the physiological changes that occur during bacteroid differentiation.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in free-living cells and bacteroids at 32 days postinoculation
