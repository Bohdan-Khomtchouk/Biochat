Genotype (CNV and SNP) by Illumina 1MDuo and CBS from ENCODE/HudsonAlpha

ORGANISM
ENCODE

SUMMARY
This data was generated by ENCODE. If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Florencia Pauli ). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE ( ). This track is produced as part of the ENCODE project. The track displays copy number variation (CNV) as determined by the Illumina Human 1M-Duo Infinium HD BeadChip assay and circular binary segmentation (CBS). The Human 1M-Duo contains more than 1,100,000 tagSNP markers and a set of ~60,000 additional CNV-targeted markers. The median spacing between markers is 1.5 kb and the mean spacing is 2.4 kb. The B-allele frequency and genotyping single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data generated by the experiment are not displayed, but are available for download from the Downloads page. Where applicable, biological replicates of each cell line are reported separately. Possible uses of the data include correction of copy number in peak-calling for ChIP-seq, transcriptome, DNase hypersensitivity, and methylation determinations.
