TITLE
RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of Nestin-GFP-peri and -GFP-retic bone marrow stromal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cell cycle quiescence is a critical feature contributing to haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. Although various candidate stromal cells have been identified as potential HSC niches, the spatial localization of quiescent HSC in the bone marrow (BM) remains unclear. Here, using a novel approach that combines whole-mount confocal immunofluorescence imaging technique and computational modelling to analyse significant tridimensional associations among vascular structures, stromal cells and HSCs, we show that quiescent HSCs associate specifically with small arterioles that are preferentially found in endosteal BM. These arterioles are ensheathed exclusively by rare Nestin-GFP-peri/NG2+ pericytes, distinct from sinusoid-associated Nestin-GFP-retic/LepR+ cells. The present RNA-seq study sought to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the differences between the two distinct HSC cellular niches.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of sorted Nestin-GFP-peri and -GFP-retic bone marrow stromal cells were generated from pooled mice in triplicate by Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing.
