TITLE
Identification of transcription factor MAB-5 binding sites

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We identified the DNA binding sites of MAB-5 in C. elegans. MAB-5 was C-terminally tagged with GFP and the expression pattern was examined through fluorescent microscopy. The binding sites were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).
