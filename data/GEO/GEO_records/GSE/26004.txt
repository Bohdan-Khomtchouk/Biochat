TITLE
GPM6B regulates osteoblast differentiation and induction of mineralization by controlling cytoskeleton and matrix vesicle release.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of GPM6B silenced osteogenic hMSC at gene expression level.  Analysis is showing significant changes in genes involved in cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis. Immunocytochemistry confirms changed distribution of actin filaments and change in shape and in size of focal adhesions upon GPM6B silencing. Moreover, we demonstrated that production and release of ALP-positive matrix vesicles (MVs) was reduced. In conclusion, we identified GPM6B as a novel regulator of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation and thereby demonstrating the significance of cytoskeleton organization for MV production and eventual mineralization.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from osteogenic hMSC, 7days after shRNAi lenti viral transductions with 3 different GPM6B silencing constructs (sh1, sh2, sh3) compared to 3 different controls (shC:non-silencing shRNA, tGFP: tGFP control vector and Mock: mock transduced cells)

PLATFORM
GPL6947 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip
