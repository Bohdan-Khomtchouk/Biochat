TITLE
Transcriptional response of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) after primary versus secondary exposure to Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAV)

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
Following an infection with a specific pathogen, the acquired immune system of many teleostean fish, including salmonids, is known to retain a specific memory of the infectious agent, which protects the host against subsequent infections. For example Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which have survived an infection with a low-virulence infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) isolate are less susceptible against subsequent infections with high-virulence ISAV isolates. A greater understanding of the mechanisms and immunological components involved in this acquired protection against ISAV is fundamental for the development of efficacious vaccines and treatments against this pathogen. To better understand the immunity components involved in this observed resistance, we have used an Atlantic salmon DNA microarray and RT-qPCR assays to study the global gene expression responses of preexposed Atlantic salmon (fish having survived an infection with a low-virulence ISAV isolate) during the course of a secondary infection with a high-virulence ISAV isolate

DESIGN
Atlantic salmon which had survived a primary infection with a low-virulence ISAV isolate (preexposed H5R fish) were reinfected by cohabitation (H5Rc fish) or IP injection (H5Rip fish) with a high-virulence ISAV isolate and compared to preexposed H5R fish non-reinfected and na√Øve Atlantic salmon infected by cohabitation (Nc fish) with the high-virulence ISAV isolate using 4x44k Agilent arrays. H5Rc fish (n~6) and Nc fish (n~6) were sampled at 20d, 23d, 29d, 41d and 63d following the infection, while H5Rip fish (n~6) were sampled at 6h, 24h, 3d, 10d, 20d and 63d. Microarrays were performed using a 1-color approach
