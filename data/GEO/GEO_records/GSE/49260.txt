TITLE
Discovery of novel and differentially expressed microRNAs between fetal and six month old skeletal muscle in goat

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (âˆ¼22 nucleotides) noncoding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) that regulate gene expression by binding to their complementary sequences. Recent years, a great deal of miRNAs which highly-enriched in skeletal muscle have been identified, which can influence multiple facets of muscle development and function through their regulation of key genes controlling myogenesis. However, to date no miRNAs have been reported to modulate muscle development in goat. Total RNAs from the xuhuai goats longissimus thoracis at fetal and six month old stages were used to construct small RNA libraries for Solexa SBS technology sequencing. In the small RNA profile, a total of 15,627,457 clean reads were obtained from the fetal goat library and 15,593,721 clean reads from the six month old goat library. There are 471 conserved miRNAs overlapped in both libraries, of which 343 miRNAs were differential expressed. We identified 122 novel miRNAs in the fetal caprine library and 53 novel miRNAs in the six month old-caprine library.
