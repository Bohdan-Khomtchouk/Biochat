TITLE
Expression data from antigen-presenting cells (APCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
P25 is the major T cell epitope for Ag85B and enables them to induce P25-specific CD4+ Th1 cells. We used microarrays to examine the gene expression of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) stimulated with P25 and P25-specific CD4+ T cells.

DESIGN
Splenic APCs from WT mice were cultured with P25 or medium in the presence of P25 TCR CD4+ T cells. After overnight culture, these APCs were enriched and total RNA was prepared using RNeasy (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mixed total RNA from three independent experiments was used for microarray analysis.
