TITLE
E2F1 ChIP-Seq on mouse hepatocytes overexpressing E2F1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E2F transcription factors are known regulators of the cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. We reveal an essential role for E2F1 in liver through the regulation of glycolysis and lipogenesis. E2F1 deficiency leads to a decreased in glycolysis and de novo synthesis of fatty acids in hepatocytes. ChIP-Seq was performed to determine direct tagets of E2F1 in hepatocytes. We highlight that E2F1 directly binds the promoters of genes implicated in metabolic process and notably key lipogenic genes to control these pathways.

DESIGN
we performed 2 independents replicates. Each replicate is the combination of 2 independents ChIP experiments
