TITLE
Human Peripheral blood monocytes untreated or treated with CXCL12

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total mRNA expression of CXCL12-treated monocytes was compared with control untreated monocytes

DESIGN
Human Peripheral blood monocytes from three different healthy donors were isolated by anti-CD14-labeled magnetic microbeads. CD14+ monocytes were cultured in teflon dishes for 1h in RPMI 10% FCS and then, were treated or not with CXCL12 for 6h. Total RNA from each condition was extracted and purified using the RNasey kit (Qiagen). Labelled RNA was used as hybridization probes on human Codelink Whole genome Bioarray. All experimental procedures were performed following manufacturer instructions. Microarrays were scanned with a GenePix 4000B (Axon Instruments) scanner. Scanned images and raw data were processed using the Codelink Expression Software.
