TITLE
Transcriptional comparison of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) following infection with Lassa or Lujo viruses

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of PBMC from cynomolgus macaques collected longitudinally over the course of infection with Lassa-Josiah, Lassa-Z132, Lassa-SorombaR, or Lujo viruses (n=3 animals/infection condition).

DESIGN
3 macaques from each group were infected intramuscularly with 10^4 PFU of Lassa-Josiah, Lassa-Z132, Lassa-SorombaR, or Lujo viruses.  PBMC were collected at days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 29 (for surviving animals).  We performed microarray analysis on PBMC samples using Agilent rhesus macaque arrays on all samples, as well as on PBMC from 3 uninfected animals for use as a control.
