TITLE
Rapid induction and long-term self-renewal of primitive neural precursors from human embryonic stem cells by small molecule inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we report synergistic inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), transforming growth factor β (TGF β), and Notch signaling pathways by small molecules can efficiently convert monolayer cultured hESCs into homogenous primitive neuroepithelium within one week under chemically defined condition. These primitive neuroepithelia can stably self-renew in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor, GSK3 inhibitor (CHIR99021) and TGF β receptor inhibitor (SB431542); retain high neurogenic potential and responsiveness to instructive neural patterning cues toward midbrain and hindbrain neuronal subtypes; and exhibit in vivo integration. hESCs at about 20% confluence were treated with 3 μM CHIR99021, 2 μM SB431542, 0.1 μM Compound E (γ-Secretase Inhibitor XXI) in neural induction media containing Advanced DMEM/F12:Neurobasal (1:1), 1xN2, 1xB27, 1% Glutmax, 5 μg/ml BSA and 10 ng/ml hLIF, for 7 days. The culture was then split 1:3 for the next six passages using Accutase and cultured in neural induction media supplemented with 3 μM CHIR99021 and 2 μM SB431542 on X-ray inactivated MEF feeders or Matrigel-coated plates. After six passages, the cells were split 1:10 regularly.
