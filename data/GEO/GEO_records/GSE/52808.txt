TITLE
Quality control of spliced mRNAs requires the shuttling SR-proteins Gbp2 and Hrb1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Eukaryotic cells have to prevent the export of unspliced pre-mRNAs until intron removal is completed to avoid the expression of aberrant and potentially harmful proteins. Only mature RNAs associate with the export receptor Mex67 (mammalian TAP) and enter the cytoplasm. The underlying nuclear quality control mechanisms are still unclear. Here we show that two shuttling SR-proteins Gbp2 and Hrb1 are key surveillance factors for the selective export of spliced mRNAs in yeast. Their absence leads to the significant leakage of unspliced pre-mRNAs into the cytoplasm. They bind to pre-mRNAs and the spliceosome during splicing, where they are necessary for the surveillance of splicing and the stable binding of the TRAMP-complex to the spliceosome-bound transcripts. Faulty transcripts are marked for their degradation at the nuclear exosome. On correct mRNAs the SR-proteins recruit Mex67 upon completion of splicing to allow a quality controlled nuclear export. Altogether, these data identify a role for shuttling SR-proteins in mRNA surveillance and nuclear mRNA quality control.
