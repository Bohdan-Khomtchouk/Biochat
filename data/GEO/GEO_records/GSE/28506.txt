TITLE
Transformation of elongation factor 1Bdelta into heat shock response transcription factor by alternative splicing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Protein translation factors play crucial roles in a variety of stress responses. Here, we show that the eukaryotic elongation factor 1Bdelta (eEF1Bdelta) changes its structure and function from a translation factor into a heat shock response transcription factor by alternative splicing. While eEF1Bdelta is specifically localized in the cytoplasm, the long isoform of eEF1Bdelta (eEF1BdeltaL) is localized in the nucleus and induces heat shock element (HSE)-containing genes in cooperation with heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). Moreover, the N-terminal domain of eEF1BdeltaL binds with NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and induces stress response heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Specific inhibition of eEF1BdeltaL with siRNA completely inhibits Nrf2-dependent HO-1 induction. In addition, eEF1BdeltaL directly binds to HSE oligo DNA in vitro and associates with HSE containing the HO-1-enhancer region in vivo. Thus, the transcriptional role of eEF1BdeltaL could provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of stress responses. We performed microarray analysis to compare the gene expression induced by eEF1Bdelta1 or eEF1BdeltaL overexpression.
