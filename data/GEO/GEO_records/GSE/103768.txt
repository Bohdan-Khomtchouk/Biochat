TITLE
Epigenome-wide analysis of healthy obese individuals during a one-year weightloss intervention

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of healthy obese individuals during a one-year weight loss intervention. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs. Adipose tissue biopsies were collected at three time points, baseline (T0), Fifth month (T1) and Twelfth month (T2).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the adipose tissue biopsies of 19 healthy obese individuals at three time-points were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
