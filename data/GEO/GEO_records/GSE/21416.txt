TITLE
Baculovirus-encoded protein expression for epigenomic profiling in Drosophila cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Baculovirus-encoded proteins can be efficiently produced following infection of different Drosophila cell lines. Epitope-tagged proteins produced in baculovirus-infected cells provide genome-wide profiles of the histone variant H2Av that are comparable to those produced by stably transformed cell lines. Keywords: Chromatin affinity-purification on microarray

DESIGN
All experiments were done using strepavidin or FLAG pulldown DNA cohybridized with total input DNA to the same array. Two channels per array, Cy5 and Cy3, were used in each experiment.

PLATFORM
