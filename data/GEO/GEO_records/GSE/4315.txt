TITLE
Expression profiling of human endomyocardial biopsies before, during and after cardiac allograft rejection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cardiac allograft rejection remains a significant clinical problem in the early phase after heart transplantation and requires frequent surveillance with endomyocardial biopsy. Endomyocardial tissue samples were obtained in connection with clinical biopsies from twenty consecutive heart transplant patients followed for six months. A rejection episode was observed in 14 patients and biopsies obtained before, during and after the episode were identified. Endomyocardial RNA, from three patients, matching these three points in time were analysed with DNA microarray. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Three subjects (subject number 1,8 and 12) Three timepoints (Before, during and after an rejection episode)
