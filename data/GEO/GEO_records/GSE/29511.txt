TITLE
Induction of the neuronal major histocompatibility complex class I and paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B pathway in the hippocampus with aging and cognitive decline

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify alterations in hippocampal synaptic mRNA expression with aging and cognitive decline.  Transcriptional profiling and subsequent bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify the most highly regulated pathways of genes.  Interestingly, the antigen processing and presentation pathway was identified as the most highly regulated pathway with aging.
