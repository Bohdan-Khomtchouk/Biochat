TITLE
zebrafish liver tumor signatures

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
transcriptome profiling of zebrafish liver tumors comparing with healthy liver tissues

DESIGN
Zebrafish liver tumors were induced by exposure to 7,12-dimethylbenz(Î±)anthracene (DMBA). 5 zebrafish liver tumors and 6 healthy zebrafish livers were used to detect gene signatures in zebrafish liver tumors. A mixture of the 11 total RNA samples was used as the common reference.
