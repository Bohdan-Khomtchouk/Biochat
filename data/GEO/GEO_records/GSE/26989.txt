TITLE
DNA methylation analysis of ovarian cancers and normal peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA by Illumina Infinium platform

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a genome-scale DNA methylation analysis of 41 ovarian tumors and 10 normal lymphocytic samples. We used the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 Beadchip platform that interrogates the DNA methylation profiles of approximately 27,000 CpGs to identify sensitive markers for ovarian cancer detection. The 41 tumor samples included one mixed (clear cell and endometrioid) tumor, three clear cell carcinomas, four mucinous, four endometrioid, and 32 serous epithelial ovarian carcinomas. The lymphocytic DNA samples were obtained from 10 healthy older women.

DESIGN
DNA obtained from 41 ovarian cancer tissue samples and 10 peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) samples was bisulfite converted and then hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v.1.2 biological replicate: sample WBC6, WBC11 biological replicate: sample WBC8, WBC12
