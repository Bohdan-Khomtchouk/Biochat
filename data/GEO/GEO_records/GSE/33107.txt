TITLE
SICKLE is a novel factor involved in miRNA biogenesis and is important for development and stress tolerance of Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To evaluate the function of SICKLE in miRNA biogenesis and stress tolerance, we use whole genome tiling array to detect the expression change of protein coding genes, miRNAs, intronic regions in sck-l mutant comparing to wildtype.

DESIGN
sic-l mutant vs. wildtype. Two biological replicates each. Seedling plants were used.
