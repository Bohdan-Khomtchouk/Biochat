TITLE
Comparative transcriptome analysis in response to heat stress in Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana ; Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata are two closely related Brassicaceae species, which are used as models for plant comparative biology. They differ by lifestyle, predominant mating strategy, ecological niches and genome organization. To identify heat stress induced genes, we performed RNA-sequencing of rosette leaves from mock-treated, heat-stressed and heat-stressed-recoved plants of both species.

DESIGN
Analysis of genetic element transcriptional changes in response to 6 hours of 37Â°C heat stress and 48 hours of recovery in Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and Arabidopsis lyrata MN47.
