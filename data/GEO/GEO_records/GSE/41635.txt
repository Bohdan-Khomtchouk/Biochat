TITLE
Expression data from ALK over-expressed MCF-7 clones and control clones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate the function of ALK in breast cancer, we enforcing expressed full length wild type ALK in the parental MCF-7 breast cancer cell line that we have established in previous studies have a very low invasive capacity, do not form tumor emboli nor do they invade into the dermal lymphatics when grown as xenografts.

DESIGN
Whole unbiased transcriptome analysis were performed using ALK over-expressed MCF-7 clones and control clones. Pathway mapping revealed that the presence of ALK induced up and down regulation changes of series of genes within several canonical signal pathway.
