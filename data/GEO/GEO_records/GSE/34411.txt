TITLE
Cardiovascular gene expression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comparison between neonatal and adult heart valve and vascular tissue Tissue engineering of blood vessels and heart valves aims to create high quality prostheses, with preservation of their growth potential. However, the current markers used to identify the necessary cell phenotypes might not take the developmental properties of such structures into account.

DESIGN
4 x 3 replicates

PLATFORM
GPL1355 [Rat230_2] Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array
