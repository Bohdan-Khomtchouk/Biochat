TITLE
Effect of topographical micropatterning on human endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Shear stress is known to regulate endothelial cell orientation along the direction of flow. We asked wither cellular patterning along, in the absence of shear could have similar biological effects as shear. We used DNA microarrays to examine the effect of cellular patterning on their transcriptome.

DESIGN
Human microvascular endothelial cells were cultured in parallel micropatterned channels (30um wide channels, 30um apart) composed of polydimethylsiloxane, followed DNA Microarray analysis (Affymetrix 1.0 ST array)
