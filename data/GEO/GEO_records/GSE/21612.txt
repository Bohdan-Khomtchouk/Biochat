TITLE
Expression data for cultured NCI-H1299 parental and spheroid cells as well as their derived xenograft models

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Current approaches to the preclinical investigation for novel cancer therapies rely heavily on the use of traditional cancer cell lines maintained in serum-containing conditions. The discrepancy between promising preclinical efficacy and clinical outcome of most novel anticancer agents emphasizes a need for developing predictive preclinical models that preserve the integrity of original patient tumors, including cancer stem cell (CSC) compartment. In this study, we isolate and characterize CSCs from a non-small cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H1299, by selectively propagating the cells in a stem-cell culture condition. Isolated CSCs proliferated as nonadherent spheroids, displayed capacity to differentiate and self-renew and exhibited higher tumorigenic potential compared to the parental cells.

DESIGN
The gene expression profiles of NCI-H1299 parental cells (serum-containing medium), CSCs (stem-cell medium), and xenograft tumor derived from both cell types were studied by Affymetrix array analysis
