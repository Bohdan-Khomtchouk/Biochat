TITLE
Next generation sequencing of A375 melanoma cell line revealed a complex regulatory network when IGFBP5 overexpressed

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IGFBP5, a critical regulators of insulin-like growth factors, has been reported to be involved in many kinds of carcinogenesis and cancer metastases. The role of IGFBP5 in human malignant melanoma (MM), however, remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that IGFBP5 was aberrantly expressed in human melanoma cells and cancer tissues. Overexpression of IGFBP5 dramatically inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of human melanoma cells, whereas knockdown of IGFBP5 by shRNA resulted in the opposite effects, enhanced the cell proliferation, migration and metastasis. In addition, IGFBP5 overexpression suppressed the growth and metastasis of melanoma xenograft tumor in vivo and IGFBP5 overexpression inhibited epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and stem cell property of tumor cell, with decreased expression of HIF1α, E-cadherin and stem cell markers NANOG, SOX2, OCT4, KLF4 and CD133. Moreover, IGFBP5 exhibited its growth inhibitory activity through inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated Kinase (ERK) and P38-MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings indicate that IGFBP5 acts as tumor suppressor roles in MM through the modulation of ERK1/2 and P38-MAPK signaling pathway as well as EMT procession and cell stemness, suggesting IGFBP5 as a novel target for human melanoma diagnosis and therapy.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of IGFBP5 over expression (OE) in A375 and A375 cell line were generated using Ion torrent
