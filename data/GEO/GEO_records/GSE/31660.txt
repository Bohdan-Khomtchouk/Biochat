TITLE
Gene expression associated with compatible viral diseases in berry

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
To understand the fruit changes and mechanisms involved in the compatible grapevine-virus interaction, we analyzed the berry transcriptome in two stages of development (veraison and ripening) in the red wine cultivar Cabernet Sauvignon infected with Grapevine leaf-roll-associated virus-3 (GLRaV-3). Analysis of global gene expression patterns indicate incomplete berry maturation in infected berries as compared to uninfected fruit suggesting viral infection interrupts the normal berry maturation process. PLEXdb( ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Andrea Vega.  The equivalent experiment is VV28 at PLEXdb.

DESIGN
GLRaV-3 virus-infected, developmental stage: Veraison(3-replications); GLRaV-3 virus-infected, developmental stage: Ripening(3-replications); Virus-free, developmental stage: Veraison(4-replications); Virus-free, developmental stage: Ripening(4-replications)
