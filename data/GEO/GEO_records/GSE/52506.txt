TITLE
Gene expression level in normal HSCs (LKS+ cells) from different stages of AML

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the molecular basis for the reversible suppression of HSCs by leukemia, we sorted the CD45.1+LKS+ population from control or leukemic mice at day 7 and day 14 for gene expression profiling analysis.

DESIGN
CD45.1+LKS+ cells were sorted from leukemia and control groups at different time points. Microarray was performed at CapitalBio in Beijing. Total RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit. We used the GeneChip Two-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix) for cRNA amplification and labeling. RNA quality was confirmed using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The amplified cRNA was labeled and hybridized to the Affymetrix Mouse Genome Array 430 2.0 (Affymetrix). Raw data were normalized using Microarray Analysis Software v5.0 (Affymetrix).
