TITLE
Polycomb PRC2 antagonizes de novo DNA methylation at the maternal Gtl2-Rian-Mirg locus [Next-Gen Sequence Data]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild-type mouse embryonic stem cells are compared with mutants for components of PRC2 including  Ezh2-/-, Eed-/-, and Jarid2-/- cells. Chromatin modifications, Gene expression, Pol-II, small-RNA sequencing, and DNA methylation are compared for both cell types.

DESIGN
To study genomic and epigentic control of PRC2 in mESCs, we designed gene expression analysis (RNA-Seq and small RNA-Seq), combining with ChIP-Seq analysis of several factors and histone marks from wild-type and distinct PRC2 mutants including wild-type, Ezh2-/-, Eed-/-, and Jarid2-/-.
