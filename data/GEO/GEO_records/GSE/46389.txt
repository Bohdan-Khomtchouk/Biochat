TITLE
The acute transcriptional response of the coral Acropora millepora to immune challenge: expression of GiMAP/IAN genes links the innate immune response of corals with those of mammals and plants

ORGANISM
Acropora millepora

SUMMARY
This studies investigates the acute response of the coral Acropora millepora to two immunogenes: MDP (bacterial mimic) and pIC (viral mimic). Three members of the GiMAP familly were found to respond strongly to MDP treatment, showing analalogy to the immune response in vertebrates and plants.

DESIGN
Differential gene expression following treatment with two immunogenes
