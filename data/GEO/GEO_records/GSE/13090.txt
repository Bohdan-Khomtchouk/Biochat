TITLE
Genome-wide GL3 and GL1 binding sites in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
GLABRA3 (GL3) and GLABRA1 (GL1) function as selector genes that control the differentiation of a group of protodermal cells into trichomes in Arabidopsis thaliana. We performed genome-wide location (ChIP-chip) analyses by using transgenic Arabidopsis  plants carrying GL3-YFP or GL1-YFP-MYC1 mini genes. These analyses identified statistically significant enriched DNA associated with GL1 and GL3. A total ~540 and ~700 genes were identified as located proximal and downstream to the GL1 and GL3 binding regions, respectively. Keywords: ChIP-chip
