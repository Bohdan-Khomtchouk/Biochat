TITLE
The long noncoding RNA expression profiles of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation identified by microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of the present study was to identify aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in pAF and predict their potential functions. We recruited three pAF patients undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation into our study. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and coronary sinus blood leukocytes (CSBL) were harvested from pAF patients at the same time during the operation. LncRNAs and mRNAs profiles in leukocytes were detected by microarray between pAF patients and controls. We identified 2095 lncRNAs and 1584 mRNAs differentially expressed between pAF patients and controls. Furthermore, expressions of lncRNAs and mRNAs in leukocytes were also measured between peripheral blood (PB) and coronary sinus blood (CSB). The 866 lncRNAs and 528 mRNAs were shown to be aberrantly expressed between CSBL and PBL in all three pAF patients. Bioinformatic analyses (lncRNA classification and subgroup, gene ontology analysis, pathway analysis and gene co-expression network construction) were performed for differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs. Lastly, we confirmed seven aberrant lncRNAs and five dysregulated mRNAs by qRT-PCR. Our results demonstrated the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in pAF and these lncRNAs/mRNAs may exert a vital role in pAF biology.

DESIGN
To explore the potential involvement of lncRNAs in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation(pAF), we firstly conducted lncRNAs and mRNAs profiling in leukocytes by microarray between pAF patients and controls. Then, expressions of lncRNAs/mRNAs in leukocytes were detected between peripheral blood (PB) and coronary sinus blood (CSB) in all three pAF patients.
