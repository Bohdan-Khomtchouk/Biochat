TITLE
Mfd alters global transcription patterns in undamaged Escherichia coli cells

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We uncovered evidence for an expanded role of transcription-coupled repair factor Mfd in Escherichia coli. In mfd knockout cells, expression of 75 genes was significantly increased while that of 18 genes was diminished. GO term analysis revealed that the affected genes were disproportionately from certain functional groups. RNA levels in the knockout deviated from wild type beginning at transcription start sites, arguing against premature termination as the cause. RNA-seq analysis in cells overexpressing Mfd revealed dramatic deviation of gene expression in the chromosome terminus region. Taken together, our data support a novel role for Mfd in transcription regulation.
