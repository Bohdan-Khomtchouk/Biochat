TITLE
Mechanisms of pparγ activation by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and GQ16.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was undertaken to assess the similarities (or differences) between the well-established PPARγ agonist Rosiglitazone and Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) diclofenac, indomethacin and ibuprofen, as well as the partial agonist GQ16 at the transcriptome level. Assessment of NSAID and GQ16 activities in PPARγ-dependent 3T3-L1 cells reveals that NSAIDs and GQ16 display similar effects toward PPARγ-dependent target genes in a manner similar to that of Rosiglitazone.

DESIGN
Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into adipocytes (7 days), then treated with DMSO (control), 100nM rosiglitazone, 25μM sodium diclofenac, 10μM indomethacin, 75μM ibuprofen, or 10μM GQ16 for 24 hours, after which total RNA was isolated.
