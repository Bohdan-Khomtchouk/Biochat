TITLE
Expression data from  RLT-PSC, human pancreatic stellate cell lineage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression patterns in human PSCs exposed to chronic hyperglycemia with and without subsequent 48h TGF-β1 treatment or to TGF-B1 treatment alone. Treatments were compared to control human PSCs cultured in normal glucose concentration

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from human PSCs of RLT-PSC line exposed to chronic hyperglycemia with or without subsequent TGF-β1 treatment and in PSCs exposed to 48h TGF-β1 treatment. Each treatment was compared to control human PSCs cultured in normal glucose concentration. Samples from all treatment arms were hybridized on Affymetrix PrimeView Human Gene Expression Array

PLATFORM
GPL16043 GeneChip® PrimeView™ Human Gene Expression Array (with External spike-in RNAs)
