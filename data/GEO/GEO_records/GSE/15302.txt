TITLE
Cells following mtDNA loss, or NAR1 repression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of cells the given amount of time after mtDNA was lost (or Nar1 expression was repressed) compared to pretreatment (or NAR1 being fully expressed).

DESIGN
One time course experiment (Cells a given amount of time following mtDNA loss compared to cells with intact mtDNA), with 2 two condition experiments (Cells with the ATP1-111 genotype 27 hours following mtDNA loss compared to the same cells with intact mtDNA, and cells 27 hours following repression of NAR1 comared to cells expressing NAR1). Each data point had 3 biological replicates, and was dye-swapped. One replicate per array.
