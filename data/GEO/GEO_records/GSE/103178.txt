TITLE
Gene expression profile of colorectal cancer HCT116 cells treated with single (2Gy) or fractionated (5 x 2Gy) doses of ionizing radiation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Radiotherapy remains a standard treatment for colorectal cancer. The clinical significance of the conventional treatment is based on accumulated dose and usually consists of single daily irradiations of 1.8 - 2 Gy fractions. However the repopulation of cancer cells during and/or after the treatment suggests that the surviving fraction of cells acquire the radioresistance to cancer therapy. It has been determined a number of radioresistance markers, but only limited data exist on the acquisition of the resistance to fractionated radiation therapy. This research provides the genomic data of gene expression changes in colorectal cancer cell HCT116 line following single and multiple fractions of irradiation, aiming to identify particular genes associated with the effect of fractionated radiotherapy.

DESIGN
RNA was harvested from colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 4h after treatment of single (2 Gy) or fractionated (5x2 Gy) ionizing radiation dose. The non-irradiated cells served as a control.
