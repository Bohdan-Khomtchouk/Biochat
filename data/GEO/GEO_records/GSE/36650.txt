TITLE
DNA methylation data from newly emerged queens, newly emerged workers, adult nurses, adult foragers and adult reverted nurses Honeybees (Apis mellifera)

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation of newly emerged queens, newly emerged workers, adult nurses, adult foragers and adult reverted nurses using comprehensive high throughput arrays for relative methylation (CHARM) We used custom Nimblegen microarrays

DESIGN
We isolated genomic DNA from newly emerged queens, newly emerged workers, adult continuous nurses, adult continuous foragers and adult reverted nurses hybridized to custom-designed Nimblegen microarrays (CHARM arrays). Multiple brains were pooled for each sample and used for the genome-wide DNA methylation analysis.
