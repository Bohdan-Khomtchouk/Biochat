TITLE
Gene expression patterns after chronic clozapine in wild type mice and HDAC2 conditional knock-outs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Effect of chronic clozapine in the gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of wild type mice and mice in which the HDAC2 has been knocked-out in CamKIIa-positive pyramidal neurons.

DESIGN
An mRNA library was built with samples from four different conditions: wild-type mice treated with chronic clozapine (n=3) or vehicle (n=3), HDAC2 conditional knock-outs treated with chronic clozapine (n=3) or vehicle (n=3)
