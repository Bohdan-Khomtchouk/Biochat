TITLE
Trancription factor Fli1 occupancy in Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD lymphoid leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We mapped binding of FLI1 in Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD leukemias over-expressing Dnmt3a or GFP.

DESIGN
Maps of transcription factor FLI1 binding sites in tertiary transplanted Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD leukemias over-expressing Dnmt3a or GFP were obtained by sequencing on Illumna HiSeq 2500

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
