TITLE
Microarray of Mouse Brain Tumors grown from injections of GL26 cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA was extracted from the tumors that grew in the brains of mice that were injected with the GL26 cell line. RNA from GL26 cells was also taken. The chip used for all was an affymetrix mouse genome chip (GPL1261). This is the mouse model compliment to a human experiment in which the human chip was used for GBM tumors. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Samples include GL26 tumors taken from C57BL6 untreated wild type, 10 month Old C57BL6 untreated wild type,  C57BL6 Foxline Mutated Nudes, and from C57BL6 wild types that received a dendritic cell vaccine against GL26.

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
