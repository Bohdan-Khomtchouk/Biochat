TITLE
Glanville fritillary larvae from three larval families (full-sib) exposed to alternative temperature treatments during final instar stage.

ORGANISM
Melitaea cinxia

SUMMARY
We combined heritability analysis of larval development rate with a global expression analysis of this phenotype to investigate genotype by environment interactions across three ecologically relevant temperatures in the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). We focused upon the development of final instar caterpillars which is greatly affected by temperature, and during this stage the caterpillars build up most of the resources for adult life. Second generation, lab reared larvae, initially collected from the Åland metapopulation, were reared in standard lab condition until 6th larval instar. At the beginning of the final (7th) instar stage the larvae were separated into of three temperature conditions: Cold treatment (temperature profile: 8°C 18:00-9:59, 14°C 10:00-11:59, 20°C 12:00-15:59 and 14°C 16:00-17:59) Standard treatment (temperature profile: 15°C 17:00-6:59, 18°C 7:00-8:59, 22°C 9:00-10:59 and 26°C 11:00-16:59) Hot treatment (temperature profile: 8°C 20:00-7:59, 15°C 8:00-9:59, 35°C 10:00-17:59 and 15°C 18:00-19:59) The temperature profiles mimic the diurnal thermal variation of the natural habitat (Åland islands) of samples. Cold treatment mimics a cool and cloudy summer, Standard represents an average temperature profile in the Åland islands and Hot treatment mimics an exceptionally hot and sunny summer, with cold night-time temperatures. The experiment contained several larval families (full-sib) of which three were selected for gene expression analysis. Samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen during mid-development (after 6, 5 and 4 days, for Cold, Standard and Hot respectively). Additional larvae from the same treatments were assayed for survival and growth. Gene expression was analyzed using a mixed model approach to identify genes with potential heritable expression variation (variation among families), genes with plastic expression responses (treatment induced changes) and genes with treatment dependent expression that varies among families (family by treatment interactions).

DESIGN
Full-sib larvae from three families (N170, N74 and O171) were exposed to three temperature treatments (Cold, Standard and Hot) during final (7th) instar stage. A total of 35 samples were used to analyze family, treatment and family by treatment interactions in gene expression, using a mixed model approach. This included 3 biological replicates in Cold and Hot treatments from each family and 5-6 biological replicates in Standard (5 in O171) per family. Techinal replicates from each family and additional techical replicates in family O171 (including dye swap replicates) were used to assess robustness of the findings.
