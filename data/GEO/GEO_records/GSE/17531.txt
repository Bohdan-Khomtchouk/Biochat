TITLE
Distribution of macroH2A1 and macroH2A2 at gene promoters in NT2/D1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chip-on-chip experiment with NT2 wildtype cells and cells treated with shRNA for macroH2A1 and macroH2A2 The goal was to determine the genome-wide occupancy of macroH2A1 and macroH2A2 at gene promoters in undifferentiated cells

DESIGN
Biological replicates: Chromatin was prepared from exponentially growing wild-type NT2 cells and cells stably exressing shRNA targetting macroH2A1 and macroH2A2 mRNA. Triplicate of IPs for macroH2A2 and two duplicates with different macroH2A1 antibodies were performed. A triplicate of control IPs was performed with IgGs on chromatin of untreated cells and macroH2A1 specific antibody on shRNA-treated cells.
