TITLE
Expression data for various strains of Toxoplasma gondii chosen from canonical types (i.e., I,II, and III)

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
This study establishes a baseline pattern for RNA expression among canonical strains of Toxoplasma gondii grown in tissue culture without perturbation.

DESIGN
Parasites cultured within human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells grown with D10 media were scraped and harvested ~8-12 hours prior to host cell lysis.  RNA was isolated and applied to a T. gondii Affymetrix array.

PLATFORM
GPL10000 [Tgondiia520372] Affymetrix Toxoplasma gondii Custom GeneChip (CDF: ToxoDB version 5)
