TITLE
Expression analysis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 with and without plasmid R27

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression level changes in Salmonella Typhiumurium SL1344 (R27) compared to the wild-type SL1344 strain when grown at different growth temperatures and growth phases.

DESIGN
A 24 microarray study was performed using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of SL1344 and three separate cultures of SL1344 (R27) grown to exponential and stationary phase at 25oC and 37oC.  Each microarray measured the expression level of 4,527 genes from Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 chromosome, 103 genes from plasmid pSLT, 100 genes from plasmid  pRSF, 14 genes from plasmid pCOL1B and 207 genes from plasmid R27. Seven probes were present per transcript, with two-fold technical redundancy.
