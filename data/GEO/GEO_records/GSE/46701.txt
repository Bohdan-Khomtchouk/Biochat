TITLE
Expression data from Wild-type (WT) and Alb/AEG-1 mice which are transgenic mice with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of AEG-1 (Astrocyte elevated gene 1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
AEG-1 is overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and positively regulates development and progression of HCC A transgenic mouse with hepatocyte-specific expression of human AEG-1 was generated using mouse albumin promoter/enhancer in B6/CBA background.

DESIGN
Hepatocytes were isolated from WT and Alb/AEG-1 mice for RNA extraction and Affymetrix microarray hybridization.

PLATFORM
