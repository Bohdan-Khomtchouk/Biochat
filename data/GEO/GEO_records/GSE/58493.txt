TITLE
Expression data of wild type and C-DGCR8 KO cones at different timepoints [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analyzed gene expression in cone photoreceptors isolated from wild type and C-DGCR8 (DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region Gene 8) KO mice at five different time points to get a mechanistic inside into the altered molecular pathways after microRNAs depletion.

DESIGN
Cones were isolated by FACS from wild type and C-DGCR8 KO mice expressing Cre recombinase postnatally specifically in cones (D4-Cre) and bearing conditional null Dgcr8 allele. Experiments were performed in duplicates from different time points (P30, P40, P50, P60, and P90). Total RNA was extracted and hybridization on Affymetrix array was performed.
