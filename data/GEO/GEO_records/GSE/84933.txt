TITLE
Genome-Wide Direct Target Identification Reveals the transcriptional regulatory Framework of WOX11 in Root Development in Rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
WUSCHEL-related homeobox domain trancription factor WOX11 is a key regulator of crown root growth and development in rice (Oryza sativa. L). However, the gene regulatory network downstream of WOX11 remains largely unknown. To dissect WOX11 transcriptional regulatory framework, we determined the transcriptome of wox11 mutants and corresponding wild type (Hwayoung) by using RNA-seq technology.

DESIGN
Genome-wide analysis of root tip transcriptome of wox11 mutant and corresponding wild type.

PLATFORM
GPL22250 Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Oryza sativa Japonica Group)
