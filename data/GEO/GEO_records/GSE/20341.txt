ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Analysis of small RNAs with 5'p, 3'OH Raw data files are available on our FTP site: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/geosup/Series/GSE20341

DESIGN
Small RNAs (18-32nt) expressed in purified male sperm, hermaphrodite oocytes, embryos, N2, glp-4(bn2), and eri-1(mg366)  were cloned and sequenced by 454 and Illumina high-throughput sequencing.
