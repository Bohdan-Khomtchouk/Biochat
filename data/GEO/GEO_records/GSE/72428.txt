TITLE
Changes in eutopic endometrial gene expression during the progression of experimental endometriosis in the baboon, Papio anubis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Endometriosis is associated with aberrant gene expression in the eutopic endometrium of women with disease. To determine if the development of endometriotic lesions directly impacts eutopic endometrial gene expression, we sequentially analyzed the eutopic endometrium across the time course of disease progression in a baboon model of induced disease. Endometriosis was induced in baboons by intraperitoneal inoculation of autologous menstrual endometrium. Eutopic endometria were collected at 9-11 days postovulation) in five time points: 1, 3, 6-7, 10-12, and 15-16 months after disease induction and compared with tissue from disease-free baboons. We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes between time points. Sequential analysis of the same animals during disease progression demonstrated an early disease insult and a transitory dominance of an estrogenic phenotype. However, as the disease progressed, a progesterone-resistant phenotype became evident.
