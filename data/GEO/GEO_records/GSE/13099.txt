ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
mRNA amount (RA) analysis of W303 hog1 mutant yeast strain growing in exponential phase in YPD subjected to osmotic stress Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Transcriptomic analysis of three independent replicates the yeast strain growing in exponential phase. Each time point replicate has been hybridized on a different macroarray (F18-F24).
