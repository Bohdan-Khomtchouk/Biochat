TITLE
Sox4 links tumor suppression to accelerated aging in mice [Hair regeneration]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sox4 is a transcription factor expressed during embryonic development and some adult tissues such as lymphoid organs, pancreas, intestine and skin. During embryogenesis, Sox4 regulates the survival of mesenchymal and neural progenitors, lymphocyte and myeloid differentiation, and pancreatic, bone and cardiac development. Aberrantly increased Sox4 expression is linked to malignant transformation and metastasis in several types of human cancer. To study the role of Sox4 in the adult organism, we first generated mice with reduced whole-body Sox4 expression. These mice display a plethora of age-related degenerative disorders and reduced spontaneous cancer incidence, indicating a role for this protein in maintaining adult tissue homeostasis and in tumor growth. To specifically address a role for Sox4 in adult stem cells, we conditionally deleted Sox4 (Sox4cKO) in stratified epithelia. Sox4cKO mice show increased skin stem cell quiescence and DNA damage accumulation, accompanied by resistance to chemical carcinogenesis. These phenotypes correlate with downregulation of cell cycle, DNA repair and skin stem cell genes in the absence of Sox4. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of Sox4 in adult tissue homeostasis and cancer.

DESIGN
Sox4 WT and cKO (conditional KO in skin) were plucked and skin  was collected for microarray hibridization, to study the contribution of Sox4 to hair regeneration and hair follicle stem cell activation
