TITLE
Contribution of germline to sex-biased expression in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The effect of germline tissue on somatic sex-biased expression is examined.  Expression is assayed in various adult tissues with germline ablated directly or genetically. The effect of germline signalling on sex-biased expression in the Drosophila head is also examined. Keywords: Expression profiling

DESIGN
Two-color microarray experiments in a loop design are used.  Additional descriptive information is available at Parisi et.al (2004) Genome Biol. 2004;5(6):R40. PMID: 15186491
