TITLE
Contribution of germline to sex-biased expression in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The effect of germline tissue on somatic sex-biased expression is examined.  Expression is assayed in various adult tissues with germline ablated directly or genetically. The effect of germline signalling on sex-biased expression in the Drosophila head is also examined. Keywords: Expression profiling
