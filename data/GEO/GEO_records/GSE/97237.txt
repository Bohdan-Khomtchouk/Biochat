12plex_pea_2013_02_g      -Water stress and seed filling in pea

ORGANISM
Pisum sativum

SUMMARY
12plex_pea_2013_02 - 12plex_pea_2013_02_g       - What is the effect of a moderate water stress on seed filling (reserve accumulation) and nitrogen remobilisation in pea (Pisum sativum)         - Pea plants (genotype Cameor) were subjected to a moderate water stress at the beggining of the seed filling period (12 Days After Pollination) of the second flowering node for a period of 8 days. Samples were collected from Well Watered (WW) plants at the beginning of the stress imposition (point A, T=0), and from Water-Stressed (WS) and WW control plants at the end of the drought period (point B, T=+8). Samples named SEED consisted of seeds from the pod of the second flowering node (seed-WW-A, seed-WW-B and Seed-WS-B). Samples named LEAF consisted of the leaves and stem sections from the two vegetative nodes below the first flowering node (leaf-WW-A, Leaf-WW-B and Leaf-WS-B). Each sample consited of a pool of 3 individual plants and 4 repetitions per condition were carried out.

DESIGN
12 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison
