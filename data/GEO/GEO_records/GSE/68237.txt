TITLE
NANOG metabolically reprograms tumor-initiating stem-like cells in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stem cell markers such as NANOG have been implicated in various cancers; however, the functional contribution of NANOG to cancer pathogenesis has remained unclear. In the present study, we show that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling phosphorylates E2F1 to transactivate NANOG. Down-regulation of Nanog significantly reduces tumor development. In the search for the NANOG-dependent mechanisms underlying growth of tumor-initiating stem-like cells (TICs), NANOG ChIP-seq identifies the genes associated with mitochondrial metabolic pathways.
