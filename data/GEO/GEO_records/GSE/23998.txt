TITLE
Gene expression profiles of splenocytes of CD22DE12 transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Splenocytes from nontransgenic control mice and transgenic mice were isolated and their gene expression profiles were compared to determine if the expression of the transgene results in any changes in regulation of gene expression. 12 differentially expressed genes were classified as the most discriminating genes, including TP53, NF2, MDM2, RAC1, APC, and STATB1 with tumor suppressor gene function as well as cell cycle regulatory genes CDKN1C, CCNG1, and NOTCH4

DESIGN
Mice were sacrificed at 6 weeks of age, spleens removed, splenocytes isolated, and RNA extracted from splenocytes.  Mouse ATLAS cDNA expression arrays were used for gene expression profiling.
