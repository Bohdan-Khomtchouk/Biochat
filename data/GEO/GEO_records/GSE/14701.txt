TITLE
Expression profiling of PaTu8988s and PaTu8988t cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray to look at the genes deregulated in PaTu8988s (adenovirus insensitive) and PaTu8988t (adenovirus sensitive) cell lines PaTu8988s and PaTu8988t are pancreatic cell lines derived from the same patient and show significant responses to oncolytic adenoviruses. The different response to adenovirus in these cell lines is not related to the previously known mechanisms that affect adenovirus infection. The two cell lines represent represent a " suitable " model to screen tumour-associated genes affecting the potency of aoncolytic adenovirus.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
