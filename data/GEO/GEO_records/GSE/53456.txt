TITLE
Genomic content analysis of Clostridium botulinum type F strains

ORGANISM
Clostridium botulinum

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to determine the level of genomic content similarity among selected strains of Clostridium botuinum type F strains.

DESIGN
In this study, strains were selected that had already been chacaterized by botulinum neurotoxin gene sequencing.  Strains harboring bont/F1, bont/F4 and bont/F5 were compared.
