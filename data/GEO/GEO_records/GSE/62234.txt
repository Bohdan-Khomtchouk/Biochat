TITLE
CTCF binding profiles in Drosophila melanogaster 3rd instar larva T1 and T3 leg discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Although the majority of genomic binding sites for the insulator protein CTCF are constitutively occupied, a subset show variable occupancy. Such variable sites provide an opportunity to assess context-specific CTCF functions in gene regulation. Here we have identified a variably occupied CTCF site in the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene in Drosophila. This site is occupied in tissues where Ubx is active (third thoracic imaginal leg disc) but is not bound in tissues where the Ubx gene is repressed (first thoracic imaginal leg disc).

DESIGN
Comparison of CTCF binding in T1 leg disc vs T3 leg disc in from 3rd instar larva
