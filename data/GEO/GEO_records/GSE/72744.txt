The histone chaperone CAF-1 safeguards somatic cell identity during transcription factor-induced reprogramming (sequencing)

SUMMARY
During development, specialized cell lineages are generated through the establishment of cell type-specific transcriptional patterns and epigenetic programs. However, the precise mechanisms and regulators that maintain these specialized cell states remain largely elusive. To identify molecules that safeguard somatic cell identity, we performed two comprehensive RNAi screens targeting known and predicted chromatin regulators during transcription factor-mediated reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Remarkably, subunits of the chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) complex emerged as the most prominent hits from both screens, followed by modulators of lysine sumoylation, DNA methylation and heterochromatin maintenance. Suppression of CAF-1 increased reprogramming efficiencies by several orders of magnitude and generated iPSCs two to three times faster compared to controls without affecting cell proliferation. We demonstrate that suppression of CAF-1 leads to a more accessible chromatin structure specifically at enhancer elements early during reprogramming. These changes were accompanied by increased binding of the reprogramming factor Sox2 to ESC-specific regulatory elements and earlier activation of pluripotency-associated genes. Notably, suppression of CAF-1 also enhanced iPSC formation from blood progenitors as well as the direct conversion of B cells into macrophages and fibroblasts into neurons. Together, our findings reveal the histone chaperone CAF-1 as an unanticipated regulator of somatic cell identity and provide a potential strategy to modulate cellular plasticity in a regenerative setting.
