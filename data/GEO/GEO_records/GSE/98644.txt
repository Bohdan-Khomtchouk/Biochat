TITLE
Telomere heterogeneity linked to metabolism and pluripotency state revealed by simultaneous measurement of telomere length and RNA-seq in the same human ES cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Telomere length heterogeneity in various cell types including stem cells and cancer cells has been recognized. Cell heterogeneity also is found in pluripotent stem cells such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The implication and mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity remain to be defined. We have optimized a robust method that can simultaneously measure telomere length coupled with RNA-sequencing analysis (scT & R-seq) in the same human ES cell. Using this method, we show that telomere length varies with pluripotency state. Long telomere hESCs highly express TERF1/TRF1 as well as ZFP42/REX1, PRDM14 and NANOG for naïve pluripotency, in contrast to short telomere hESCs. hESCs express high telomerase activity as expected, and ubiquitously express NOP10 and DKC1, stabilizing components of telomerase complexes, regardless of telomere lengths. Moreover, new candidate genes such as MELK, MSH6 and UBQLN1 cluster with long telomeres and pluripotency network. Notably, short telomere hESCs exhibit higher oxidative phosphorylation primed for lineage differentiation, whereas long telomere hESCs show elevated glycolysis, another key feature for naïve pluripotency. Our data further suggest that telomere length is implicated in metabolism activity and pluripotency state of hESCs. Single cell analysis of telomere and RNA-sequencing can be exploited to further understand the molecular mechanisms of telomere heterogeneity.

DESIGN
By combining the methods to amplify the telomere specific sequences and mRNA separately, 121 single hESCs were randomly selected for full-length RNA-seq using Smart-seq2.
