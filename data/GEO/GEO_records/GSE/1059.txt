TITLE
Myometrial cells expressing CREB, CREM alpha, CREM tau2alpha, ATF2 or the ATF2-small gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human myometrial cells taken from biopsies of pre-menopausal non-cancerous non-pregnant uteri were cultured in complete MEM D-valine medium plus 10% FCS, and stably-transfected with the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen) harbouring either CREB, CREM alpha, CREM tau2alpha, ATF2, ATF2-small gene or a control empty-vector. Total RNA was extracted using TRI-reagent (Sigma) and RNeasy columns (Qiagen), and 10 ug used in target preparation for array hybridization. Keywords: other
