TITLE
Gene expression in neurons or astrocytes treated with grape seed extract

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We examined the effect of grape seed extract (GSE), which are known to protect neurons against oxidative stress, on primary cultures of hippocampal astrocytes. GSE increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. Microarrays are used to examine the effects of GSE on primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and astrocytes.

DESIGN
Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were treated with 0, 1, or 10 ug/ml of GSE for 24 hrs. Primary cultures of hippocampal astrocytes were treated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 ug/ml of GSE for 24 hrs.
