TITLE
Hormonal Regulation of MicroRNA Expression in Rat Adrenal Gland

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To determine miRNA profiles in rat adrenals from animals treated with vehicle, ACTH, 17α-ethinyl estradiol (17α-E2) or dexamethasone (DEX).  miRNA expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix® GeneChip® miRNA 2.0 Arrays. Together with qRT-PCR, several adrenal miRNAs have been identified, whose expression is subject to regulation by one or more than one hormone.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from four group rat adrenal gland and miRNA profiles were established using microarray using Affymetrix® GeneChip® miRNA 2.0 Arrays and confirmed with qRT-PCR. The microarray data were analyzed using Partek® Genome Suite software, version 6.3 Copyright© 2008 (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) to comprehensively evaluate the differential expression level of the various samples.

PLATFORM
