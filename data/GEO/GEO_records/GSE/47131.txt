TITLE
Hormonal Regulation of MicroRNA Expression in Rat Adrenal Gland

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
To determine miRNA profiles in rat adrenals from animals treated with vehicle, ACTH, 17α-ethinyl estradiol (17α-E2) or dexamethasone (DEX).  miRNA expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix® GeneChip® miRNA 2.0 Arrays. Together with qRT-PCR, several adrenal miRNAs have been identified, whose expression is subject to regulation by one or more than one hormone.
