SUMMARY
Under conditions of hormonal adjuvant treatment the estrogen receptor apoprotein supports breast cancer cell cycling through the retinoic acid receptor α1 apoprotein. Basal proliferation persisted in estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells grown in hormone depleted conditioned media without or with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OH-Tam). Downregulating ER using siRNA  inhibited basal proliferation by promoting cell cycle arrest. The basal expression of RARα1, the only RARα isoform that was expressed in breast cancer cell lines and in most breast tumors, was supported by apo-ER but was unaffected by OH-Tam. The overlapping tamoxifen-insensitive gene regulation by apo-ER and apo-RARα1 comprised activation of mainly genes promoting cell cycle and mitosis and suppression of genes involved in growth inhibition.

DESIGN
Cells were plated at 20% confluence in low glucose phenol red free medium supplemented with 5% charcoal stripped FBS and glutamine 24h-48h prior to transfection. Treatment with vehicle, OH-Tam (100nM), or OH-Tam (500nM) was begun an additional 24h later. Cells were transfected with control siRNA, ERα siRNA or RARα siRNA.
