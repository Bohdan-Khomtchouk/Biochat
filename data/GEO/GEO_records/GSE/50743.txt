TITLE
Human Bone Marrow Stromal Cells cultured on polymer scaffolds with varied properties

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to evaluate expression differences from a single donor human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) as a function of varied polymer-based tissue engineering scaffolds. The results revealed that gene expression patterns of hBMSCs grouped according to scaffold.

DESIGN
A library of scaffolds prepared from polycaprolactone (PCL) or poly D,L-lactic acid (PDLLA) was sythesized and cultured with hBMSCs for 14 days with RNA extracted from cells on Day 1 and Day 14. Gene expression analysis was performed using BRB ArrayTools. GF = gas foam, SC = spun coat, BNF = big nanofiber, SNF = small nanofiber, FFF = free-form fabricated, TCPS = tissue culture polystyrene, TCPS+OS = tissue culture polystyrene with osteogenic supplements. The 72 arrays data was used previously in the publication: Kumar et al. The determination of stem cell fate by 3D scaffold structures through the control of cell shape, Biomaterials (2011) 32, 9188-9196. A companion data set of 24 arrays was submitted separately to GEO as GSE50744 and will be referenced to Baker et al. Ontology Analysis of Global Gene Expression Differences of Human Bone Marrow Stromal Cells Cultured on 3D Scaffolds or 2D Films
