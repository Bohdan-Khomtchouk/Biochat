TITLE
Expression data from proliferating and senescent IMR90 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from proliferating and senescent IMR90 cells to compare gene-expression to the changes in nucleolus-association in proliferating and senescent IMR90 cells.

DESIGN
IMR90 cells were grown in standard medium and RNA was isolated from proliferating cells. Then cells were grown until senescence (stop of proliferation, positive beta-galactosidase test) and total RNA was again isolated.
