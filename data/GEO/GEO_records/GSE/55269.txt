TITLE
Gene expression data on human keratinocytes with knockdown or overexpression of SNAI2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
1. Keratinocytes infected with retroviruses expressing control or SNAI2 shRNAs were cultured in growth medium and Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 arrays were used to determine global gene expression profiles. 2. Keratinocytes infected with retroviruses overexpressing LACZ or SNAI2 were cultured in growth medium and Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 arrays were used to determine global gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
Keratinocytes with knockdown or overexpression of SNAI2 were used to determine gene expression profiles

PLATFORM
