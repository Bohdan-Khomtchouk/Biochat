TITLE
Expression in LT-HSC after in vitro culture in mSCF, mTpo, mFlt3L, hIGFBP2 and Angptl5.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse LT-HSC were sorted and cultured in mScf, mTpo, mFlt3L, hIGFBP2 and Angptl5 for 2 days. These expression values were related to insertions of gamma-retroviral, lentiviral or alpharetroviral vectors carrying GFP which were retrieved after serial murine BM transplantation. The relation between gene expression in the cells responsible for long-term hematopoiesis and location of vector integration was investigated.

DESIGN
Biological duplicate measurements of murine sorted and cultured LT-HSC (LSK, CD34-, CD135-)
