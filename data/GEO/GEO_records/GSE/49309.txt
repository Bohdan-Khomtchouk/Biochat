TITLE
RNase-mediated protein footprint sequencing reveals protein-binding sites throughout the human transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNAs are continuously associated with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and these interactions are necessary for many key cellular processes ranging from splicing to chromatin regulation. Although numerous approaches have been developed to map RNA-binding sites of individual RBPs, few methods exist that allow assessment of global RBP-RNA interactions. Here, we describe a universal, high-throughput, ribonuclease-mediated protein footprint sequencing approach that reveals RNA-protein interaction sites throughout a transcriptome of interest. We apply this method to the HeLa transcriptome and compare RBP binding sites found using different cross-linkers and ribonucleases. From this analysis, we identify numerous putative RBP binding motifs, reveal novel insights into co-binding by RBPs, and uncover a significant enrichment for disease-associated polymorphisms within RBP interaction sites.

DESIGN
Protein interaction profile sequencing (PIP-seq) in HeLa cells. Two crosslinkers (formaldehyde and UV) with two RNases (dsRNase and ssRNase) each, as well as a no-crosslink sample. Performed with and without proteins. Three replicates for formaldehyde, two replicates for UV, single replicate for no crosslinker.
