TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of mRNAs immunoprecipitated by wild-type (WT) or phospho-null (S200A) FLAG-LIN28A in HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the effect of LIN28 (S200) phosphorylation on LIN28's association with mRNAs on a transcriptome-wide scale, we performed mRNA-seq on RNAs immunoprecipitated (RIP-seq) by wild-type (WT) or phospho-null (S200A) LIN28 in HeLa cells.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNAs immunoprecipitated by wild-type and phospho-null (S200A) FLAG-LIN28 (in triplicate)

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
