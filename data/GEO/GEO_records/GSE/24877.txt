TITLE
Differential Gene Expression and Clonal Selection during Cellular Transformation Induced by Adhesion Deprivation (A16 vs NA16)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cell substrate adhesion plays an important role in cellular transformation of rat fibroblast cell lines, however a few viable non-adherent fibroblast cells when placed in suspension for a time period of 16 h (NA16) showed varied phenotypic characteristics like colony and tumor formation In order to understand the molecular events associated with adhesion independent cell survival ability of NA16, whole genome profiling was performed using Affymetrix Rat 230_2 GeneChips Keywords: Expression profiling of a adhesion deprived transformed cell line

DESIGN
F111 fibroblast cell lines were grown in adhesion (A16) and suspension (NA16) conditions for 16h. These suspension cells (NA16) were plated on soft agar for colony formation and also injected in nude mice subcutaneously for tumor formation. A16 samples were considered as the control ones. Total RNA isolated from the samples (A16, NA16, Colony and Tumor) was subjected for expression analysis using Affymetrix Rat 230.2 GeneChip System. The experiment was repeated biologically and technically twice.
