TITLE
RORɣt and RORα Signature Genes in Human Th17 Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In an effort to study gene expression modulated by RORɣt and RORα in human Th17 cells, global gene expression of human CD4 T cells activated under Th17 skewing conditions was profiled by RNA sequencing. RORɣt and RORα signature genes were identified in these Th17 cells treated with specific siRNAs to knock down RORɣt or RORα expression. In addition, selective small molecule RORɣt modulators were also utilized as pharmacological tools in RORɣt signature gene identification.

DESIGN
Human CD4 T cells from 2 healthy donors were used in studies. 5.0 × 106 human CD4 T cells were used per sample and cell samples were collected at 0, 24 and 48 hours of Th17 differentiation for gene expression studies with RNA-Seq. For compound treatment, CD4 T cells were pre-treated with compounds or DMSO vehicle control at 37°C for 1 hour before T cell activation. RORγt inverse agonists compound A, B and C were tested at two concentrations and DMSO treatments were used as controls in human Th17 differentiation assays. For siRNA treatment, three RORγt siRNAs, two RORα siRNAs, two control siRNAs were tested at 1 μM, and mock transfected samples were included as controls. siRNA treatment was performed by Amaxa electroporation of human CD4 T cells with siRNAs.. T cells after compound or siRNA treatments were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads (Miltenyi Biotech) at 2:1 bead to cell ratio in culture medium containing 10 ng/ml IL1β (R & D), 10 ng/ml IL23 (R & D), 30 ng/ml TGFβ1 (R & D), 10 μg/ml of anti-IL4 and anti-IFNγ (eBioscience). T cell cultures were collected at different time points for RNA extraction and gene expression studies
