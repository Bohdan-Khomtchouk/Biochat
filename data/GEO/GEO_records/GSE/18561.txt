TITLE
Adult C. elegans: Control daf-2 mutants treated with daf-16 RNAi vs. daf-2 mutants treated with empty vector RNAi

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of adult C. elegans comparing daf-16(-); daf-2(-) animals with adult daf-2(-) animals.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, daf-2 mutants treated with daf-16 RNAi vs. daf-2 mutants treated with empty vector RNAi. Biological replicates: 8 daf-2 mutants treated with daf-16 RNAi vs. daf-2 mutants treated with empty vector RNAi, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL9450 UCSF C. elegans 20K oligo array version 1
