TITLE
miR-671-5p promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by downregulating FOXM1 expression in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA (miRNA) dysfunction is associated with a variety of human diseases including cancer. Our previous study showed that miR-671-5p was deregulated during breast cancer progression. We aim to decipher the functional mechanism of miR- 671-5p in breast cancer. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression after overexpression miR-671-5p in several breast cancer cell lines, and those altered genes might potentially under regulation of miR-671-5p contibuting to breast cancer developemtn.

DESIGN
miR-671-5p or scramble control nucleotide were tranfected into breast cancer cell lines, including MCF7, MDA231 and SKBR3.  Total RNA were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to identify the potential downstream target genes that under miR-671-5p regulation by overexpress miR-671-5p. Potential targets were predicted to see if it has binding sites matching miR-671-5p sequence by miRNA target prediction softwares.
