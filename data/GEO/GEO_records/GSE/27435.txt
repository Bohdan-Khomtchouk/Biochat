TITLE
MicroRNA expression contributes to the poor prognosis of human small cell lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are important cellular components and their dysfunctions are associated with various disease.Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis, but little is know about the underlying machinery that leads to rapid tumor growth and early metastases.In this study, clinical outcome prediction miRNAs were successfully found  through expression profiling of a total of 924 miRNA genes in 42 SCLC cases.

DESIGN
42 patients with respectable very limited disease (training set) were enrolled. All the patients underwent surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy according to the standard of care.   Total RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded （FFPE）specimens, low molecular weight RNA was seperate and labeled , and then hybridized to capitalbio V3 biochip representing about 924 microRNA . three chip were test in each group, and the procedure was repeated twice.
