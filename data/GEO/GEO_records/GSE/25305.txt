TITLE
Tetradecylthioacetic acid effect on heart ventricle

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
Identifying genes that show differential cardiac expression by comparing Atlantic salmon fed with a tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) supplemented diet to those fed a control diet for two sampling time points.

DESIGN
Comparing cardiac gene expression from Atlantic salmon with 2 different diets (TTA and control) and sampled at 2 time points. 6 biological replicates (individuals), totally 24 arrays.
