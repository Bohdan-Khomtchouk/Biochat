TITLE
Differential gene expression along with progression of diet-induced atherosclerotic plaque using Microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the changes in gene expression at different stages of diet-induced atherosclerotic development, double knock out Apobtm2Sgy/Ldltm1Her mice were fed with either high-fat or normal chow diet. The microarray was performed using total RNA extracted from ascending aorta of the animals.

DESIGN
Double knockout mice fed with rich cholesterol diet and a normal diet were sacrificed after 0, 4, 8, 14 and 20 weeks and RNA was extracted for Microarray analysis

PLATFORM
GPL18406 Agilent-026986 Custom Whole Genome Mouse 8x60k designed by Genotypic Technology Pvt. Ltd. Feature Number
