TITLE
In vitro transcriptomic comparison of daptomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus ; Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus NCTC 8325

SUMMARY
Mutants from SG511 and NCTC8325 (wild type isolates) resistant to daptomycin were obtained following serial passage experiments in vitro. Transcriptomic experiments showed alteration in the expression of genes involved in various pathways including general metabolism, cell wall regulon and lipid metabolism.

DESIGN
Microarray was used to evaluate alteration in the transcriptome between wild type strains SG511 and NCTC8325 and their daptomycin resistant isolates, in antibiotic-free medium.

PLATFORM
GPL7137 Agilent-017903 Staphylococcus aureus V5 Bis 15K (basic)
