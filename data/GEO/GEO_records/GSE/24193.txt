TITLE
Dioxin exposure of human CD34+ hemopoietic cells induces gene expression modulation that recapitulates its in vivo clinical and biological effects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has a large number of biological effects, including skin, cardiovascular, neurologic disease, diabetes, infertility and cancer. We analysed the in vitro TCDD effects on human CD34+ cells and tested the gene expression modulation by means of microarray analyses before and after TCDD exposure. We identified 253 differentially modulated probe sets, identifying 217 well-characterized genes. A large part of these were associated with cell adhesion and/or angiogenesis and with transcription regulation. Synaptic transmission and visual perception functions, with the particular involvement of the GABAergic pathway, were also significantly modulated. Numerous transcripts involved in cell cycle or cell proliferation, immune response, signal transduction, ion channel activity or calcium ion binding, tissue development and differentiation, female or male fertility or in several metabolic pathways were also affected after dioxin exposure. The transcriptional profile induced by TCDD treatment on human CD34+ cells strikingly reproduces the clinical and biological effects observed in individuals exposed to dioxin and in biological experimental systems.

DESIGN
This series of microarray experiments contains the gene expression profiles of highly purified human CD34+ cells separated from the leukapheresis of normal donors stimulated with G-CSF and analyzed before and after in vitro TCDD (20 nM, 12h) exposure. 3 micrograms of total RNA were processed and 15 micrograms of fragmented biotin-labelled cRNA were hybridized to the Affymetrix HG-U133A chip following the manufacturer's instructions.
