TITLE
CGH data from 58 bladder tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present the first computational approach to reconstruct the sequence of copy number alterations driving carcinogenesis from the analysis of several tumor samples of a same patient. Applied to BAC array-CGH and SNP array data from bladder and breast cancers, this method proved highly valuable to establish the clonal relationships between primary tumors and recurrences and to identify the chromosome aberrations at the initiation of tumorigenesis. Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization

DESIGN
An algorithm was developed to reconstruct tumors lineage and the sequence of copy number alterations along tumorigenesis from the analysis of several samples from a same patient. The data here consist in CGH data from 58 bladder tumors. 50 of these tumors come from independent samples and were used to compute the frequencies of breakpoints at each location. The 8 other samples (S1_A, S1_B, S2_A, S2_B, S3_A, S3_B, S3_C and S3_D) are multiple tumors from 3 patients. They were used to reconstruct the sequence of chromosome aberrations along cancer development in these 3 patients.
