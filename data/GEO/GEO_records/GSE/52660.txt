TITLE
Effects of differentiated hMADS adipocytes on BT474 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression levels of HER2-positive breast cancer cells exposed to the conditioned medium from adipocytes. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that adipocytes secrete factors that induce the resistance of cancer cells to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediated by trastuzumab. The results provide insight into the genes that may be involved in the adipocyte-induced cancer resistance to trastuzumab treatment.

DESIGN
BT474 cells or SKBR3 cells were exposed to the conditioned medium (CM) from differentiated hMADS (#hMADS) or to the control medium for 2 h. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed. The experiment was performed in triplicate.
