TITLE
Hela SPAG4 siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to clarify the downstream target genes of SPAG4, we performed knockdown of SPAG4 using siRNA both under normoxia and hypoxia.

DESIGN
Hela cells are cultured for 24 hours under normoxia and hypoxia after knocking down of SPAG4 using different sequences of siRNA.
