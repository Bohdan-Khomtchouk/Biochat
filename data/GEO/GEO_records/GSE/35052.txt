TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for DNA copy number analysis of supernatant DNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA contained in the supernatant of cultured malignant cells as well as from plasma/serum of cancer patients is able to transform recipient immortal murine NIH3T3 cells. We demonstrate for the first time that human circulating DNA is able to drive tumor progression in an immunocompetent colon carcinogenesis rat model and that treatment with DNAse I/proteases has antitumor effects in a xenograft nude mice model. DNA copy number analysis of the DNA purifed from the supernatat of SW480 cell cultures was analyzed to determine if specific regions of the genome are represented in this fraction.

DESIGN
We hybridized genomic DNA from parental SW480 cells, the DNA isolated from supernatant of SW480 cells, onto the 500K Affymetrix genotyping array set, following the manufacturerÂ´s instructions, and compared their DNA copy number profile against a common reference generated using data from the International HapMap project.
