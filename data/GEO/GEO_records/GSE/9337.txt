TITLE
Agricultural fungicides to gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae upon exposure to toxic doses

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Correlations between the chemical structures of agricultural fungicides and mRNA expression levels following exposure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to toxic doses of thiuram, zineb, maneb, TPN, and PCP were examined. Structurally, thiuram, zineb, and maneb are dithiocarbamate fungicides, whereas TPN and PCP are not. To characterize chemical toxicity, genes expression was classified according to the functional groups used by the MIPS database. However, no correlations between the classification scheme and chemical structures were found. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles was performed to characterize the effects of the five chemicals. According to this analysis the similarity of gene expression profiles depended on the similarity of chemical structures. These results suggest that DNA microarray technology has potential for predicting the major chemicals which will cause environmental toxicity and will provide information on new biomonitoring methods. Keywords: stress response
