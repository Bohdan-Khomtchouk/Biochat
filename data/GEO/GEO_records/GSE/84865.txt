TITLE
Ebola virus glycoprotein variant with increased infectivity for human cells dominated the 2013-2016 outbreak

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The unprecedented magnitude of the 2013-2016 Makona Ebola virus (M-EBOV) epidemic likely resulted from multiple epidemiologic factors that set it apart from previous outbreaks. Nonetheless, genetic adaptations that distinguish M-EBOV from previous isolates may also have contributed to the scale of the epidemic. Of particular interest is a M-EBOV glycoprotein (GP) variant, GP-A82V, that was first detected at the inflection point of the 2013-2016 outbreak - when the number of cases increased exponentially - and which completely supplanted the earlier M-EBOV sequence. We found that, as compared with the earlier strain, GP-A82V increased the ability of M-EBOV to fuse with and infect cells of primate origin, including human blood dendritic cells, without altering innate immune signaling in target cells. Residue 82 is located at the NPC1-binding site on M-EBOV GP and the increased infectivity of GP-A82V was restricted to cells from species in which the NPC1 orthologue bears primate-defining residues at the critical interface. We utilized HIV-derived lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with founder and A82V containing M-EBOV GPs to explore the potential that this modification alters how human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) respond to EBOV GP stimulation.

DESIGN
We generated stocks of lentiviral vector bearing one the following three M-EBOV GPs: founder, A82V, and A82V/T230A. These viral stocks were used to challenge MDDCs from two healthy, anonymous human donors. Stimulated MDDCs were harvested at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after viral addition. Gene expression in M-EBOV GP challenged MDDCs was compared to a unstimulated control.
