TITLE
Barley root gene expression during colonisation by Piriformospora indica

ORGANISM
Hordeum vulgare

SUMMARY
The fungal mutualist Piriformospora indica is colonising barley roots thereby mediating various beneficial effects to its host. The interaction is characterised by an initial biotrophic interaction stage which is followed by a cell death-dependent colonisation phase. We used microarrays to identify the global programme of gene expression during the colonisation process of barley roots by P. indica and  to obtain informations into plant defense and metabolic reprogramming.
