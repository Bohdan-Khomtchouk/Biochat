TITLE
Expression data from placenta harvested from WT and Pth-null fetuses treated 90 minutes prior with saline or PTH (1-84)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays an essential role in regulating calcium and bone homeostasis in the adult, but whether PTH is required at all for regulating fetal-placental mineral homeostasis is uncertain. To address this we treated Pth-null mice in utero with 1 nmol PTH (1-84) or saline and examined placental calcium transfer 90 minutes later. It was found that placental calcium transfer increased in Pth-null fetuses treated with PTH as compared to Pth-null fetuses treated with saline. Subsequently, to determine the effect of PTH treatment on placental gene expression, in a separate experiment, 90 minutes after the fetal injections the placentas were removed for subsequent RNA extraction and microarray analysis.

DESIGN
12 mouse placentas were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. Of the 12 placenta, 3 were from WT fetuses treated in utero with saline, 3 were from WT fetuses treated in utero with PTH (1-84), 3 were from Pth-null fetuses treated in utero with saline, and 3 were from Pth-null fetuses treated in utero with PTH (1-84).
