TITLE
Effect of carbon monoxide and the CO sensor CooA on gene expression in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough

SUMMARY
Investigating the role of carbon monoxide and a CO sensor protein CooA in the physiology of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough using whole genome expression analysis

DESIGN
Comparison of whole genome expression changes in the wild type and a strain deleted for CooA (DVU2097) in the presence and absence of carbon monoxide
