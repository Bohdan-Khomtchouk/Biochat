TITLE
Gene expression data from forelimb buds of E10.5 mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify Pax3 targets during myogenesis in the mouse embryo

DESIGN
Mouse embryos were genotyped Pax3GFP/+ or Pax3PAX3-FKHR/GFP and dissected at E10.5 under a fluorescent binocular. The forelimb buds were dissected and dissociated and GFP positive cells were then sorted by flow cytometry before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We also sorted GFP negative cells.
