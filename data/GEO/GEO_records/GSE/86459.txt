TITLE
A global view of RNA-protein interactions reveals novel root hair cell fate regulators

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis thaliana root epidermis is comprised of two cell types, hair and nonhair cells, which differentiate from the same precursor. Although the transcriptional programs regulating these events are well studied, post-transcriptional factors functioning in this cell fate decision are mostly unknown. Here, we globally identify RNA-protein interactions and RNA secondary structure in hair and nonhair cell nuclei. This analysis reveals distinct structural and protein binding patterns across both transcriptomes, allowing identification of differential RNA binding protein (RBP) recognition sites. Using these sequences, we identify two RBPs that regulate hair cell development. Specifically, we find that SERRATE functions in a microRNA-dependent manner to inhibit hair cell fate, while also terminating hair growth in differentiated hair cells independent of microRNAs. Additionally, we show that GLYCINE-RICH PROTEIN 8 alleviates phosphate starvation stress while promoting hair cell fate. In total, this global analysis reveals novel post-transcriptional regulators of plant root epidermal cell fate.

DESIGN
Protein interaction profile sequencing (PIP-seq) in the nuclei of Arabidopsis thaliana root hair or nonhair cells.  These are crosslinked with formaldehyde and treated with two RNases (ssRNase and dsRNase) with two replicates

PLATFORM
