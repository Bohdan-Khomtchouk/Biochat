TITLE
Expression data from NPA treated stems of Arabidopsis thaliana.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In-vivo induced establishment and activity of the interfascicular cambium in Arabidopsis thaliana stems under NPA treatments. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the establishment and activity of the interfascicular cambium.

DESIGN
3 mm stem pieces were collected after being in treated with NPA for a week in order to stop the polar auxin transport and induce secondary growth. Collected samples were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We aimed to obtain genes responsible for auxin-indueced cambium establishment and activity.
