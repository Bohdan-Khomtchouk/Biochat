TITLE
Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) in organ transplantation and the effects of carbon monoxide treatment

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) in organ transplantation remains a significant problem with limited alternative therapeutic options. Organs that undergo significant damage during IRI, particularly those enduring long warm ischemia times, undergo significant delayed graft function (DGF) after reperfusion and tend to have greater complications long term with the onset of chronic rejection. The gas molecule carbon monoxide (CO) has emerged as an agent that can suppress IRI in rodent models of solid organ transplantation. Since the use of CO is a potential therapeutic modality in humans, we tested if CO can prevent DGF in a pig model of kidney transplantation Keywords: stress response, treatment response
