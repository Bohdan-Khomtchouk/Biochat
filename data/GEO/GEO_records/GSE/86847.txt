TITLE
The developmental transcriptome profiling reveals an abundant GosB that regulates cell cycle, proliferation and apoptosis

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Background: In bovines, the development and growth of skeletal muscle involves many physiological processes and plays an extremely important role in the quality of beef, however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differences in meat quality are largely unknown. Therefore, a cattle muscle transcriptome analysis was performed to compare gene expression profiles between embryonic stage and adult stage. Results: Total RNAs from the Qinchuan cattle skeletal muscle at fetal and adult stages were used to construct libraries for Illumina next-generation sequencing using Ribo-Zero RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) method. We found a total of 19,695 genes were expressed in the embryo and adult, and 3,299 and 433 genes were present only in the embryo and adult, respectively. Over 5,000 unigenes were significantly different (P < 0.05) when comparing fetal and adult patterns. We further characterized GosB, which was abundant in skeletal muscle, as the candidate gene to explore its role in cattle development. GosB increased the number of C2C12 myoblasts in S phase, and decreased the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase. GosB promoted proliferation and protect the C2C12 cells from apoptosis via regulating Bcl-2 expression and controlling the intracellular calcium concentration. Conclusions: Modulation of GosB expression in muscle tissue may emerge as potent tool to control myoblast number in the cattle.

DESIGN
Six longissimus muscle samples from Qinchuan cattles of two developmental states (embryonic, 90 d; and adult, 24 M old) were collected from Yiming abattoir, a local slaughterhouse of Xiâ€™An, P.R. China.
