TITLE
Transcriptomic Analysis of Placenta Affected by Antiphospholipid Antibodies: Following the TRAIL of trophoblast death

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Antiphospholipid antibodies, a maternal risk factor for preeclampsia, increase shedding of necrotic trophoblast debris from the placenta, leading to endothelial dysfunction. Using Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2 microarrays, we found changes in the transcriptome of placental explants treated with antiphospholipid antibodies including seven mRNAs encoding for genes BCL2L1, MCL1, PDCD2L, FASLG, SEMA6A, PRKCE and TRAIL that are involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry confirmed a reduction in TRAIL expression. These results may help to understand how antiphospholipid antibodies affect trophoblast cell death and how the antibodies could contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.

DESIGN
Three different first-trimester placentas (8-8.5 weeks gestation) were dissected into 6 explants each and cultured either with antiphospholipid antibodies (25ug/mL) or untreated media for 16h. RNA was extracted from treated placental explants and Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2 arrays were conducted to investigate changes in mRNA expression. Untreated: 1UNT, 2UNT, 3UNT Antiphospholipid antibody treatment: 1APL, 2APL, 3APL Biological replicates: 1, 2, 3
