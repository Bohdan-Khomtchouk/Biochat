TITLE
Molecular control of myeloid suppressors by death pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to evaluate the mechanisms distinguishing the different forms of myeloid suppressors in cancer and inflammation, and their indivdual roles in T cell suppression

DESIGN
We used microarrays to profile the expression profile of myeloid suppressor cells in mouse and human samples. The starting point is the attached arrays which use different CD11+ or CD14+ selections to crudely separate the myeloid suppressors from other immune cells. The overall study is an initial step towards much higher resolution genetics studies to determine the functional prathways used by myeloid suppressors to inhibit T-cells.
