TITLE
Expression data from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants in interaction with different Trichoderma strains

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Trichoderma harzianum T34 is a fungal strain able to promote the plant growth and to increase plant defense responses. Trichoderma harzianum transformants expressing the amdS gene, encoding an acetamidase, of Aspergillus nidulans produce a higher plant development than the wild type T34. We used microarrays to analyze the physiological and biochemical changes in tomato plants produced as consequence of interaction with Trichoderma harzianum T34 and amdS transformants

DESIGN
Aerial parts of tomato plants in interaction with different Trichoderma strains were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affimetrix microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL4741 [Tomato] Affymetrix Tomato Genome Array
