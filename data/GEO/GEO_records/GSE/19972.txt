TITLE
Expression Data from Ectopic expression of SUMO-1 in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transgenic C. elegans strains that express human SUMO-1 under the control of pan-neuronal (aex-3) or pan muscular (myo-4) promoters were assayed for gene expression changes.

DESIGN
Control N2 non transgenic worms were compared to aex-3::His-SUMO-1 and myo-4::His-SUMO-1 worms in 3 biological replicate populations
