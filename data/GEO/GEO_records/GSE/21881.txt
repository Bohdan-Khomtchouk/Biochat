TITLE
BS-90 strain resistance in M-line Biomphalaria glabrata

ORGANISM
Biomphalaria glabrata

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles ofBS-90 snails sized 8-12mm exposed to E. paraensei (BS-90 are susceptible) and S. mansoni (BS-90 are resistant) and unexposed controls Keywords: Dose response

DESIGN
Five individual snails from the treatment group were pooled to make up 3 repliactes.  After exposure to the indicated parasite snails were collected and RNA was isolated at 12hours, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 days. Three unexposed control groups were also analyzed.
