TITLE
Normal vs Testoterone treated thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This laboratory is focusing on to clarify the biologic relevance of a virulence factor known as trans-sialidase from Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of the Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis).

DESIGN
The impact of hormones in the thymus is observed by gene expression profiling. Differences in the responses of the thymic epithelial cells to androgens is observed using the GLYCOv2 chips, comparing samples treated vs untreated with testosterone. At present we have analyzed by the glyco chips the differential expression of genes among sexes in thymocytes taken from female vs male mice. To have a full picture of the differences in gene expression in the thymus, thymic epithelial cells have to be analyzed. At present we have pinpointed the primary culture of these cells and their in vitro stimulation with androgens. Thus we analyzed the differential expression among testosterone treated and untreated cells.
