TITLE
Skeletal muscle myoblasts: GATA4-Wt, -KO, -OE; day 0, 3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression in satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts islolated from Gata4-loxP mice. Myoblasts were infected with nLacZ for control (Wt), Cre recombinase to knockout GATA4 (KO), or GATA4 expression vector to overexpress GATA4 (OE). Infected myoblasts were cultured in growth medium (day 0) then differentiated into myotubes in differentiation medium for 3 days (day 3).

DESIGN
Total 18 samples. Three replicates in each myoblast; GATA4-Wt, -KO, and -OE myoblasts at day 0 and day 3.

PLATFORM
