TITLE
Expression data from 7-day-old dark-grown wild-type and dez mutant seedlings from control (1 µM) and high-Zn (100 µM) media

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The transition between growth in the dark (skotomorphogenesis) and growth in the light (photomorphogenesis) is one of the most critical in plant development. Here the newly identified mutant dez is photomorphogenic in the dark and is strongly enhanced in high Zn. dez displays a shortened hypocotyl, expanded cotyledons, an elongated root and differentiated plastids in the dark contrast to wild-type seedlings that are typically skotomorphogenic, with a long hypocotyl and unexpanded cotyledons protected by an apical hook, and undifferentiated etioplasts We used microarrays to identify transcripts regulated in dez in high-Zn relative to wild-type in high-Zn, and dez in high-Zn relative to dez in control conditions.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of each genotype and condition (wild-type and dez, control and high-Zn) consisting of ~45 7-day-old seedlings each were harvested in dim green light and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted and hybridised to the Affymetrix ATH1 chip
