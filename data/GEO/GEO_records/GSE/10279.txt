TITLE
Khd1p associated mRNAs

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RNA-coimmunopurifications with TAP-tagged Khd1 protein from Saccharomyces cereviseae. Untagged strain (BY4741) served as a control (Gerber et al., 2004). Cells were grown to midlog phase in rich media and harvested by centrifugation. TAP-tagged Khd1 was affinity purified from cell-free extracts with IgG sepharose and eluted with TEV protease. RNA was isolated from extract (=input) and from purified protein samples by phenol-chloroform extraction. RNAs were reverse transcribed using a mixture of oligo-dT and random nonamer oligos in the presence of amino-allyl dUTP/ dNTP mixture. cDNAs were fluorescently labeled and hybridized on yeast DNA microarrays over night at 65 degrees. For a detailed procedure see http://microarray-pubs.stanford.edu/yeast_puf and also Gerber AP et al. PLoS Biology, 2004. An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. Strain Name: yeast strain with/without TAP-tagged Khd1 Keywords: all_pairs
