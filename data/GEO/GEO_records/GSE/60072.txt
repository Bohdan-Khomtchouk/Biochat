TITLE
Gene expression analysis in WT-AG-haESCs, DKO-AG-haESCs and round spermatids

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA seq result shows that WT-AG-haESCs and DKO-AG-haESCs samples are clustered together using hierarchical cluster both in the all expression genes and imprinting genes. This suggests that DKO of DMRs of H19 and Gtl2 do not change the overall gene expression patterns in AG-haESCs.

DESIGN
We used round spermatids as control. Using RNA-seq, profile of all the expression genes and imprinting genes beteween different samples were analysed.
