TITLE
KD of Fibroblast specific TF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Combinatorial knock down of LHX9, OSR1, PRRX1, TWIST2, fibroblast specific transcription factors and adipogenic induction by medium change induce transdifferentiation from fibroblast to adipocyte. Adipogenesis from meshencymal stem cell (MSC) and human preadipocyte (PreADP) were used for general reference of adipogenesis.

DESIGN
54 Samples total with 3 replicates each of sample and treatment types.

PLATFORM
