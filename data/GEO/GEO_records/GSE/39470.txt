TITLE
Streptococcus mutans growth-phase effects: wild-type(WT) vs. lytS-deficient mutant (lytS)

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of S. mutans cells comparing WT cells with lytS cells at early- and late-exponential growth phase.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, WT vs. lytS cells and optical density (600nm) 0.2 vs. 0.9. Biological replicates: 4 wild-type, 4 lytS mutant, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL15711 JCVI PFGRC Streptococcus mutans 13K v3 array designed primarily based on strain UA159 [ORF version]
