TITLE
Differential Gene Expression between MCF10A and MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These RNA-seq data were generated to correlate with genomic interaction data in a related Hi-C analysis.  MCF10A is a normal-like mammary epithelial cell line and MCF7 is a transformed estrogen responsive breast cancer cell line derived from a metastatic site; both are commonly used in models of breast cancer progression.  Analysis revealed a set of genes related to repression of WNT signalling that were both up-regulated in MCF7 and located in genomic regions that had transitioned from closed to open structure in MCF7.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of MCF10A and MCF7 cells. 3 replicates each.  Sequencing was strand-specific and conducted on ribo-depleted RNA.
