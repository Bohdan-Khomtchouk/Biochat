TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Neurospora crassa conidia undergoing germling fusion: Δpp-1 vs WT

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa OR74A

SUMMARY
To study the consequences of transcription factor pp-1 deletion during vegetative cell fusion, we sequenced mRNA of WT and Δpp-1 conidia during a period of intense germling fusion activity .

DESIGN
The,WT,(FGSC2489),and,Δpp1,strains,were,analyzed

PLATFORM
