TITLE
Functional analysis of ABCB5 in melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Functional analysis of ABCB5 in A375 and G3361 melanoma cells, by comparing stably-transfected controls to ABCB5-shRNA-targeted cells.

DESIGN
12 samples total. Replicates n=3 for the following 4 groups: A375 pSUPER-retro-puro-Vector vs. A375 pSUPER-retro-puro-ABCB5-KD; G3361 pSUPER-retro-puro-shCNTRL vs. G3361 pSUPER-retro-puro-ABCB5-KD.
