TITLE
Comparison of Wild type and Pofut1-deleted skeletal muscle in young and old mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pofut1 is an essential gene that glycosylates proteins containing EGF-like repeats, including Notch Receptors (NotchRs).  Work in mice and in Drosophila has shown that O-fucosylation by Pofut1 is required for NotchR ligands to bind to and activate NotchRs.  As such, Pofut1 deletion in skeletal myofibers allows for an analysis of potential functions and molecular changes of Pofut1 in skeletal muscle that derive from its expression in skeletal myofibers. In this study we compared gene expression profiles between quadriceps muscles in young (2 month) and old (17 month) mice where Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (Pofut1) was deleted specifically in skeletal myofibers via use of a human skeletal alpha actin Cre transgene (Scre) and a loxP flanked Pofut1 gene (SCreFF) and mice which bore the only the Scre transgene but did not have floxed Pofut1 alleles (SCre++).

DESIGN
A total of eighteen samples in three groups were analyzed for this study. The first group is Pofut1flox/flox quadriceps. The second group is Skeletal α actin cre/Pofut1 wild type quadriceps. The third group is skeletal α actin cre/Pofut1flox/flox quadriceps. For each group, three of the samples are replicates from young (2 month) mice, and three of the samples are replicates from old (17 month) mice.
