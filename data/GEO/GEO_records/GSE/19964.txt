SUMMARY
The future clinical use of embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based hepatocyte replacement therapy depends on the development of an efficient procedure for differentiation of hepatocyes from ESCs. Here we report that a high density of human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived fibroblast-like cells (hESdFs) supported the efficient generation of hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) with functional and mature hepatic phenotypes from primate ESCs and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Molecular and immunocytochemistry analyses revealed that hESdFs caused a rapid loss of pluripotency and induced a sequential endoderm-to-hepatocyte differentiation in the central area of ESC colonies. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that pluripotent stem cells were directed toward endodermal and hepatic lineages by FGF2 and Activin A secreted from hESdFs. Furthermore, we found that the central region of ESC colonies was essential for the hepatic endoderm-specific differentiation, as its removal caused a complete disruption of endodermal differentiation. In conclusion, we describe a novel in vitro differentiation model, and show that hESdF-secreted factors act in concert with regional features of ESC colonies to induce robust hepatic endoderm differentiation in primate pluripotent stem cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA were isolated from ORMES6 ESC, differentiated cells at IVDS2 and 3, and cells in the central foci (IVDS2-C) and peripheral (IVDS2-P) area of ESC colonies at IVDS2. Each condition was repeated twice and used ORMES6 ESC as control.
