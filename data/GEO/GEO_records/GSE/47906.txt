TITLE
Expression data from a new lymphoid stromal population

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lymph node (LN) stromal cells provide survival signals and adhesive substrata to lymphocytes. During an immune response, B cell follicles enlarge, questioning how LN stromal cells manage these cellular demands. Herein, we used a murine fate mapping system to describe a new stromal cell type that resides in the T cell zone of resting LNs. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression characterizing this new population of lymphoid stromal cells.

DESIGN
Mice lymph nodes were collected and digested before cell sorting and RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of lymphoid stromal cells in order to increase expression profiles.
