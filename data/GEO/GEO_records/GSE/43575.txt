TITLE
A Prader-Willi locus lncRNA cloud modulates diurnal genes and energy expenditure.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a genetic cause of childhood obesity, is characterized by intellectual disabilities and sleep abnormalities. PWS-causing deletions include a neuronal long, non-coding RNA (lncRNA) processed into small nucleolar RNAs and a spliced lncRNA,116HG. We show that 116HG forms a subnuclear RNA cloud that co-purifies with the transcriptional activator RBBP5 and active metabolic genes, remains tethered to the site of its transcription and increases in size in postnatal neurons. Snord116del mice lacking 116HG exhibited increased energy expenditure corresponding to dysregulation of diurnally expressed Mtor and circadian genes Clock, Cry1, and Per2. Genomic and metabolic analyses demonstrate altered diurnal energy regulation in the Snord116del mouse cortex and link the loss of 116HG to the energy imbalance observed in PWS.

DESIGN
Examination of lncRNA binding sites by ChIRP-seq using an oligo-based purification method from WT and Snord116del (+/-) mouse brain with specific and nonspecific control oligos.  Transcript abundance levels by RNA-seq analysis of 3 adult WT and 2 adult Snord116del (+/-) mouse brain cortices at Zt+6 and 2 adult WT and 2 adult Snord116del (+/-) mouse brain cortices at Zt+16.
