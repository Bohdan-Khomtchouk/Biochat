TITLE
DNA methylation analysis of human skeletal muscle after endurance training

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Regular endurance exercise training induces beneficial functional and health effects in human skeletal muscle. The putative contribution to the training response of the epigenome as a mediator between genes and environment has not been clarified. Here we investigated the contribution of DNA methylation and associated transcriptomic changes in a well-controlled human intervention study. Training effects were mirrored by significant alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression in regions with a homogeneous muscle energetics and remodeling ontology. Differential DNA methylation predominantly occurred in regulatory enhancer regions, where known binding motifs of MRF, MEF2 and ETS proteins were identified. A transcriptional network analysis revealed modules harboring distinct ontologies, and interestingly the overall direction of the changes of methylation within each module was inversely correlated to expression changes. In conclusion, we show that highly consistent and associated modifications in methylation and expression, concordant with observed health-enhancing phenotypic adaptations, are induced by a physiological stimulus.

DESIGN
DNA samples from vastus lateralis muscle bisopsies were included in the study. Specifically, 23 subjects performed three months of supervised endurance training. Biospies were taken at rest, before and after training. DNA methylation levels were profiled using Illumina 450K arrays.
