TITLE
Expression data from wild type or Gdap1-null Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression data from wild type or Gdap1-null Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts before and 4 days after transduction with the reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cell reprogramming

DESIGN
Total RNA from wild type or Gdap1-null Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts was extracted before or at day 4 of reprogramming and hybridised on affymetrix microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
