TITLE
A novel capsule-mediated virulence mechanism in a bacterial pathogen

ORGANISM
Bordetella pertussis

SUMMARY
Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, produces a microcapsule at its surface but its role in pertussis pathogenesis remained to be investigated.Absence of KpsT, a membrane-associated protein involved in the polysaccharide transport resulted in the down-modulation of a large number of virulence genes which correlated with strong attenuation in vivo.

DESIGN
One condition experiment, DeltaKpsT against WT. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 mutants replicates.
