TITLE
Gene expression changes in alpha GABA receptors in the mice brains after prolonged ketamine administration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of global gene epression changes in the mouse prefrontal cortex after long term treatment with sub-aesthetics dose of ketamine.

DESIGN
We analyzed brain tissues from 2 ketamine treated mice and 2 saline treated mice using the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 st v1 platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No techinical replicates were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
