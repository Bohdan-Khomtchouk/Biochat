TITLE
Expression profiling of fetal mammary cells that express ectopic levels of Sox10

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We use RNA-sequencing to generate gene expression profiles of fetal mammary cells that have been induced to overexpress Sox10.  These data highlight multiple  important molecular mechanisms that are altered in response to this perturbation, and offer a resource to probe the basis of the stem/progenitor and EMT-like functions that are mediated by Sox10 in mammary cells.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of fetal mammary cells that express ectopic levels of Sox10
