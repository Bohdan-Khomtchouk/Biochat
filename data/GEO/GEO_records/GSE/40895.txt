TITLE
Identification of transcriptional signatures overlapping in pancreatic ductal development, acute pancreatitis and KrasG12D-driven carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the molecular basis of gene regulation in pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, we developed methods for the isolation of this cell population during mouse development and normal adult homeostasis, as well as in conditions with ductal features (acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)). Our technique utilizes the specificity of Dolichos biflorus Agglutinin (DBA) lectin marking the entire normal ductal tree, including terminal intercalated ducts (putative sites of stem or progenitor cells) and ductal structures in ADM and PanIN. We used ferromagnetic-labeled DBA lectin to isolate ductal structures. Ductal cells were isolated under the following conditions: (1) Embryonic Development in wild type mice: E14.5, E15.5, E16.5, and postnatal day 1 (P1); (2) Injury and regeneration (pancreatitis) 0, 1, 3, 5 days following cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Cerulein is a cholecystokinin analog which produces a self-limited pancreatitis with injury and subsequent regeneration and repair, completed five days after insult; and (3) Pdx1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice aged 10 and 20 weeks that harbor PanIN lesions and a subset develop PDAC. Ductal/PanIN cells were isolated from these mice and appropriate control mice (Pdx1-Cre;Kras+/+).

DESIGN
Expression profiling of ductal cells at embryonic days 14.5, 15.5, 16.5 and post-natal day 1 as well as days 0, 1, 3 and 5 after acute ceruelin-induced pancreatitis and 10/20 weeks aged Pdx1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice.
