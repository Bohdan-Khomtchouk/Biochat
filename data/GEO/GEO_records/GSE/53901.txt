TITLE
Microarray analysis of the Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) brains

ORGANISM
Lates calcarifer

SUMMARY
In this study, we attempt to characterize the transcriptomic profile of the Asian seabass brains collected from the male and female sexes. The objective is to identify genes that show sexually dimorphic expression in the brain of this species.   For this experiment, Asian seabass were collected from the Marine Aquaculture Center of the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore. There were no treatments carried out in this experiment. Four brains from adult male seabass (5 years old) with M3-type testis and four brains from adult female seabass (5 years old) with F3-type ovaries were used in this experiment. (Gonads were examined by histology and classified according to sexual maturation status as described by Guiguen and colleagues (Guiguen et al. Environmental Biology of Fishes, 1994)).

DESIGN
Total 8 samples. Male Brain : 4 Female Brain : 4
