TITLE
Transcriptomics of cryophilic Saccharomyces kudriavzevii reveals the key role of gene translation efficiency in cold stress adaptations

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Saccharomyces kudriavzevii

SUMMARY
Comparative genome-wide gene expression analysis between a wine yeast strain belonging to the species S. cerevisiae and the type strain from S. kudriavzevii IFO1802, a cryotolerant yeast, in natural must fermentations.

DESIGN
RNA samples taken from wine fermentations at 12ºC and 28ºC at the beginning of exponential phase. Three biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL17965 UHNMAC Yeast 6.4 K array (Y6.4K) version 7 [Probe-level version]
