TITLE
Small RNA from W23 maize anthers at 1mm, 1.5mm, and 2mm

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Illumina small RNA sequence data from maize anthers at 3 stages - 1mm, 1.5mm, and 2mm.

DESIGN
Plants were field-grown and then anthers dissected and grouped according to length.  RNA was extracted using TriReagent protocol.  Each of the 3 sample types were sequenced separately.
