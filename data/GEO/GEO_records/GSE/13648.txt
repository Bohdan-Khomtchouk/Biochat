TITLE
Global identification of yeast chromosome interactions using genome conformation capture

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine the global chromosomal interaction map for exponentially growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells using Genome Conformation Capture. Interactions between chromosomes were identified within a population of yeast cells growing exponentially in a semi-defined medium containing glucose. The series contains the sequences of the ligated restriction fragments that identified the interactions.

DESIGN
A GCC library was prepared, using MspI, from 1.5 x 10^5 cells and sequenced. Data was processed using the Flp_spin_man program suite in conjunction with SOAP (Rodley C.D., Bertels F., Jones B., and O'Sullivan J.M., submitted). The software package initially sorted sequences according to the presence or absence of the MspI restriction site. Sequences containing the restriction site were broken, in silico, and their positions mapped onto the yeast genome (using SOAP). Thus regions of the genome that were in close enough proximity to be cross-linked and subsequently ligated together were identified.
