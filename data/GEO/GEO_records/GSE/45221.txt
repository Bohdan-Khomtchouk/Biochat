TITLE
Pharmacogenomic profiling of Akt in helper T cell activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
1) identify, at the genome-wide level, the genes that are differentially expressed in activated Th cells, with or without Akt inhibition and 2) conduct bioinformatics analyses to identify the pathways and possible mechanisms involved.

DESIGN
First identify the differentially expressed genes  at 2,6 and 12h time points after TCR stimulation compared with 0h time point in the absence of Akti1/2 and presence of Akti1/2 , then identify differentially expressed gene sets that were dependent on Akt among the three different time point groups . There are duplicate samples for each time point.
