TITLE
Diurnal variation for rice leaves in a growth chamber

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Time-course transcriptional profiling to compare progression of subjective time with that in the field. The subjective time was inferred from expressions of multiple circadian clock-related genes. 24-h time series with 2-h interval were sampled for 2 developmental stage with no replicate. Two more varieties were sampled only at 3 time points for plants of 28 days past sown (DPS).
