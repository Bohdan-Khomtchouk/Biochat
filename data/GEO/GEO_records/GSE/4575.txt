SUMMARY
Microarray of exercised (degenerated) rat supraspinatus versus non-exercised (normal) Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
rats were subjected to exercise that consisted of running on a 10Ëš decline at 17m/min for 1 hour per day, 5 days per week. This regimen equates to approximately 7500 strides per day. After four weeks of running, rats were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation and both supraspinatus tendons were collected. 12 non-exercised rats were used as controls.
