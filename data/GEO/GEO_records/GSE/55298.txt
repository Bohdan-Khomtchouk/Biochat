TITLE
Toxoplasma RH and Mock Infection of macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Infection of RAW264.7 cells with RHΔku80 parasites or mock-infection for 24 hours To measure changes in gene expression induced in macropahges upon Toxoplasma infection, we infected RAW 264.7 macrophages in cell culture with RHΔku80 parasites or syringe-lysed human foreskin fibroblast monolayers (mock-infected). RNA was harvested 24 hours post infection.

DESIGN
Cells were infected with Toxoplasma or mock-infected in vitro, in duplicate
