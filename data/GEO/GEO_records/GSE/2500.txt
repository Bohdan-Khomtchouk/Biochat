TITLE
Tiling microarray analysis of japonica and indica rice chromosome 10

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to identify transcribed regions of both japonica and indica rice chromosome 10. A series of high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays that represent sense and antisense strands of the entire nonrepetitive sequence of the chromosome were used to measure transcriptional activities. A total of 750,282 and 838,816 36mer oligonucleotide probes, positioned every 46 nt on average, were designed to interrogating the japonica and the indica chromosome, respectively. The probes were synthesized via maskless photolithography at a feature density of approximately 389,000 probes per slide. The arrays were hybridized with fluorescence-labeled cDNA reverse-transcribed from equal amounts of four selected poly(A)+ RNA populations, namely, seedling roots, seedling shoots, panicles, and suspension cultured cells of the respective rice subspecies.
