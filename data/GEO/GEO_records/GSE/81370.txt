TITLE
Rapid decay of engulfed extracellular miRNA by XRN1 exonuclease promotes transient epithelial-mesenchymal transition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the effect of miR-223-3p expression on the mRNA level we employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes with a potential seed region targeted by miR-223-3p.   A549 cells were transfected for 48h with either a mirVana miRNA mimic Control or miR-223-3p.

DESIGN
Four independent experiments were performed for A549_miRCT. Three independent experiments were performed for A549_miR223.
