TITLE
A high-resolution binding profile of meiotic cohesin in murine spermatocytes reveals accumulation at rDNA loci

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In mammalian spermatocytes and oocytes, cohesin complexes serve several distinct functions including establishing the meiotic chromosome architecture into axes and loops, providing sister chromatid cohesion, protecting telomeres, and supporting meiotic recombination. High-resolution analysis of cohesin binding to meiotic chromosomes, however, remained to be performed, mainly because of the complexity of germ cell development and meiotic chromatin, and of the difficulty obtaining proper meiocyte populations. Here, we established a ChIP-seq approach to identify and characterize the genome-wide binding profile of cohesin specifically in murine spermatocytes. Chromatin binding of cohesin proteins SMC3, present in all cohesin complexes, and SMC1β representing the major meiotic complexes, were analyzed. Both cohesins were much reduced in coding exons as well as in 5’ and 3’ UTRs.  SMC1β cohesin binding sequences coincide in a large fraction with CACA repeats and thus with transcription factor ZSCAN4C binding sites, but also with other TF sites. We observed neither overlap with recombinase DMC1 sites nor with recombination hotspot marker PRDM9 sites. Most interestingly, meiotic cohesin is strongly enriched at 5S ribosomal RNA genes. We hypothesize a role of cohesin in the regulation of meiotic rDNA stability and/or transcription.
