TITLE
Identification of Sox10 target genes by comparative expression profiling

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
RT4D6 Schwannoma cells were treated with siRNA specific for Sox10 and a mutant siRNA. Total RNA from the cells were used to screen for differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
Specific siRNA and mutant siRNA were used.  Two different sets of paired cells were used.  Biotin labeled probes were generated and separate microarray chips were used to detect expression of genes.
