TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in roots from Populus trichocarpa and Populus deltoides colonized with Laccaria bicolor

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
The majority of trees live in association with symbiotic fungi, which facilitate their access to soil nutrients. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis represents a complex biological system involving multifaceted interactions between the two partners. The establishment of the symbiosis depends on various conditions (e.g. climate), but also on the genetic traits of the partners. To evaluate the impact of the genetic predisposition on the development and functioning of ectomycorrhizas, we compared the transcriptome of roots from Populus trichocarpa and Populus deltoides colonized with Laccaria bicolor.
