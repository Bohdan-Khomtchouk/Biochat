TITLE
Colon Cancer cell line YB5 untreated cells vs YB5 treated 24h with Depsipeptide at 20 nM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Study the effect of HDACi Depsipeptide on gene expression. We combined these data with whole genome DNA methylation microarray to test the reactivation of genes that have an hypermethylated promoter region.

DESIGN
We did two independant experiments with 2 untreated and 2 treated different batch of cells
