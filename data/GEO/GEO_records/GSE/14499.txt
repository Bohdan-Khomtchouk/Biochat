TITLE
Effect of BDNF on the APP transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined transgenic (TG) mice expressing human APP695 bearing the double Swedish (671KM > NL) and Indiana (717V > F) amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutations. Lentiviral vectors constitutively expressing BDNF-GFP under control of the CMV/ÃŸ-actin hybrid promoter or GFP alone were injected into the entorhinal cortices of TG mice bilaterally at age 6 months, a time point by which neuropathological degeneration and cell loss are established. Age-matched wild-type littermates underwent sham surgery or injection of lentivirus expressing GFP into the entorhinal cortices bilaterally. Keywords: Treatment effect
