TITLE
Renormalised expression data from 1570 breast cancer related samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An integration of several studies normalized to enable consistent cross-study comparisons and enrichment of the less frequent breast cancer types, enabling detection of new potential cancer driver genes.

DESIGN
Raw Affymetrix CEL files were retrieved from the series GSE2034  GSE11121  GSE20194  GSE1456  GSE2603  GSE6532 GSE20437 GSE1561 GSE7390 GSE5847. Samples were then filtered with a three stage quality control resulting in the final dataset. These were subjected to RMA normalization and then placed on a log2 scale. Samples were stratified by levels of MYC expression with the top quartile defined as High and the bottom quartile defined as Low.
