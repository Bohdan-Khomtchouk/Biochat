TITLE
DNA methylation patterns in twins discordant for ALS reveal concordant signatures of disease [array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our data suggest twin pair specific methylation differences exist in blood that reside in genes that are enriched for neuronal pathways.

DESIGN
methylation profiling, of 5 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for ALS

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
