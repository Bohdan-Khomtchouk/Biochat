TITLE
Expression data from cerebrum in a spontaneous mutant mouse, laggard.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found a new spontaneous mutant mouse, laggard, characterized by general weakness in movements and retardation in growth. We used microarray to identify genes whose expression levels are affected downstream from the mutation.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from the cerebrum of each mutant mouse or its littermate, performing hybridization to Affymetrix DNA chip with cRNA probe. The profiles were compared comprehensively between them to investigate the molecular pathology in the mutant mouse.
