TITLE
Effect of 13 weeks of subchronic exposure to TCDD, PeCDF, PCB126, PCB153 and PCB126/PCB153 on hepatic gene expression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study investigates the effects of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands TCDD, PCB126 and PeCDF; the non-AhR ligand PCB153 and the binary mixture PCB126/PCB153 on hepatic gene expression in female sprague dawley rats. Rats were treated with toxicological equivalent doses of TCDD (100ng/kg), PeCDF (200ng/kg), PCB126 (1000ng/kg) and PCB153 (1000ug/kg) 5 days a week for 13 weeks. Keywords: Environmental pollutant toxicity comparison
