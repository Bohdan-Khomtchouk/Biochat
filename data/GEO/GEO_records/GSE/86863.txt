TITLE
miRNAs in extracellular vesicles prepared from patients with multiple sclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differences in the levels of miRNAs in extracellular vesicles (EVs) between multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and healthy individuals were detected by means of microarray analysis.

DESIGN
In this study, miRNAs were extracted from EVs in the plasma of 4 relapsing-remitting MS patients and 4 sex- and age-matched healthy controls, and applied to array analysis.
