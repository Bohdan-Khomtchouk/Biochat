TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) brain after exposure to environmental concentrations of human pharmaceuticals

ORGANISM
Sparus aurata

SUMMARY
A gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) microarray platform was developed to identify brain gene expression profiles in response to environmental concentrations of human pharmaceuticals.

DESIGN
Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles was conducted among brain of gilthead seabream exposed to Acetaminophen (APAP; analgesic), Carbamazepine (CBZ; anti-epileptic) and Atenolol (AT; Î²-blocker). All groups of samples were also compared with brain of control individuals.

PLATFORM
GPL15601 Agilent-031723 Sparus aurata SAPD_v.3 (Feature Number version)
