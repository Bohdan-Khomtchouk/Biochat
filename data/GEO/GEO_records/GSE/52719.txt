TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of mice lung tissue (2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recombinant-murine S100A8 and the corresponding Cys42 to Ala42 mutant were used at 10 mg/50 ml HBSS administered onto the nares of BALB/C mice. To assess direct effects, mice were sacrificed 1, 4, 6, 12 or 20 h post-inhalation of S100A8 or 12 and 20 h post-inhalation of Ala42S100A8. For comparison with Dex inhalation (used at 10 mg/50 ml HBSS), lungs were harvested 6 and 12 h post administration. Because S100A8 is reported to initiate proinflammatory responses by ligating TLR4 and/or RAGE, a quantitative PCR array was developed to analyse 63 genes, selected to reflect potential acute inflammatory changes induced by ligation of these receptors.

DESIGN
Expression of inflammatory genes was evaluated with the RT-qPCR array. Relative quantities of mRNA in duplicate samples were obtained using the LightCyclerÂ® 480 Software 1.5 and the Efficiency-Method.

PLATFORM
GPL17991 RT-qPCR array 2 (64 genes)
