TITLE
Rhesus macaque aCGH

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Sixteen individual rhesus macaque genomes were compared to a reference macaque genome (R354) on custom-designed sure-print 1M oligonucleotide microarray Agilent (Agilent Technologies) aCGH slide per manufacturerâ€™s recommendations.

DESIGN
a custom designed Agilent array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) platform, which comprises 950,843 unique 60-mer oligonucleotide probes specific to the rhesus macaque reference genome (rheMac2), to compare the genomic DNAs of 17 unrelated rhesus macaques of Indian origin to the genome of an unrelated sample from the same species.
