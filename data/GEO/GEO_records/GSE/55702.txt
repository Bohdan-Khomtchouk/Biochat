TITLE
Lepidium sativum seed germination timecourse

ORGANISM
Lepidium sativum

SUMMARY
This series analyses germinating Lepidium sativum seeds with both temporal and spatial detail. This is a cross species microarray normalisation on Arabidopsis thaliana chips. Performed as part of the vSEED project

DESIGN
Lepidium seeds were dissected into four compartments at seven time points during seed germination. The compartments were the micropylar endosperm (CAP), the non-micropylar endosperm (NME), the radicle and lower hypocotyl (RAD) and the cotyledons (COT). At testa and endosperm rupture the seeds were split into pre- and post- ruptured populations.  Dry seeds were also sampled: as a whole seed (DRY), the radicle and endosperm part (DRYRC) and the dry seed part containing the non-micropylar endosperm and part of the cotyledons (DRYNMC).
