TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in prostate cancer and non-neoplastic tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiles were evaluated in a series of 64 prostate clinical specimens, including 32 cancer and 32 non-neoplastic tissues. For 26 individuals, paired cancer and non-neplastic tissue was available.

DESIGN
Tumor and non-neoplastic tissues were obtained, with appropriate informed consent and Institutional Review Board approval, from untreated prostate cancer patients subjected to radical prostatectomy. Freshly frozen surgical blocks were carefully dissected by the pathologist using H & E-stained sections as a template to identify areas containing at least 70% of tumor or normal cells. The total series comprises 64 clinical specimens, of which 32 from cancer areas and 32 from benign areas. For 26 patients, matched tumor and normal samples were available.
