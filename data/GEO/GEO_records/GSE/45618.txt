TITLE
Expression analysis of BL6 murine megakaryocyte progenitors from bone marrow and fetal Liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
About 10% of Down syndrome (DS) infants are born with a myeloproliferative disorder (DS-TMD) that spontaneously resolves within the first few months of life. About 20-30% of these infants subsequently develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL). In order to understand differences that may exist between fetal and bone marrow megakaryocyte progenitor cell populations we flow sorted megakaryocyte progenitor cells and performed microarray expression analysis. kewywords: Mouse megakaryocyte progenitors

DESIGN
Expression data of flow cytometrically isolated murine megakaryocyte progenitor cells (lin-, Sca-1-, c-kit+, CD150+, CD41+) from C57/BL6 murine fetal liver and bone marrow
