TITLE
Limited systemic sclerosis patients with PAH show biomarkers of inflammation and vascular injury

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Limited systemic sclerosis patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension show biomarkers of inflammation and vascular injury Forty-nine PBMC samples were obtained from 21 lSSc subjects without PAH (lSSc-noPAH), 15 lSSc subjects with PAH (lSSc-PAH), and 10 healthy controls; three subjects provided PBMCs one year later. Genome-wide gene expression was measured for each sample. Gene expression clearly distinguished lSSc samples from healthy controls, and separated lSSc-PAH from lSSc-NoPAH patients.  The gene expression and cytokine profiles of lSSc-PAH patients suggest the presence of activated monocytes, and show markers of vascular injury and inflammation.

DESIGN
Sample vs reference, total RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), 21 lSSc subjects without PAH (lSSc-noPAH), 15 lSSc subjects with PAH (lSSc-PAH), and 10 healthy controls
