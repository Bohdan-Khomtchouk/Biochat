TITLE
Controlled ErbB receptor dimerization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to better understand signaling events following receptor dimerization involving HER2, we have generated an experimental system in which ErbB dimerization can be controlled. We used gene expression microarrays to identify genes and pathways that are differentially activated by HER2 homodimers and HER2 containing heterodimers.

DESIGN
MCF10A-HER2-FKBP-HA cells were treated with AP1510, TGFalpha or heregulin for 48 hrs prior to RNA harvest for array analysis.
