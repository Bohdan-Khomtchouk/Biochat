TITLE
Modulation of mucosal immune responses to Clostridium difficile by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ and microRNA-146b

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BACKGROUND: miRNA have been shown to play an important role during immune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to assess differential expression of miRNA between uninfected and infected mice with Clostridium difficile strain VPI 10463 RESULTS: MicroRNA (miRNA)-sequencing analysis indicated that miR-146b, miR-1940, and miR-1298 were significantly overexpressed in colons of C. difficile-infected mice

DESIGN
Colon of uninfected and C.difficile-infected C57BL6/J WT mice were sampled at day 4 post-infection with Clostridium difficile VPI 10463. The infection dose was 107 cfu/mouse.
