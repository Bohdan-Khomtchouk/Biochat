TITLE
Tissue-specific pioneer factors associate with androgen receptor cistromes and transcription programs.  [microarray]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the in vivo androgen receptor (AR) binding sites in murine prostate, epididymis and kidney in response to physiological androgen testosterone using ChIP-sequencing and gene expression profiling by microarray. From AR cistrome analysis, we identified tissue-specific collaborating factors i.e. FoxA1 in prostate, Hnf4a in kidney and AP2a in epididymis and validated by ChIP-seq. The ChIP experiments have been performed using antibodies specific to AR, FoxA1, Hnf4a, AP-2a and IgG non-specific antibody as a negative control.

DESIGN
Expression profiling by microarray of mouse androgen responsive tissues, prostate, kidney and epididymis castrated and treated with vehicle or testosterone for 3 days or 12 or 24 hours after single testosterone-injection.
