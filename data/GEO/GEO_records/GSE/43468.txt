TITLE
Hepatic Leukemia Factor Reproduces Circadian Resistance To Cell Death

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we examine the regulation of cell death by hepatic leukemia factor (HLF), which is an output regulator of circadian rhythms and is aberrantly expressed in human cancers, using an ectopic expression strategy in JB6 mouse epidermal cells and human keratinocytes.  Ectopic HLF expression inhibited cell death in both JB6 cells and human keratinocytes, as induced by serum-starvation, tumor necrosis factor alpha and ionizing radiation. Microarray analysis indicates that HLF regulates a complex multi-gene transcriptional program encompassing upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes, downregulation of pro-apoptotic genes, and many additional changes that are consistent with an anti-death program.  Collectively, our results demonstrate that ectopic expression of HLF, an established transcription factor that cycles with circadian rhythms, can recapitulate many features associated with circadian-dependent physiological variation.

DESIGN
Murine progenitor cells, JB6 cell line, were stably transformed with an HLF retroviral expression system or vector only control.  Confirmation of HLF ectopic expression was performed with western blot analysis.  Samples were collected from randomly cycling, preconfluent cells maintained in normal growth medium.
