TITLE
Global analysis of NFATc1 binding and histone marks in VEGF-activated endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed the newly mapping of genome-wide NFATc1 binding events in VEGF-stimulated primary cultured endothelial cells, by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). Combined NFATc1 ChIP-seq profile and the epigenetic histone marks revealed that predominant NFATc1-occupied peaks were overlapped with promoter marking but not silencer marking. DNA microarrays with NFATc1 expression or knockdown indicated the predominant NFATc1 binding targets were correlated with induced patterns.

DESIGN
Examination of NFATc1 and two different histone marks in HUVEC in the presence/absense of VEGF.
