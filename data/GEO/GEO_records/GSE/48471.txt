TITLE
Gene expression comparison of P. atrosepticum and it's derivative vasH mutant

ORGANISM
Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI1043

SUMMARY
Effect of mutagenesis of a sigma 54-dependent transcriptional regulator encoding gene vasH (ECA3425) to global gene expression in P. atrosepticum SCRI1043 in planta mimicking conditions.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of the wild-type strain SCRI1043 and the mutant strain ΔvasH were grown in hrp inducing minimal media supplemented with 10% v/v tuber extract untill the culture reached late exponential phase. Differences in the gene expression in SCRI1043 and ΔvasH were analyzed by microarray.
