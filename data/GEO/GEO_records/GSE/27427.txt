TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of pediatric SLE neutrophils and Healthy neutrophils cultured with SLE sera or Interferon

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mature neutrophis were freshly isolated from blood  of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and healthy donors. Illumina microarray was used to assess transcriptional changes between SLE group and Control group. To uderstand further the gene expression difference between SLE and healthy neutrofils, neutrophils from healthy donors were cultured with autologous sera, SLE sera or Interferon and microarray data was used to compare with fresh SLE neutrophils.

DESIGN
(Expt 1) Neutrophils from 21 SLE samples (19 patients) and 12 healthy donors were isolated, and extracted RNAs were used generate microarray data. (Expt 2) Neutrophils isolated from 2 healthy children (not used in the first experiment) were cultured with autologous sera (control), Interferon alpha (100U and 1000U), and 4 SLE sera and 6 SLE sera for 6 hours and RNAs were extract for microarray experiment.
