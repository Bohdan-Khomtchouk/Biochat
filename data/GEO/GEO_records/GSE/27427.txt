TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of pediatric SLE neutrophils and Healthy neutrophils cultured with SLE sera or Interferon

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mature neutrophis were freshly isolated from blood  of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and healthy donors. Illumina microarray was used to assess transcriptional changes between SLE group and Control group. To uderstand further the gene expression difference between SLE and healthy neutrofils, neutrophils from healthy donors were cultured with autologous sera, SLE sera or Interferon and microarray data was used to compare with fresh SLE neutrophils.
