TITLE
Expression data following mitogen stimulation from Jurkat Cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis identified 27 of these 744 p300 and pol II associated genes as significantly increased (pâ‰¤ 0.05) within the first hour following mitogen stimulation Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from Jurkat T-cells treated 0, 30, and 60 min with phorbol ester and ionomycin.  Antisense biotin-labeled RNA (aRNA) suitable for application to the Affymetrix microarray platform was generated using the Ambion MessageAmp 2-Biotin Enhanced kit as suggested by the manufacturer (www.Ambion.com).  Purified biotin-labeled aRNA was fragmented and hybridized to U133 plus 2 GenechipsTM  (Affymetrix), as recommended by the manufacturer.  All samples were hybridized as technical replicates.  Affymetrix U133 plus 2 GenechipsTM contain probe-sets corresponding to over 56,000 targets.
