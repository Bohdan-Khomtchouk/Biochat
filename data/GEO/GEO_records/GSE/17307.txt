TITLE
GRE specific DNA-binding polyamide effect on dexamethasone-stimulated lung adenocarcinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of dexamethasone-stimulated A549 lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells treated with a glucocorticoid response (GR) element (GRE) specific DNA binding polyamide. Polyamide designed to target the sequence 5'-WGWWCW-3' and disrupt GR-mediated gene expression. Effects of the GR antagonist mifepristone  also examined.

DESIGN
A549 cells were treated with compounds for 48 hours before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
