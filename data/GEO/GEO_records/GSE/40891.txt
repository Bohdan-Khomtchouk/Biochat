TITLE
miRNAs expressed in murine CD4+ T cells of splenocyte and lamina propria lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The levels of some murine mRNAs and proteins are expressed discrepantly between the central immune system and the gut immune system in murine colitis. It was possible that RNA interference would result in some of the discrepancy. Thus, we compared microRNAs that are expressed in CD4+ T cells of spleen (SP) and lamina propria (LP) using Il-10+/- mice (C57BL/6 background) in order to reveal the role of miRNAs in murine colitis.

DESIGN
Using 10-week-old female Il-10+/- mice, we investigated the difference in miRNA expressions between CD4+ T cells of spleen and that of lamina propria.
