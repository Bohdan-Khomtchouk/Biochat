TITLE
Differential gene expression in high and low sulfide-producing yeast strains during wine fermentation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Comparison between two commercial wine yeast strains (UCD522 and P29) differing in their production of H2S during wine fermentation.

DESIGN
Due to the characteristics of the strains (commercial, non-standard wine strains), the experiment was duplicated using two completely different platforms and techniques (cDNA-based and in situ synthesized oligonucleotide-based). UCD522 and P29 wine microfermentations were performed in parallel and yeast samples were taken at the stage of fastest fermentation rate. Two biological replicates per yeast strain.
