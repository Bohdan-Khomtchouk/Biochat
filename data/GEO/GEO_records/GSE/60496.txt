TITLE
A database of circadian and diel rhythmic gene expression in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
The mosquito Ae. aegypti is responsible for the transmission of many diseases including yellow fever and Dengue fever. This species exhibits many behaviors that are under diel and circadian control. However, there has been little reporting on gene expression rhythmicity. To study how gene expression is globally regulated by diel and circadian mechanisms, we have undertaken a DNA microarray analysis of Ae. aegypti head and bodies under 12:12 light:dark cycle (LD) and constant dark (DD, free-running) conditions. Zeitgeber Time (ZT) with ZT12 defined as the initiation of the one hour dusk period under the light:dark cycle, and ZT0 defined as beginning of the one hour dawn period. Circadian Time (CT) with CT0 defined as subjective dawn, inferred from ZT0 of the previous light:dark cycle.

DESIGN
This is a 12-plex high definition NimbleGen array design. The Higgs White Eye (Wh) strain of Aedes aegypti was investigated for rhythmic expression during the light/dark phase and constant darkness. Samples were collected every 4 hours for 44 hours in each treatment, and RNA collected from whole head tissue of females that were presumed mated.
