TITLE
ChIP-Seq of ORC2 bound to third instar salivary gland DNA in WT and mutant Drosophila, analyzed by Illumina sequencing

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We analyzed ORC2 ChIP-Seq from hand dissected salivary glands of wandering third instar larvae from OrR or SuUR Drosophila. Goals were to ascertain the difference in binding profile between salivary glands expressing and not expressing the Supressor of UnderReplication protein.

DESIGN
One replicate is included for each of OrR (WT) or SuUR salivary glands.
