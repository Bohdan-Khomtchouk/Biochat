TITLE
Expression data for rno-miR-146a overexpressing cell line HSC-2

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
HSC-2 (hepatic stellate cells line from rat) were stably transfected with rno-miR-146a. Three different clones were selected (S1, S4, S5). We used Affymetrix rat genome RAT230 2.0 chip to monitor global transcriptome changes.

DESIGN
Two passages of each sample were used. Control - HSC-2 and GFPscr.

PLATFORM
