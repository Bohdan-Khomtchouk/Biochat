TITLE
miRNA Expression data from murine hearts of transgenic Clock delta 19/delta 19 mice (Clock mice) and wild type (WT) mice at 4 and 21 months of age

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Mice are on a C57Bl/6J background strain The micorarray approach allows the investigation of changes in miRNA expression between Clock Mutant and Wild Type mice.
