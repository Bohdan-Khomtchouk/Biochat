TITLE
miRNA Expression data from murine hearts of transgenic Clock delta 19/delta 19 mice (Clock mice) and wild type (WT) mice at 4 and 21 months of age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice are on a C57Bl/6J background strain The micorarray approach allows the investigation of changes in miRNA expression between Clock Mutant and Wild Type mice.

DESIGN
There are a total of 12 samples, 3 from Clock Mutant 4 month, 3 from Wild type 4 month, 3 from Clock mutant 21 month and 3 from Wild Type 21 month. Animals were sacrificed at 6 hours into the light phase (ZT 6).

PLATFORM
GPL19117 [miRNA-4] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-4 Array
