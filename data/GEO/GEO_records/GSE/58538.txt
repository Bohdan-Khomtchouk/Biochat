TITLE
Genome wide DNA methylation profiles provide clues to the origin and pathogenesis of germ cell tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Germ cell tumors (GCT) originate from germ cells at different developmental stages (GCT type I – V) They are thought to inherit their methylation profile from (early embryonic) germ cells which undergo a characteristic epigenetic “reset” during maturation. This study aims to provide insight into the developmental timing and underlying biology of the various subtypes of GCTs and their (embryonic) cells of origin by identifying specific and global methylation differences between GCT subtypes. In total, 91 type I-IV GCTs and four cell lines were profiled using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K) platform. The data were pre-processed using a validated pipeline and analyzed using an in-house generated extension of the annotation manifest. Marked methylation differences were identified between GCT subtypes both on the global and local level (i.e. differentially methylated regions, imprinting control regions, promoters, etc). GCT subtypes indeed show major similarities to specific stages of (early) developing embryonic germ cells with regard to their methylation profile. The extended annotation manifest for the Illumina 450K platform and methylation datasets are readily available on GEO (GEO accession: GSE58538, GPL18809), providing an integrated hypothesis generating data source for future research.

DESIGN
91 germ cell tumors of various histologies were investigated for their methylation profile. Methylation detection was performed using Illumina’s HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. 14 type I teratomas (TE) were included of which 6 were located sacral (3 male: I.TE.s.m; 3 female: I.TE.s.f), 4 were located in the testis (I.TE.t) and 3 were located in the ovary (I.TE.o). 30 pure embryonal carcinomas (EC) were included as well as 21 mixed non seminomas (mNS). 12 seminomas of the testis (SE) were included as well as 4 dysgerminomas (their couterpart in the ovary). Finally, 4 spermatocytic seminomas (SS) and three dermoid cysts were analyzed. For a detailed overview the histological classification of germ cell tumors please see the publication linked to this data or associated literature [1-3]. Four cell lines were included, al modelling type II GCTs. Cell lines derived from EC include NT2[4-8], NCCIT [5, 9] and 2102EP[4-8]. TCam-2 closely resembles SE [10-12]. 1. Oosterhuis, J.W. and L.H.
