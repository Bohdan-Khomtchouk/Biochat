TITLE
Hybridization of human oocyte cDNA library on the multi-species oocyte array to assess for gene conservation using a temperature stringency criteria

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human oocyte cDNA library was hybridized on a multi-species oocyte array (Bovine, Mouse, Frog) Temperature stringency criteria was used to evaluate the conservation degree of oocyte genes among vertebrates (Bovine, Mouse, Frog)

DESIGN
2 technical replicates on distinct array were made at each pre-determined hybridization temperature (45°C, 50°C, 55°C), overall, the experiment includes 6 arrays

PLATFORM
GPL10879 Multi-species (Bovine, Mouse, Frog) oocyte 14k array
