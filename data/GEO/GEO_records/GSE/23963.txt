TITLE
Hybridization of human oocyte cDNA library on the multi-species oocyte array to assess for gene conservation using a temperature stringency criteria

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Human oocyte cDNA library was hybridized on a multi-species oocyte array (Bovine, Mouse, Frog) Temperature stringency criteria was used to evaluate the conservation degree of oocyte genes among vertebrates (Bovine, Mouse, Frog)
