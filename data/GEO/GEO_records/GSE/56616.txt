TITLE
Hydrocortisone and Triiodothyronine Regulate Hyaluronate Synthesis in a Tissueâ€“Engineered Human Dermal Equivalent through Independent Pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hydrocortisone (HC) and triiodothyronine (T3) have both been shown to be capable of independently inhibiting hyaluronate (HA, hyaluronic acid) synthesis in a self-assembled human dermal equivalent (human dermal matrix). We sought to investigate the action of these two hormones in concert on extracellular matrix formation and HA inhibition in a tissue engineered human dermal matrix.

DESIGN
RNA preparations were sent to CFG Microarray Core (E). Three replicate samples from each condition were used in the study. The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv4 microarrays.
