TITLE
Altered genes expression profile of Rep2 mutants in Fission Yeast upon HU treatment.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Expression profiles indicate that C-terminal of rep2 is essential for its transactivation activity. Keywords: rep2 mutants cells treated with 8 mM HU for different time points vs wildtype untreated cells
