TITLE
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CYANOBACTERIA AND HETEROTROPHS UNDER DIFFERENT TROPHIC CONDITIONS

ORGANISM
Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 ; Shewanella sp. W3-18-1

SUMMARY
Application of genome-scale 'omics approaches to dissect subcellular pathways and regulatory networks governing interspecies interactions is dependent, at least initially, on the availability of model systems with well-annotated genomes and tractable genetics.

DESIGN
We employed controlled cultivation and next-generation sequencing technology to identify transcriptional responses of euryhaline unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and a marine facultative aerobe Shewanella putrefaciens W3-18-1 to investigate the effect of C sources and C flux directions on the interactions between these organisms.
