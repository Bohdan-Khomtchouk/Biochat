TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Dop1R2 RNAi in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The process of metamorphosis relies on choreography of temporal and spatial cues that mediate, in which inappropriate activation of many of these genes results in growth defects, developmental delay and death.  Using RNA interference, we have unraveled an essential role for the insect specific dopamine 1(D1)-like receptor Dop1R2 at the late larval/prepupal stage.  We used microarrays to evaluate differentially expressed genes during the early/pale pupal stage and identified up-regulation of families of functionally related genes, including ecdysone induced genes, stress and defense/immune response genes, and those that underlie tissue morphogenesis.

DESIGN
Drosophila Dop1R2 RNAi or w1118 control early/pale pupae were collected from crosses maintained at 29C.  These tissues were processed for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (DrosGenome1).  Results were used to assess differential expression of genes in Dop1R2 RNAi verses control flies.
