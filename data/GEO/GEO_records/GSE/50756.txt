TITLE
Cyclophilin B supports the survuval of glioblastoma multiforme cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have found that cyclophilin B (CypB) expression is important for malignant glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell proliferation. To identify molecular mechanisms that could explain CypB-dependent survival in human GBM cells, a microarray analysis was performed using RNA prepared from U251MG GBM cells transduced with lentiviral CypB shRNA. These data revealed that about 130 genes were more than 2-fold affected by CypB depletion. Significant alterations in the expression of genes related to cell death, cell proliferation and cell migration were found in the shCypB cells.

DESIGN
U251 glioblastoma cells transduced with lentivirus expressing non-target control shRNA (shCON) were compared to cells transduced with lentivirus expressing shRNA sequence against cyclophilin B (shCypB). Cells transduced with the lentiviral shRNA (shCON VS shCypB) for 5 days before total RNA extraction. Three biological replicates of cells treated with each shRNA (shCON or shCypB) were profiled.
