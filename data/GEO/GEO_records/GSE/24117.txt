TITLE
In Silico ascription of gene expression differences to tumor and stromal cells in a model to study impact on breast cancer outcome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present a method for identifying and ascribing differentially expressed genes to tumor epithelial and/or stromal cells, by utilizing pathologic information and weighted t-statistics

DESIGN
Sets of differentially expressed gene-probes were identified in tumors from patients who developed distant metastasis compared with those who did not, by weighing the contribution from each tumor with the relative content of stromal and tumor epithelial cells in their individual tumor specimen. The analyses were performed under various assumptions of mRNA transcription level from tumor epithelial cells compared with stromal cells.
