TITLE
Gene expression patterns define the hepatocyte-like cells derived by different strategies [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide gene profiling in hiPSC-Hep and hiHep and compared gene expression patterns in these two types of hepatocyte-like cells.Genes involving in fat digestion and absorption and metabolism enzymes were induced in both hiHeps and hiPSC-Heps. There were also hepatic genes not expressed in either hiPSC-Heps or hiHeps, including cytochrome P450-based metabolism genes and coagulation complements. Interestingly, when genes were clustered based on their hepatic functions, we found that for each hepatic function there were always a few genes not fully induced in either hiPSC-Heps or hiHeps.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 4 cell types (UCF,hiHep,hiPSC-Hep,PHH) were generated by deep sequencing, UCF have 2 replications,hiHep and hiPSC-Hep have 4 replications,PHH have 3 replications, using Illumina Hiseq 2000.
