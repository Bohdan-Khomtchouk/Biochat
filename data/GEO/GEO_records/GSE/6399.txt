TITLE
Comparison between gene expression in heart from Emd KO and control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The present research is devoted to the identification of gene(s) severely affected by EMD mutations, leading to striated muscle laminopathies and more specifically the cardiomyopathy. For this purpose, we developped a large-scale gene expression approach on heart and skeletal tissues from Emd KO mouse model. Keywords: disease state modification

DESIGN
In the project presented here we performed differential expression in heart from a mouse model of EDMD: a Emd KO mouse created via homologous recombination by Y.Hayashi in Japan (Ozawa, 2006). The emd knock-out mouse showed significantly delayed PR time, that could correspond to impaired atrial-ventricle node conduction. Genes were identified as differentially expressed if they met a false discovery rate threshold of 0.05 in a two-sample t-test (q-value) and showed at least a two-fold difference in expression independent of absolute signal intensity.
