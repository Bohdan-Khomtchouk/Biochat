TITLE
Comparison between gene expression in heart from Emd KO and control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The present research is devoted to the identification of gene(s) severely affected by EMD mutations, leading to striated muscle laminopathies and more specifically the cardiomyopathy. For this purpose, we developped a large-scale gene expression approach on heart and skeletal tissues from Emd KO mouse model. Keywords: disease state modification
