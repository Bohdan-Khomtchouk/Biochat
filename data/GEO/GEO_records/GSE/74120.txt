TITLE
Gene profile analysis of sorted Sca1+/cKit- BMCs obtained from young and aged mice bearing tumor or not

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sca1+/cKitâ€“ hematopoietic BMCs of hosts bearing primary tumors promote the growth of distant tumors that form with a myofibroblast-rich, desmoplastic stroma. BMCs from old mice bearing primary tumors lack this ability

DESIGN
Sca1+/cKit- BMCs were isolated from young and old mice bearing Matrigel control or size-matched primary tumors by FACS directly into RLT Plus Buffer (Qiagen Rneasy Plus Micro Kit)
