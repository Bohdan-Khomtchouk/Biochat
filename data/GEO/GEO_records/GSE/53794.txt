TITLE
Epigenetic priming of memory updating during reconsolidation to attenuate remote fear memories

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Remembrances of traumata range among the most enduring forms of memories. Despite the elevated lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders, effective strategies to attenuate long-term traumatic memories are scarce. The most efficacious treatments to diminish recent (i.e., day-old) traumata capitalize on memory updating mechanisms during reconsolidation that are initiated upon memory recall. Here, we show that in mice successful reconsolidation-updating paradigms for recent memories fail to attenuate remote (i.e., month-old) ones. We find that whereas recent memory recall induces a limited period of hippocampal neuroplasticity mediated, in part, by S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and histone acetylation, such plasticity is absent for remote memories. However, by using an HDAC2-targeting inhibitor (HDACi) during reconsolidation, even remote memories can be persistently attenuated. This intervention epigenetically primes the expression of neuroplasticity-related genes as revealed by whole genome RNA sequencing, which is accompanied by higher metabolic, synaptic and structural plasticity. Thus, applying HDACis during memory reconsolidation might constitute a treatment option for remote traumata.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates per group were analyzed. The material analyzed was whole hippocampi from one brain hemisphere, from which total RNA was extracted.
