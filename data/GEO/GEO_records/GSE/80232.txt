TITLE
Smart-seq2 analysis of P17 FACS sorted retinal cells from the Tg(Chx10-EGFP/cre,-ALPP)2Clc or Vsx2-GFP transgenic line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Three Vsx2-GFP mouse retinas were dissected, dissociated and FACS sorted, and single cell RNA-seq libraries were generated for 288 single cells and 3 bulk libraries using Smart-seq2 (~10,000 cells each)

DESIGN
Three mouse retinas (labeled 1a, 2a, 2b) were used, and 96 single cells from each were processed using Smart-seq2. A bulk RNA-seq control of 10,000 cells from each retina was also prepared

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
