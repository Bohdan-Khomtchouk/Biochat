TITLE
Molecular characterization of head and neck cancer cell model genomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To provide full characterization of genome changes in six commonly used head and neck cancer cell lines. These data will serve as an excellent resource when designing future experiments that attempt to model HNSCC behaviour.

DESIGN
Six commonly used ATCC head and neck cancer cell lines are analyzed.
