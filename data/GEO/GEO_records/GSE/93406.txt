TITLE
Reseveratrol and Rosiglitazone regulation of red tibialis anterior (red TA) gene expression in ZDF rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The goal of this work was to examine if reserveratrol or rosiglitazone treatment could improve the metabolic status of obese male ZDF rats after 6 weeks. Gene expression was analyzed in several key metabolic tissues, including liver, various white adipose tissue depots, red tibalus muscle, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

DESIGN
A total of 5 microarrays were run for each group, for a total of n=20 samples. For each sample, 100 ng of total RNA was prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix Rat Gene 2.1 ST array strips, according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Affymetrix Inc., Fremont, CA, USA).
