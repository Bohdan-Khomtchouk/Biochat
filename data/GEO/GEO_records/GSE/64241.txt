TITLE
Affymetrix SNP copy number data for embryonic stem cell samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines exhibit repeated patterns of genetic variation, which can alter in vitro properties as well as suitability for clinical use. We examined associations between copy number variations (CNVs) on chromosome 17 and hPSC mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mDA) differentiation.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved stem cell samples. Copy number analysis of Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 was performed for 17 stem cell samples.
