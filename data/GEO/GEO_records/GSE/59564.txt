TITLE
Expression Data from PECAM1+ and PECAM1- B16F10 Clones

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have isolated cells from the B16F10 melanoma cell line which express the vascular-selective marker PECAM1 Here we used microarrays to determine expression profile differences across the mouse genome to determine whether these cells display additional endothelial characteristics

DESIGN
PECAM1+ and PECAM1- B16F10 clones, along with mouse endothelial cells were cultured and harvested for RNA, which was then used in an Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array to determine expression signatures

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
