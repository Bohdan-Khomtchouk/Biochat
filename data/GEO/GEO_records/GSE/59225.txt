TITLE
Global transcriptional profile of Salmonella enterica serovar Cerro 87 wild-type and its dpt genes deletion mutants at different growth state

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular mechanism of the DNA phosphorothioate modification-dependent restriction system,  the transcriptomes of Salmonella enterica serovar Cerro 87 wild-type and its modification or restriction genes deletion mutants were compared by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Global gene expression in three strains, Salmonella enterica serovar Cerro 87 wild-type and its modification or restriction genes deletion mutants, were measured at three different growth state, respectively. Three independent experiments were performed at each condition.

PLATFORM
GPL18901 Agilent-030218 salmonella enterica cerro 87 8X15K array [Probe Name Version]
