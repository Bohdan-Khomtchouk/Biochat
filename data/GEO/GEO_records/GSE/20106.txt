TITLE
Phenotypic plasticity in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum: miRNA expression

ORGANISM
Acyrthosiphon pisum

SUMMARY
We developed high throughput Solexa sequencing and bioinformatic analyses of the genome of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum in order to identify the first miRNAs from a hemipteran insect. By combining these methods we identified 155 miRNAs including 56 conserved and 99 new miRNAs. Moreover, we investigated the regulation of these miRNAs in different alternative morphs of the pea aphid by analysing the expression of miRNAs across the switch of reproduction mode.

DESIGN
An array including the 155 aphid microRNAs was designed in order to follow the expression of aphid microRNAs during the modification of reproduction mode of the pea aphid
