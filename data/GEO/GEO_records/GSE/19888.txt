TITLE
Expression data from HMC-1 mast cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that the G protein Gi3 is the cellular target of the adenosine A3 receptor (A3R). By using a cell permeable peptide comprising the C-terminal end of GÎ±i3 fused to an importation sequence (ALL1) as a selective inhibitor of Gi3 signaling, we show that by coupling to Gi3, the  A3R stimulates multiple signaling pathways in human mast cells, leading to upregulation of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors.Following contact with activated T cell membranes, endogenous adenosine binds to and activates the A3R, resulting in Gi3-mediated signaling. Specifically, the majority of ERK1/2 signaling initiated by contact with activated T cell membranes, is mediated by Gi3, giving rise to ALL1-inhibitable cellular responses. These results unveil the physiological GPCR that couples to Gi3 and establish the important role played by this G-protein in inflammatory conditions that involve adenosine-activated mast cells. We used microarrays to detail the effect of ALL1 on  gene expression of HMC-1 cells activated directly by the A3 receptor, or by contact with activated T cell membranes.

DESIGN
The experiment consisted of 6 treatments in duplicates, a total of 12 samples. The cells were activated via two different activation pathways (A3 and T membranes), with or without pretreatment with the drug ALL1.
