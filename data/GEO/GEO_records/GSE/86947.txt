TITLE
Differential gene expression of WT vs THAP1 KO and a THAP1 C54Y mutation in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the differences in mRNA profiles of WT mouse cells in comparison to both THAP1 -/- cells and cells in which a disease causing C54Y mutation was introduced.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from wild type, THAP1 KO, and THAP1 C54Y mouse ES cells derived from C57Bl/6 blastocysts, followed by library preparation and sequencing on the illumina platform.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
