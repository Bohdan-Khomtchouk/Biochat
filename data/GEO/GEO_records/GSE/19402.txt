TITLE
Gene expression data from hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus cortex, Drd2-MSNs and Drd1-MSNs in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goal of the experiment: Analysis of gene expression changes in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, Drd2-MSNs and Drd1-MSNs of mice with a postnatal, neuron-specific ablation of GLP or G9a as compared to control mice.

DESIGN
For microarray analysis, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cortex and striatum of Camk2a-Cre; GLPfl/fl, Camk2a-Cre; G9afl/fl and age (10-14 week old) and sex matched littermate controls were used for total RNA purification. Four biological replicates were performed for each experiment. Polyribosome associated mRNAs from five, age (10-14 week old) and sex matched Drd1-Cre; Drd1-bacTRAP; G9afl/fl, or Drd2-Cre; Drd2-bacTRAP; G9afl/fl and Drd1-bacTRAP; G9afl/fl or Drd2-bacTRAP; G9afl/fl control mice were used. Three biological replicates were performed for each experiment.
