TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of microRNAs in sweet orange

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
miRNAs-mediated gene silencing pathway plays vital roles in plant development, abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we carried out a high-throughput sequencing approach to identify miRNAs in leaves and flowers of sweet orange. Consequently we identified genome-wide 183 known miRNAs and 38 novel miRNAs.

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing of the leaves and flowers in sweet orange

PLATFORM
GPL9256 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Citrus sinensis)
