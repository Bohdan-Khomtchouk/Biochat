TITLE
Gene expression of developed cancer stem cells [iPS-CC1]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA expression of human induced cancer stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells were analyzed.

DESIGN
We compared mRNA expression between cancer stem cells (that were induced from human cancer tissue-derived cells with defined factors or that were developed from human iPS cells with a cancer cell-conditioned medium) and human iPS cells.
