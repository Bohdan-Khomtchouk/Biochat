TITLE
DNA methylation analysis of the autistic brain reveals dysregulated biological pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of post-mortem human brain samples from both autistic individuals and nonautistic individuals.  Samples of the frontal cortex (BA10) and cingulate cortex (BA24)  were examined from each individual.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 45 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
