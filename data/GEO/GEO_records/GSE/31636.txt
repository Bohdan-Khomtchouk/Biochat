TITLE
Expression data from embryoid body with BRCA1 mutation [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the functional significance of the R1699Q variant of human BRCA1 gene using a mouse ES cell-based assay.

DESIGN
The LMT_miRNA_v2 microarray (NCI-Frederick) was designed by using the Sanger miR9.0 database ( http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk ) and manufactured by Agilent Technologies as custom-synthesized 8 x 15 K microarrays.
