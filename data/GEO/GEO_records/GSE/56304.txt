TITLE
Expression data from cultured primary mouse dermal fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In previous investigations, we detected that growth of melanoma cells in mice depleted for adam9 is enhanced. This resulted from molecular alterations in stromal cells cross-communicating to tumor cells and from constitutively altered expression of some molecules, e.g., TIMP1 in stromal fibroblasts lacking adam9. We used microarray analysis to identify the gene expression alterations occurring in stromal cells upon adam9 deletion which lead to the molecular alterations observed and contribute to the tumor phenotype.

DESIGN
Primary fibroblasts from adam9 KO and WT mice were cultured in standard conditions to address constitutive gene alterations.
