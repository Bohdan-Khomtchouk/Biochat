TITLE
Replication origin mapping of mitotic and meiotic cells in different conditions

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Identification of sites of replication initiation by copy number analysis, comparing samples before and after entry into S phase. Experiments were performed in the following strains and conditions for mitotic cells: cdc25-22 (temperature-sensitive mutation arrests cells at G2/M for synchrony, otherwise wild type), nitrogen-rich conditions; wild type, haploid and diploid, nitrogen-depletion conditions. Experiments were performed in the following strains and conditions for meiotic cells: pat1-114 diploid (temperature-sensitive mutation induces a synchronous meiosis, otherwise wild type), nitrogen-depletion and nitrogen-rich conditions; pat1-114 diploid with altered Cdc45 levels, nitrogen-depletion conditions.

DESIGN
Comparison of samples before and after S phase entry; dye-swap experiments were performed and averaged.
