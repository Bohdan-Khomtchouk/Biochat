TITLE
Comparasion of DNA methylomes of human CD11b+ cells from healthy donors (HD) peripheral blood and CD11b+ cells isolated from ascitic fluid (a) or peripheral blood (b) from ovarian cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The methylation profiles of bisulfite-modified DNA of human CD11b+ cells from healthy donors (HD) were compared with CD11b+ cells isolated from ovarian cancer patients (blood or ascitic fluid) using the Infinium HumanMethylation850 BeadChips (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA,). This platform allows the interrogation of > 850,000 methylation sites per sample at single-nucleotide resolution, and comprises an average of 17 CpG sites per gene in the 99% of RefSeq genes. 96% of CpG islands are covered, with additional coverage in CpG island shores and the regions flanking them. The samples were hybridized in the array following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

DESIGN
Total DNA isolated by standard procedures from  isolated CD11+ cells.

PLATFORM
GPL23976 Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation850 BeadChip
