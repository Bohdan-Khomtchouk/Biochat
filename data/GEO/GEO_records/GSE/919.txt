TITLE
Comparison of WT and YODA

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Wild type and yda-2 plants were germinated and grown on commercial potting mix in walk-in chambers with constant illumination (~150 micromoles per square meter per second) at 22oC. The aerial parts of the plants were harvested at the rosette stage, prior to bolting. Total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) with the additional steps recommended for polysaccharide-rich tissues. Hybridization probes for the GeneChip AtGenome1 microarrays (Affymetrix) were prepared from 20 mg total RNA. All procedures followed Affymetrix protocols. Briefly, cDNA was synthesized using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a T7-(dT)24 primer, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction using Phase Lock Gel tubes (Eppendorf), and precipitated with ethanol. Labeled antisense RNA was generated with a BioArray kit (Enzo) and purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 25 mg of the fragmented cRNAs were used for hybridization to the arrays. Affymetrix instruments were used for hybridization, washing, staining and scanning of the arrays according to the provided instructions. Data from four biological replications representing tissue grown and harvested at different times was collected. The average signals of all eight experiments were scaled to the target value of 500.
