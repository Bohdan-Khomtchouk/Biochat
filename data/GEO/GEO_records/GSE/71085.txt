TITLE
Transcriptome Profiling of Two Separatively Reproduced Arabidopsis Lines

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We profiled transcriptome of seedling samples derived from SALK Col-0 plants and a Col-0 plants reproduced in our lab for at least 10 generations. Using strand-specific RNA-seq analysis, we identified 32 genes were differentially expressed genes (fold-change > 2, DESeq2 P-value < 0.01), including 28 ones (88%) were up-regulated in the Col-0 plants reproduced in our lab. Of them, QUA-QUINE STARCH (QQS) ranked top 2 differentially expressed gene.

DESIGN
2 lines with 2 biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL17639 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
