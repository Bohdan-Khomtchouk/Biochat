TITLE
Genome-wide identification of regulatory elements in preSertoli cells based on DNaseI hypersensitivity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identifying transcriptional networks active during development has been hindered by the slow pace at which regulatory elements are identified, and by the difficulty in purifying cells from developing tissues. We used DNaseI-seq to identify functional regulatory elements in purified fetal preSertoli cells and uncovered thousands of preSertoli-specific DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) that are likely to activate or repress genes required for Sertoli cell development and function. To demonstrate their functional significance, we validated the preSertoli-specific enhancer activity of a DHS located 50 kb upstream of the Wt1 gene. This genome-wide data will guide many future studies into gene-regulatory mechanisms that operate in the fetal gonad and may lead to the identification of non-coding mutations leading to DSDs.

DESIGN
One biological replicate was analyzed for each of the eight mouse samples using DNase-seq. Three biological replicates were analyzed for RNA-seq. Two biological replicates for ChIP-seq.
