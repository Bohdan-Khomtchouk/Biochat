TITLE
H3K27me3 analysis in mouse colonic epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
H3K27me3 statuses were analyzed in normal mouse colonic epithelial cells and in those exposed to DSS-induced colitis, and aberrant changes of H3K27me3 by DSS-induced colitis were identified.

DESIGN
H3K27me3 in colonic epithelial cells isolated from male BALB/c mice without or with DSS treatment were analyzed using Agilent-015279 Mouse CpG Island ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 2x105K.
