TITLE
Comparing expression profiles of NIH3T3 cells with and without LPAR1 mutation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the signaling pathways of mutant LPAR1, we performed gene expression profiling for NIH3T3 cells expressing wild-type and mutant LPAR1 receptors using Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arrays

DESIGN
6 RNA samples from the same cell line. 3 samples contained LPAR1 mutant and 3 samples were wild-type. Cells were harvested at 0, 60, and 120 minutes.
