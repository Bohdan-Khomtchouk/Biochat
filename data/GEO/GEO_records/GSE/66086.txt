TITLE
m6A level and isoform characterization sequencing (m6A-LAIC-seq) reveal the census and complexity of the m6A epitranscriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a widespread reversible chemical modification of RNAs, implicated in many aspects of RNA metabolism. Little quantitative information exists as to either how many transcript copies of particular genes are m6A modified (“m6A levels”), or the relationship of m6A modification(s) to alternative RNA isoforms. To deconvolute the m6A epitranscriptome, we developed m6A level and isoform-characterization sequencing (m6A-LAIC-seq). We found that cells exhibit a broad range of non-stoichiometric m6A levels with cell type specificity. At the level of isoform characterization, we discovered widespread differences in use of tandem alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites by methylated and nonmethylated transcript isoforms of individual genes. Strikingly, there is a strong bias for methylated transcripts to be coupled with proximal APA sites, resulting in shortened 3’ untranslated regions (3’-UTRs), while nonmethylated transcript isoforms tend to use distal APA sites. m6A-LAIC-seq yields a new perspective on transcriptome complexity and links APA usage to m6A modifications.

DESIGN
m6A-LAIC-seq of H1-ESC and GM12878 cell lines, each cell line has two replicates
