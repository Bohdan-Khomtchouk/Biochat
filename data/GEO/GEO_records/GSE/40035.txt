TITLE
Mutation Mapping of 40 Streptococcus suis strains

ORGANISM
Streptococcus suis

SUMMARY
Streptococcus suis is an important zoonotic pathogen that can cause meningitis and sepsis in both pigs and humans. In this study,we evaluated the genetic difference of 40 Streptococcus suis strains belonging to various sequence types by comparative genomic hybridization to identify genes associated with the variation in pathogenicity using NimbleGenâ€™s tilling microarray platform. Application of Comparative Phylogenomics to Identify Genetic Differences Relating to Pathogenicity of Streptococcus suis

DESIGN
Comparative genomic analysis on the 40 S.suis strains of different serotypes and ST types through tilling arrays
