TITLE
Effect of high or low chronic shear stress on microvascular endothelial cells cultured on native- versus AGE-fibronectin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were cultured on the inner surface of fibers (each 700 Âµm inner diameter) coated with either with native- or advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) modified fibronectin in hollow-fiber cartridges (FiberCell Systems, Inc.). Duration of shear stress application was 10 days. Shear stress was gradually increased to 17 dyne/cm2 in 2 samples (GSM32266: native fibronectin high shear stress or GSM45608: AGE-fibronectin) or was kept at constant low level of 1 dyne/cm2 in 1 sample (GSM41248: native fibronectin low shear stress). Keywords: parallel sample
