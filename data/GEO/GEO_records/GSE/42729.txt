TITLE
Expression analysis of Tim-3 knockdown RAW264.7 cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Tim-3 knockdown RAW264.7 cell, compared to control siRNA transfected RAW264.7 cell. The Tim-3 knockdown of this cell render it hyper-reactive to TLR stimulation. Tim-3 knockdown analyzed in this study are further described in Li Y, Feng J, Geng S, Geng S, Wei H, Chen G, Li X, Wang L, Wang R, Peng H, Han G, Shen B, Li Y.  2011. The N- and C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domains of galectin-9 contribute differently to its multiple functions in innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Mol Immunol. 48(4):670-7. (PID 21146220)

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from Tim-3 knockdown and control RAW264.7 cells. There are 135,000 probes in a chip,each chip measures the expression level of 27526 genes of mouse from Nimblegen. Fold-change screening between the two groups obtained from the experiment. The threshold used to screen up or down regulated genes is Fold change＞＝2.0
