TITLE
Role of cytochrome c in α-synuclein radical formation: implications of α-synuclein in neuronal death in Maneb and paraquat-induced model of Parkinson's disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Altogether results show that peroxidase activity of cytochrome c contributes to α-synuclein radical formation and oligomerization, and that α-synuclein through its co-localization with cytochrome c or on it's own, affects several biological pathways which contribute to increased neuronal death in  Maneb and paraquat (MP)-induced model of Parkinson's disease.

DESIGN
Nigrostriatal tissue of Controls, Wild-Type MP co-exposed mice, and MP-coexposed α-synuclein Knock out mice, were analysed by Microarray with three replicates for each group.
