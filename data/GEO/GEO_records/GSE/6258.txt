TITLE
Microarray analysis of the effect of Cipro on wt and lexA mutant S. aureus cells

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of human disease and can be difficult to treat due to both multi-drug resistance and the organismâ€™s remarkable ability to persist in the host, which is thought to result from several complex regulatory networks that modify transcription in response to environmental stress. In this study, we characterize the global transcriptional response of S. aureus strain 8325 to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. We find that ciprofloxacin induces prophage mobilization and also significant alterations in metabolism, most notably an upregulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition, ciprofloxacin induces the SOS response, which based on a comparison of the wild-type and lexA mutant strains, we show includes the de-repression of sixteen genes. In addition to RecA, LexA, and the hypothetical proteins encoded by SACOL0436, SACOL1375, SACOL1986 and SACOL1999, the S. aureus SOS genes encode proteins involved in DNA metabolism and induced mutation. Finally, we show that rendering LexA uncleavable significantly sensitizes the pathogen to ciprofloxacin therapy in vivo. These observations suggest that the SOS response may play a critical role in the pathogenicity of S. aureus. Keywords: time course
