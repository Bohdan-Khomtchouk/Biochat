SUMMARY
Change of metabolite profiles and gene transcription in subjects with high T2D risk by low ambulatory activity

DESIGN
We analyzed from sedentary and obese subjects by NMR lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, gluconeogenic substrates, amino acids and glycoproteins, known to be related to T2D risks, and studied their associations with  amounts and intensities of accelerometer recorded physical activities
