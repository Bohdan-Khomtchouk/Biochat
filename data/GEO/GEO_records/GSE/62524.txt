Change of metabolite profiles and gene transcription in subjects with high T2D risk by low ambulatory activity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Change of metabolite profiles and gene transcription in subjects with high T2D risk by low ambulatory activity

DESIGN
We analyzed from sedentary and obese subjects by NMR lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, gluconeogenic substrates, amino acids and glycoproteins, known to be related to T2D risks, and studied their associations with  amounts and intensities of accelerometer recorded physical activities

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
