TITLE
Linking toxicant physiological mode of action with induced gene expression changes in Caenorhabditis elegans: atrazine

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Physiologically based modelling using DEBtox (dynamic energy budget in toxicology) and transcriptional profiling were used in Caenorhabditis elegans to identify how physiological modes of action, as indicated by effects on system level resource allocation were associated with changes in gene expression following exposure to atrazine (AZ). For AZ, the physiological mode of action predicted by DEBtox was increased cost for maintenance. The transcriptional analysis demonstrated that this increase resulted from effects on DNA integrity as indicated by changes in the expression of genes chromosomal repair. Our results have established that outputs from process based models and transcriptomics analyses can help to link mechanisms of action of toxic chemicals with resulting demographic effects. Such complimentary analyses can assist in the categorisation of chemicals for risk assessment purposes.

DESIGN
Adults of C. elegans strain GE-31 exposed as biological replicate groups (approx 10,000) to a control and 4 concentrations of atrazine from L1 stage. Replicate populations were sampled 12 hours after the on-set of egg laying and hybridised against a common reference for purposes of normalisation. All experiments were conducted following a reference design with the reference sample compiled from a mixture of RNA extracted from control and cadmium-, fluoranthene-, atrazine- and copper-exposed worms from L1, L4 and adult life-stages. Use of this reference was intended to provide optimal coverage of the spotted genes.
