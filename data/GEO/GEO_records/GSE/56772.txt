TITLE
Age-dependent gene expression in the hippocampus of rTg4510 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to assess the adult hippocampal gene expression patterns in the rTg4510 mouse line at various ages. This line harbors a repressible mutant human Tau transgene under the Camk2a promoter. Both mice with just the tet-Transactivator alone and no transgenes ('double negative') were used as comparison groups.

DESIGN
Hippocampi from (1-4) mice per genotype at ages ranging from 1.7 to 10.8 months of age were dissected, RNA isolated, and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays performed.
