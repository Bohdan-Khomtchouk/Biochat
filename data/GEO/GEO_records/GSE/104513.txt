TITLE
RNA-seq of maturation stage pituitary mouse cell lines and NIH-3T3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Proper expression of key reproductive hormones from gonadotrope cells of the pituitary is required for reproduction. We performed RNAseq of 3 maturaton staged gonadotrope cell lines,  a thyroptrope cell line and NIH-3T3 cells to establish the timing and expression levels of genes involved in gonadotrope maturation.

DESIGN
Rna-seq of 3 mouse gonadotrope cell lines, 1 mouse thyrotrope cell line and NIH-3T3 cell line

PLATFORM
