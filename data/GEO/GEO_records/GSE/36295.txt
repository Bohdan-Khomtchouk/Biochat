ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of fresh breast cancer tissue versus normal tissues. The Study comprising 45 Saudi-Arabian subjects was designed to take advantage of transcriptomics to prospectively explore the roles of lifestyle and genetic susceptibility in the occurrence of breast cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from 45 surgically resected breast cancer tissues and 8 healthy breast tissues (3 from Affymetrix) and purified, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array.
