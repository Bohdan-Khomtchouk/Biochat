Effect of mild hyperthermia on Mk differentiation

SUMMARY
Physical factors can have major influences on the proliferation and differentiation fate of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. Recently, we demonstrated that cord blood CD34+ cells undergo accelerated and increased megakaryocyte differentiation when incubated at 39째C. In this study, we investigated in detail the impacts of mild hyperthermia on the kinetics of megakaryocyte differentiation, maturation, polyploidization and cell viability. The qualitative and quantitative effects on Mk differentiation were found to be rapidly induced, and optimization of the culture length at 39째C led to greater Mk yields. Mild hyperthermia did not promote endomitosis of cord blood-derived Mk, but rather led to a small reduction in the proportion of polyploid Mk. Moreover, it had little impact on viability but induced a significant shift in the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis at 37째C to necrosis at 39째C. Finally, our results suggest that the effects on megakaryocyte differentiation could be the consequences of aberrant expression of key megakaryocyte transcription factors induced by mild hyperthermia.
