Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression of the mciroRNA, miR-153 is significantly altered in neural stem cells (NSCs) following exposure to the teratogens, alcohol and nicotine (PMIDs:22458409, 17687032). To better understand how miR-153 may mediate teratogenesis, we first needed to identify miR153 targets in fetal NSCs. Gestational day 12.5 fetal mouse cortical neural epithelium was isolated and grown as neurospheres in defined medium for studies. We overexpressed miR-153 in fetal NSCs for 24 hours in a transient transfection assay, and profiled mRNA expression using a microarray platform (codelink array) to identify potential target genes. Over expression of pre-miR-153 resulted in a ~32-fold induction of miR-153 compared to the transfection control. Transcript profiles were assessed from RNA samples (6 independent replicates in each condition) hybridized to codelink microarrays according to manufacturer's protocols. Data analysis showed that miR-153 overexpression resulted in statistically significant down-regulation of 102 genes (at a false discovery rate α=0.1, of a total of 860 transcripts down-regulated by ≥1.3-fold). These data suggested the role of this miRNA in moderately controlling expression hundreds of gene transcripts. These regulated genes may be important in controlling neural stem cell differentiation and downstream signaling pathways.

DESIGN
Six independent replicates were performed for control and treatment groups, and twelve independent single channel intensity values were uploaded after normalization for analysis  independent single channel intensity values were uploaded after normalization
