TITLE
Genetic and molecular basis of drug resistance and species-specific drug action in Schistosome parasites

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
Oxamniquine resistance evolved in the human blood fluke (Schistosoma mansoni) in Brazil in the 1970s. We crossed parental parasites differing ~500-fold in drug response, determined drug sensitivity and marker segregation in clonally-derived F2s, and identified a single QTL (LOD=31) on chromosome 6. A sulfotransferase was identified as the causative gene using RNAi knockdown and biochemical complementation assays and we subsequently demonstrated independent origins of loss-of-function mutations in field-derived and laboratory-selected resistant parasites. These results demonstrate the utility of linkage mapping in a human helminth parasite, while crystallographic analyses of protein-drug interactions illuminate the mode of drug action and provide a framework for rational design of oxamniquine derivatives that kill both S. mansoni and S. haematobium, the two species responsible for > 99% of schistosomiasis cases worldwide.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from adult worms resistant (HR, 3 replicates) and susceptible (LE, 2 replicates) to the oxamniquine drug were compared to identify differential expression in genes related to drug resistance
