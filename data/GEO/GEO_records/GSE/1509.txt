TITLE
Atlas Rat cDNA Expression Array - Zipf's Normalization

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Five microarrays from a larger dataset used to demonstrate a normalization technique base on Zipf's law. The original data set was generated by using Atlas Rat cDNA microarrays (Clontech, 588 genes) probed with rat brain tissue, from control (cerebellum n=10, olive n=10) and harmaline treated (cerebellum n=10, olive n=9) animals. Microarrays were probed according to established protocols and exposed to imaging plates overnight (BAS-MS 2325) and scanned at a 50  m resolution on a FLA-3000G phosphoimager (Raytest, Germany). Image gridding was carried out using VisualGrid® software ( ). Keywords: other
