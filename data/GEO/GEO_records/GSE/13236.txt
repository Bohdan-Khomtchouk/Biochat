TITLE
Global transcriptional profiling of Staphylococcus aureus treated with magnolol

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is an important human and animal pathogen, multiply resistant strains are increasingly widespread, new agents are needed for the treatment of S. aureus. magnolol has potent antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. We employed Affymetrix Staphylococcus aureus GeneChipsTM arrays to investigate the global transcriptional profiling of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 treated with magnolol. Keywords: gene expression array-based, count

DESIGN
Staphylococcus aureus cells were exposed for a certain time to magnolol at a certain concentration, 6 samples including 3 control samples are analyzed.
