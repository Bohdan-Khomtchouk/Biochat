TITLE
Continuous suppression of Mek1/2 impairs the developmental potential of mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Co-suppression of Gsk3 and Mek1/2 signaling (“2i culture”) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) induces a naïve state that more closely resembles the inner cell mass (ICM) of the pre-implantation embryo, including global DNA hypomethylation. While the ICM exists only transiently in vivo, it remains unclear how continuous suppression of Mek1/2 and Gsk3 signaling and associated hypomethylation affect the stability and functionality of ESCs in vitro. Here we show that, compared to ESCs maintained in conventional serum/LIF media, culturing male ESCs in 2i/LIF for & gt;6 passages results in the erosion of genomic imprints and a concomitant impairment in the ability to generate adult, entirely ESC- derived mice (all-ESC mice). We further demonstrate that female ESCs cultured in serum/LIF phenocopy male ESCs cultured in 2i/LIF, including global hypomethylation, imprint erosion and impaired developmental potential. Unexpectedly, culture of female ESCs in serum/LIF and male ESCs in 2i/LIF for & gt;16 passages causes recurrent chromosomal aberration that have been associated with a selective growth advantage. We provide evidence that inhibition of Mek1/2, but not Gsk3, is responsible for hypomethylation, imprint loss and chromosomal instability in ESCs, and identify alternative conditions that preserve epigenetic integrity. Taken together, our data suggest that while short-term suppression of Mek1/2 in ESCs captures an ICM-like epigenetic state, prolonged suppression results in irreversible changes that compromise developmental potential.
