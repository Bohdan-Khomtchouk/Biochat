TITLE
Copy number profiling of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast with high-grade transformation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to define the repertoire of somatic genetic alterations involved in the progression to high-grade TNBC (HG-TNBC) in two transformed AdCCs of the breast.

DESIGN
Two patients with diagnosis of AdCC of the breast with heterogeneous morphology and associated with areas of HG-TNBC were included in the study. All diagnostic blocks and slides of both cases were centrally reviewed by four pathologists and morphologically distinct areas of each tumor were identified and microdissected. DNA for each case was hybridized on the molecular inverse probe assay using the OncoScanÂ® FFPE Express custom service (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
