TITLE
Smad3, Smad4 and TTF-1/NKX2-1 binding sites in H441/A549 lung cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated the role of TTF-1/NKX2-1 on Smad3 and Smad4 binding in lung cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
Smad3 binding sites in A549 cells and Smad3, Smad4, and TTF-1/NKX2-1 binding sites in H441 cells were determined by ChIP-seq.
