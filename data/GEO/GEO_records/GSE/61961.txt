TITLE
The effect of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1 (TNFR1) loss on gene expression in beta-catenin-deprive colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human colon carcinoma cells SKCO1 were deprived of either beta-catenin alone or beta-catenin together with TNFR1 and changes in mRNA levels were examined before and after TNFR1 ablation

DESIGN
SKCO1 cells were transfected with either beta-catenin-specific siRNA alone or beta-catenin-specific siRNA together with a TNFR1-specific siRNA and changes in mRNA levels were examined before and after TNFR1 ablation
