TITLE
MMTV-PyMT whole tumor gene expression with and without Class IIa HDAC inhibitor treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify differential gene expression resulting from the inhibition of class IIa HDACs in the CD3+ or CD11b+ cells residing in MMTV-PyMT tumors.

DESIGN
Prior to necropsy and collection of tumors from MMTV-PyMT mice, mice were treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or 50 mg/kg TMP195 for 2 weeks. One excised tumor from each of these mice was immediately snap frozen then stored at -80 C until processed for RNA extraction.  RNA samples were stored at -80 C until labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix arrays.
