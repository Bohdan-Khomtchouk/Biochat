TITLE
Identification of MITF-regulated genes in the human melanoma cell line Ma-Mel-15

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptional response of the human melanoma cell line Ma-Mel-15 either transfected with control siRNA (siNT = non-targeting siRNA) or transfected with siRNAs (pool of 4 active and independent siRNAs) directed against the melanocytic transcription factor and lineage oncogene MITF (Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor). The experiment was performed as biological duplicates and RNA was isolated 48 hours after siRNA transfection. We aimed to determine novel markers and pathways of melanoma cell plasticity.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from siRNA-treated Ma-Mel-15 melanoma cell lines and global gene expression profiling was done using the Illumina Human HT12 v4 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
