TITLE
Genome-wide Definition of the SigF Regulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Expression)

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
The genome wide transcriptome analysis to identify the M.tuberculosis sigma factor Rv3286c (SigF) dependent transcripts as well as Pristimaycin induced transcripts

DESIGN
Pristinamycin induced transcripts were identified by comparing the cDNA extracted from H37Rv::pMY769 with and without pristinamycin (3 biological replicates). SigF controlled transcripts were identified by comparing the cDNA extracted from H37Rv::pMYsigF with and without pristinamycin (4 biological replicates).

PLATFORM
