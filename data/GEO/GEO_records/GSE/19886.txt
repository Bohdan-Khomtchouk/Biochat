TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of Hyperoxic/hypoxic Retinas in Mouse Model of Oxygen-induced Retinopathy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinal ischemia is believed to initiate a series of events that leads to retinal neovascularization observed in several retinal diseases such as diabetetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion. Although some molecules such as VEGF and MCP-1 have been implicated in the process, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In order to identify genes associated with retinal ischemia, we performed gene expression analyses in retinas of mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy using DNA microarray technology.

DESIGN
C57BL/6N pups were placed in a 75% oxygen environment on postnatal day 7 (P7) for 5 days and then returned to room air.  Retinas were removed from mice at 0 (P12), and 12 hours (P12.5) after ischemia. To isolate sufficient total RNA for labeling protocols, 2 retinas from one mouse were pooled. The results of three experiments for each condition (biological replicates) were used for the statistical analyses.
