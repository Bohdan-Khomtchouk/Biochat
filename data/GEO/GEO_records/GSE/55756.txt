TITLE
Transcription profiling of mouse liver by array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PPARα-null and wild-type male mice treated with PFHxS or PFNA

DESIGN
PPARα-null and wild-type male mice at 6-9 months of age were dosed by gavage for 7 consecutive days with either 0, 3, or 10 mg/kg  PFHxS, or 1 or 3 mg/kg PFNA (#394459, Sigma-Aldrich, St, Louis, MO) in water.  PFHxS was kindly provided by 3M Corp (St. Paul, MN).  Four biological replicates consisting of individual animals were included in each dose group.  Dose levels reflected exposures that produce hepatomegaly in adult mice without inducing overt toxicity.
