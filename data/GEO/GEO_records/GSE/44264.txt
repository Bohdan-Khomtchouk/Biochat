TITLE
Effects of PSF and CTBP1-AS knockdown in prostate cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and  Androgen receptor (AR) downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. We identified androgen-regulated long non-coding RNA, CTBP1-AS, located in the antisese region of CTBP1 gene. CTBP1-AS activate AR signaling by epigenetically repress AR-associated cofactors such as CTBP1 by interactign with RNA-binding protein PSF and recruiting HDAC complex to the target promoters. In order to investigate the CTBP1-AS and PSF function in prostate cancer cells, we performed gene expression in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines after siPSF or siCTBP1-AS treatment. We also treated cells with vehicle or androgen to analyzed the effects of CTBP1-AS and PSF on AR function.

DESIGN
Observation of androgen dependent gene expression changes after treatmet with siRNAs targeting CTBP1-AS and PSF with microarray.
