TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis Col-0 expressing FLAG-SUB1A or FLAG-SUB1C rice ERFs

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In rice (Oryza sativa L.), the haplotype at the multigenic SUBMERGENCE 1 (SUB1) locus determines survival of prolonged submergence. SUB1 encodes two or three group VII Ethylene Response Factor (ERF) family transcription factors, SUB1A, SUB1B and SUB1C. A highly submergence-inducible SUB1A allele is present in lines that are submergence tolerant. This gene is the determinant of submergence tolerance. Here, the heterologous ectopic expression of rice SUB1A and SUB1C in Arabidopsis thaliana was employed to assess the transcriptional network mobilized by ectopic expression of SUB1A and SUB1C.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants were stably transformed with constructs allowing the expression of 35S:FLAG-SUB1A and 35S:FLAG-SUB1C. Affymetrix ATH1 arrays were hybridized with RNA isolated from 7-day-old whole seedlings at midday (growth chamber, 0.5X MS-agar plates, 1 %(w/v) sucrose, 23 ÂºC, 16 h light/ 8 h dark, 125 uE m-2 s-1). Two biological replicates each.
