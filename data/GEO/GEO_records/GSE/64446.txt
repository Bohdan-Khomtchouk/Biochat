TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae: DSB mapping by Break-chip in a two-color experiment (G1 control vs. S phase samples)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Break-chip (microarray-based double strand break mapping) analysis of mec1 cells recovering from 200 mM hydroxyurea in the presence or absence of 0.8 micromolar bathophenanthroline sulfonate (BPS).

DESIGN
We asked if the presence of an iron chelator, BPS, during cell recovery from transient exposure to 200 mM hydroxyurea changes the global patterns of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs).  We used a yeast checkpoint mutant, mec1, which has been shown to produce DSBs at replication forks after hydroxyurea was removed from the cell culture.  We synchronously released cells from the G1/S transition into S phase in the presence of 200 mM hydroxyurea.  After 1h treatment, the drug was removed and cells were allowed to recover in fresh medium for 1h in the presence or absence of 0.8 micromolar BPS.  Recover (R) samples, R-1h-BPS and R-1h+BPS, as well as the G1 control samples were collected. Break-chip analysis was performed as previously described (Feng et al., G3(Bethesda) 2011 Oct;1(5):327-35. doi: 10.1534/g3.111.000554).
