TITLE
Expression data from mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from the umbilical cord tissue (UCX®) and cultivated in ATMP-compatible media

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Standardization of MSC manufacturing is urgently needed to facilitate comparison of clinical trial results. Here, we compare gene expression of MSC generated by the adaptation of a proprietary method for isolation and cultivation of a specific umbilical cord tissue-derived population of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) The adaptation focused on different stages of production, from cell isolation steps to cell culturing and preservation. The origin and quality of reagents were considered and steps for avoiding microbiological and endotoxin contamination of the final cell product were implemented. Cell isolation efficiency, MSC surface markers and genetic profiles originating from the use of different medium supplements were compared. The ATMP-compliant UCX® product was also cryopreserved avoiding the use of DMSO, an added benefit in the use of these cells as an ATMP. Cells were analysed for expansion capacity and longevity. The final cell product was further characterised by flow cytometry, differentiation potential, and tested for contaminants at various passages. Gene expression profiles, genetic stability and immune properties were analysed.

DESIGN
human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs (UCX®) were isolated using clinical grade enzymes  and cultivated in flask or bags using α-MEM basal medium with 1 g/L glucose and 2 mM glutamine supplemented with either FBS,human serum or human platelet lysate.
