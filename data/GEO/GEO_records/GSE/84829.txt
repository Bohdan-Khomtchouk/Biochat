TITLE
Identification of mesothelial-to-mesenchymal gene signature in ascitic fluid-isolated mesothelial cells through RNA-sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-sequencing analysis was carried out on ascetic fluid-isolated mesothelial cells from ovarian cancer patients compared to control human peritoneal mesothelial cells to identify a mesothelial-mesenchymal gene signature.

DESIGN
Three control human peritoneal mesothelial cell samples isolated from omentum obtained from non-oncologic patients undergoing abdominal surgery and three ascitic fluid-isolated mesothelial cell samples obtained from the peritoneal effucsions of stage III/IV ovarian serous carcinoma patients

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
