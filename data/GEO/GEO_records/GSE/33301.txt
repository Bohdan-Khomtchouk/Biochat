TITLE
Expression data from control and COUP-TFII siRNA treated HUVEC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
COUP-TFII plays a critical role in angiogenesis during development. It has also been shown to suppress Notch signaling pathway to confer vein identity. However, the downstream targets and the mechanism mediate COUP-TFII function to regulate these processes remain elusive. To identify the downstream targets and the mechanism by which COUP-TFII regulates agiogenesis and vein specification, we knocked down COUP-TFII in HUVEC cells using COUP-TFII specific siRNA and used microarray analysis to identify downstream targets. Interestingly, we found the expression of many genes in the cell cycle pathway and Notch signaling pathway are significantly altered in the COUP-TFII depleted cells.

DESIGN
HUVEC Cells were transfected with siRNA  (Control or COUP-TFII siRNA) duplexes (50 nM) and total RNA was isolated 48 hours later.
