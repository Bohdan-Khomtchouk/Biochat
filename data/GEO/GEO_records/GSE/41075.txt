TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of endometrial biopsies  inflammatory response to Chlamydia trachomatis genital tract infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium that frequently causes an asymptomatic genital tract infection, gradually cleared by host immunity Transcriptome profiles were made of endometrial tissue from women with or without genital tract C. trachomatis infection, to characterize host responses to infection. Profiles showed that infection polarized host defense toward Type 2 immune responses. Responses included fibrin deposition, enhanced wound repair, and tissue remodeling.

DESIGN
Trans-cervical endometrial biopsy specimens were collected from 10 women with no identified upper or lower genital tract infection and 12 women with C. trachomatis endometrial infection.
