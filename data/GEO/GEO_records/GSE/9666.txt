SUMMARY
hormonal progression in prostate cancer fiber model Keywords: prostate cancer, hormonal progression, fiber model

DESIGN
The LNCaP Hollow Fiber model of prostate cancer was appied. A total of 24 fibers were implanted in each animal, in bundles of eight fibers at three different regions in the animal. Castration of mice was performed At each time point, eight fibers from the same mouse were harvested and total RNA was isolated from LNCaP cells grown inside the fibers using Trizol
