TITLE
Genome-wide analyses of GATA6 occupancy and functions provide insights into its oncogenic mechanisms in human gastric cancer (microarray)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identifiy core GATA6 functions and transcriptional targets in human gastric cancer, including additional subservient transcriptional regulators via integrative analysis of GATA6 transcription factor occupancy, gene dependency, and tumor synexpression.

DESIGN
This study used Affymetrix U133A 2.0 gene chips with 2 control and 2 treated replicates for 2 cell types.
