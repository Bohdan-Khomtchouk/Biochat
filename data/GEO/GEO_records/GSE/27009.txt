TITLE
microRNA expression in CagA-expressing cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Comprehensive analysis of microRNA expression were performed with 238 rat genes of microRNA between CagA-expressing and -non-expressing cells. CagA expression was controlled by tetracycline-off system in RGM1 cells.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, RGM1 cells were used to acquire expression profiles of 238 microRNA genes.
