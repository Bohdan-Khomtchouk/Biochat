TITLE
Expression data from gastric tissues: Cancer Samples vs. Matched Adjacent Noncancerous Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate gene expression associated with copy number changes, we performed a genome-wide copy number and expression microarray analysis of 25 pairs of gastric tissues.

DESIGN
25 pairs of gastric tissues: gastric cancer tissues vs. matched adjacent noncancerous tissues.
