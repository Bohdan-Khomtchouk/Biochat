TITLE
Type I Interferon induces binding of STAT1 to Bcl6: Divergent Roles of STAT-family transcription factors in the T follicular helper cell genetic program

SUMMARY
CD4+ T follicular helper cells (TFH) are critical for the formation and function of B cell responses to infection or immunization, but also play an important role in autoimmunity. The factors that contribute to the differentiation of this helper cell subset are incompletely understood, although several cytokines including IL-6, IL-21 and IL-12 can promote TFH cell formation. Yet, none of these factors, nor their downstream cognate STATs, have emerged as non-redundant, essential drivers of TFH cells.  This suggests a model in which multiple factors can contribute to the phenotypic characteristics of TFH cells. As type I interferons (IFNs) are often generated in immune responses, we set out to investigate if these factors are relevant to TFH cell differentiation. Type I IFNs promote Th1 responses, thus one possibility was these factors antagonized TFH-expressed genes.  However, we show that type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) induced Bcl6 expression, the master regulator transcription factor for TFH cells, and CXCR5 and PD-1 (encoded by Pdcd1), key surface molecules expressed by TFH cells. In contrast, type I IFNs failed to induce IL-21, the signature cytokine for TFH cells. The induction of Bcl6 was regulated directly by STAT1, which bound to the Bcl6, Cxcr5 and Pdcd1 loci. These data suggest that type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) and STAT1 can contribute to some features of TFH cells but are inadequate in inducing complete programming of this subset.

DESIGN
The role of STAT1 in type I interferon treated CD4+ T cells was investigated by Chip-seq of STAT1.
