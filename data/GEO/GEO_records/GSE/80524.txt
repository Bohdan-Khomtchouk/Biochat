TITLE
Histone H2B ubiquitylation represses gametogenesis by opposing RSC-Dependent chromatin remodeling at the ste11 master regulator locus

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Chromatin modifications play a pivotal role in cell fate decision. In fission yeast, the ste11 gene encodes the master regulator initiating the switch from vegetative growth to gametogenesis when cells starve. The methylation of H3K4 by Set1-COMPASS and consequent promoter nucleosome deacetylation was shown to repress ste11 induction and cell differentiation but the regulatory steps remain poorly understood. A genetic screen highlighted H2B ubiquitylation and the RSC remodeling complex as activators of ste11 expression. Mechanistic analyses revealed more complex, opposite roles of H2B-ub1 at the promoter where it represses expression, and over the transcribed region where it sustains transcription of ste11. By promoting H3K4 methylation at the promoter, H2B-ub1 initiates the deacetylation process, which decreases chromatin remodeling by RSC. Upon induction, this process is reversed and efficient NDR formation leads to high expression. Therefore, H2B-ub1 represses gametogenesis by opposing the recruitment of RSC at the promoter of the master regulator ste11 gene.
