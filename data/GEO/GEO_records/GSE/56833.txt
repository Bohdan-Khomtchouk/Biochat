TITLE
Expression profiling of EvgSc and ompR mutants

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
In order to explore the transcriptional reprogramming in EvgSc, ompR and EvgSc/ompR mutants we have used whole genome microarray profiling.

DESIGN
EvgSc, ompR and EvgSc/ompR mutants were developed. Each mutant was profiled in duplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL13360 Agilent-020097 E. coli Gene Expression Microarray (Feature Number version)
