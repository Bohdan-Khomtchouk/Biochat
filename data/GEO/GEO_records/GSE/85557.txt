TITLE
Expression profile of LNCaP/AR cells with or without HNF4G expression grown for long term in charcoal stripped-serum (CSS) media

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the underlying mechanism of androgen independent growth we performed transcriptome analysis of LNCaP/AR-Vec and LNCaP/AR-HNF4G at day 9 of growth in CSS and LNCaP/AR-HNF4G at 32 days of growth in CSS to identify the HNF4G transcriptome, as well as determinants of castration-resistant growth

DESIGN
RNA-seq

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
