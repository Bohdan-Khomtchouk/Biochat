TITLE
The difference of placental fibroblast between normal pregnancy and preeclampsia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fibrosis are known as one of the characteristic pathological findings of placenta in preeclampsia (PE). The mechanism underlying tissue injury when placental stroma is exposed to hypoxia and inflammatory stimulation is unclear. We focused on the relationship between pathogenesis of PE and placental fibrosis, and investigated the changes of fibrosis related factors (FRFs) in placental stroma. The mRNA levels of fibrosis related factors in PE were higher than those in normal pregnancy (NP). Those under hypoxia and by TGF-β stimulation were more prominent in PE compared with NP. The contraction rate of PE had significantly higher than that of NP. The significant elevation of plasma level of TGF-β in PE was indicated compared with those in NP.

DESIGN
The placental fibroblasts of PE are more sensitive to hypoxia and TGF-β stimulation than those of NP, and are prone to produce fibrosis. This study showed the possibility the placental fibrosis in PE pregnancy is induced by hypoxia and TGFβ stimulation.
