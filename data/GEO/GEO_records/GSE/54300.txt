TITLE
Gene expression analysis of S. cerevisiae treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor CG-1521

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We set out to identify early changes in gene expression in S. cerevisiae after treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor CG-1521.

DESIGN
Exponentially growing yeast cells were treated with 50 Î¼M CG-1521 or vehicle control for 1h. The experiment was performed in two independent biological replicates.
