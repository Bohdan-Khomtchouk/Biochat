TITLE
Expression data from the rat knee articular cartilage at different developmental stages

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Age as the primary rise factor could be play an important role in incidence and development of osteoarthritis. Several studies have confirmed some tissue specific microRNA were associated with development of osteoarthritis. But if age related microRNA or miRNA cluster would be involved in pivotal post-transcriptional gene regulation in osteoarthritis is unclear. In view of this, we have an idea that several age-related miRNAs would be screened from the rat knee cartilage at different development ages by miRNAs Microarray analysis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the rat knee cartilage and identified distinct classes of age-related miRNAs during this process.
