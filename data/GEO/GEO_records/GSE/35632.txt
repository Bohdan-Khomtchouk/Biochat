TITLE
Expression of RpoN molecular roadblock in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in rich media

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The bacterial transcription factor RpoN regulates an extensive network of genes whose products are involved in diverse biological functions.  We constructed a small peptide termed the RpoN molecular roadblock, which binds to and blocks transcription from RpoN promoters.  This RpoN molecular roadblock can be used in any bacterium to obtain information on the RpoN regulon. We expressed the RpoN molecular roadblock in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and used microarrays to identify genes that were differentially transcribed due to the RpoN molecular roadblock.
