TITLE
Expression Profiling of Severed Rat Medial Collateral Ligament Following Injury

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene Expression Profiling of Severed Rat Medial Collateral Ligament at 1, 2, 4, 7,1 0, and 14 days Following Injury with Control and Cultured Ligament Fibroblasts and Rat Universal Reference RNA The aim of this study was to assess the genes involved in the repair of the the dense connective tissue of the a rat ligament in order to provide targets for improvement in healing. Rat whole genome microarrays (Agilent) were used in this study and Cy3 and Cy5 labeled total RNA was extracted and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 prior to fragmentation and hybridization. Keywords: Time course of changes in gene expression in the healing of the rat medial collateral ligament.
