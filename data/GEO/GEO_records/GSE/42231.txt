TITLE
RNA-seq reveals that Air1 and Air2 control TRAMP substrate specificity for nuclear RNA surveillance

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae TRAMP4 and TRAMP5 complexes, which consist of the poly(A) polymerase Trf4 or Trf5, respectively, the zinc knuckle proteins Air1 or Air2, and the RNA helicase Mtr4, play a critical role in nuclear RNA surveillance. Although it is known to enhance the nuclease activity of the exosome, relatively little is known about the exact mechanism and specificity of TRAMP. To better define the specificities of the TRAMP complexes, we used phenotypic analysis and RNA deep-sequencing technology to measure differences in global RNA polyadenylation in air mutants, revealing specific requirements for each Air protein in the regulation of the levels of non-coding and coding RNAs. These findings reveal differential functions for Air proteins in eukaryotic RNA metabolism and indicate that they control the substrate specificity of the RNA exosome.

DESIGN
Poly(A)+ RNA from WT, rrp6-Δ, air1-Δ rrp6-Δ and air2-Δ rrp6-Δ was sequenced using ABI SOLiD platform, in duplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL15263 AB SOLiD 4 System (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
