TITLE
Identification of early flg22 responsive genes in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to identify the early responsive genes activated by the 22 amino acid peptide of bacterial flagellin (flg22) in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells that are involved in the initial responses important for plant innate immunity. We used the microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying intial cellular and molecular responses to microbial associated molecualr patterns (MAMPs).

DESIGN
Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were treated with 100 nM flg22 for 30 min and 60 min.  Transcript profiles were analyzed and compared between control and treated cells to identify early flg22 responsive genes.
