TITLE
Neurotrophin NT3 promotes ovarian primordial to primary follicle transition

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Neurotrophins are growth factors that are known to have a role in promoting cell survival and differentiation. The focus of the current study is to examine the role of neurotrophins in regulating ovarian primordial follicle development. Ovaries from 4-day old rats were placed into organ culture and cultured for 10 days in the absence or presence of neurotrophin-3 (NT3), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), or nerve growth factor (NGF). Treatment of ovaries with NT3 resulted in a significant (P < 0.01) increase in primordial follicle development (i.e. primordial to primary follicle transition). Treatment with BDNF at high doses of 100â€“250 ng/ml also significantly (P < 0.01) increased primordial follicle development, but NGF had no effect. Immunohistochemical studies determined that NT3 was present in granulosa cells, interstitial tissue, and in the oocytes of primordial and primary follicles. The NT3 receptor NTRK3 was present in oocytes at all stages of development. Analysis of ovaries that contain predominantly primordial follicles demonstrated the transcripts for NT3, NTRK3, NGF, and the BDNF/neurotrophin-4 (NT4) receptor NTRK2 are expressed, while BDNF, NT4, and the NGF receptor NTRK1 are not detectable. Inhibition of the NTRK3 receptor with the tyrophostin AG 879 resulted in oocyte death and a significant (P < 0.01) reduction in follicle pool size. Inhibition of the NTRK receptors with K252a slowed primordial to primary follicle transition. A microarray analysis demonstrated that a small number of genes were differentially expressed after NT3 treatment. Observations indicate that the neurotrophin NT3, acting through the NTRK3 receptor in oocytes, promotes the primordial to primary follicle transition.  Reproduction (2009) 138, pp. 697-707 We used microarrays to determine genes expressed differentially between control and NT3 (neurotrophin-3) treated P4 ovary.

DESIGN
RNA samples from 3 control groups are compared to 3 NT3 treated ovary groups.
