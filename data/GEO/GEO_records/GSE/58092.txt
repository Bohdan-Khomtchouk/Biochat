TITLE
Investigation of miRNA expression patterns in Y79 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to investigate the miRNA expression patterns in Y79 cells, which are from a representative retinoblastoma cell line.

DESIGN
We prepared 3 independent sets of cell lysates of Y79 cells in normal culture conditions. Total RNA was prepared from each set of cell lysates using Trizol reagent.
