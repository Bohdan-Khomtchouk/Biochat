TITLE
Wnt5a-deficient vs. wild-type E18 liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of E18.5 livers derived from Wnt5a-deficient (KO) mice compared to those from littermate wild-type (WT) mice. RNA samples were extracted from whole livers derived from E18.5 fetuses.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: Wnt5a KO vs. WT whole livers. Total RNA samples were extracted from E18.5 whole livers. KO and WT samples were a mixture of RNA solutions derived from two Wnt5a KO livers and two WT livers, respectively.
