TITLE
Histone architecture of stem-cell memory T cells reveals progressive remodeling of epigenetic landscape in antigen-experienced CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the genomic landscape of histone modifications in antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells. Using a ChIP-Seq approach coupled with global gene expression profiling [GSE67825], we generated genome-wide histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) trimethylation maps in distinct subsets of CD8+ T cells - na√Øve, stem cell memory, central memory, and effector memory.

DESIGN
To gain insight into how histone architecture is remodeled during the differentiation of activated T cells

PLATFORM
GPL9185 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Mus musculus)
