TITLE
Cancer-associated fibroblasts-secreted CXCL14-regulated LINC00092 mediates ovarian cancer progression by altering glycolysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) constitutes a major gynecological malignancy, with a reported incidence rate of 3-12/100 000 woman annually. As early symptoms of ovarian cancer are often clinically atypical or absent, the majority of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at a late stage, when the five-year survival rate is extremely low. This condition underscores the urgency of early detection of these patients and establishment of new therapeutic targets for successful intervention. Considering that the predominant biological characteristic that differentiates malignant from benign tumors is the ability to metastasize, it is necessary to identify novel metastasis-related molecules for ovarian cancer. In this study, we found that CAFs could significantly increase the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells compared with non-cancer associated fibroblasts(NAFs), which is associated with over-expression of CXCL14 in CAFs. We examined the impact of CAF-secreted CXCL14 on the lncRNA expression profiles in ovarian cancer during metastasis.

DESIGN
We treated A2780s ovarian cancer cell line with recombinant CXCL14 protein and control respectively and subjected them to Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray v3.0 to profile differential lncRNAs in ovarian cancer upon treatment of CXCL14
