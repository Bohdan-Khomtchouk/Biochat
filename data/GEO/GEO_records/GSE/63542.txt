TITLE
Gene expression profiles of the Cited4-siRNA-transduced cells and the non-transduced cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the gene expression profiles of the Cited4-siRNA-transduced cells and the nontransduced cells.

DESIGN
Embryoid body was formed as in vitro cardiogenesis. For comparison of gene expression profiles of  the Cited4-siRNA-transduced cells and the nontransduced cells, total RNA was extracted from  the Cited4-siRNA-transduced cells at day 6.5 and the nontransduced cells at day 6.5.
