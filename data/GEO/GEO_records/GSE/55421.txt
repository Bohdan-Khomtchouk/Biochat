TITLE
Genome-wide maps of SNAI2 binding in undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the ChIP-Seq results of SNAI2 in several different conditions which include: SNAI2 binding in both control and SNAI2 knockdown cells to demonstrate specificity of the binding. SNAI2 ChIP-Seq was also performed in SNAI2 or control LACZ overexpressing cells cultured in growth medium as well as LACZ or SNAI2 overexpressing cells in differentiation medium.

DESIGN
Examination of SNAI2 binding sites across the genome using the 6 different conditions

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
