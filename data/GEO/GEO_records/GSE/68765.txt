TITLE
Expression analysis of human PBMCs stimulated with Borrelia, MDP or Pam3cys.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis examining the effect of the Crohn's disease-associated ATG16L1 polymorphism on the responses to stimulation components derived from various bacteria classes.

DESIGN
Expression analysis was performed on RNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy genotyped volunteers were stimulated for 24h with RPMI alone, or RPMI containing heat-killed Borrelia burgdorferi , muramyl dipeptide (MDP) or Pam3Cys.
