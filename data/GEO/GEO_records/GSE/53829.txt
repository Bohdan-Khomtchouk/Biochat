TITLE
A Ten-microRNA signature identified from a genome-wide microRNA expression profiling in human epithelial ovarian cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Ovarian tissue samples  including 15 normal tissue samples  and 48 malignant ovarian tissue  were collected at Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University. All tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after being removed from body and stored at -80Â°C. Biovue's Sharpvue miRNA qPCR array panels (A-E) including 1721 unique assays were used to quantitate genome-wide miRNA gene expression from the collected ovarian tissue samples.

DESIGN
qPCR genome-wide miRNA gene expression profiling for ovarian tissue samples from clinical hosptial.  Equal amount total RNA from each sample was used in gene expression analysis. Normal (n=14) and (n=45) samples.
