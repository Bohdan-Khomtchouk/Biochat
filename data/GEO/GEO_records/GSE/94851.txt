TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3, H4 acetylation (H4ac) and TBP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to compare Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS)-derived genome-wide occupancy of H3, H4 acetylation and TBP in S. cerevisiae wildtype strains.

DESIGN
Examination of H3, H4ac, TBP, Bdf1 (SRP010134), Taf1 (SRP010134), Swr1 (SRP028548), and Htz1 (SRP035413) in wildtype yeast strains. The following bedGraph files were generated using the following third-party SRA data: Bdf1.bedGraph: SRP010134/SRX114994/SRR397550 Htz1.bedGraph: SRP035413/SRX433134/SRR1118262 (GEO GSE54105/GSM1308195) Swr1.bedGraph: SRP028548/SRX332103/SRR948403 Taf1.bedGraph: SRP010134/SRX114691/SRR396796
