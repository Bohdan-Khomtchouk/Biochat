TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Differential Expression Analysis of miRNA Expression In the Whole Blood Samples Obtained From Prostate Cancer Patients vs. Controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Research conducted using the novel approach of Next Generation Sequencing to determine the differentially expressed microRNAs in whole blood samples from prostate cancer patients.

DESIGN
The whole blood miRNA  samples from both controls and patients were sequences and a differential expressional analysis was conducted to identify possible biomarkers to distinguish patients from controls.
