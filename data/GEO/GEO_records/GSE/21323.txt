TITLE
Protein arginine methyltransferase AtPRMT5 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In this study, we analyzed the Arabidopsis homologue of PRMT5, AtPRMT5â€™s function in RNA processing. RNA-seq analyses revealed that AtPRMT5 is involved in a subset of pre-mRNA splicing. Several RNA processing factors involved in regulating flowering time were validated that the corresponding intron retention surely exists in atprmt5 mutants. AtSm proteins can also be methylated by AtPRMT5 in vitro and in vivo, which may be the reasons for the pre-mRNA splicing defects in atprmt5.
