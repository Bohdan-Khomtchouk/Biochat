TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of   transcription factor PfNF-YB in Plasmodium falciparum.

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
PfNF-YB is a transcription factor of Plasmodium falciparum and is known as a CCAAT-box-binding subunit B. PfNF-YB belongs to NF-Y complex family that is conserved from yeast to human. PfNF-YB is highly expressed in schizont stage and co-localized at the nucleus in mature form during intraerythrocytic stage. We found that melatonin and cAMP second messenger can modulate the PfNF-YB expression in P. falciparum. To better understand the function of PfNF-YB in P. falciparum we proposed to perform chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of PfNF-YB together with chromatin profiling by ChIP-on-chip analysis. The results showed that PfNF-YB binds to CCAAT of several genes in schizont stage.
