TITLE
Rev-erb alpha citrome in brown adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have reported that cold temperature challenge results in a dramatic decrease in levels of the transcriptional repressor, Rev-erb alpha. Performing Rev-erb alpha ChIP-seq on brown adipose from wildtype animals kept at thermoneutrality or cold-challenged (and using Rev-erb alpha KO brown adipose as a control), we were able to globally determine the genomic regions undergoing Rev-erb alpha-dependent de-repression.

DESIGN
Examination of Rev-erb alpha binding in brown adipose tissues under thermoneutral and cold-challenged conditions
