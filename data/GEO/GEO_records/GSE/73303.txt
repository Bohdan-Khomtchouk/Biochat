TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Methylation Profiling in Skeletal Muscle from Lean and Obese Subjects [Bisulfite-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Obesity is a metabolic disease caused by environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors.  However, the epigenetic mechanisms of obesity are incompletely understood. The aim of our study was to identify skeletal muscle DNA methylation patterns in obesity.

DESIGN
Muscle biopsies were obtained basally from lean (n=11) and obese (n=9) participants in combination with euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps to assess insulin sensitivity. We performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing next generation methylation analysis on DNA isolated from vastus lateralis muscle biopsies.
