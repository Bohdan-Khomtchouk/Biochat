TAF6 orchestrates transcription programs and apoptosis in the absence of p53

SUMMARY
The decision of metazoan cells to live or undergo programmed cell death hinges on the balance between the levels of pro- versus anti-apoptotic gene products. The general RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription factor, TFIID, plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression through its core promoter recognition and co-activator functions. The core TFIID subunit TAF6 is a co-activator for the pro-apoptotic p53 tumour suppressor protein. Our previous studies identified a specialized isoform of TAF6, termed TAF6 that can specifically be induced in apoptosis. To elucidate the impact of TAF6 on gene expression and cell death, we employed modified antisense oligonucleotides to enforce expression of endogenous TAF6. The induction of endogenous TAF6 triggered apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. Importantly, TAF6 also induces apoptosis in tumor cell lines devoid of p53, placing TAF6 function downstream of p53. Microarray experiments uncovered a TAF6-induced transcriptome landscape displaying enhanced expression of genes of the Notch, oxidative stress, integrin, p53 and apoptosis pathways. Our data show that the TAF6 pathway is a pivotal signalling nexus that controls pro-apoptotic gene expression programs.
