TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Analysis of Wild Type and SRSF10-/- embryonic day 13.5 heart Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated the SRSF10 -/- mice, and collected their embryonic heart at 13.5 and controls. Then, we extracted RNAs of embryonic heart and performed next generation sequencing. By comparing sequcing data from WT and SRSF10 -/- samples, we profiled the alternative splicing events and gene expression regulated by SRSF10 during mouse heart development process.

DESIGN
E13.5 embryonic heart mRNA profiles of wild type (WT) and SRSF10-/- mice were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq2000.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
