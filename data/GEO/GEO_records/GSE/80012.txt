TITLE
Gene expression alteration in FoxQ2 knockdown sea uchin embryos

ORGANISM
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor FoxQ2 is required for anterior pole neural development in  S. purpuratus embryos. To understand the gene regulatory network driving  neurogenesis in the anterrior pole region, it is necessary to  identify genes that depend on FoxQ2.    We carried out a microarray experiment to compare gene expression changes in FoxQ2 knockdown embryos.

DESIGN
One control and one knockdown example were prepared for comparison.
