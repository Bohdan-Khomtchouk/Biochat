TITLE
The role of vimentin in regulating genes related to EMT

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the biological and functional role of vimentin in maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype of mammary epithelial cells, vimentin was silenced in the non-transformed MCF10A cells and vimentin-dependent changes in gene expression were analyzed.

DESIGN
Scrambled is the siScr-transfected control with two replicates; KD the sample with vimentin knockdown, also two replicates.
