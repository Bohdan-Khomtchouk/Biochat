TITLE
Identification of transcripts altered upon LIN-41 knockdown in human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify transcripts altered upon LIN-41 knockdown, we transfected either a control siRNA or one of two different LIN-41 siRNAs into human embryonic stem cells and collected total RNA 72 hours after transfection.

DESIGN
We compared transcript levels between control siRNA or LIN-41 siRNA treated cells.
