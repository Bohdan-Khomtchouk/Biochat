TITLE
Rice global gene expression profile in response to plant hormones

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
A time course gene expression profiling of rice treated with various plant hormones (abscisic acid, gibberelin, auxin, brassinosteroid, cytokinin and jasmonic acid)  was performed to obtain an overall signature of the rice transcriptome in response to each phytohormone.

DESIGN
The transcriptome of rice seedlings treated with various plant hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellic acid 3 (GA3), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), brassinolide (BL), trans-zeatin (tZ), and jasmonic acid (JA) was characterized by microarray analysis. Seven-day old seedlings were transferred in culture solutions with specific hormones and in culture solution without hormone to serve as control (mock treatment). Root samples were collected and analyzed in three replicates at pretreatment (control) and after 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h and 6 h incubation in culture solutions with each hormone. Shoot samples were collected and analyzed in two replicates at pretreatment (control) and after 1 h, 3 h, 6 h and 12 h incubation culture solutions with each hormone. A total of 93 microarray data for root and 50 microarray data for shoot were obtained.
