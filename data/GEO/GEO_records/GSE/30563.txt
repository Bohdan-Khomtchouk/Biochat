TITLE
Gene Expression data from human brain tumor or normal brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stem cells from various lineages have well known for its migration tendency toward glioma and become attractive vehicles to deliver therapeutic genes to brain tumors. However, which factors and mechanisms work in these function is not yet known. To identify those factors and mechanisms, we analyzed the brain tumor-specific gene expression profile using microarray analysis

DESIGN
To identify genes that are differentially expressed, human brain tumor samples and normal brains were collected from brain tumor patients for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To obtain samples, we got patients consent to collect and analysis of sample. All of three normal brains (N2, N3, N4) and brain tumor, Gliobalstoma (T2),  Ganglioglioma (T3) and shwannoma(T4), are used for experiment.
