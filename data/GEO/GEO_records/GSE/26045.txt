TITLE
cordycepin-Energetic Homeostasis and Sugar Signaling

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
bra-inra09-01_bioen - cordycepin - Diversification of the Molecular Mechanisms Involved in the Control of the Energetic Balance in Angiosperms - To evaluate the importance of mRNA stability control in glucose signaling, genome wide RNA transcript levels changes will be evaluated in response to short term treatments with glucose or glucose plus abscisic acid (ABA) under conditions of transcriptional inhibition in Arabidopsis. The underlying mechanisms will be investigated for a selected number of co-regulated genes (transcription factors, kinases).

DESIGN
12 dye-swap - treatment variations

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
