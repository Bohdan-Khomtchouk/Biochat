TITLE
Transcriptomic profiles of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) in response to alkalinity stress

ORGANISM
Oryzias latipes

SUMMARY
Alkalinity stress is considered to be one of the major stressors for fish in saline-alkali water. Thus, it is of great significance from both aquaculture and physiological viewpoint to understand the molecular genetic response of aquatic organisms to alkalinity stress. The objective of this study is to determine genome-wide gene expression profiles to better understand the physiology response of medaka (Oryzias latipes) to high carbonate alkalinity stress. In lab-based cultures, adult fish were exposed to freshwater and high carbonate alkalinity water .We designed a microarray containing 26429 oligonucleotides and describe our experimental results for measuring gene expression changes in the gill of carbonate alkalinity stress exposed fish.

DESIGN
The fish were exposed to freshwater (FW) and high carbonate alkalinity water (AW) for 96h, each with three replicates.
