TITLE
Adult and Neonatal dorsal horn gene expression 7 day post sciatic nerve SNI injury

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
As rats do not develop neuropathic pain like hypersensitivity as neonates post nerve injury but do as adults we have used these arrays to help define the processes involved in this process. Rat spinal cord (ipsilateral dorsal horn) was assayed 7 days post SNI injury to the sciatic nerve relative to sham injury. Two age groups of animals were tested Neonates (P10) and Adult (8-12wks). Keywords: Two way analysis of differential regulation

DESIGN
Six biologically indepenedent arrays were hybridized per assay point.  Dorsal horn total RNA was prepared using standard Affymetrix protocols. Affymetrix Rat Expression 230A array used.
