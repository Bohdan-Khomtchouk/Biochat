TITLE
Association of maternal mRNA with the spindle in mouse oocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The oocytes of many species, both invertebrate and vertebrate, contain a large collection of localized determinants in the form of proteins and translationally inactive maternal mRNAs. However, it is unknown whether mouse oocytes contain localized MmRNA determinants and what mechanisms might be responsible for their control. We collected intact MII oocytes, enucleated MII oocyte cytoplasts (with the spindle removed), and spindle-chromosome complexes which had been microsurgically removed. RNA was extracted, amplified, labeled, and applied to microarrays to determine if any MmRNA determinants were localized to the SCC.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to determine whether maternal mRNAs in mouse oocytes are enriched in the meiotic spindle
