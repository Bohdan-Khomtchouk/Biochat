TITLE
The significance of phosphorylation for FXR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The serine or threonine between two zinc fingers of the DNA binding domains (DBD) is highly conserved in a majority of nuclear receptors. In the present study, we focused on the serine 154 of farnesoid X receptor (FXR). To determine the influence of phosphomimetic or non-phosphomimetic mutation for FXR on gene expressions, we employed cDNA microarray analysis using COS-1 cells which ectopically express FXR S154A or FXR S154D with DMSO or CDCA.
