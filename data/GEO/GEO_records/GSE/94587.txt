TITLE
Transcriptome analysis revealed impaired cAMP responsiveness in PHF21A-deficient human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-Seq on PHF21A-deficient patient-dervied lymphoblasts as well as two unaffected individuals.

DESIGN
We performed RNA-Seq from patient-derived lymphoblast cells. Libraries were polyA-selected and strand-specific according to the protocol described in PMID: 25607527
