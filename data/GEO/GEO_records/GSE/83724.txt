TITLE
PAX3-FOXO1 requires BRD4 to drive oncogene addiction in RMS cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The fusion transcription factor PAX3-FOXO1 drives oncogenesis in a subset of rhabdomyosarcomas, however the mechanisms by which it remodels chromatin are unknown.  We find PAX3-FOXO1 reprograms the cis-regulatory landscape by inducing super enhancers (SEs), in collaboration with master transcription factors MYOG, MYOD and MYCN.  This myogenic SE circuitry is consistent across cell lines and primary tumors. Deregulation of PAX3-FOXO1 itself occurs by translocation-induced chromatin loops bringing the PAX3 promoter under the control of FOXO1 enhancers.   Protein targets induced by, or bound to, PAX3-FOXO1 occupied SEs, were selectively sensitive to small molecule inhibition. PAX3-FOXO1 co-binds BRD4 at SEs, and BET bromodomains are required for PAX3-FOXO1-dependent transcription and cancer cell growth.

DESIGN
RNA-seq in FP-RMS cells exposed to either DMSO or JQ1 treatment, and RNA-seq of fibroblast cells stably transduced with either empty vector or PAX3-FOXO1 vector.
