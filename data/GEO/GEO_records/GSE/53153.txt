TITLE
Impact of mutant p53 on TNF-induced gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDA-MB-231 are a metastatic triple-negative breast cancer cell line that bears a missense p53 mutation (R280K). We depleted endogenous mutp53 in MDA-MB-231 cells by siRNA transfection, and treated the cells with Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha. Microarray analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of mutant p53 on the transcriptional response triggered by TNFα in these cells.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with control or p53 siRNA were treated with TNFα for 20 hrs or left untreated. The study comprises four experimental points, each in triplicate.
