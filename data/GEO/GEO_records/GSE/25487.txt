TITLE
Expression of SV40 TAg signature in MDAMB231 cells, tumors, and normal human mammary epithelial cells (M98040 and M99005)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDAMB231 cells express the SV40TAg signature.  The normal mammary epithelial tissue does not express the signature. CK0082, Empty1 and Gata3 samples are not reported in this manuscript

DESIGN
We used microarrays to determine whether the MDAMB231 cell lines and tumors express the SV40Tag signature (91 gene signature).
