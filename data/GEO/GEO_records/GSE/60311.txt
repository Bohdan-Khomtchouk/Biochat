TITLE
Response to drought and salt stress in leaves of poplar (Populus alba × P. glandulosa): Expression profiling by oligonucleotide microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Populus alba x Populus glandulosa

SUMMARY
We performed that comprehensive identification of genes responsible for stress tolerance by analyzing the whole-genome expression profiles of poplar (Populus alba × P. glandulosa) leaves exposed to drought and salt stresses. Examination at the molecular level how this tree species responds to drought and salt stresses by regulating the expression of genes involved in signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and stress responses.

DESIGN
Genome-wide analysis was conducted in poplar leaves exposed to drought and salt stresses.The plants were acclimated in soil and grown for 6 weeks in controlled conditions in a growth room (16 h light; light intensity, 150 μmol m-2sec-1; 24°C). Plants with a height of about 15 cm were separately exposed to either drought or salt stress. Up- and down-regulated genes were identified, and their putative functions are discussed.
