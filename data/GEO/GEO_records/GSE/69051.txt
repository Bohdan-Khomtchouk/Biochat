TITLE
Transferring genomics to the clinic: distinguishing Burkitt and Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (v4)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out for RNA extracted from Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies of 156 new patients using the Illumina DASL version 4 platform, plus 71 replicate samples from version 3 platform and 12 replicates from GSE32918. Then the patients were classified into BL and DLBCL by moleclar classifier proposed in the article.

DESIGN
The molecular classification result of the replicate samples are used to evaluated the reproducibility of the classifier, and the clinic diagnosis were used to compare the agreement with the classifier

PLATFORM
GPL14951 Illumina HumanHT-12 WG-DASL V4.0 R2 expression beadchip
