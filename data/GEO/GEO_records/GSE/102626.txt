TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the Novosphingobium resinovorum SA1 strain grown on sulfanilic acid and glucose

ORGANISM
Novosphingobium resinovorum

SUMMARY
Novosphingobium resinovorum strain SA1 is one of few strains capable of degrading sulfanilic acid which is a widely used representative of sulfonated aromatic compounds. In order to identify the elements involved in the biodegradation process and to understand the metabolic responces of the cells exposed to this aromatic compound, we performed a whole transcriptome analysis of cells grown on sulfanilic acid and glucose.  Additionally, for distinguish the potential stress/starvation effects of the xenobiotic we compared the transcript profiles of samples taken from both the exponential and stationary growth phases.

DESIGN
8 samples -  including two replicas in each point - were analyzed as follows. 2-2 paralel samples were taken from the exponential phase cells grown on sulfanilic acid and glucose. These are for comparing the transcript profiles of the actively growing cells using sulfanilic acid (xenobiotic) and glucose (control) as substrates. For modeling the starvation effect, 2-2 samples/replicas were taken from the stationary phase cells grown on glucose and sulfanilic acid.
