TITLE
Expression profile of ZOS and ZOSM osteosarcoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pulmonary metastasis is the main cause of medical failure and death of osteosarcoma patients. Despite intensive search for new therapeutic strategies, survival has not improved during the last two decades. Therefore, itâ€™s very urgent to understand the underlying mechanisms of tumor progression to identify targets of novel therapies for osteosarcoma. We used microarrays to identify the metastasis-driving gene during osteosarcoma metastasis

DESIGN
Microarrays are performed in ZOS and ZOSM-two syngenic primary human osteosarcoma cell lines with low and high metastatic potential which are established in our lab

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
