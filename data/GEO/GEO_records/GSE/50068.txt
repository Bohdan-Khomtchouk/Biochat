TITLE
MiR-21 is targeted by STAT5 but dispensable for mammary gland development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we identifies miR-21 to by under cytokine control through the transcription factor STAT5 and while miR-21 is differentially expressed during mammary gland development, miR-21 is dispensable for mammary development and lactation.

DESIGN
