TITLE
Ets-1 over-expression in ovarian cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Ets-1 is over-expressed in a wide variety of cancers, and has been strongly associated with the upregulation of factors involved in metastasis and angiogenesis. In this study, we created an inducible Ets-1 over-expressing ovarian cancer cell line from parental 2008 ovarian cancer cells that do not express detectable levels of Ets-1 protein. This microarray compares the stable over-expressing Ets-1 ovarian cancer cell line (2008-Ets1) to their parental 2008 cells to examine differences in gene expression beyond metastasis and angiogenesis.

DESIGN
Two samples were used: 2008 ovarian cancer cells, and 2008-Ets1 ovarian cancer cells which over-express Ets-1. Included in this analysis are three independent replicates for each sample.
