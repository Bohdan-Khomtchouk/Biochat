TITLE
Deep sequencing and de novo assembly of the mouse oocyte transcriptome define the contribution of transcription to the DNA methylation landscape.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have performed deep RNA-Seq and de novo transcriptome assembly at different stages of mouse oogenesis. This revealed thousands of novel non-annotated genes as well as alternative promoters for ~10% of reference genes expressed in oocytes, a large fraction of which coincide with transposable elements of the MaLR and ERVK families. We defined the oocyte DNA methylation landscape as composed of large-scale hyper- and hypo-methylated domains. Correlation with our transcriptome assembly revealed that transcription correlates accurately with DNA methylation and potentially account for ~85-90% of the DNA methylome.
