TITLE
Hi-C study of the E. coli MG1655 chromosome

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
We performed Hi-C analysis of Escherichia coli MG1655 cells in exponential and stationary growth phase. We could detect long-range interactions predominantly in the Ori domain of the chromosome. Interestingly, the use of a new type of control revealed that these interactions are mostly crosslinking independent.

DESIGN
6 samples from exponential phase growth in M9 medium; 6 samples from stationary phase growth in M9 medium; for each growth condition, 3 samples were with crosslinking and 3 samples were without.

PLATFORM
GPL18956 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655)
