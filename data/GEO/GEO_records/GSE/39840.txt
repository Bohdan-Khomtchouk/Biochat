TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of Endotoxin-stimulated Leukocytes of the Newly Born: Control of Cytokine Gene Expression by Interleukin-10.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Introduction: Increasing evidence now supports the association between the fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) with the pathogenesis of preterm labor, intraventricular hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. These disorders are among the most important causes of mortality and morbidity in the perinatal period. During the fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and monocytes (MONOs) are sequentially recruited into the placenta; the same process occurs in the lung of the newborn during the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of the study was to reveal cell-specific differences in gene expression and cytokine release in response to endotoxin that would elucidate inflammatory control mechanisms in the newly born. Results: Compared to PMNs, MONOs had a greater diversity and more robust expression of pro-inflammatory (PI) gene expression at 4h. Only MONOs had genes changing expression in the JAK/STAT pathway including interleukin-10.

DESIGN
Isolation of cord blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes separately from 5 subjects. Endotoxin stimulation in cell culture for 4 hours. Comparison of gene expression between PBS versus endotoxin (LPS).
