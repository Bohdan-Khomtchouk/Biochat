TITLE
Genome-wide binding pattern of PU.1 in normal erythroid progenitors and erythroleukemia cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We find that the myeloid master regulatory transcription factor, PU.1, binds to > 16,000 sites in both normal and leukemic erythroid cells. Of these bound sites, ~7,000 lie within 2kb of TSS of a gene, suggesting PU.1 may regulate a large number of genes in erythroid cells. Coupling this data with gene expression analysis, we show PU.1 directly regulates several critical signaling pathways in erythroid cells.

DESIGN
Assaying PU.1 occupancy in normal and leukemic erythroid cells

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
