TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana under phosphate starvation stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We performed a transcriptomic analysis of Pi starvation responses in Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0) wild type plants under phosphate starvation stress and in plants with altered PHR1(-like) activity, comparing mutants of phr1 and phr1-phl1 grown in phosphate-lacking medium. Results show the central role of PHR1 and functionally redundant members of its family in the control of transcriptional responses to Pi starvation.

DESIGN
The analysis was performed in wild-type plants grown for seven days in complete (+Pi) and Pi-lacking (-Pi) Johnson solid media and the single phr1 and double phr1-phl1 mutants grown for 7 days in â€“Pi medium. Three independent biological samples of total RNA from shoot and root were hybridized separately.
