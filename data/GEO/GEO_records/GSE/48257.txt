TITLE
Gene expression analysis of H9 hESC derived cardiomyocytes (CM) and neuron stem cells (NSC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we generated wildtype H9 hESC derived cardiomyocytes (CM) and neural stem cells (NSC) by in vitro differentiation. Global gene expression profiles were compared among undifferentiated H9 hESC and the derived CM and NSC.

DESIGN
Comparison of global gene expression profiles of undifferentiated H9 hESC and the derived CM and NSC populations.
