TITLE
Expression data from conventional osteosarcoma compared to primary non-neoplastic osteoblast cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In osteosarcoma patients, the development of metastases, often to the lungs, is the most frequent cause of death. To improve this situation, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing osteosarcoma development and dissemination and the identification of novel drug targets for an improved treatment are needed. Towards this aim, we characterized osteosarcoma tissue samples compared to primary osteoblast cells using Affymetrix HG U133A microarrays.
