TITLE
H1299 cells: p53 transcriptional response in hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of H1299 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells transfected with either wt p53 or mut(175) p53 driven by the 5xHRE promoter (5 repeats of hypoxia-inducible factor response elements) and treated for 16 h with normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia( < 0.1% O2). 5xHRE promoter ensures that p53 expression is induced in hypoxic conditions only. Goal was to determine the transcriptional response of p53 in hypoxia and the 175 p53 mutant was used as a control as it is DNA-binding defective and transcription-incompetent mutant.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment: wt p53-transfected H1299 cells treated with normoxia, mut p53-transfected H1299 cells treated with normoxia, wt p53-transfected H1299 cells treated with hypoxia, mut p53-transfected H1299 cells treated with hypoxia. Biological replicates: 1 normoxic sample with wt p53, 1 normoxic sample with mut p53, 3 hypoxic samples with wt p53, 3 hypoxic samples with mut p53.
