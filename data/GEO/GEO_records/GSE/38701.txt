TITLE
Transcriptional expression patterns triggered by chemically distinct neuroprotective molecules

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To increase our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie neuroprotection following glutamate receptor-induced excitotoxicity, we treated primary CD-1 mouse cortical neurons with NMDA in the presence of absence of neuroprotective compounds. The results indicate a convergence at the level of whole genome expression, despite the divergent chemistries and purported mechanisms of action. While more arrays were performed than published, only the extreme arrays were used in subsequent analyses.

DESIGN
CD-1 Mouse cortical neurons were exposed to NMDA, in the presence or absence of neuroprotective molecules, followed by a recovery period (16hr) and total RNA extraction.
