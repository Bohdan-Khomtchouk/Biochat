TITLE
RNF17 referees ping-pong in mouse testes [RIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In mammals, piRNA populations are dynamic throughout male germ cell development. Embryonic piRNAs consist of both primary and secondary species and are mainly directed toward transposons. In meiotic cells, however, the piRNA population is transposon-poor and restricted to primary piRNAs derived from pachytene piRNA clusters1-6. The mechanism controlling which piRNAs are present at each developmental stage is poorly understood. Here we show that RNF17 shapes adult meiotic piRNA content by suppressing the production of secondary piRNAs. In the absence of RNF17, ping-pong (secondary amplification) occurs inappropriately in meiotic cells – aberrantly targeting protein-coding genes and lncRNAs. Our data indicate that RNF17 comprises one component of a “refereeing” mechanism that prevents deleterious activity of the meiotic piRNA pathway by ensuring the selective loading of PIWI proteins with products of meiotic piRNA clusters.
