TITLE
Translatome and transcriptome profiling of FK866 response in Jurkat cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We treated Jurkat cells for 48 hr with a sublethal dose of FK866 (5 nM) and DMSO (Mock, control treatment).  RNA samples for microarrays derived from fractionated samples by sucrose gradient (sub-polysomes, polysomes), giving us the chance to perform an analysis among polysomal/subpolysomal distribution in treated or untreated cells and the possibility to identify the multi-level gene expression regulation effects of FK866. We are interested to find differentially expressed genes, in the early phase of cell response to FK866, and genes that account for a specific post-transcriptional regulation exerted by the cell in response to the drug. Keywords: polysomal profiling, translatome profiling, polysomal RNA, subpolysomal RNA,  translational profiling, polysome profiling, post-transcriptional regulation, FK866, translational efficiency.

DESIGN
Gene expression signals derived from the polysomal and subpolysomal RNA populations were compared by microarrays analysis to those obtained from total RNAs (derived from the sum of all the fractions in the polysomal gradient). Polysomal RNA, subpolysomal RNA and total RNA were isolated from Jurkat cells treated with FK866 5 nM  or DMSO (mock, control treatment) for 48 hr. Cells lysates were collected from control cells (mock) and from treated cells (FK866). All experiments were run in biological quadruplicates.
