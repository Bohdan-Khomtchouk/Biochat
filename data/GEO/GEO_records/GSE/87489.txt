TITLE
Gene expression data from mice Ago2-amygdala

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we aimed to uncover which mRNAs are changed in the Ago2-amygdala complex following chronic social defeat in mice We used microarrays to determine which mRNAs are changed in the Ago2-amygdala complexof mice following chronic social defeat compared to control

DESIGN
Mice were subjected to chronic social defeat. 8 days following the end of the protocol, mice were sacrificed and amygdala was collected. The amygdala was immunoprecipitated using Ago2 beads and RNA was extracted to microarray.
