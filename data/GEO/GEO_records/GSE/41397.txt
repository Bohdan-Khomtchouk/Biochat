TITLE
IP of 5-methylcytosine (5-hmC) enriched DNA fragments from control and PB treated mouse livers (91 day)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
5-hmC is an epigenetic modification of the DNA base cytosine with roles in gene silencing events, imprinting and X inactivation. Phenobarbital (PB) is a well studied non-genotoxic carcinogen with roles in epigenetic perturbation.  We profile 5hmC in both control mouse livers as well as in the livers of 91 day PB treated mice. 5hmC is largely found to reside in the bodies of active genes and promoter levels are perturbed upon PB induced gene activation events. 5-hmC is assocated with promoters fo silent genes. Upon PB exposire a handfull of genes are induced which reveal decreases in promoter 5hmC levels

DESIGN
comparison of 5-hmC profiles in 5 control and 5 PB exposed mouse livers (dose: 91day PB)

PLATFORM
GPL16143 NimbleGen Mouse 2.1M deluxe promoter array (ver. 2)
