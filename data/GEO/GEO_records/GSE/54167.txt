TITLE
Disruption of FAT10-MAD2 binding inhibits tumor progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FAT10 interacts with MAD2 and caused tumor progression. The hypothesis tested in the present study was FAT10 induces tumor progression through its binding to MAD2 and Disruption of this binding restored its global gene expression

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from wild-type HCT116, stable FAT overexpressed HCT116, and FAT10 mutants, where its binding with MAD2 was disrupted or abolished.
