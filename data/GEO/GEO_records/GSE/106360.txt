TITLE
Epigenome analysis of pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast tumor samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylome-wide DNA methylation profiling of spatially separated breast tumor samples pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to characterize methylation heterogeneity alteration by NAC. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs in the 47 samples derived from 8 breast cancer patients.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 47 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
