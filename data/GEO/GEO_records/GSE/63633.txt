TITLE
miRNA gene expression profiling of primary tumors and lung metastases using a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic mammary carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of a total of 566 miRNA genes and controls in 24 laser microdissected samples (normal lung parenchyma, normal mammary glands, lung metastases, primary tumor carcinoma and primary tumor EMT) and Jyg MC (A) GFP/Luc cells and spheres

DESIGN
Laser-capture microdissection combined with NanoString gene expression assays  of microRNAsÂ  revealed overexpression of either epithelial or mesenchymal markers in epithelial and spindle-like cell regions, respectively

PLATFORM
GPL19460 nCounter Mouse miRNA Expression Assay
