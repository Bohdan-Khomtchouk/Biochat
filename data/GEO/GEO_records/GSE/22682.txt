TITLE
Global gene expression analysis in the pedicel abscission zone of tomato flowers by DNA microarray

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
In tomato, the mutants that lack the abscission zone (AZ) within pedicels are called a ‘jointless’ and are agronomically significant in that they increase the tomato fruit yield for industrial processing. We have employed  DNA microarray expression analysis to identify genes with the potential to play a role in development of the pedicel abscission zone of tomato, and identified several classes of differentially regulated genes between pedicels of the AZ-forming line (wild-type) and pedicels of the non AZ-forming lines (jointless mutant and MC-suppressed transformant).

DESIGN
Tomato flower pedicels were harvested at anthesis stage from the AZ-forming line (wild-type) and the non AZ-forming lines (jointless mutant and MC-suppressed transformant), and subjected to DNA microarray analyses.  Experiments were performed twice with independently prepared samples.
