TITLE
Comparison of the transcriptional profiles of the retinal pigmental epithelium/choroid from young and old mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize underlying changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid with age, we produced gene expression profiles for the RPE/choroid and compared the transcriptional profiles of the RPE/choroid from young and old mice. The changes in the aged RPE/choroid suggest that the tissue has become immunologically active. Such phenotypic changes in the normal aged RPE/choroid may provide a background for the development of age-related macular degeneration. Keywords: age-related change

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression of retinal pigmental epithelium/choroid from young and old animals. There were 4 samples from young mice and 4 samples from old mice. Each sample contained 4 retinal pigmental epithelium/choroid from 2 animals
