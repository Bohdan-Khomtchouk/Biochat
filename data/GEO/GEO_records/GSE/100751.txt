TITLE
Repression of stress-induced LINE-1 expression protects cancer cell populations from lethal drug-exposures [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DTP heterochromatin in genomic repeat regions protects the population from drug-induced death.

DESIGN
Investigation of RNA expression changes in heterogenous parental populations as compared to drug treated and drugtolerant populations. Also included are TSA treated parental and drug-tolerant populations
