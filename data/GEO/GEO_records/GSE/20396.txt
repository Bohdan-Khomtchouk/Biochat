TITLE
Expression data of LCM-dissected retina layers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analyzed the transcript expression in different LCM-dissected cell layers isolated from mouse retinas adapted to light or dark in order to identify transcripts potentially targetted by retinal microRNAs which are regulated in response to light treatment

DESIGN
Retinas were isolated from adult mice adapted to light or dark following LCM dissection of photoreceptors (ONL+OS/IS), inner nuclear layer (INL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), ganglion cell layer (GCL) and whole retina samples. Experiments were performed in duplicates. Total RNA was extracted and hybridization on Affymatrix array was performed.
