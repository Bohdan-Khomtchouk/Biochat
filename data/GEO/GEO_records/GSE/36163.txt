TITLE
Expression analysis of HFF cells in G1 phase [TileShuffle]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome expression analysis of HFF cells on Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0 array set. Cells were synchronised by serum starvation and transcriptome-wide expression in G1 phase. Expression data were processed with our new permutation approach TileShuffle.

DESIGN
We analyzed one Affymetrix Human Tiling 1.0R set
