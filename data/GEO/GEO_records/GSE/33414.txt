TITLE
Zebrafish macrophage stimulating protein (Msp) mutants compared to wild types at 3 and 6 dpf

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
This microarray was performed in attempt to find (novel) related genes in the msp/ron signaling pathway during embryonic development

DESIGN
Embryos from mutant versus wild type crosses were raised in standard E3 medium at 28 degrees Celcius. At 3 dpf and 6 dpf total RNA from (n=30) msp mutant versus wild type embryos was isolated using the Rnaesy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufactures protocol.

PLATFORM
GPL14688 Agilent-026437 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray V3 (Feature Number version)
