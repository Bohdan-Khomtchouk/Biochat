TITLE
Human OEhMSCs on Gelfoam or bioconditioned gelfoam

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human osteogenically enhanced mesenchymal stem cells were cultured for 5 days on standard gelfoam or gelfoam coated with MSC-derived extracellular matrix

DESIGN
To address whether mesenchymal stem cell derived extracellular matrix might stimulate the secretion of osteogenic factors by OEhMSCs, we seeded them onto standard gelfoam or ECM-coated gelfoam in vitro and cultured them under standard conditions. After 5 days, we performed transcriptome micro-array analysis to identify genes that were up-regulated > 2-fold.
