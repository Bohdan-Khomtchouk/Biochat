TITLE
Global expression profiling to study the effect of glyphosate herbicide treatment on Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Using whole genome microarray (Affymetrix ATH1) we studied the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana to glyphosate (Roundup Original) herbicde that inhibits 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme and thus disrupts aromaticamino acid biosynthesis. Few genes related to defense and secondary metabolism were altered. Keywords: 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) inhibiting herbicide stress response

DESIGN
Surfactant (preference 0.25%) treated plants were used as carrier control group and EC50 concentration of glyphosate was used as the herbicide treatment group. Each of the control and treatment group consisted of 3 biological replicates and each biological replicates comprised leaves from 10 individual plants. RNA was extracted at 24h post treatment to study the transcriptional alterations caused by the herbicide treatment.
