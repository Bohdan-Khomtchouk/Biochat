TITLE
HIF1alpha drives early induction of pluripotency through reprogramming of glycolytic metabolism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analyis of two neonatal fibroblasts (BJ and HFF1), one adult dermal fibroblasts (NFH2), two BJ-derived human iPSCs (iB4 and iB5), two HFF1-derived iPSCs (iPS 2 and iPS4), four NFH2-derived iPSCs (OiPS3, OiPS6, OiPS8, OiPS16), one amniotic fluid cells and three derived iPSCs (lines 4, 5, 6, 10, and 41), two human ES cells (H1 and H9), neonatal fibroblasts transduced with the four retroviral factors (OKSM) after 24h, 48h, and 72h, neonatal fibroblasts treated with EDHB for 24h, 48h, and 72h, neonatal fibroblasts transduced with four factors and treated with EDHB for 24h, 48h, and 72h, neonatal fibroblasts knocked down for HIF1A (HIF1-KD) and for a scrambled sequence (SCR-KD)

DESIGN
Total mRNA obtained from somatic cells (fibroblasts and amniotic fluid cells), pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs and hESCs), and somatic cells exposed to HIF1A activation or HIF1A suppsression in addition to the standard retroviral-based reprogramming.
