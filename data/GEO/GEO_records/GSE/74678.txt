TITLE
The glucose-sensing transcription factor MLX promotes myogenesis via myokine signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Metabolic stress and changes in nutrient levels modulate many aspects of skeletal muscle function during aging and disease. Growth factors and cytokines secreted by skeletal muscle, known as myokines, are important signaling factors but it is largely unknown whether they modulate muscle growth and differentiation in response to nutrients. Here, we find that changes in glucose levels increase the activity of the glucose-responsive transcription factor MLX, which promotes and is necessary for myoblast fusion. MLX promotes myogenesis not via an adjustment of glucose metabolism but rather by inducing the expression of several myokines, including insulin like-growth factor-2 (IGF2), whereas RNAi and dominant-negative MLX reduce IGF2 expression and block myogenesis. This phenotype is rescued by conditioned media from control muscle cells and by recombinant IGF2, which activates the myogenic kinase Akt. Importantly, MLX null mice display decreased IGF2 induction and diminished muscle regeneration in response to injury, indicating that the myogenic function of MLX is conserved in vivo. Thus, glucose is a signaling molecule that regulates myogenesis and muscle regeneration via MLX/IGF2/Akt signaling.â€ƒThe data pproided are histome H4 acetlation data for MLX DN and MLX wt samples;
