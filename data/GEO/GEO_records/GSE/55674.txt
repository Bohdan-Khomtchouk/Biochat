TITLE
Fed State Prior to Hemorrhagic Shock and Polytrauma in a Porcine Model Results in Altered Liver Transcriptomic Response

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We sequenced liver mRNA from 23 individual pigs (5 prefed and 18 fasted) taken at 4 separate time points to evaluate the change in gene expression over the course of hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation in response to a carbohydrate prefed state.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in liver biopsies from pigs at 4 timepoints throughout hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation

PLATFORM
GPL11429 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Sus scrofa)
