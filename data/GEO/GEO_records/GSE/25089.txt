TITLE
Global hypomethylation identifies loci targeted for hypermethylation in head and neck cancer: HNSCC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation BeadChip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs in fresh-frozen tumor tissues. Samples included 91 tumors from the oralpharynx and larynx, reflecting all stages of disease, 18 normal head and neck National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) samples, and 213 normal control blood samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite-converted DNA from the 91 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2.
