TITLE
Genome-wide maps of GATA1, TAL1, and H3K27ac occupancy in erythroid precursors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the occupancy of GATA1 and TAL1, two erythroid transcription factors, and H3K27ac histone modification in human erythroid precursors.

DESIGN
Examination of occupancy of two transcription factors and one histone mark by ChIP-seq in erythroid precursors
