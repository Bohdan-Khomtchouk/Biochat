TITLE
Intra-macrophage transcriptome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium 4/74 using strand-specific RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. ST4/74

SUMMARY
Bacterial transcription is controlled by many transcription factors and promoters. Currently many promoters are mapped only in in vitro conditions. We use an intra-macrophage model to map the promoters and their expression in vivo. InSPI2 is an in vitro growth condition mimicking intra-macrophage condition. We also characterize the transcriptome of Salmonella during growth in an in vitro intra-macrophage growth condition.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis of S.Typhimurium 4/74 within macrophages using RNA-seq in biological replicates. dRNA-seq also performed in biological replicates. Transcriptome analysis of S.Typhimurium 4/74 during InSPI2 growth using strand specific RNA-seq.
