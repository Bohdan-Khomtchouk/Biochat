TITLE
Expression data from human lung epithelial cells after amorphous silica nanoparticle exposure for 40 passages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Amorphous silica nanoparticles induce malignant transformation and tumorigenesis of human lung epithelial cells. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the cellular malignant transformation induced by amorphous silica nanoparticles and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
The human lung epithelial cells, Beas-2B were continuously exposed to 5 Î¼g/mL amorphous silica nanoparticles for 40 passages, and named as BeasSiNPs-P40 (shortly as P40-5 during the further microarray detection). Meanwhile, the passage-matched control Beas-2B cells, named as Beas-P40 (shortly as NC during the further microarray detection).
