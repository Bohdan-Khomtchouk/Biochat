TITLE
Influence of Anti-VEGFA and dexamathasone treatments on the early phase of cornea angiogenesis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Inflammation is a key component of pathological angiogenesis. Here we monitor gene expression profiles of the pre-sprouting phase of corneal angiogenesis in the rat model, as influenced by topically applied treatments. We used GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array to monitor gene expression profies of several genes in the different treatment groups

DESIGN
Animals were sutured as a stimuli for neovascularisation, and treatments (anti-VEGFA, goat IgG and dexamethasone) given topically to module the early response. Eyedrops were given four times per day, for two days.
