TITLE
Stable Set8 effect on gene expression in U2OS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis play a significant role in various biological processes including transcription, DNA repair and cell cycle progression. The identification of Set8 and Set8b (a splice isoform) histone H4K20 methyl transferase as a substrate for the cullin-based ubiquitin ligase (CRL4-Cdt2) demonstrate that this pathway plays a significant role in promoting cell cycle progression, specifically promoting G2 progression. This study investigate the effect of failure to degrade Set8 in S-phase of the cell cycle via CRL4-Cdt2 on gene expression.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the effect of the expression of stable form of Set8b H4K20 mono-methyl transferase (Set8b_deltaPIP2) on gene expression Human osteosarcoma-derived human cells were transduced with retroviruses encoding either wt-Set8b or a mutant of Setb8 which is resistant to degradation via CRL4-Cdt2 ubiquitin ligase complex (Set8b_deltaPIP2) or with an a control pMSCV empty virus. 5 days after transduction, cells were harvested and the RNA was extracted by Trizol (Invitrogen) and hybridized to the affymetrix chips array.
