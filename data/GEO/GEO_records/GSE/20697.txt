TITLE
Expression profiling of human adipose stromal cell (hASC) adipogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human abdominal adipose tissue was obtained with informed consent from a 33-year old Caucasian female (BMI = 32.96 Kg/m2) undergoing lipoaspiration. Adipose stromal cells (hASCs) were isolated and differentiated into adipocytes in vitro.

DESIGN
Two technical replicates from 9 time points realtive to induction of adipogenesis (day 0). Also, two technical replicated from pre-adipocytes (day -2) grown without FGF. Two individual replicates (day 1 and day 7) were removed due to failed hybridizations.
