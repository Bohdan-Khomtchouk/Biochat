TITLE
Reverse myocardial remodeling by aortic bending debanding in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify alterations in gene expression during reverse myocardial remodeling in a mouse model of reversible pressure overload. Mice were subjected to 4 weeks of aortic banding (AB) or sham procedure (sAB), banding and subsequent debanding (DB3), or sham procedure and subsequent debanding (sDB3), with saccrifice 3 days after debanding.
