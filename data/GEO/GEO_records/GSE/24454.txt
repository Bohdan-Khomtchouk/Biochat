TITLE
Reverse myocardial remodeling by aortic bending debanding in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify alterations in gene expression during reverse myocardial remodeling in a mouse model of reversible pressure overload. Mice were subjected to 4 weeks of aortic banding (AB) or sham procedure (sAB), banding and subsequent debanding (DB3), or sham procedure and subsequent debanding (sDB3), with saccrifice 3 days after debanding.

DESIGN
Microarray screening was performed in 3 mice from each group. Sham was used as control, and we used an ANOVA model for each gene programmed in R-script to identify the effect of debanding.
