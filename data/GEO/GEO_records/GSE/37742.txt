TITLE
Bacillus subtilis W168, WT vs. rpoC (G1122D)

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of the rpoC G1122D mutant during log growth phase in LB medium.

DESIGN
Bacillus subtilis W168, WT vs. rpoC (G1122D). The experiment was conducted two times using three independent total RNA preparations (biological triplicates). Each comparison was performed in dye-swap with the same RNA preparation. For each paried comparison, one sample was labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 and the other was with Alexa Fluor 647.
