TITLE
ADRM1 amplified metastasis gene in gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Selected genes within the 1 Mb minimal amplified region on 20q13.3 driven by ADRM1 in gastric cancer cell line AGS were analyzed by Gene expression Microarray.

DESIGN
Gene Expression of ADRM1, HRH3, MTG2, LAMA5 and OSBPL2 were then compared in 16 Gastric cancer cell lines to a reference composed of mixed gastric cancer cell lines.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
