TITLE
nautilus null vs. wild type miRNA

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To determine if the Drosophila MyoD homolog, nautilus, was activating any miRNA loci, similar to vertebrate MyoD, we compared the miRNA expression profiles between wild-type (w1118) and nautilus null embryos during the window of maximum nautilus expression (6-8hr AEL), using LNA arrays specifically designed to quantify miRNA levels in Drosophila (Exiqon). Expression levels for mir-309, mir-3, mir-286, mir-4, mir-5, and mir-6 from the 8-miR cluster, were significantly decreased in nautilus null embryos. It suggests that the intergenic 8-miR cluster, encoding eight miRNAs, is regulated by nautilus.
