TITLE
Abberant miRNA expression profiles in recurrent implantation failure endometrium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A microarray study about miRNA expression profiles in recurrent implantation failure patients as compare with who had got pregnancy after embryo implantation no more than three times To detect the miRNAs that may regulate endometrial receptivity by microarray study

DESIGN
A microarray profile comparision between RIF and control endometrium at window of implantation
