TITLE
Expression analysis of Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 WT and âˆ†fnr mutant

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655star

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 ?fnr mutant, compared to the wild-type strain. The mutations engineered into this strain produce a strain lacking the FNR protein. WT strains were grown under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate cultures of Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 WT (aerobic and anaerobic) and two separate cultures of the ?fnr mutant strain (anaerobic). Each chip measures the expression level of 4,661 genes from Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 with eight 60-mer probes per gene, with each probe represented twice on the array.
