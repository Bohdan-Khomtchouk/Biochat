TITLE
Expression data from CD4+ T cells of germ free mice, SPF IQI mice and SPF C57BL/6 mice depletd with Uhrf1 (by Cd4Cre-Uhrf1flox/flox)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Commensal bacteria shapes gut immune system. Colonization bacteria increase the frequency of regulatory T cells, however, the molecular mechanisms has not yet been unknown. To reveal the mechanism, we isolated Treg cells and Non-Treg cells and performed the global expression analysis.

DESIGN
Colonic lamina propria cells were isolated from mice described above. Treg cells and Non-Treg cells (also called as Tconv cells) were sorted by FACS AriaIII
