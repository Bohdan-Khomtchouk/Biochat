TITLE
Comprehensive gene expression changes by the expression levels of Dicer protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA regulates gene expression. In this experiment, we determined the gene expression changes by the microRNA expression status using Dicer protein nulll. Wildtype, and intermediate expression.

DESIGN
Dicer gene disrupted HCT116 colon cancer cells were transduced with tetracycline regulated Dicer protein expression. To determine the gene expression changes dependent on the Dicer protein levels, we used Dicer disrupted cells, Dicer wild-type cells, and cells with intermediate expression level of Dicer protein for the cDNA microarrya analyses.
