TITLE
Expression data from furfural-tolerant E. coli strain and wild type under furfural stress

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Cellular tolerance toward furfural is a complex phenotype involved many genes, and hard to be improved by manipulating individual genes. We previously established exogenous global regulator IrrE mutants that confer Escherichia coli with significantly enhanced tolerance to furfural stress. In order to elucidate the mechanism for enhancement of furfural tolerance in the mutants and to identify new genes and pathways that can be possible targets for engineering of furfural tolerance, we carried out comparative transcriptomic with the representative strains F1-37 and WT (harboring the furfural-tolerant mutant F1-37 of IrrE and the wild type IrrE, respectively). The data from transcriptome analyses were deposited here.

DESIGN
Cells of furfural-tolerant mutant F1-37 and wild-type strain WT were grown in LB medium supplemented with furfural, and the cells were harvested in the exponential phase. The samples for both of these two strains were prepared in triplicate with biological replicates.
