TITLE
Transcriptomes of whole blood and PBMC in chickens.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The gene expression profiles of chicken whole blood (WB) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have been characterized and compared by microarray analysis. This study  highlights the respective advantages of each blood cell subset and show that whole blood is more suitable for large scale studies and allows for the exploration of biological processes which are so far poorly investigated.

DESIGN
Whole blood and PBMC from four male broilers (9 weeks old) were collected and isolated before -80Â°C conservation.
