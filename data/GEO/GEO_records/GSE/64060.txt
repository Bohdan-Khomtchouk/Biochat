TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of mice lacking CD36.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in BAT lacking CD36. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that genes involved in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function would be misregulated. Results provide important information about the role of CD36 in BAT.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from the BAT of control and Cd36-/- mice subjected to an overnight fast.
