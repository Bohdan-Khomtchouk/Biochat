TITLE
Expression profile of wild-type Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain cultured in TT medium for 6 h, reproduced in 2011

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of the wild-type strain grown in a rich medium at 70 deg-C for 360 min.

DESIGN
Four wild-type T. thermophilus HB8 strains were each pre-cultured at 70°C for 16 h in 4 ml of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells were inoculated into 1 liter of the same medium to a final OD600nm of 0.0005 and then cultivated at 70°C. Cells were collected after 360 min (OD600nm =~ 1.4), and then, the expression of each mRNA was analyzed.
