TITLE
Gene and microRNA transcriptome analysis of Parkinson's related LRRK2 mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of familial and sporadic Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD).  Here, we investigated in parallel gene and microRNA transcriptome profiles of three different LRRK2 mouse models. Striatal tissue was isolated from adult LRRK2 knockout mice, as well as mice expressinghuman LRRK2 wildtype (hLRRK2-WT) or PD-associated R1441G mutation (hLRRK2-R1441G).

DESIGN
We used microarraya to measure gene and microRNA expression levels in various LRRK2 mouse models. LRRK2 wildtype and knockout mice were bred on a C57BL/6 background. LRRK2 non-transgenic and hLRRK2 transgenic mice were bred on a FVB/N background.
