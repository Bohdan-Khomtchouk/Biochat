TITLE
Expression data wheat Flag Leaf at anthesis

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
TaMYB13 is a transcription factor that has been associated with fructan accumulation in previous studies in wheat (Xue et al. 2011 Plant journal 68: 857 - 870). In this study we aimed to find genes regulated by TaMYB13, through overexpression of this transcription factor in wheat and perform expression analysis by making use of Affymetrix genechip assays. Expression of control plants was compared to transgenic lines, and total RNA was extracted from Flag leaves at anthesis.

DESIGN
In this experiment the genome wide gene expression was assessed from wheat flag leaf material harvested at anthesis. Control plants (BW43,BW44,BW45) were compared with transgenic lines that overexpress TaMYB13 (a20, b2, b36).
