TITLE
Chip-chip from HCT116 cells with p400 antibody

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The chromatin remodeller p400 has oncogenic properties that promote early steps of colon cancer. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of p400 together with chromatin profiling by ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated that p400 directly binds the chromatin at promoters of p400 target genes.

DESIGN
Study of p400 binding on promoters of HCT116 cells
