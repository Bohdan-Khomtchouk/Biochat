TITLE
Expression data from low R:FR - JA crosstalk in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Low reduced red:far-red ratio [R:FR] signaling through phytochromes induces shade avoidance responses, including petiole elongation. Jasmonic acid-mediated defense against herbivores and pathogens is inhibited under these conditions. Using microarrays we studied the crosstalk between low R:FR and JA at the global gene expression level in Arabidopsis thaliana.

DESIGN
Plants were exposed for 2 h. to the following treatments: high R/FR with mock spray, low R/FR with mock spray, high R/FR with JA spray, low R/FR with JA spray. Gene expression was determined in petioles.
