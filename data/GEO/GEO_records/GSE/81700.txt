TITLE
Expression data from naive, effector and memory-like ILC2s isolated from mouse lungs and those from effector and memory-like ILC2s isolated from mediastinal lymph node

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in the lung are stimulated by inhaled allergens. ILC2s do not directly recognize allergens but they are stimulated by cytokines including interleukin (IL)-33 released by damaged epithelium.Lung ILC2s, upon stimulation, produce T helper 2 cell-type cytokines inducing T cell independent allergic lung inflammation. We now report that lung ILC2s, upon activation by an allergen or IL-33, acquire the properties of memory cells. The activated ILC2s initially proliferate and secrete cytokines, followed by a contraction phase as they stop producing cytokines. Nevertheless, some persist long after the resolution of the inflammation and acquire intrinsic capacities to react to unrelated allergens more vigorously than na√Øve ILC2s, thus mediating a severe allergic lung inflammation. Gene expression profiles of the previously activated ILC2s show a gene signature of memory T cells. These antigen non-specific memory ILC2s may explain why asthma patients are often sensitized to multiple allergens.

DESIGN
ILC2s were isolated from mouse lungs from naive and IL-33 injected mice 4 days, 14 days and 4 months after the initial treatment. RNA was extracted from those ILC2 populations and analyzed for gene expression profiles. RNA was also extracted from ILC2s isolated from lung draining mediastinal lymph node (mLN) 4 days and 14 days after IL-33 treatment.
