TITLE
Molecular responses and metabolic reset of apple fruit under postharvest low oxygen stress

ORGANISM
Malus domestica

SUMMARY
In the present work we report data on the application of an integrated approach on apples held under two levels of low oxygen concentrations  throughout  the initial 2 months of  storage, when, in general, strict control of the effects of the extremely low oxygen concentration is  required for a successful DCA performance.

DESIGN
Examination of 4 different condition. Three replicates per condition

PLATFORM
GPL18137 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Malus domestica)
