TITLE
LncRNAs expression profiles in the livers of 20-month-old male HBx transgenic mice and C57BL/6 wild-type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) has been implicated as an oncogene in both epigenetic modifications and genetic regulation during hepatocarcinogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which regulate gene expression with little or no protein-coding capacity, are involved in diverse biological processes and in carcinogenesis. We asked whether HBx could promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by regulating the expression of lncRNAs.In this study, we investigated the alteration in expression of lncRNAs induced by HBx using microarrays, and our results indicate that HBx transgenic mice have a specific profile of liver lncRNAs compared with wild-type mice.

DESIGN
For these experiments, six each of 20-month-old male HBx-transgenic mice and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed and the livers were removed. Every three livers were pooled as one sample; therefore, each group was represented by two samples. The total RNA was extracted from the four samples and used for microarray experiments. Mouse LncRNA Array (4 x 44K, ArrayStar, Rockville, MD) were used to monitor the expression level of approximately 14000 lncRNAs identified from the NCBI RefSeq, UCSC, RNAdb2.0, NRED, Fantom3.0 and UCRs. LncRNAs differentially expressed were identified by comparing expression levels in HBx-transgenic mice and wild-type mice.
