Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Canakinumab is a human anti-interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) monoclonal antibody neutralizing IL-1 beta. Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) is a rare, multigenic, autoinflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by chronic arthritis; intermittent high-spiking fever, rash, and elevated levels of acute-phase reactants. Blood samples of SJIA patients were obtained from two phase 3 clinical trials conducted by the members of the Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) and the Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group (PRCSG) (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00886769 and NCT00889863). For patients, baseline and day 3 samples were analyzed for either placebo or canakinumab (Ilaris) treatment. Clinical response was assessed at day 15 using adapted JIA American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria.

DESIGN
Overall, 206 samples were used in this study including 22 samples from healthy controls, 33 samples of placebo treated patients and 151 samples of canakinumab treated patients.
