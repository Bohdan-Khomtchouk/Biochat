TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of wild-type Leishmania species between both stages using full-genome DNA microarrays

ORGANISM
Leishmania major ; Leishmania infantum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analyses of L. infantum promastigote compared to L. infantum intracellular amastigote, and  L. major promastigote compared to L. major intracellular amastigote The full-genome DNA microarray includes one 70mer-oligonucleotide probe for each gene of L. infantum and for each gene of L.major LV39 Keywords: stage-specific comparison

DESIGN
Leishmania infantum: Two-condition experiment, promastigote stage vs amastigote stage. Six biological replicates for each stage, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array Leishmania major: Two-condition experiment, promastigote stage vs amastigote stage. Four biological replicates for each stage, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array

PLATFORM
