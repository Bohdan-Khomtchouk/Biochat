TITLE
Identification of ciprofloxacin helper drug targets by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O25b:H4-ST131

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify genes that can be targeted by helper drugs to counteract resistance towards ciprofloxacin (CIP). In order to reveal the impact of ciprofloxacin on the transcriptome, differential gene-expression analysis by RNA-seq was performed on the multidrug resistant E. coli strain ST131, treated with a clinically relevant concentration of ciprofloxacin (2 µg/mL).

DESIGN
E. coli ST131 UR40 was treated with ciprofloxacin (2µg/mL) and samples were taken at time points 0 min, 30 min and 90min.
