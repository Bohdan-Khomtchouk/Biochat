TITLE
A multi-scale model for hair follicle reveals heterogeneous skin domains drive rapid spatiotemporal hair growth patterning

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report transcriptomes of whole skin from different anatomic regions, dorsum, ventrum, chin and ear pinna, as well as ear cartilage/muscle complex at different post-natal time points. Whole tissue was microdissected from wild type mice.

DESIGN
Examination of miscrodissected whole skin from dorsum, ventrum and chin at six consecutive time points of the hair cycle, and comparison of ear pinna telogen skin vs. ear cartilage/muscle complex vs. dorsal telogen skin. Sample definition: CCT		Chin skin, Competent telogen CEA		Chin skin, Early anagen CMA		Chin skin, Mid-anagen CLA		Chin skin, Late anagen CC		Chin skin, Catagen CRT		Chin skin, Refractory telogen VCT		Ventral skin, Competent telogen VEA		Ventral skin, Early anagen VMA		Ventral skin, Mid-anagen VLA		Ventral skin, Late anagen VC		Ventral skin, Catagen VRT		Ventral skin, Refractory telogen DCT		Dorsal skin, Competent telogen DEA		Dorsal skin, Early anagen DMA		Dorsal skin, Mid-anagen DLA		Dorsal skin, Late anagen DC		Dorsal skin, Catagen DRT		Dorsal skin, Refractory telogen ERST		Ear skin, Telogen LC		Ear cartilage/muscle complex
