TITLE
Smad4 and Trim33 dependend nodal/activin responsive genes in differentiated mouse ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In differentiated mouse ESCs, most of the nodal/activin responsive genes are dependent on both Smad4 and Trim33, some are solely dependent on Smad4, and some are dependent on Trim33.

DESIGN
Ebs at Day2.5 from WT, Smad4 null, and Trim33 knock-down ESCs, were treated with activin or SB 431542 for 2 h.
