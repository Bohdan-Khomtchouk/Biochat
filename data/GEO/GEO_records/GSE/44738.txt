TITLE
Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with NimbleGen's array to identify methylated genes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly invasive cancer with a poor prognosis. Using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-chip analysis, we found that 161 genes that were specifically hypermethylated in PANC-1 cells. Among them, miR-615-5p was hypermethylated in its putative promoter region, which silenced its expression in PDAC cell lines.

DESIGN
Comparison between PANC-1 cell lines and normal pancreas tissue
