TITLE
SET DOMAIN GROUP 2 is the major histone H3 lysine-4 tri-methyltransferase in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Post-translational modifications of histones play important roles in modulating chromatin structure and regulating gene expression. We have previously shown that over two thirds of Arabidopsis genes contain histone H3 methylation at lysine-4 (H3K4me), and that tri-methylation of H3K4 (H3K4me3) is preferentially located at actively transcribed genes. In addition, several Arabidopsis mutants with locus-specific loss of H3K4me have been found to display various developmental abnormalities. These findings suggest that H3K4me3 may play important roles in maintaining the normal expression of a large number of genes. However, the major enzyme(s) responsible for H3K4me3 has yet to be identified in plants, making it difficult to address questions regarding the mechanisms and functions of H3K4me3. Here we describe the characterization of SET DOMAIN GROUP 2 (SDG2), a large Arabidopsis protein containing a histone lysine methyltransferase domain. We found that SDG2 homologues are highly conserved in plants, and that the Arabidopsis SDG2 gene is broadly expressed during development. In addition, the loss of SDG2 leads to severe and pleiotropic phenotypes as well as the mis-regulation of a large number of genes. Consistent with our finding that SDG2 is a robust and specific H3K4 methyltransferase in vitro, the loss of SDG2 leads to a drastic decrease in H3K4me3 in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that SDG2 is the major enzyme responsible for H3K4me3 in Arabidopsis, and that SDG2-dependent H3K4m3 is critical for regulating gene expression and plant development.
