TITLE
Different Vitamin D Receptor Agonists Exhibit Differential Effects on Endothelial Function and Aortic Gene Expression in 5/6 Nephrectomized (NX) Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Vitamin D analogs alfacalcidol, paricalcitol, and VS-105 exhibit different effects on endothelial function and aortic gene expression in 5/6 NX uremic rats

DESIGN
Uremic rats were treated with vehicle or test agent, i.p. 3x/week for 12 days. Each group consisted of 8-12 animals. Untreated, age-matched sham rats served as controls.  Five groups in this study: sham, NX-vehicle, NX-paricalcitol at 0.08 μg/kg, NX-alfacalcidol at 0.04 μg/kg, and NX-VS-105 at 0.01 μg/kg
