TITLE
Effect of treatment with H2O2 or DPTA-NONOate on E. histolytica

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
E. histolytica of strains HM1:IMSS (virulent) and Rahman (avirulent) were examined for response to oxidative and nitrosative stress.

DESIGN
Response to oxidative stress in E. histolytica was assayed by treating Eh (HM1:IMSS) and Eh (Rahman) with 1mM H2O2 for 60 minutes or 90 minutes and comparing transcription to parasites grown in TYI. In addition, response to nitosative stress was assayed in Eh (HM1:IMSS) by treatment for 60 minutes with 200 ÂµM DPTA-NONOate.
