TITLE
Host cell gene expression in Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infected MDCK cells at 2, 4 and 6 hours post infection

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
We used the microarray data to analyze host cells response on MDCK cells infected with A/WSN/33 (H1N1)

DESIGN
A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infected MDCK cells were harvested at 2, 4, and 6 hpi and RNA extraction was performed using standard protocol as described by Affymetrix. The aim of this experiment is to analyze host response to Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infection.
