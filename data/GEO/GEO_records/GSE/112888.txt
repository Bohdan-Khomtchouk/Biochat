Expression data from WT and MED12 KO SKOV3 and HO8910 cells

SUMMARY
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of death among all gynecological  malignancies due to high rate of disease relapse. Disease relapse in cancer patients  after clinical remission are often referred to tumor dormancy. Here we identify the  RNA polymerase II transcriptional Mediator subunit 12 (MED12) as an important  molecular regulator of tumor dormancy. We found that MED12 knock-out (KO)  could induce dormancy of EOC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, microarray  analysis showed that MED12 KO decreased the expression of EGFR. Hierarchical cluster assays of the differentially expressed genes between MED12 WT and KO single clones of SKOV3 and HO8910 cells.

DESIGN
MED12 WT and KO single clones of SKOV3 and HO8910 cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
