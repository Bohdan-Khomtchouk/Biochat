TITLE
Copy number variation of human intestinal stem cells with different passage in culture (five pedifrees, passage 5 and 25)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stem cells of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and other columnar epithelia collectively resist cloning in their elemental states. Here we demonstrate the cloning and propagation of highly clonogenic, “ground state” stem cells of the human intestinal and colon. To assess the genomic stability of our intestinal stem cells, we serially passaged five independent intestinal stem cell pedigrees derived from the ileum of one late fetal demise case and tested them after 50 (passage 5; P5) and 250 days (P25) of continuous proliferation. DNA from cells at these passages cells was analyzed by SNP array based copy number variation analysis (CNV).  Although at P25,  there are aneuploidy in some of pedigrees, there are very few CNV at P5 in all pedigrees.

DESIGN
SNP array based copy number variation study was performed for 5 pedigrees from human fetal intestinal stem cells (passage 5 and 25) to assess genomic stability at chromosomal level.
