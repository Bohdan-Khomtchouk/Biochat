TITLE
H3K27me3 is maintained at a reduced level in Suz12(Bgal/Bgal) ESCs [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Suz12(Bgal/Bgal) ESCs express a truncated form of Suz12 fused to Beta-galactosidase. These cells maintain a reduced level of H3K27me3 despite this mutation to a core component of PRC2, unlike Eed-/- ESCs whose H3K27me3 is ablated.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed in wild type and Suz12(Bgal/Bgal) ESCs, here used to demonstrate the coverage of the Suz12 gene in mRNA reads.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
