TITLE
Expression analysis of Trichoderma reesei QM9414 and delta-phlp1, delta-gnb1 and delta-gng1 in light and darkness.

ORGANISM
Trichoderma reesei

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in response to different light conditions of the T. reesei QM9414 parental strain and the deletion strains delta-phlp1, delta-gnb1 and delta gng1, cultivated on 1 % microcrystalline cellulose. The mutants analyzed in this study are further described in Tisch et al. 2011: Carbohydrate degradation is significantly regulated by light and the phosducin like protein PhLP1 in Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina).

DESIGN
We used two biological replicates of four T. reesei strains (QM9414, delta-phlp1, delta-gnb1 and delta-gng1), cultivated in constant light (LL, 1800 lux) or constant darkness (DD) on microcrystalline cellulose.
