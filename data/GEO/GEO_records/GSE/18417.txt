TITLE
Arabidopsis transcriptome changes caused by ectopic production of a turtle riboflavin-binding protein

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Leaf contents of free riboflavin were modulated by ectopic expression of the turtle gene encoding riboflavin-binding protein (RfBP). Compared to Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) ecotype Col-0 (wild type), REAT (modified type) that constitutive express RfBP had 71%-77% less flavins of free form. We used microarray to investigate the influence on plants due to the reduced free flavin. One modified line (REAT11) and wild type (WT) were tested by microarray, and the experiments data revealed that abundance of transcripts for 950 genes in REAT was altered compared to the wild type.

DESIGN
Four samples were analyzed. Two WT and two REAT11 biological replicates were analyzed (one array each).
