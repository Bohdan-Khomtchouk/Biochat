TITLE
H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in rat peripheral nerve

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq of H3K27me3 in rat peripheral nerve was used to identify sites of polycomb repression associated with genes in Schwann cells, which constitute the majority of cells in peripheral nerve.

DESIGN
H3K27me3 ChIP samples were prepared from rat sciatic nerve and then sequenced. Inputs for these ChIP samples have previously been submitted as samples GSM1541282 and GSM1541283 in Series GSE63103

PLATFORM
