TITLE
Fetal Brain lesions after subcutaneous inoculation of Zika virus in a pregnant nonhuman primate

ORGANISM
Macaca nemestrina

SUMMARY
ZIKV was inoculated (strain FSS13025, Cambodia 2010) subcutaneously at five separate locations on the forearms, each with 107 plaque-forming units (PFU) into a healthy pregnant pigtail macaque at 119 days gestation (~28 weeks human pregnancy) to test directly whether ZIKV causes fetal brain injury.

DESIGN
Brain tissues from dam and fetus at necropsy (day 43 post-inoculation) were sequenced. A pigtail macaque brain sample from the Non-Human Primate Reference Transcriptome Project (NHPRTR.org) was used as a control

PLATFORM
