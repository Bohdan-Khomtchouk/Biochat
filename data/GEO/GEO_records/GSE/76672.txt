TITLE
Expression data of differentiated adipocyte treated with small molecules

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To treat obesity and its related metabolism, small molecules can be used. To investigate the role of small molecules, butein, sulfuretin, and resveratrol were treated in differentiated adipocytes to find important regulators in adipocyte biology. Each small molecules have their own charactaristics on adipocyte biology, comparison of expression profiles among three small molecules can offer new insight in adipocyte biology.

DESIGN
Fully differentiated C3H10T1/2 adipocytes were treated with butein, sulfuretin, and resveratrol for 6 hours and the expression profiles were compared to find common anti- or pro-adipogenic factors.
