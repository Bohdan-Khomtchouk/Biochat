TITLE
Expression analysis of KHR and KHR-NICD oral tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
KHR-NICD oral tumors grow faster than KHR oral tumors. The hypothesis was to test for differences in gene expression between KHR and KHR-NICD oral tumors.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated for KHR (n=6) and KHR-NICD (n=6) oral tumors. Expression profiling was performed using the Illumina MouseRef-8 v2 (GPL6885) array. Studies were conducted using tumors from FVB x C57BL/6 F1 mice.

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
