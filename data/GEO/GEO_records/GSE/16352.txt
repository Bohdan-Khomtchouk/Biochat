TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae Fur regulon

ORGANISM
Neisseria gonorrhoeae FA 1090

SUMMARY
In Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Fur (ferric uptake regulator) protein regulates iron homeostasis gene expression through binding to conserved sequences in promoters of iron-responsive genes. We have expanded the gonococcal Fur regulon using a custom microarray to monitor iron-responsive gene expression throughout the growth curve combined with a genome-wide in silico analysis to predict Fur boxes (FB), and in vivo FuRTA assays to detect genes able to bind Fur. Keywords: time course: (1hr ,2hr, 3hr, 4hr)

DESIGN
The effect of iron on global gene expression was determined over a 4-h time period by comparing the RNA profile of the organism grown in iron-deplete conditions to growth in iron-replete conditions.
