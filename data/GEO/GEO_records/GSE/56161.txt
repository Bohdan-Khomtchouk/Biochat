TITLE
Gene expresson profiles of hPER1S714G and hPER1S714 in liver and white adipose at ZT1 and ZT13

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To discover the influence of S714G mutation in PER1, we used whole genomic array to analyze the changes in liver and white adipose.

DESIGN
Both hPER1S714G and hPER1S714 control mice were entrained to LD cycles for 10 days, liver and white adipose samples were taken at ZT1 and ZT13. Three independent repeats were performed for each sample at each time point.
