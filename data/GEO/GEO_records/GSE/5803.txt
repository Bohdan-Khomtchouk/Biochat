TITLE
gene differentially expressed in androgen independent prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Progression to androgen independent is the main cause of death in prostate cancer, and the mechanism is still unclear. By reviewing the expression profiles of 26 prostate cancer samples in a holistic view, we found a group of genes differentially expressed in androgen independent compared with androgen dependent groups (p value < 0.01, t test). Focusing on apoptosis, proliferation, hormone and angiogenesis, we found a group of genes such as thioredoxin domain containing 5 (TXNDC5), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 10a (TNFRSF10A), ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) up-regulated in androgen independent prostate cancer, which could play important roles in the transition from androgen dependent to androgen independent and could be biomarkers of prognosis. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
The main aim was comparing the androgen dependent and androgen independent prostate cancer to identify differentially expressed genes. In addition, we added several normal prostate tissue sample for comparisons. Totally 29 experiments were performed without replicates. 3 for normal prostate tissue, 8 for androgen independent cancer and 18 for androgen dependent prostate cancer. In all experiments, the reference samples are common reference, a pool with unrelated fetal tissues.
