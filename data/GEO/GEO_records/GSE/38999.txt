TITLE
Microarray analysis of At-med16-1 and wild type (Col-0) infected with the avirulent bacterial pathogen  Pst DC3000/avrRpt2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of the microarray experiment was to identify defense genes that were differentially expressed in the Arabidopsis mutant At-med16-1 and wild type in response to infection of the avirulent bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000/avrRpt2.  Results indicated that, compared with the wild type, several positive regulators of SAR (systemic acquired resistance) were downregulated and a group of SAR negative regulators were upregulated in At-med16-1.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates with leaves from 8 plants per sample were collected at 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours after inoculation with the avirulent bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000/avrRpt2.  After extraction, RNA concentration was determined on a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and sample quality was assessed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  Equal amount of RNA from the 3 biological replicates were pooled as one sample for microarray analysis.
