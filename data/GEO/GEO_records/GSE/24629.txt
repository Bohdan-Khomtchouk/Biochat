TITLE
Comparison of two clones (4106a and FRC) of Myzus Persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae)

ORGANISM
Myzus persicae

SUMMARY
The aim of this experiment was to compare the transciptome of the peach-potato aphid (Myzus persicae) clone 4106a (a laboratory insecticide-susceptible standard collected from potato in Scotland in 2000) with clone FRC (an insecticide resistant aphid clone collected from peach in France in 2009) to identify which genes are over or underexpressed in the resistant phenotype. The custom microarray used in this study was designed using the Agilent eArray platform (Agilent Technologies) by the Georg Jander Lab and is based on a previously described array containing probes for > 10, 000 M. persicae unigenes produced by Sanger sequencing (Ramsey, Wilson et al. 2007) augmented with an additional 30, 517 probe set designed on EST unigene sequences identified in a 454 sequencing project (Ramsey, Rider et al. 2010). The final slide layout consists of four arrays of 45, 220 60-mer probes and these are produced by Agilent by in situ oligonucleotide synthesis. References: Ramsey, J. S., D. S. Rider, et al. (2010).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 4106a vs. FRC Myzus persicae clones. Biological replicates: 4 pools of RNA extracted from ten 15 day old aphids of each clone. Technical Replicates: Two technical reps incorporating a dye swap. Total replication: eight replicates for each clone.
