TITLE
A Functional Survey of Light-Responsive Genes Using A Rice NSF45K Microarray

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We performed expression profiling experiments on two-week old rice leaf tissues grown in light and dark condition with the rice 47k array. Four biological replicates and a dye-swap were used. To generate more consistent results on light vs dark response in rice, biological replicates were prepared from 4 different varieties such as Kitaake, Nipponbare, Tapei309 and IR24 because individual genetic background can affect to expression profile (Townsend et al., 2003). Gene expression was assayed by probing the microarray with pooled Cy3 and Cy5 labeled cDNAs derived from 0.5-1.0ug high quality mRNA prepared from leaf samples. Keywords: Direct comparison
