TITLE
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) Gene Expression-Based Biomarkers in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aim: To discovery biomarkers in JIA base on gene expression from RNA sequencing on PBMC Method: Paired-end Ilumina sequencing to capture gene expression of PBMC from JIA individuals and healthy controls Results:sample heterogeneity makes RNA sequencing on PBMC unsuitable as a first-step method for screening biomarker candidates in JIA

DESIGN
RNA sequencing on PBMC of 3 independent cohorts consist of JIA patients and healthy controls

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
