TITLE
H. pylori 26695: wild-type vs nitro-oxide (NO) treated; knockout-crdS in H. pylori 26695 vs knockout-crdS with NO treatment

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori 26695

SUMMARY
There are two transcription profiles. The first profiling is comparing control untreated H. pylori with H. pylori with NO treatment. And the second profiling is comparing knockout-crdS in H. pylori untreated with knockout-crdS with NO treatment. The goal was determine the effects of NO-responsive gene and crdS-regulated genes on H. pylori gene expression.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment, wild-type H. pylori untreated (WT –NO), H. pylori with NO treatment (WT +NO), knockout-crdS in H. pylori untreated (ΔcrdS -NO), ΔcrdS with NO treatment (ΔcrdS +NO)

PLATFORM
