TITLE
Combined miRNA and mRNA Sequencing Identifies Protective Transcriptional Signature of Enhanced PI3Kalpha Signaling in Cardiac Hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A molecular and bioinformatic pipeline permitting comprehensive analysis and quantification of myocardial miRNA and mRNA expression with next-generation sequencing was developed and the impact of enhanced PI3Kalpha signaling on the myocardial transcriptome signature of pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy was explored.

DESIGN
miRNA and mRNA-Seq were carried out in four groups of mouse LV samples: WT sham, WT+TAC, caPI3Kalpha sham, caPI3Kalpha+TAC

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
