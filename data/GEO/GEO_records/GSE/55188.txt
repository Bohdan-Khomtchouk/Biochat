TITLE
RNA-Seq of Aged Polg Mutator Mouse Brains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have performed both proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of the brains of one-year old Polg mutator mice. As part of this analysis, we generated RNA-Seq data from RNA isolated from one cerebral hemisphere of these mice. mRNA levels and protein  abundance levels were compared in this study.

DESIGN
11 samples of RNA isolated from mouse cerebral hemisphere. 7 Polg D257A/D257A, 1 Polg D257A/WT, and 3 Polg WT/WT. The samples were collected from one-year old male mice.
