TITLE
Effector cell signatures in peripheral blood after nasal allergen challenge: biomarkers of the allergic response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study investigated temporal transcriptomic changes in response to nasal allergen challenge of titrated timothy grass pollen.

DESIGN
This is an open single-center observational study conducted outside the pollen season. Twelve participants with seasonal allergic rhinitis underwent a control (diluent) challenge followed by nasal allergen challenge after an interval of 14 days. On each challenge day, nasal challenge with control or titrated timothy grass pollen (Aquagen, phleum pratense; ALK) was administered. Peripheral blood was collected before nasal challenge (baseline) and at 3, 6 and 24 hours following challenge. RNA was extracted from whole blood and CD4 cells for microarray experiment using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
