TITLE
Transcriptomics of environmental adaptation and survival in wild adult Pacific Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) during spawning migration

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
a salmonid microarray was used to characterize environmentally-regulated shifts in gene expression between ocean and river habitats in gill and liver tissues of wild migrating adult Pacific sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). To correlate gene expression with survival, non-lethal biopsy sampling of gill tissue and microarray-based profiling was combined with biotelemetry and genetic stock identification so that transcriptomic profiles could be compared between fish reaching spawning grounds and presumed mortalities.
