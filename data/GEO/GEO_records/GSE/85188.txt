TITLE
Rac1 controls both the secretory function of the mammary gland and its remodelling for successive gestations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the effects of Rac1 gene deletion on development and function of the mammary gland.

DESIGN
The microarray was conducted from RNA isolated from mouse mammary glands harvested from Involution day 2 mice.  Cre-mediated specific Rac1 gene deletion in luminal mammary epithelial cells was achieved by crossing Rac1fx/fxRosaYFP mice with WAPiCreTg/• mice to produce Rac1fx/fxYFP ;WAPiCreTg/• (Rac1-/-) mice. Rac1fx/fxYFP mice that lacked the Cre gene were used as wild type (WT) controls.  The RNA was isolated from the inguinal gland 4 for each mouse.
