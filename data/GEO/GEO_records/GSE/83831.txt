TITLE
4T1 breast tumors: SPARC knock down primary tumors vs. Control primary tumors vs. Lung metastasis foci

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of the transcriptome of primary tumors generated from 4T1 cells transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing a siRNA against murine SPARC (4T1-C18), primary tumors generated from 4T1 cells transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing a scramble sequence (4T1-SCR) or lung metastasis foci from 4T1-SCR tumor-bearing mice (4T1-SCR MTTS).

DESIGN
Three experimental conditions, 4T1-C18, 4T1-SCR and 4T1-SCR MTTS. Biological replicates: 4  4T1-C18, 4 4T1-SCR, 4 4T1-SCR MTTS independently grown in different mice. 2 days-old tumors and 30 days old lung foci. One replicate per array.  All microarrays were processed the same day

PLATFORM
GPL19507 MI mouse exonic evidence-based oligonucleotide (MEEBO) microarray
