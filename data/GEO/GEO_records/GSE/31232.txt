TITLE
Expression data from different samples of a single ccRCC patient.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have sampled several tumour regions from a single patient before and after everolimus treatment, including both primary and metastatic site samples to investigate intra-tumour heterogeneity.

DESIGN
We selected 4 primary tumour regions, including a pre-treatment biopsy, and 1 metastatic region for expression analysis using microarray data. Two samples were used per region (1 fresh frozen and 1 formalin-fixed).
