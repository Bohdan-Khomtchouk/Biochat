TITLE
Genome-wide binding sites of AtDEK3 in Arabidopsis thaliana.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The scope of the project is to find DNA binding sites of the DNA binding protein AtDEK3. For the experiments AtDEK3 overexpressor (OE) plants have been obtained. The AtDEK3 was tagged with a CFP-tag. With ChIP the protein was pulled down and eluted DNA was send for sequencing. Gene ontology (GO) term classification of genes enriched for AtDEK3 binding indicated that AtDEK3 target genes are involved in diverse biological processes.

DESIGN
ChIP Seq of three indenpendendt AtDEK3 OE and their respective inputs were used.
