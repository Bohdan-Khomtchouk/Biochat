Genome-wide analysis of Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Description: The pluripotency of an embryonic stem cell makes it an attractive target for differentiation strategies aimed at producing tissues for therapeutic purposes. Yet, even though we know that ES cells have tremendous capacity for differentiation, we do not fully understand the molecular paths taken by these cells as they differentiate. Moreover, it is unclear how the path of ES cell differentiation relates to the molecular decisions made by tissues undergoing normal development. The motivation behind this work is to increase our understanding of this relationship and its potential limitations. Overall Design: Dataset is a murine embryonic stem cell differentiation timecourse consisting of 14 timepoints spanning 17 days of differentiation. Samples were harvested at 24 hour intervals on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17. There two replicates of each sample. A common reference design was employed. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series. Elapsed Time: amples were harvested on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 Keywords: time_series_design
