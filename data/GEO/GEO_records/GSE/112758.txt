TITLE
Gene expression of nucleolin or TRA2B4-silencing HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TRA2β4 is transcribed from the human transformer 2β(TRA2B) gene and overexpressed in colon cancer cells. Nucleolin is one of RNA-binding proteins to regulate cell survival and proliferation. In this study, TRA2β4 and Nucleolin levels were reduced in colon cancer HCT116 cells and gene expression levels were measured using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Ten nM of TRA2β4 or Nucleolin siRNA was transfected into HCT116 cells for 48 hours and then gene expression was measured by human whole-genome microarray (Agilent Technology).
