TITLE
Microarray analysis of T-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8)-mediated gene expression in mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously identified an extracellular pH-sensing G protein-coupled receptor T cell death associated gene 8 (TDAG8) as an extracellular pH sensor of tumor cells that promotes cell growth/survival in vitro and tumor development in vivo. To determine genes regulated by TDAG8 in vitro, mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells stably expressing TDAG8 (TDAG8-LLC cells) and control vector (control LLC cells) were cultured under acidic conditions. Transcriptome microarray analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays was performed with total RNA prepared from these cells.

DESIGN
To determine genes regulated by TDAG8 in vitro, mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells stably expressing TDAG8 (TDAG8-LLC cells) and control vector (control LLC cells) were cultured under acidic conditions. Transcriptome microarray analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays was performed with a mixture of equal amounts of total RNA samples from four independent cell cultures.
