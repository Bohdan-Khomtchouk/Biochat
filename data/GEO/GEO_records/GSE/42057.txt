TITLE
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data were generated on 136 subjects from the COPDGeneÂ® study using Affymetrix microarrays. Multiple linear regression with adjustment for covariates (gender, age, body mass index, family history, smoking status, pack years) was used to identify candidate genes and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to identify candidate pathways. Candidate genes identified included those that play a role in the immune system, inflammatory responses, and sphingolipid metabolism. Many of our final candidate genes also show an association with related disease phenotypes such as emphysema, gas trapping, and 6-minute walk distance.

DESIGN
42 control subjects and 94 subjects with varying severity of COPD had PBMC gene expression profiles generated.  All subjects are non-hispanic white, current or former smokers.
