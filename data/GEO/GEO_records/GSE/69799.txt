TITLE
Elucidating the molecular mechanisms for CAT-SKL drug effects on breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Time-course analysis was done to measure antioxidant CAT-SKL drug treatment effects on whole genome expression in a breast cancer cell line. total RNA was isolated from parallel cell cultures, starting at the 0 hour (immediately before 1uM CAT-SKL treatment) and every 6 hours after treatment up to 30 hours

DESIGN
The MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line model was used in this study of logitudinal whole genome mRNA expression data. Expression data were collected by microarray analysis using Illumina HT12v3 arrays.
