TITLE
Response of  Bacillus pumilus to hydrogen peroxide

ORGANISM
Bacillus pumilus

SUMMARY
Reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide occur in all aerobically living organisms. Oxidative stress during fermentation can impair the fitness of the production host and the quality of the product. B. pumilus has been described as highly resistant to hydrogen peroxide. The response of exponentially growing B. pumilus cells to hydrogen peroxide was studied.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, unstressed versus hydrogen peroxide stressed cells, 3 biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL18698 Agilent-038542 Bacillus pumilus array [B.pumilusJo2-Jan12]
