TITLE
Expression data from 20-day-old mouse Sertoli cells and 20-day-old Sertoli cell treated with 500 nm Microcystin-Leucine Arginine (MC-LR)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microcystin-Leucine Arginine causes cytotoxic effects in Sertoli Cells We used microarrays to analyze up-regulated and down-regulated genes to investigate the molecular mechanism associated with cytotoxic effects in Sertoli cells treated with MC-LR

DESIGN
Primary mouse Sertoli cells were isolated and cultured for 48 h, cells were then treated with MC-LR. Microarray technique was used to analyze differently expressed genes to understand the molecular mechanism associated with cytotoxicty induced with MC-LR.
