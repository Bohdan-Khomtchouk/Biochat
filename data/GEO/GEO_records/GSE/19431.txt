TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in Cystic Fibrosis Airway Epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the commonest lethal genetic diseases in which the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) has yet to be explored. We hypothesized that unique miRNA expression profiles exist in CF versus non-CF bronchial epithelial cells so the our aim was to investigate whether unique miRNA expression profiles exist in CF, particularly in CF bronchial epithelial cells and explore their effects on influencing signaling pathways.

DESIGN
The expression of 667 miRNAs were measured in bronchial brushings from individuals with and without cystic fibrosis (CFn=5, non-CF n=5).  The 5 CF patient samples have been normalised to the controls so we get a final normalised value for 5 samples only. There are 2 raw data files for samples and controls as there are two cards A and B ran for each sample, for a total of 4 raw data files available on the Series record.
