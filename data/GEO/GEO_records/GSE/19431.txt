TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in Cystic Fibrosis Airway Epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the commonest lethal genetic diseases in which the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) has yet to be explored. We hypothesized that unique miRNA expression profiles exist in CF versus non-CF bronchial epithelial cells so the our aim was to investigate whether unique miRNA expression profiles exist in CF, particularly in CF bronchial epithelial cells and explore their effects on influencing signaling pathways.
