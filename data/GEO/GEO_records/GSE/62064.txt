TITLE
Radial glia require PDGFD/PDGFRB signaling in human but not mouse neocortex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression over serial 150um sections of a single gestational week 14.5 human neocortical specimen. The hypothesis tested with this dataset was that a transcriptional signature of radial glia (neural stem cells) could be isolated via unsupervised gene coexpression analysis due to variation in the abundance of this cell type from section to section. This dataset is the first of its kind generated using this method (Gene Coexpression Analysis of Serial Sections, or GCASS).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from serial sections of a single GW14.5 human neocortical specimen.
