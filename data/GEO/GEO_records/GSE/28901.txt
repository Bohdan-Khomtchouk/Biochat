TITLE
Identification of GLI1 direct target genes in human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Panc-1GLI1ER and Panc-1ER were established from human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1. Panc-1GLI1ER cells express a chimeric transgene composed of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged version of the amino-terminal half of GLI1, fused to the AF2 domain of the mouse estrogen receptor 1(Esr1) cDNA. On the other hand, Panc-1ER harbor only EGFP-tagged AF2 domain. To identify GLI1 direct target genes, total RNAs were purified from the cells before and 3 hours after the beta-estradiol (E2) treatment. Gene expression profiles were analyzed by AGILENT human 4x44 cDNA microarray. Keywords: Expression profiling by genome tiling array

DESIGN
GLI1 direct target genes were identified in Panc-1 cells. Gene expression profiles of Panc-1GLI1ER and Panc-1ER cells were analyzed by AGILENT human 4x44 cDNA microarray before and 3 hours after treatment of beta-estradiol (E2) at doses of 10nM.
