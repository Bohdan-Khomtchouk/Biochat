TITLE
Proteasome machinery is instrumental in a common gain-of-function program of the p53 missense mutants in cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mutant p53 proteins, resulting from the missense mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, possess gain-of-function activities and are among the most robust oncoproteins in human tumors. They are potentially important therapeutic targets. To complement our mutant p53 transcriptomic studies we have performed ChIP-seq analysis in MDA-MB-231 (R280K) using the mouse anti-p53 DO1 antibody or control mouse IgG versus the input material.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis was performed in MDA-MB-231 (R280K) using the mouse anti-p53 DO1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech.) and  MDA-MB-231 (R280K) with mouse unspecific IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech.) as negative control.
