TITLE
Chronic haloperidol effects on gene expression in mouse [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We evaluate the effects of chronic administration of antipsychotic haloperidol versus placebo in male, 8-week old, C57BL/6J mice.

DESIGN
We used RNA-seq to study gene expression changes after haloperidol treatment in striatum samples of 28 mice (16 haloperidol-treated mice, 12 placebo-treated mice).

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
