TITLE
MiR-148a Functions as a Tumor Suppressor by Targeting CCK-BR via Inactivating STAT3 and Akt in Human Gastric Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the role of miRNAs in gastric cancer, miRNA microarray profiling in 28 pairs of gastric cancer tissues and the matched normal mucosal tissues were performed.

DESIGN
Twenty-eight pairs of gastric cancer tissues and the matched normal mucosal tissues were performed by human microRNA microarray v.12.0 (Agilent Technologies).

PLATFORM
GPL10850 Agilent-021827 Human miRNA Microarray (V3) (miRBase release 12.0 miRNA ID version)
