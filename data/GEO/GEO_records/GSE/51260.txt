TITLE
Aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in Primary Varicose Great Saphenous Veins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LncRNAs are key regulatory molecules involved in a variety of biological process and human diseases. However, the pathological effects of lncRNAs on primary varicose great saphenous veins (GSVs) remain unclear. In this study, we aimed at identifying aberrantly expressed lncRNAs involved in the prevalence of GSV varicosities and exploring their potential regulating effects.

DESIGN
6 paired tissues of the varicose great saphenous vein patient were used to compare the expression differences between varicose veins (VVs) and adjacent normal segments of saphenous veins (NVs) in the study. The lncRNA and mRNA expression profile of 6 paired vein tissues were studied using the microarry.
