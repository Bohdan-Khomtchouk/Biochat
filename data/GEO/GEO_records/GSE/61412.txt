TITLE
Expression data from advanced stage of murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and control pancreas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression signature of PDAC and to identify distinct up- and down-regulated transcripts in these tumors compared to control pancreas. We also established from this dataset the metabolic signature of PDAC in order to define new metabolic therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.

DESIGN
PDAC were removed at an advanced stage of tumorigenesis in 7 to 10-weeks old mice with Mixed genetic background : B6CBAF1 x C57BL/6 x 129/Sv x FVB/n. Apparent signs used to determined the time of sacrifice : weight loss, lower activity and dull coat.
