TITLE
Effects of moderate ethanol consumption during pregnancy on placental gene expression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We conducted a preliminary investigation to determine whether ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene expression may have some utility as a diagnostic indicator of maternal drinking during pregnancy as well as a prognostic indicator of risk for adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in affected offspring.

DESIGN
Pregnant Long-Evans rats voluntarily consumed either a 0% or 5% ethanol solution four hours each day throughout gestation.  Ethanol consumption produced a mean maternal daily intermittent peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL.  Placentas were harvested on Gestational Day 20 for gene expression studies.
