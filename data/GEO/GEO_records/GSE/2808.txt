TITLE
Gene expression in the Gli3Xt/Xt Vs wildtype developing limb

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarray technology to investigate the transcriptional consequences of loss of Gli3 from the anterior mesenchyme of the developing mouse limb bud at both E11.5 and E12.5. Comparisons were made between RNA derived from the anterior margin of Gli3Xt/Xt limb buds and that derived from wild type littermates Keywords: genetic modification
