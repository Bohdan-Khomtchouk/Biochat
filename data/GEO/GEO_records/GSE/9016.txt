TITLE
UV irradiation of human melanocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Target genes of ultraviolet stress response in cutaneous melanocytes, potentially associated with solar induced melanocarcinogenesis, were characterized by cDNA microarray technology. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
In cultured normal human melanocytes, 198 genes out of Â»9000 arrayed were found modulated > 1.9 times following artificial ultraviolet (mainly ultraviolet-B) irradiation (100 mJ per cm2).
