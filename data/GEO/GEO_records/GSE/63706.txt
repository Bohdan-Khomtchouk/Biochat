TITLE
Expression data from Senescence Process of citrus

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis ; Citrus maxima ; Citrus unshiu ; Citrus reticulata

SUMMARY
The postharvest senescence processes of citrus fruits were analyzed transcriptomic. The present study was aimed to: further uncover the rind-flesh communication of hesperidium; characterize the differential storage behaviors of different citrus varieties; reveal the important changes during storing process; and demonstrate the specific non-climacteric characteristics of citrus fruits.

DESIGN
We chose four major table fruit varieties of citrus: satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc) (M), ponkan (Citrus reticulata Blanco) (K), newhall navel orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) (O) and shatian pummelo (Citrus grandis Osbeck) (P). They were sampled every 10 days during 50 DAH (days after harvest), almost covering the commercial storage period of loose-skin citrus.
