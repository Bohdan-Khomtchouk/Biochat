TITLE
Expression data from Senescence Process of citrus

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
The postharvest senescence processes of citrus fruits were analyzed transcriptomic. The present study was aimed to: further uncover the rind-flesh communication of hesperidium; characterize the differential storage behaviors of different citrus varieties; reveal the important changes during storing process; and demonstrate the specific non-climacteric characteristics of citrus fruits.
