TITLE
Identification of the BRD1 interactome and its impact on mental disorder risk

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified chromatin binding sites for two isforms of BRD1 (BRD1-S and BRD1-L) using ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
BRD1 isoforms were cloned, epitope-tagged (pcDNA 6 V5-His6, Lifetechnologies) and stably expressed in HEK293T cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed using anti V5-antibody conjugated agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti HA antibody conjugated agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) as controls
