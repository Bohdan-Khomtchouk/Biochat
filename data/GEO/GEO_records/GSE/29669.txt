TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of the zebrafish inner ear points to growth hormone mediated regeneration following acoustic trauma

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcripts for GH, MHC Class I and II genes, and heavy- and light-chain myosins, as well as many others genes, were differentially regulated in the zebrafish inner ear following overexposure to sound.

DESIGN
Following acoustic trauma in the zebrafish inner ear, we used microarray analysis to identify genes involved in inner ear repair following acoustic exposure by comparing the gene expression levels of 2 days and 4 days post-sound exposure (NE-ZF-2d and NE-ZF-4d, respectively) to controls without sound exposure (C-ZF).
