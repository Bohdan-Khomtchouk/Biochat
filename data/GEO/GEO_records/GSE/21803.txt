TITLE
Profile of macrophages in human abdominal aortic aneurysms: a transcriptomic, proteomic and antibody protein array study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), are defined by an increased aortic diameter and characterized by impairment of the extracellular matrix, macrophages infiltration and decreased density of smooth muscle cells. Our aim is to identify the key molecules involved in the pathogenesis of AAAs. This study investigated transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of macrophages from AAA patients ( > 50 mm aortic diameter) and peripheral arterial occlusion (PAO) patients without AAA detected, who both needed a surgery.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic profiling data presented here.  We tested mRNA from macrophages of 4 different AAA patients and 4 different PAO (peripheral arterial occlusion) samples. RNA sample from each AAA and PAO patients were compared each other.
