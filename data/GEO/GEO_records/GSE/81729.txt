TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells during in vitro spontaneous transformation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse ovarian surface epithelial (MOSE) cells were isolated from adult C57BL6 female mice and cultured during 28 passages in a standard medium. Total RNA was analyzed with NIA-15K microarrays.

DESIGN
Common reference, single biological repeats, 4 technical repeated dye-swap replicates. Test samples: culture passages 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 18, 23, 25 and 28. Reference sample: whole newborn male.
