TITLE
Ribosome profiling of E. coli K-12 MG1655 MOPS rich media with 0.2% glucose

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Ribosome profiling was performed on E. coli wild type cells. All replicates were grown to an OD of ~0.4 in MOPS rich Media with 0.2% glucose supplemented, aerobically in shake flasks. Cultures were treated with chloramphenicol 2 min prior to harvest.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates
