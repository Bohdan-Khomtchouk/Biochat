TITLE
RNA-Seq expression analysis of Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites adapted to grow in the presence of toxic amount of the Nitric Oxide donor S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica HM-1:IMSS

SUMMARY
Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite responsible for amebiasis, a disease which is characterized by acute inflammation of the colon. Adaptation of the parasite to toxic level of nitric oxide (NO) produced by phagocytes may be essential for the establishment of chronic amebiasis and for the survival of parasite within the host. To obtain insight into the mechanism of adaptation to NO, E. histolytica trophozoites were selected in vitro by stepwise exposures to increasing amounts of NO donor S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) up to a concentration of 110 µM. These NO adapted trophozoites (NAT) were more resistance to acute exposure of GSNO (350μM), to activated macrophages and have a better capability to invade porcine colon explants compared to wild-type trophozoites.  The transcriptome of NAT was investigated by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and it showed only a weak overlapping with the transcriptome of trophozoites exposed to acute nitrosative stress (TEANS).

DESIGN
RNA-Seq analysis of mRNA extracted from control trophozoites (two biological replicates) and from NAT (three biological replicates).
