TITLE
Expression data from 2 cohorts of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this dataset, we included expression data obtained from 30 resected human PDAC tumors, to examine what genes are differentially expressed in different cohorts that might lead to various outcomes The two cohorts we have are defined as short term survivors (STS) with median survival of > 3 month and < 1 year postsurgery, and long term survivors (LTS) with overall survival of > 3 years postsurgery.

DESIGN
30 total samples were analyzed
