TITLE
gcn2/WT polysome loading and transcript level in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the role of GCN2 in regulating translation, we compared the polysome loading state and overall transcript level between Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (ecotype Landsberg erecta)  and gcn2 (Genetrap line GT8359, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)  seedlings with or without herbicide chlorosufuron treatment RNA was fractionated using sucrose gradients into polysomal and nonpolysomal RNAs. We also determined overall total transcript levels.  We used Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.

DESIGN
wild type and gcn2 mutant were compared in their total transcript and translation state. RNA was fractionated using sucrose gradients into nonpolysomal and polysomal RNAs.   The sucrose gradient fractions and the total RNA were analyzed using Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays (platform  GPL198).
