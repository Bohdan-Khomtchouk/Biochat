TITLE
Liver transcriptome of sexually mature hens in relation to the formation of the egg yolk

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We used a transcriptomic approach based on the comparison of the expression between the liver of sexually mature hens versus pre-laying pullets to better appreciate which hepatic proteases and antiproteases are specifically expressed in relation to vitellogenesis. Using a 20K chicken oligoarray corresponding to 12 595 different chicken genes, a total of 582 genes were shown to be over-expressed in the liver at sexual maturity of hens (1.2 to 67 fold- difference).  Most of the top ten over-expressed genes are known components of egg yolk or of the perivitelline membrane. The combination of different bioinformatic tools reveals 12 proteases and 3 antiproteases amongst the over-expressed genes, including many predicted proteins with yet unknown functions.

DESIGN
8 samples of each condition( liver of 38 weeks old mature hens and of 10 weeks old immature pullets) were analysed, with an experimental design in dye switch (half of the slides labeled with fluorophore Alexa 555 and half with Alexa 647 for each condition)
