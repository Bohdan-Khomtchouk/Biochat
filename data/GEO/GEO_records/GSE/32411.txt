TITLE
Differential Expressions of miRNAs in resting and activated human in vitro-differentiated NK cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate miRNA expressions of miRNA upon activation.

DESIGN
In vitro-differentiated human NK cells were freshly incubated in the presence of IL15 after 24h deprivation of IL-15. The cells were harvested at the times (0h, resting-Sample 1 and 2; 6h, activated-Sample 3 and 4) and analyzed by microarray.
