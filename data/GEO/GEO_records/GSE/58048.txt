TITLE
Histone methyltransferase SMYD3 knockdown effects in MCF7 breast cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study aims to elucidate the effect of histone methyltransferase SMYD3 on gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Knockdown luciferase control v.s. knockdown SMYD3 in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line were conducted.  Results identify a large proportion of cell cycle-related genes regulated by SMYD3.

DESIGN
SMYD3 was knockdowned in MCF-7 cells and shLuc was used as control. Their total RNA were isolated for genomic expression profiling with Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.
