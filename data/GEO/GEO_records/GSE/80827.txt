TITLE
Transcriptional Changes in Escherichia coli Upon Treatment with (-)-Roemerine

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Escherichia coli TB1 cells under (-)-Roemerine treatment. The genome reprograming in the bacterial cells at transcription level was analyzed through treatment of the bacteria with plant-derived alkaloid, (-)-Roemerine, to elucidate the response of bacteria to the antibacterial drug.
