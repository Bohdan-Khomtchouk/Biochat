TITLE
Transcriptional Changes in Escherichia coli Upon Treatment with (-)-Roemerine

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Escherichia coli TB1 cells under (-)-Roemerine treatment. The genome reprograming in the bacterial cells at transcription level was analyzed through treatment of the bacteria with plant-derived alkaloid, (-)-Roemerine, to elucidate the response of bacteria to the antibacterial drug.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, DMSO vs. DMSO+Roemerine treated cells, at two different time points, 0 vs. 60 min. after treatment. Biological replicates: 7 control replicates (3 samples for 0 min., 4 samples for 60 min.), 6 Roemerine treated replicates (3 samples for 0 min., 3 samples for 60 min)

PLATFORM
GPL13359 Agilent-020097 E. coli Gene Expression Microarray (Probe Name version)
