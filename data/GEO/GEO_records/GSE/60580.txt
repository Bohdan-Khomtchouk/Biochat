TITLE
Low oxygen and FGF2 effects on the transcriptome of the adult human dermal fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adult human dermal fibroblasts reside in vivo under low oxygen tension. Thus, low oxygen culture conditions represent a physiological state for adult human dermal fibroblasts. We have also previously shown that low oxygen and addition of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) lead to prolonged life-span of adult human dermal fibroblasts.  Therefore, we set to determine effects of low oxygen and FGF2 on the gene expression signature of adult human dermal fibroblasts. This global analysis will allow identification of genes affected and pathways regulated by low oxygen and FGF2.

DESIGN
Adult human dermal fibroblasts were grown in four different experimental conditions (2% oxygen, 2% oxygen with addition of 4 ng/ml FGF2, 19% oxygen, and 19% oxygen with addition of 4 ng/ml FGF2) and their transcriptomes were compared. Current study includes one biological replicate and three technical replicates of each sample (total of 12 samples).
