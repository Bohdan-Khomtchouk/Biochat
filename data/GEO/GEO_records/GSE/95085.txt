TITLE
Affymetrix CytoScanÂ® HD Array (SNP and copy number array) used on pseudarthrosis tissue from Neurofibromatosis type 1 individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Array data was used to confirm somatic deletion or copy neutral LOH on chromosome 17, that was inclusive of the NF1 gene.

DESIGN
Affymetrix Cytoscan arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from peripheral blood or from frozen pseudarthrosis tissue/bone samples. Copy number analysis and SNP array data was performed for 3  pseudarthrosis tissue samples and one blood sample from Neurofibromatosis type 1 individuals.
