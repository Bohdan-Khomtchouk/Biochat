TITLE
Toxicogenomics profiling of bone marrow from rats treated with topotecan in combination with oxaliplatin: a mechanistic strategy to inform combination toxicity.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Combinations of anticancer agents may have synergistic anti-tumor effects, but enhanced hematological toxicity often limit their clinical use. We examined whether “microarray profiles” could be used to compare early molecular responses following a single dose of agents administered individually with that of the agents administered in a combination.  Six patterns of co-expressed genes were detected at the 1-hour time point which indicate regulatory expression of genes dependent on the order of the administration. When topotecan is given first, several signal transduction transcription factors associated with cancer or inactivation of a tumor suppressor were co-regulating gene expression. These results suggest alterations in histone biology, chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, bone regeneration, and respiratory and oxidative phosphorylation are among the prominent pathways modulated in bone marrow from animals treated with an oxaliplatin/topotecan combination.

DESIGN
mRNA responses were compared within bone marrow of Sprague-Dawley rats after a single 30-minute treatment with topotecan at 4.7 mg/kg or oxaliplatin at 15 mg/kg alone to that of sequentially administered combination therapy or vehicle control Please note that one of the 'Bone Marrow_Oxaliplatin _Vehicle 1' sample (1344-05H_4M 40) was considered an outlier and thus, was excluded from data analysis and GEO records.
