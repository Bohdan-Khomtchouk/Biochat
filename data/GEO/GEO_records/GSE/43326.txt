TITLE
Gene expression data from iPSC-derived neural cells, comparison between APP wild and E693delta mutation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oligomeric forms of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) are presumed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). However, it is still unclear how Abeta oligomers contribute to AD pathogenesis in patient neural cells. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a familial AD patient and differentiated them into neural cells. Abeta oligomers were accumulated in neural cells of AD bearing amyloid precursor protein (APP)-E693delta mutation. To uncover Abeta oligomers in AD(APP-E693delta) neural cells, we analyzed gene expression profiles of control and the AD neural cells

DESIGN
comparison between control (n=3) and AD (n=3)
