TITLE
Burkitt lymphoma cells vs. Lymphoblastoid B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes mediating tumor transformation we compared the transcriptome of five Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell lines (tumor cells) with that of a pool of three lymphoblastoid B-cell lines (LCL; immortal, but not tumor cells). Each BL cell line was considered as a biological replicate. BL cell lines: DG-75, Ramos, BL2, Mutu-I and Akata. LCL cell lines: X50-7, IB4 and Dana.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, BL vs. pool of LCL. Biological replicates: 5 BL cell lines, 1 pool of LCL cell lines, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
