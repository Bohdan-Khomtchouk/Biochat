TITLE
Tet1 is a tumor suppressor of hematopoietic maligancy [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of Tet1 expression causes global 5mC and 5hmC changes in stem and progenitor cells in mice and enhanced pro-B cell self-renewal, increased DNA damage and B-lymphomageneis. In this study we performed whole transciptome analysis using RNA-sequencing in purified long-term HSCs and MPPs. These results revealed that genes regulated byTet1 included Histones, DNA repair enzymes and B-lineage specific factors.

DESIGN
Purified long-term HSCs and MPPs from WT and Tet1 KO mice were used for RNA isolation. RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and PolyA selection using oligo-dT beads (Life Technologies) was performed according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Libraries were generated as described before, including end-repair, A-tailing, adapter (Illumina Truseq system) ligation and PCR amplification. RNA libraries were then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 using 50bp paired-end reads. Transcriptome profiling of LT-HSC and MPP cells in WT and Tet1 KO mice
