TITLE
Analysis of liver gene expression profile in male mice fed alcoholic (Lieber-Decarli's) diet and calorie-matched control diet for 6 weeks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis showed dysregulation of genes involved in lipid, xenobiotic and glutathione metabolism as well as those involved in mitochondrial function and cell proliferation in the livers of C57BL6 mice fed alcoholic liquid diet for 6 weeks.

DESIGN
We analyzed liver RNA from 4 mice fed alcoholic diet and 4 mice fed control diet  using the Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool.

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
