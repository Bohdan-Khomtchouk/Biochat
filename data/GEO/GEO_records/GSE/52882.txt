TITLE
Gene expression in Vemurafenib-treated A375 and A2058 melanoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human melanoma cell line A375 and A2058 were incubated with DMSO (control group) or Vemurafenib (1 μM in DMSO) for 72 hours. Total RNA was isolated with Qiagen RNA isolation kit; 1.5 μg of total RNA was used as template for cDNA synthesis.

DESIGN
A375 and A2058 human melanoma cell lines were treated with DMSO (control) and Vemurafenib (examination). Triplicates per group were processed and analysed in parallel.

PLATFORM
