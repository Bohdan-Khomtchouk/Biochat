TITLE
Mapping the determinants of gene expression plasticity by genetical genomics in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
2 Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) per array, 40 arrays per Temperature, 2  Temperatures(16C,24C) Keywords: genetical genomics experiment

DESIGN
Hybridization were performed separately for each temperature. RILs were paried on each array so that their genetic distance was maximized (distant pair design, Fu et al. Genetics 2006, PubMed ID: 16361243).

PLATFORM
GPL4038 C. elegans 22k 60 mer array
