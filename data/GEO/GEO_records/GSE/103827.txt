TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis reveals mechanisms of leaf coloration between the leaf color mutant and normal green leaves in Ginkgo biloba

ORGANISM
Ginkgo biloba

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from the leaves of mutant and normal green leaves of Ginkgo biloba using the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform to generate the transcriptome dynamics that may serve as a gene expression profile blueprint for leaf color variation of the mutant in Ginkgo biloba.

DESIGN
Transcriptome sequencing in leaf color mutant and normal green leaves of Ginkgo biloba

PLATFORM
GPL24012 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Ginkgo biloba)
