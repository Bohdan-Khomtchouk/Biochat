TITLE
WT and FcgKO peritoneal MF response to IFNg

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Emerging data suggest that many immunoreceptors, all of which use a conserved ITAM-module for their signaling, can couple with members of additional classes of membrane receptors to deliver unique signal(s) to the cell. Using functional and gene expression analysis we describe the role for the tonic signaling through Fcg-chain, the major ITAM-module of the innate immune system, in modifying cytokine responses in MF.

DESIGN
Peritoneal MF were left unstimulated or were stimulated in duplicates for 6 hrs with IFNÎ³. cDNA was analyzed using 8-sample Mouse Ref-8 v2.0 Illumina array.  Expressed genes were defined as those with p < 0.05, and their relative expression values were calculated using average of two WT unstimulated samples as calibrator.
