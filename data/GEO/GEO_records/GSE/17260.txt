Prediction of progression-free survival in patients with advanced-stage serous ovarian cancer

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify and evaluate the prognostic ability of progression-free survival-related profile for advanced-stage ovarian cancer, advanced-stage serous ovarian cancer tissues from 110 patients who received primary surgery and a platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy were profiled using oligonucleotide microarrays of more than 40,000 transcripts. We first selected 88 genes by a univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis (p < 0.01) and next optimized regression coefficients by ridge regression model using 10-fold cross-validation. The prognostic index was independently associated with PFS time compared to other clinical factors in multivariate analysis [hazard ratio (HR), 3.72; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.66–5.43; p,0.0001]. In an external dataset, multivariate analysis revealed that this prognostic index was significantly correlated with PFS time (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.20–1.98; p = 0.0008). Furthermore, the correlation between the prognostic index and overall survival time was confirmed in the two independent external datasets (log rank test, p = 0.0010 and 0.0008).  In multivariable analysis, our prognostic index was independently associated with progression-free survival times compared to other clinical factors (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the prognostic ability of our prognostic index was validated in external, publicly available dataset (n = 87), and was proved in multivariate analysis (p = 0.0032). These results suggest that disease progression or recurrence of advanced-stage serous ovarian cancer can be predicted by gene expression profile. The prognostic ability of our index based on the 88-gene expression profile in ridge regression Cox hazard model was shown to be independent of other clinical factors in predicting cancer prognosis across two distinct datasets. Further study will be necessary to improve predictive accuracy of the prognostic index toward clinical application for evaluation of the risk of recurrence in patients with advanced-stage serous ovarian cancer.

DESIGN
One hundred ten patients who were diagnosed as advanced-stage serous ovarian cancer were recruited in this study.
