TITLE
Comparative transcriptomics allows defining mononuclear phagocyte subset homology across vertebrate species (Sheep)

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Characterization of sheep blood and splenic immunocyte subpopulations by means of global expression analysis

DESIGN
We analysed the gene expression of blood plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC) from 3 control sheep, blood SIRPa+ conventional DC (cDC) from 3 control sheep, blood CADM1+ cDC from 1 control sheep, splenic B lymphocytes from 4 control sheep, splenic monocytes/macrophages from 3 control sheep and Monocyte-derived DC from 3 independent in vitro cultures
