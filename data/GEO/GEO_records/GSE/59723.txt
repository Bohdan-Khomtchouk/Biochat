TITLE
Transcriptional analyses of wheat responses to the necrotrophic effector SnTox3

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Wheat (Triticum aestivum) was infiltrated with the Stagonospora nodorum effector protein SnTox3 to identify differentially regulated genes.

DESIGN
SnTox3 was isolated from P. pastoris expression strains, purified and infiltrated into the susceptible wheat line BG220. Samples were collected 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post infiltration (hpi) in biological triplicates. Total RNA was isolated and used for microarray analysis with the Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array following the manufactures instructions. Resulting data were analysed using the Partek Genomics Suite.
