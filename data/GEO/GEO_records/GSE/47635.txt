TITLE
Copy number variations in mouse mammary tumours driven by mutant Pik3ca^H1047R expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Profiling of mouse mammary tumours that have developed in a mouse model expressing mutant Pik3ca^H1047R at endogenous level under control of the MMTV promoter (Tikoo et al., PLoS one 2012). Copy number variations in tumours (compared to matching liver DNA) were detected using Agilent Sureprint microarrays.

DESIGN
DNA samples prepared from 11 tumours developed in Pik3ca^H1047R mice (biological replicates). For each sample the reference is the matching liver DNA of each animal.
