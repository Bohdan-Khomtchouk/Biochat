TITLE
Somatic copy number alterations associated with populations and clinical characteristics in ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Clinical characteristics of ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCC) include 1) higher incidence among Japanese, 2) association with endometriosis, 3) poor prognosis in advanced stage, 4) higher incidence of thrombosis as complication. We applied high resolution comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array to screen somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) associated with these clinical characteristics. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study. DNA obtained from tumors was assayed by array comparative genomic hybridization using Agilent Whole Human Genome 244K.

DESIGN
117 tumor samples were analyzed by Agilent-G4411B Human Genome CGH Microarray Kit 244A. Log2 Ratio (tumor sample DNA/normal DNA) were compared between Japanese and non-Japanese, between patients with thrombosis and without thrombosis, between patients with endometriosis and without endometriosis, among patients sensitive to, intermediate to and resistant to the chemotherapy, among FIGO stages, between relapsed and not relapsed, between survived and not survived.
