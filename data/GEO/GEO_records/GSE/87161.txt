TITLE
Gene expression profile of peri-implantation uteri treated with LPA3 receptor agonist

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate gene expression changes induced by Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (LPA3) activation in peri-implantation uteri,  we performed microarray analysis in LPA3 agonist (T13)-injected pseudopregnant uteri. On 3.5 dpc, pseudopregnant mice were subjected with intrautero-injection of vehicle (0.01% BSA-PBS) or T13 and then uteri were dissected 24-36 hr after the injection. We found that several thousand genes were up- or down-regulated by T13 injection.  Interestingly, well-known decidual markers such as Bmp2 and Wnt4 were dramatically induced by T13, which we certificated in quantitive RT-PCR.

DESIGN
6 different samples (1-6) mixed with uteri from 3 mice, respectively; vehicle-injected pseudopregnant uteri (psp; 1,3,5) and lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 agonist injected pseudopregnant uteri (T13; 2,4,6); 24 hr after the injection (E4.5; 1,2), 30 hr after the injection (E4.8; 3,4) and 36 hr after the injection (E5.0; 5,6); A comparison between psp vs T13 in each timepoint
