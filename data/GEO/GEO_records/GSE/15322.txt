TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic profiling of human colon cells (CCD-18Co) exposed to an orange extract rich in flavanones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in human colon normal fibroblasts exposed to a bitter orange extract enriched in flavanones (and previously subjected to in vitro gastro-duodenal digestion) to determine possible modulatory beneficial effects induced by these plant-derived compounds on the colon cells. Keywords: Comparative gene expression, Control vs Treated cells (response to exposure with xenobiotics plant polyphenols)

DESIGN
We used ~90% confluent monolayers of colon CCD-18Co cells exposed to either small doses of pre-digested extract from bitter orange containing a mixture of flavanones (Treated) or equivalent quantities of digestive enzymes and salts (Control). Treatments were done in triplicate.
