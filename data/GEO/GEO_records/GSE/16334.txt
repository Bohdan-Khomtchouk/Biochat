TITLE
Expression data from normal and Fanconi anemia low density bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited disease complicated by aplastic anemia.  There is evidence that hematopoietic stem cells have lost self replicative capacity and undergo apoptosis when exposed to inhibitory cytokines including interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. We used gene expression microarrays to identify transcriptomal differences between bone marrow cells from normal volunteers and from children and adults with Fanconi anemia

DESIGN
Fanconi anemia patients were identified using mitomycin C and/or diepoxybutane chromosomal breakage analysis.  Eleven normal volunteers and 21 FA patients were studied.  All FA patients with cytogenetic evidence of clonal evolution were excluded.  All FA patients with acute leukemia were excluded.  RNA was prepared from freshly obtained low density mononuclear cell fractions.
