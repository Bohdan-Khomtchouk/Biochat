TITLE
Carbendazim induced genomic instability in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Carbendazim (Methyl benzimidazol-2-ylcarbamate; MBC) is an antimitotic drug used for broad-spectrum fungicide, antineoplastic and mutagen in microbial breeding. Using a customized SNP microarray technology, this work revealed the effect of MBC on genomic instability (loss of heterozygosity, chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy) in the diploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae JSC25.

DESIGN
By SNP microarrays specific for chromosome 4, we analyzed 40 JSC25-derived mutants  treated with MBC to uncover the details of MBC-induced genomic instability.
