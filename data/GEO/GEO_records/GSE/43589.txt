TITLE
Effect of Oleanolic acid on liver transcriptome of mice lacking apolipoprotein E

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The hypothesis that the oleanolic acid of olive oil might influence hepatic gene expression in an apoE was tested in mice. Gene expression was analyzed using DNA microarrays in male apoE-deficient mice that received 10 mg/kg/day of oleanolic acid for 11 weeks.

DESIGN
As initial screening of potential candidate genes involved in a differential response, only genes with remarkably modified expression (signal log2 ratio > 1.5 or < -1.5) were further considered
