TITLE
Expression Profiling of Mixed Lineage Leukemia Cells Treated with a Potent Small-Molecule DOT1L Inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell lines bearing MLL translocations (MV4-11 and MOLM-13) were treated with a potent, selective inhibitor of the DOT1L histone methyl transferase.  Treatment of MLL-rearranged cell lines with the DOT1L inhibitor selectively inhibits H3K79 methylation and blocks expression of leukemogenic genes.  Here we provide expression profiling data of cells treated with DOT1L inhibitor or vehicle control.

DESIGN
MV4-11 cells were treated with 3 uM EPZ004777 (DOT1L inhibitor) or vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) for 2, 4 and 6 days.  MOLM-13 cells were treated with 3 uM EPZ004777 (DOT1L inhibitor) or vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) for 6 days.  For each unique conditon, 3 biological replicates were generated for expression profiling.
