TITLE
Early vanadium stress induced transcriptional changes in the root of Oryza sativa

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Whole genome arrays have been used to analyze the transcriptomic response to vanadium stress in rice root. Identify genes and pathways that would respond to vanadium stress

DESIGN
Comparison of mock control and  rice seedlings treated with 1 mM vanadium; Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 V-treated replicates
