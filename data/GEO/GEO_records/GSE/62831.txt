TITLE
Tumor suppression by miR-26 overrides potential oncogenic activity in intestinal tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Through a series of mouse genetic studies, we concluded that miR-26 overexpression in intestinal epithelial cells inhibits tumor formation in Apcmin/+ mice. We isolated intestinal epithelial cells from M2rtTA and M2rtTA; eGFP.miR-26a to assess gene expression changes after the induction of miR-26a expression.

DESIGN
Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from three M2rtTA and three M2rtTA; eGFP.miR-26a mice after treatment with doxycycline for 10 days.  Gene expression was profiled using Illumina microarrays.
