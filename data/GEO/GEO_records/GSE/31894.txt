TITLE
Regulation of global gene expression in human Loa loa infection is a function of chronicity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression to parasite and nonparasite antigen was seen in infected patients with lifelong exposure to the human filarial parasite Loa loa (endemics) compared with patients who became infected due to temporary residence or travel in an endemic country (expatriates).

DESIGN
CD4+ and CD8+ cells were isolated; comparison was done between unstimulated cells from 2 patient groups and between parasite microfilarial (MfAg) and nonparasite streptolysin O (SLO) antigen-stimulated cells with unstimulated cells; Technical replicates (2 unstimulated; 2 each antigen)
