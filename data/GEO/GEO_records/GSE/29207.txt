TITLE
Role of miR-30 miRNAs during adipogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hMADS cells) overexpressing either miR-30a or miR-30d, as well as knocked-down for the whole miR-30 family. Gene expression was analyzed after 4 days in adipogenic medium. Data give insight into the role of miR-30 during adipogenesis, and identifies enriched predicted targets for miR-30.

DESIGN
Human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hMADS cells) were transfected with one of the following: premiR-30a (Ambion), premiR-30d (Ambion), premiR negative control #1 (Ambion). Three days after transfection, cells were submitted to adipogenic differentiation for 4 days. In a separate experiment, hMADS cells were transfected with either antimiR-30 or antimiR-neg (mismatch control), and then submitted to differentiation as described above. For each experimental condition, 2 hMADS cell clones were used independently (clone B7 and B9).
