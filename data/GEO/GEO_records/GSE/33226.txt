TITLE
Genome wide DNA methylation analysis of leukemia and reprogrammed leukemia cells (gene expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the methylation pattern of a well characterized leukemia cell line, named K562. Furthermore, we decided to investigate how the malignant epiegenome change during the reprogramming process

DESIGN
We used Affymatrix expression microarrays analysis to investigate the relation between expression and methylation in leukemia and reprogrammed leukemia (LiPS). We show that the erasure of the epigenetic aberrancies have functional consequences on leukemia phenotype
