TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryonic ureteric bud (UB) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dicer-dependent miRNAs are required for UB morphogenesis and differentiation during metanephric kidney development. We used microarray analysis to identify genes whose expression in the UB epithelium are altered from UB-specific ablation of Dicer.

DESIGN
E15.5 UB cells from control and Dicer mutant kidneys were FACS sorted for transcription profiling.
