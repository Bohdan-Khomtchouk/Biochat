TITLE
Expression Array of Lymphoblastoid Cell lines Under Inflammatory Conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression across 85 cell lines after stimulation with a cocktail of inflammatory cytokines

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from Genotyped Lymphoblastoid cell lines under inflammatory and baseline conditions. 3 biological replicates of stimulated and 2 biological replicates of baseline samples were hybridized to the Illumina Human WG-6 v.3 gene expression chip.
