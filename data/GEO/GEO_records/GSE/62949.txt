TITLE
DNA Methylation and RNA Expression Profiles in Lung Adenocarcinomas [RNA Expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung cancer occurs in never-smokers. Epigenetic changes in lung cancer potentially represent important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic targets. We compared DNA methylation profiles of 28 adenocarcinomas of the lungs of never-smokers with paired adjacent nonmalignant lung tissue. We correlated differential methylation changes with gene expression changes from the same 28 samples. We observed a distinct separation in methylation profiles between tumor and adjacent nonmalignant lung tissue using principal component analysis. Tumors were generally hypomethylated compared with adjacent nonmalignant tissue. Of 1,906 differentially methylated CpG sites between tumor and nonmalignant tissue, 1,198 were within classically defined CpG islands where tumors were hypermethylated compared with nonmalignant tissue. A total of 708 sites were outside CpG islands where tumors were hypomethylated compared with nonmalignant tissue. There were significant differences in expression of 351 genes (23%) of the 1,522 genes matched to the differentially methylated CpG sites. Genes that were not significantly differentially expressed and were hypermethylated within CpG sites were enriched for homeobox genes. These results suggest that the methylation profiles of lung adenocarcinomas of never-smokers and adjacent nonmalignant lung tissue are significantly different. Despite the differential methylation of homeobox genes, no significant changes in expression of these genes were detected.

DESIGN
Twenty eight pairs of tumor and adjacent normal lungs were profiled for lung adenocarcinoma patients by gene expression and DNA methylation microarray
