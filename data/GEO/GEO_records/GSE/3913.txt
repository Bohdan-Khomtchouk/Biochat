TITLE
Seasonal variation in leafy spurge crown bud gene expression

ORGANISM
Euphorbia esula

SUMMARY
These experiments were designed to follow the seasonal changes in the transcriptome of field-grown leafy spurge crown buds. The goal was to identify specific signaling pathways and marker genes characteristic to the changes that occur when the buds transitioned from paradormancy through endodormancy and into ecodormancy. Keywords: Time course seasonal dormancy

DESIGN
We used a balanced dye swap, common reference design with two biological samples (collected monthly from Aug-Dec. in 2001 and again in 2003).

PLATFORM
GPL2524 Euphorbiaceae chip1
