TITLE
Mapping of hns sites in Typhimurium 14028 using a tiling oligo array

ORGANISM
Salmonella

SUMMARY
The NimbleGen array contains 387,000 46~50-mer oligos, including 377,230 salmonella probes whose sequences only hit genome once. The probes were designed based on Salmonella typhimurium LT2 (NC_003197) genome, with a moving window of about 12 bases. Raw intensities were normalized by the median intensity in each channel and the ratios were calculated by log base 2 (hns-bound DNA / genomic DNA) after the normalization. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Two arrays were hybridized with Typhimurium 14028genomic DNA and hns-bound DNA from a chromatin immunoprecipitation with a Dye swap.

PLATFORM
