TITLE
Effect of ectotopic expression of K13 on global gene expression in HUVEC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Integrated microarray and multiplex cytokine analyses of Kaposi's Sarcoma Asssociated Herpesvirus viral FLICE Inhibitory Protein K13 affected genes and cytokines in human blood vascular endothelial cells. The KSHV-encoded K13 protein is one of the few proteins to be expressed in latently-infected spindle cells and the ectopic expression of K13 in human vascular endothelial cells is sufficient to transform them into spindle cells.

DESIGN
We have examined the effect of ectopic K13 expression on global gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).
