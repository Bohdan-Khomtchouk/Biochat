TITLE
Transcriptomic effects of Capridine on the acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Agilent human gene expression arrays to test whether Capridine, a chemotherapeutic agent with specificity towards prostate cancer, deregulates the genomic fabric of acute myeloyd leukemia in HL-60 cells. This cell line was derived at the National Cancer Institute from a 36-year-old woman with acute promyelocytic leukemia. We found that Capridine down-regulates the pathways responsible for formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, for anti-apoptosis and for proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells. Our results indicates the therapeutic potential of Capridine against acute myeloid leukemia.

DESIGN
Two-conditions: HO = not treated, HA = Capridine-treated HL-60 cells. Four biological replicates of each condition. Differently labeled biological replicates were cohybridized with each array. Results of similarly labeled different conditions were compared then averaged for the two fluorescent labels. For instance: HO1 & HO3 were compared with HA1 & HA3, HO2 & HO4 were compared  with HA2 & + HA4, and the results of the comparisons averaged. This design uses 100% of the resources, has a better normlaiztion and allows all possible comparisons among the conditions.
