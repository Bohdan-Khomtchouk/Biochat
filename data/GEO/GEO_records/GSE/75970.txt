TITLE
Gene expression profile Colorectal Tumor and Normal tissue samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of 4 pairs of colorectal cancer tissue and paraneoplastic tissue. The fresh frozen samples were obtained during surgical procedures. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying malignancy.

DESIGN
Differential lncRNA and gene expression in human colorectal cancer was measured between tumor tissues and paraneoplastic tissues. Four independent experiments were performed using four donors for each experiment.
