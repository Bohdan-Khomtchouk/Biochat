TITLE
Short Read Sequencing Data of the Transcriptome of the Rheumatoid Arthritis and Treated with Acupuncture or not

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the application of Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of the transcriptome of the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rat model induced by collagen type II (CIA) and treated with acupuncture or not.

DESIGN
2 rats in total, i.e., 2 replicates RA rat model before treatment (RA1, 2) for 3 in vitro culture conditions (standard serum FBS, blood serum from animals acupuncture treated AP+, blood serum from animals acupuncture untreated AP-).
