TITLE
miRNA profiling of control and ischemic samples in vitro and in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
miRNA microarray profiling of primary cortical neurons exposed to 4h oxygen and glucose deprivation  (OGD) in vitro. RNA samples collected at 8h post-OGD terminaion. miRNAs were also profiled in mice exposed to 3- vessel occlusion model of stroke. RNA samples collected from contralateral (control) and ipsilateral (infarct) sides of the brain following 24h of reperfusion.

DESIGN
Comparison of control and ischemic samples across 3 biological replicates for both in vitro and in vivo samples. In vitro cultures consisted of primary cortical neurons derived from E17 rat Wistar embryos. In vivo samples were obtained from C57bl/6 mice exposed to three-vessel occlusion.
