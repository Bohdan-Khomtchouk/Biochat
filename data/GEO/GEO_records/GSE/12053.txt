TITLE
siRNAs 15-29 nucleotides long with 100 percent hit to Turnip mosaic virus clone GBR98

ORGANISM
Turnip mosaic virus

SUMMARY
Mustard (Brassica juncea) was tested for Turnip mosaic virus infection. Small RNA of the plant was extracted and converted to DNA according to Ho, T., et al. (2006)  Journal of Virological Methods 136:217-223, with primers modified to contain 454 adapter nucleotide sequences. The DNA then passed quality control through Bioanalyzer and Nanodrop before sequenced by 454 Life Sciences. Keywords: siRNA

DESIGN
One sample analyzed by 454 high-throughput sequencing technology

PLATFORM
GPL9383 454 GS (Turnip mosaic virus)
