TITLE
Expression data from periparturient bos taurus

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The liver of dairy cows naturally displays a series of metabolic adaptation during the periparturient period in response to the increasing nutrient requirement of lactation. The hepatic adaptation is partly regulated by insulin resistance and it is affected by the prepartal energy intake level of cows. We aimed to investigate the metabolic changes in the liver of dairy cows during the periparturient at gene expression level and to study the effect of prepartal energy level on the  metabolic adaptation at gene expression level.B13:N13

DESIGN
Sixteen Ayrshire dairy cows were allocated to a controlled-energy diet (CON) or a high-energy diet (HIGH) for 6 weeks before the predicted parturition. Microarrary was conducted for liver samples at 8 d prior to the predicted parturition (-8 d) and 1 d and 9 d after the actual parturition (1 d and 9 d).
