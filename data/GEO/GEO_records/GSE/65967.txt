TITLE
Gene expression profiling of MDA-MB-468 cells following p53-R273H mutant knock-down

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 58 genes were up-regulated ( > 1.5 fold-change) while 117 genes were down-regulated

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed in duplicate as follows: MDA-MB-468 cells were transduced with lentiviral shRNA targeting endogenous p53-R273H mutant (p53si-1)or a non-targeting shRNA (NS). Total RNA from cells was extracted using Qiagen RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturersâ€™ protocol. RNA purity was examined by spectrophotometric determination at 260/280 nm. The microarray hybridizations were carried out using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
