TITLE
TCR affinity-dependent functional inhibition via PD-1 and SHP-1 phosphatase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate gene expression changes associated with stimulation of TCRs of different affinity, primary CD8 T cells were transduced with sequence optimized TCRs of various affinities and stimulated for 6h.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured at baseline (0h) and after 6h after stimulation with low dose NY-ESO-1 multimer
