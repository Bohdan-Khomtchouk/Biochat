TITLE
Global transcriptomic profiling of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-mediated neuronal injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) is a cellular phenomenon consistently observed upon occurrence of ischemic stroke which eventually results in neuronal death. Neuronal cell death after ischemia takes place via two distinct processes, necrosis and apoptosis. Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is denoted by chromatin condensation, nuclear blebbing, cellular shrinkage, and DNA fragmentation. Unlike apoptosis, cellular swelling and lysis is suggestive of necrosis. However, these two processes are related not only to the severity but also to the duration of ischemia.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was carried out using 20 Illumina mouse Ref8V1.1 genechip arrays. The assignment of the arrays was as follows: Controls (n=5); exposure to OGD for 10min, 5h, 8h, 15h and 24 h (n=3 respectively).
