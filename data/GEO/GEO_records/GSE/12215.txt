SUMMARY
Employing MCT-1 oncogene mediated transformation of immortalized breast epithelial MCF10A cells; we characterized the largely reciprocal association of these two RBPs with target mRNAs and their influence on protein expression vis-Ã -vis cellular transformation.  Using a ribonomics approach, we identified mRNAs from cancer-related pathways whose association with AUF1 and/or HuR were altered when comparing immortalized with transformed MCF10A cells. Significantly, we were able to demonstrate that knockdown of HuR expression using RNA interference, reduced anchorage-independent growth capacity in transformed MCF10A cells as well as decreased protein expression of a number of validated target genes. Our data demonstrate that the global alterations in binding of HuR and AUF1 with target transcripts have a critical role in post-transcriptional regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in breast epithelial cell transformation.
