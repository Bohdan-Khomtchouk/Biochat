TITLE
THP-1 human monocytes Transcriptome following exposure to S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further study the transcriptome of THP-1 human monocytes after exposure to of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), we investigate whole genome microarray expression to identify genes regulated by exposure to GSNO (1.4 or 6 µM).

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression in THP-1 cells incubated without (control) or with (1.4 or 6 µM) of GSNO for 4 h were measured. Four biological replicates were performed as controls: C1; C2; C3; C4. Four biological replicates were performed in 1,4 or 6 µM GSNO-exposed cells: G1; G2; G3; G4 and G5; G6; G7; G8; respectively.
