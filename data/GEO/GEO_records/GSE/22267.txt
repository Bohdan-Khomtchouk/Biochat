TITLE
JNK3 null vs. wild type hippocampi

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
JNK is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and there are three genes that encode for JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 respectively. JNK3 is mainly expressed in the central nervous system and it plays a crucial role in neuronal death in several neurodegenerative diseases, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease. By contrast, the isoforms JNK1 and JNK2 seem to be involved in brain development. The lack of Jnk3 gene confers neuroprotection, although the specific mechanism underlying this has yet to be elucidated. The present study analyze the gene expression profiling in mice lacking Jnk3, comparing them to wild-type mice. The microarray analysis showed that 22 genes are differentially expressed in Jnk3 null mice. Of these we focused in pik3cb, since it is directly related to the pro-survival PI3K/AKT pathway. Results from Jnk3 null mice showed an increase in pik3cb transcript, together with an increase in PI3K activity and hyperphosphorylation of AKT. By contrast, these changes were not observed in Jnk1 null mice, indicating that activation of PI3K/AKT pathway is specifically related to the lack of JNK3. The data obtained in this study demonstrates activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in Jnk3 null mice through the increase of pik3cb transcript.

DESIGN
We performed arrays from Jnk3 null mice respect wilde-type mice. For each experiment (sample) a RNA pool from hippocampus form three different mice were used. Moreover, a second independent hybridization were done with new sample of RNA (sample 2). The genes differentially expressed were determined based on the results from both samples.
