TITLE
ALKBH5 is a New Mammalian Nuclear RNA Demethylase that Affects RNA Metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify ALKBH5-binding RNA, PAR-CLIP was performed to pull down ALKBH5-binding RNAs. After digestion with Rnase T1, small RNA-seq was performed. Through analysis of 50 million reads, we have found 933 ALKBH5-binding genes, among which mRNA accounts for 85%. further analysis revealed that ALKBH5 mainly binds to intron and exon region of mRNAs. among 933 genes,64 genes have been reported to be spermatogenesis related, and most of them are functionally related with p53 signaling. we have also found 9 consensus binding motifs based on the clusters significantly detected in RIP sample.

DESIGN
There are two samples, RIP and CON. RIP sample is the RNA product specifically immunoprecipitated by ALKBH5 antibody, while CON means RNA product nonspecifically bound by IgG and protein A-sepharose 4B。
