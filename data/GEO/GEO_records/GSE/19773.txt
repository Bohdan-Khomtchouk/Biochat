TITLE
DNA methylation in progenitor cells: expression study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We surveyed DNA methylation profiles of all human RefSeq promoters in relation to gene expression and differentiation in adipose tissue, bone marrow and muscle mesenchymal progenitors, as well as in bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors. We unravel strongly overlapping DNA methylation profiles between adipose stem cells (ASCs), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and muscle progenitor cells (MPCs), while hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) are more epigenetically distant from MSCs seen as a whole. Differentiation resolves a fraction of methylation patterns common to MSCs, generating epigenetic divergence.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from MSCs isolated from various tissues and from differentiated cells, and hybridized onto Illumina expression arrays. 2-3 replicates per cell type. The supplementary file 'GSE19773_non-normalized.txt' contains the non-normalized data for Samples GSM493884-GSM493894.
