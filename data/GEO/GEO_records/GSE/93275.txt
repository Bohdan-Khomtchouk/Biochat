TITLE
Specificity of Pitx3-Dependent Gene Regulatory Networks in Subsets of Midbrain Dopamine Neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global binding patterns of Pitx3 on genomic DNA of human dopaminergic cells revealed that Pitx3 is often co-recruited to regions that foster the formation of GATA-bHLH-BRN complexes, which usually involve Lmo co-regulatory proteins

DESIGN
ChIP assay followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq)

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
