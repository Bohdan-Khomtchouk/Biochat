TITLE
Yeast response to TFM exposure: time course

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used for a global investigation of the cellular effects of acute 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) exposure on Saccharomyces cerevisiae over time. TFM is used to control sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) populations in the Lake Champlain and Great Lakes regions. Little is known about the changes in gene expression due to TFM exposure so this time course microarray study was performed to reveal significantly altered patterns of gene expression when yeast cultures were exposed to 0.05mM TFM over four hours.

DESIGN
Cultures of BY4741 yeast were grown in non-fermentable yeast peptone glycerol ethanol (YPGE) media at 30°C to saturation and treated for 1, 2, or 4 hours with 2% isopropanol (untreated) or 0.05mM TFM (treated). Samples taken immediately before treatment represented “time zero” samples. For each treatment and time point, two independent RNA samples were isolated (except at 2h for untreated yeast due to poor RNA quality of one of the samples).
