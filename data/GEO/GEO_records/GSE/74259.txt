TITLE
Yeast response to TFM exposure: time course

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used for a global investigation of the cellular effects of acute 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) exposure on Saccharomyces cerevisiae over time. TFM is used to control sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) populations in the Lake Champlain and Great Lakes regions. Little is known about the changes in gene expression due to TFM exposure so this time course microarray study was performed to reveal significantly altered patterns of gene expression when yeast cultures were exposed to 0.05mM TFM over four hours.
