TITLE
Genome wide methylation profliling of ETMR tumours.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal, ETMR and PNET tumours

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from 12 ETMR, 28 PNET and 34 control samples hybridised to the Illumina 450k Human Methylation Beadchip Please note that three of the 12 EMTR samples are tumor, cell line and xenograft sample derived from a single patient. Thus, there are 10 ETMR patients, 12 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
