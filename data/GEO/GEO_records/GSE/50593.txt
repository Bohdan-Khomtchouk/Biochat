TITLE
Coordinated genomic control of ciliogenesis and cell movement by Rfx2

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
We have performed a systems-level analysis of the RFX/Daf-19 family transcription factor, Rfx2. Using a combination of high-throughput sequencing of Rfx2-regulated transcripts and chromosomal binding sites, we provide a comprehensive accounting of the target genes by which Rfx2 controls ciliogenesis and cilia beating in vertebrates.

DESIGN
RNA-seq: two biological replicates for control and RFX2 knockdown by morpholino injection, ChIP-seq: RFX2-GFP pulldown with GFP antibody, GFP only expression used as control

PLATFORM
GPL17682 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Xenopus laevis)
