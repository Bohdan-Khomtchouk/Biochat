TITLE
Somatic Promoter Landscape of Primary Gastric Adenocarcinoma Delineated by Epigenomic Profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Regulatory elements in cancer remain poorly characterized in primary solid tumors. Here we applied microscale histone modification profiling to delineate the landscape of somatic promoters and enhancers in primary gastric adenocarcinoma, analyzing 94 epigenomic  profiles of primary tumors, normal tissues, and cell lines

DESIGN
14 gastric cancer tumor (T) normal (N) pairs and 14 GC lines are profiled in multiple number of chromatin marks

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens) GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
