TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Runx3 bound regions in splenic NK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq was conducted using freshly isolated (resting) splenic WT NK cells with anti-Runx3 antibody (Ab), anti-H3K4me1 Ab and non-immune serum (NIS) as control.

DESIGN
Runx3 and H3K4me1 IP from splenic NK cells isolated by negative selection using NK cell isolation kit (R & D) followed by sorting of NKp46+ cells.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
