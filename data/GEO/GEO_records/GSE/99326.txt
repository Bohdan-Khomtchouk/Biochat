TITLE
Expression data from differentiated macrophages-Various conditions-PMA only stimulated, 1 min and 3 min plasma stimulated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Macrophage polarization factors to direct digit number and identity in the treated macrophages. We have characterized the macrophage-dependent regulatory genes network through a combination of whole genome RNA sequencing and transcriptional profiling in the phorbol and non-thermal plasma treated THP-1 monocytes. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from differentiated macrophages (THP-1) using a very lose doses of non-thermal plasma, as well as THP-1 which were treated only with phorbol (PMA). These data are used to obtain genes that are differentially expressed in response to macrophage polarization by plasma treatments.

DESIGN
4 total samples were analyzed. We generated the following comparisons: con1 vs. cont2, 1min vs. cont2; 3min vs. cont2. Genes with a fold-change â‰¥2 were selected.
