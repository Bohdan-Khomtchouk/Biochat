TITLE
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) : AK156230 knockdown cells vs control cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNAs expression profile of  MEFs comparing AK156230 knockdown cells with control cells. The microarray with coverage of 45038 mouse mRNAs.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, AK156230 knockdown MEFs and control MEFs were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
