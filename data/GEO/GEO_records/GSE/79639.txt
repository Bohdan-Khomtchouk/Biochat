TITLE
Loss of CREBBP results in H3K27ac loss at enhancers in lymphoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KD of CREBBP at lymphoma cell line, MD901, results in reduced H3K27ac enrichment at a subset of promoters and enhancers.

DESIGN
Genome-wide H3K27Ac ChIPseq binding sites in human cell line MD901 (CREBBP wild type) with shCREBBP (11027 and 3752) and scramble control.
