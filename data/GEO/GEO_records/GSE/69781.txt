TITLE
Gene expression profiling of E13.5 Eda null embryonic mammary buds

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TNF ligand ectodysplasin-A1 contributes to embryonic mammary gland development. We searched for target genes of the Eda pathway using profiling of genes differentially expressed in Eda-null mammary buds after a short exposure to recombinant Fc-Eda-A1 protein.

DESIGN
Microdissected E13.5 Eda-/- epithelial mammary buds from 5-6 embryos were pooled together. Other half of an embryo was used as a control and the other half as a treated sample.  Littermates from 3 litters of B6CBA background were used for the analysis. Array and data analysis were performed in the Biomedicum Functional Genomics Unit (University of Helsinki, Finland).
