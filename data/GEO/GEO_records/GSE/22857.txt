TITLE
FTO: gene expression and function in skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified the target genes of FTO ( " fat mass and obesity associated " ) in primary cultures of human skeletal muscle cells using adenoviral vectors expressing FTO or GFP and oligonucleotide microarrays.

DESIGN
Human myotubes were prepared from 4 different skeletal muscle biopsies. After differentiation, myotubes were infected for 48 hours with recombinant adenovirus expressing either GFP or FTO. Each FTO-infected myotubes culture was compared to GFP-infected myotubes culture. GFP-infected myotubes were regarded as the control. Four biological replicates were processed.
