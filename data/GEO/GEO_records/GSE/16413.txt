TITLE
Gene knock down studies revealed CCDC50 as candidate gene in mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
The two B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) entities chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) show recurrent chromosomal gains of 3q25 q29, 12q13 q14 and 18q21-q22. The pathomechanisms affected by these aberrations are not understood. The aim of this study was to identify genes, located within these gained regions, which control cell death and cell survival of MCL and CLL cancer cells. Blood samples from 24 CLL and 6 MCL patients as well as 6 cell lines representing both malignancies were analyzed by gene expression profiling. By comparison of genomic DNA and gene expression, 72 candidate genes were identified. We performed a limited RNAi screen with these candidates in order to identify genes affecting cell survival. CCDC50, SERPINI2 and SMARCC2 mediated a reduction of cell viability in primary CLL cells as well as in cell lines. Gene knock down and a NFkB reporter gene assay revealed that CCDC50 is required for survival in MCL and CLL cells and controls NFkB signaling.
