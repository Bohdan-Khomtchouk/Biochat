TITLE
Effects of Oltipraz on Gene Expression in the Livers of Wild-Type and Nrf2-null Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oltipraz is an activator of Nrf2 but is also an activator of other pathways including those mediated by constitutive activated receptor (CAR).  To identify genes regulated by oltipraz that were Nrf2-dependent, we compared gene expression after exposure in wild-type and Nrf2-null mice.

DESIGN
Wild-type or Nrf2-null mice were treated each day for 4 days with 75 mg/kg/day/day oltipraz in corn oil or corn oil alone.  There were 4 biological replicates used for each of the 4 genotype-treatment groups.  Gene expression in the livers of the mice was evaluated using Affymetrix mouse exon arrays (MoEx-1_0-st-v1).
