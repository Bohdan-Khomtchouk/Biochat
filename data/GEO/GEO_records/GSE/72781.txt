TITLE
GGTase-Iβ deletion in Intestinal Epithelial Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prenylation is a post-translational modification of proteins consisting on the attachment of a lipid residue (isoprenoid). GGTase-I is one of the prenyltransferases catalyzing prenylation. Using mice with an inducible intestinal epihtelial cell specific deletion of GGTase-Iβ we analyzed the impact of geranylgeranylation within intestinal epithelium.

DESIGN
Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from 3 control mice and 3 mice with a codnitional deletion of GGTase-Iβ in Intestinal Epithelial Cells. RNA was isolated and subjected to Affymetrix gene chip analysis
