TITLE
Chronic viral infection of naive, effector, memory and exhausted virus-specific CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD8 T cells normally differentiate from resting na√Øve T cells into function effector and then memory CD8 T cells following acute infections.  During chronic viral infections, however, virus-specific CD8 T cells often become exhausted.  We used microarrays to examine the gene expression differences between naive, effector, memory and exhausted virus-specific CD8 T cells following lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. Keywords: infection response

DESIGN
Three or four independent samples were sorted by flow cytometry for each cell type (naive, effector, memory and exhausted) virus-specific CD8 T cells.  RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
