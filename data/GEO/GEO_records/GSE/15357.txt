TITLE
Molecular characterization of hybridoma subclones spontaneously switching at high frequencies in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This is a comparative microarray analysis of  36-65 hybridomas switching at normal low frequencies in vitro vs. selected variants spontaneously switching at 100 fold higher frequencies in vitro. This analysis reveals differential gene expression of 2091 unique probe sets, 1637 of them corresponded to known genes (647 of which were up-regulated and 990 down-regulated in the variants spontaneously switching at higher frequencies), including genes known to be involved in regular class switching (such as Cd40, Lig4, H2afx,Ung, Xrcc4, Tcfe2a, Id2, Apex1, Bcl6 and Prdm1) as well as genes involved in processes known to be necessary for regular class switch recombination (CSR), such as transcription, response to DNA damage and DNA repair, DNA binding, chromatin modifications, etc.

DESIGN
Two subclones of each hybridoma switching at low (L) and high (H) frequencies were analyzed.
