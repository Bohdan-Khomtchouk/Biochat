TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin binding site for Mdm2.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The MDM2 oncoprotein is an essential component of the p53 pathway. Although MDM2 has been widely described as a major negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, growing evidences support the notion that Mdm2 functions are also mediated through p53 independent mechanisms. We found that MDM2 is recruited on chromatin. By ChIP-Seq (using MDM2 antibody) of H1299 cells exhibiting MDM2 recruitment on chromatin, we identified at the whole genome level MDM2 binding sites. Both input and IPped-DNA were exhaustively sequenced and mapped on human genome
