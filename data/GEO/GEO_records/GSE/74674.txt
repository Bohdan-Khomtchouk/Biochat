TITLE
Screen mRNAs specifically regulated by mTORC1 in colon epithelial cells from mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To screen mRNAs specifically regulated by mTORC1, a global mRNA expression profile in colon epithelial cells (CECs) from mice with or without CECs-specific TSC1 knockout (KO)  was developed using microarray.

DESIGN
Wile-type or CECs-specific TSC1 KO mice with experimental colitis were sacrificed, with CECs harvested and subjected to total RNA extraction.
