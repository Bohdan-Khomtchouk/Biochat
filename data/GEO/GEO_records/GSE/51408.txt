TITLE
Expression microarray screen for genes regulated by the unliganded glucocorticoid receptor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further characterize the role of the unliganded glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in breast cells, we used an shRNA vector directed against GR to create EPH-4 mouse mammary cell lines with depleted endogenous levels of this receptor. RNA prepared from normal (EV-50) and GR-depleted (shGR-19) cells was used in an expression microarray screen for targets of unliganded GR. This analysis revealed 260 targets of negaive regulation by unliganded GR, and 343 targets of positive regulation by unliganded GR, several of which were involved in pro-apoptotic networks, and opposed the activity of liganded GR targets. This work presents the first screen for targets of unliganded GR. We propose that the balance between liganded and unliganded GR signaling is responsible for controlling differentiation and apoptosis, respectively, and suggest that gene regulation by unliganded GR may represent a mechanism of reducing the risk of breast tumourigenesis.

DESIGN
RNA was prepared from EV-50 and shGR-19 cells and RNA integrity was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA was hybridized to the array in duplicate. The duplicates of each EV-50 and shGR-19 were averaged, and the shGR-19 data was subsequently compared to the EV-50 data.
