TITLE
Reproductive aging: fem-1 day 3 oocyte vs fem-1 day 8 oocyte

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To find genes in C. elegans oocytes associated with reproductive aging.

DESIGN
Five replicates comparing RNA from oocyte samples collected from day 3 fem-1(hc17) animals with RNA from oocyte samples collected from day 8 fem-1(hc17) animals. Three out of five are dye-flipped.
