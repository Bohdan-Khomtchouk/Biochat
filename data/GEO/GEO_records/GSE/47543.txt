TITLE
The physicochemistry of capped nanosilver predicts it biological activity in brain endothelial (RBEC4) cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study uses the RBEC4 cell model to examine if nanosilver of different sizes (10nm and 75nm) and cappings (citrate and polyvinylpyrrolidone(PVP)) affect its cellular permeability and genomic response.

DESIGN
RBEC4 cells (95% confluent) were screeened for changes in gene expression after 18 hour exposure to 1.0 ppm of PVP or citrate coated nanosilver particles at 10 or 75 nanometer sizes.  Analysis indicated that the cellular transcription profile alter by nanosilver 10nm+PVP was distinct from it 75nm counterpart and both sizes of citrate-coated particles.
