SUMMARY
We retrospectively analyzed AML patients enrolled in the AIEOP since 2000, 42 patients with 11q23 rearrangement were analyzed by gene expression profile Gene expression analyses were performed to compare AML MLL partner genes (AF9, AF10, AF6, ENL, ELL, Septin 6, and AF1q) Keywords: Expression data

DESIGN
Class comparison between different AML MLL partner genes
