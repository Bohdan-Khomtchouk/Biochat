TITLE
ATP effect on Arabidopsis roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Extracellular adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) is a signaling molecule. To define the global transcriptional response to ATP, we performed DNA microarray analysis using RNA derived from wild-type (Col-0) Arabidopsis and the dorn1-1 mutant, Lectin receptor kinase I.9 (At5g60300) carrying a EMS point mutation, seedlings after 100 μM ATP.

DESIGN
12 samples ( 2 genotypes, 2 treatments, 3 biological replicates)
