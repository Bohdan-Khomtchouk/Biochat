TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of human embryonic stem cells, fibroblast iPSC, and low passage stromal primed myeloid iPSC before and after conversion to the naïve state

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of human embryonic stem cells, fibroblast iPSC, and low passage stromal primed myeloid iPSC before and after conversion to the naïve state

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from indicated donor cells, hESC, or iPSC. Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchips were used for all analyses in this series. A single sample of each cell line was used for this analysis.
