TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of Propionibacterium acidipropionici with different PA tolerance and production

ORGANISM
Acidipropionibacterium acidipropionici

SUMMARY
We reported that analysis of acid tolerance mechanism in Propionibacterium acidipropionici at gene expression level. Genome shuffling was performed on P. acidipropionici to improve the acid tolerance of the strain. Wild type strain P. acidipropionici CGMCC 1.2230 and acid-tolerant mutant P. acidipropionici WSH1105 were compared to find key genes involved in acid tolerance of P. acidipropionici during fermentation. Results provide important information on acid response of P. acidipropionici, such as genes encoded ABC-transporters, proteins involved in amino acids metabolism and propionic acid synthesis.

DESIGN
The mRNA of wild type (1.2230) and acid-tolerant mutant (WSH1105) strains, collected exponential growth phase under pH 7.0 and 5.5, were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Miseq.
