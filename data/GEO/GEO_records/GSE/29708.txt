TITLE
The RING-containing protein, JMJ24 mono-ubiquitinates RDR2 to coordinate histone methylation and DNA methylation in Arabidopsis.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
JMJ24 is  a RING motif containing Jumonji protein, whose E3 ligase activity is essential for communication between histone methylation and DNA methylation.In Arabidopsis JMJ24 is higly expressed in mature pollen. JMJ24 interacted with RDR2 and a single C4HC3 RING motif enabled JMJ24 to mono-ubiquitinate RDR2 for stabilization. RDR2 acted downsteam of JMJ24 for DNA methylation and local silencing. Here we performed tiling-array-based transcriptome profiling using mature pollen collected from WT and jmj24-1 and  found that hundreds of loci encoding transposon elements, noncoding RNAs and protein-coding genes are regulated by JMJ24.

DESIGN
WT vs. jmj24-1
