TITLE
Histone acetylation in wild-type and SET2 deletion yeast strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
ChIP-on chip assays to measure the change in histone acetylation over the yeast genome, in a SET2 deleted strain compared to the wild-type control. ChIPs of H3K9ac, H3K56ac and H4K12ac  from wild-type and SET2 deleted cells were normalized to the H3 enrichment.

DESIGN
Two color experiment. SET2 deletion vs. WT cells. Biological replicates=3 per IP per cell type.

PLATFORM
GPL10930 Agilent-014810 Yeast Whole Genome ChIP-on-Chip Microarray 4x44K (G4493A) [Probe Name version]
