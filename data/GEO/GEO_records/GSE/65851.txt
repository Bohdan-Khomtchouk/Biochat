TITLE
Beta Amyloid toxicity in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer's disease

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transgenic animals were engineered to express human amyloid peptide controlled by a muscle-specific, heat-inducible promoter. At low temperatures (16째C) Abeta expression is minimal, while at higher temperatures (20-25째C) Abeta accummulates in large quantities and causes paralysis. GFP- and GFP::degron (a toxic aggregating GFP mutant)-expressing animals were used as controls.

DESIGN
Animals were grown at 16째C till early 3rd larval stage and then upshifted to 25째C. Animals were harvested at the time of upshift (T0), and every 4 hours later until 20 hours postupshift (T4-T20).
