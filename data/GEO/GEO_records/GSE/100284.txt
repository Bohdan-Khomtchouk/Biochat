TITLE
Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling of 152 pediatric AML patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide CpG-island methylation profiling on pediatric AML samples was performed to identify specific methylation patterns discriminating particular AML subgroups from the rest of AML samples based on the methylation profile.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from pediatric AML material representing different cytogenetic subgroups was used: inv(16)(p13;q22) (CBFB-MYH11), MLL-rearrangement, t(8;21)(q22;q22) (RUNX1-RUNX1T1), t(15;17)(q24;q21) (PML-RARA), t(8;16)(p11;p13) (KAT6A-CREBBP), t(5;11)(q35;p15.5) (NUP98-NSD1) or C/EPBα (double mutation) and NPM1 mutations and CN AMLs. AML samples were enriched for  ≥80% leukemic cells.
