TITLE
very moderate exercise training; variations in stress and toxicity gene expression in rat hearts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Array analysis of a set of 96 stress and toxicity genes was carried out in left ventricular cardiomyocytes from 8 control and 7 trained rats. The training protocol was very gradual and mild. Animals were sacrificed 48 hrs after the last training session in order to evaluate gene expression during the " second window of cardioprotection " . Array results were validated by Real Time PCR of selected genes and Western Blot analysis of selected proteins. Plasma MDA and resistance to ischemia/reperfusion were evaluated as well. A total of 11 genes were found to be upregulated by moderate exercise, 3 to be downregulated. MDA was found to be increased in plasma of trained rats. Myocardial resistance to ischemia-reperfusion was found to be improved in trained rats with respect to controls. Results suggest that such a pattern of mild training does at the same time elicit stress responses, but also the upregulation of a number of defensive genes, that are likely to constitute the core of the adaptive mechanisms. Keywords: exercise training-related stress response and cardioprotection
