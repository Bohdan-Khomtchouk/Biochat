TITLE
Genome-wide location analysis of  BMP (SMAD1) in mouse erythroid progenitors co-occupted with lineage specific regulators (GATA1, GATA2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lineage regulators direct BMP and Wnt pathways to cell-specific programs during differentiation and regeneration

DESIGN
Mouse G1E or G1ER cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 20 min. DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. A sample of whole cell extract (WCE) was sequenced and used as the background to determine enrichment. ChIP was performed using an antibody against total Smad1 (Santa Cruz SC-7965), Gata1 (Santa Cruz SC-265), or Gata2 (Santa Cruz SC-9008).  This represents the Mouse ChIP-seq portion of this dataset.
