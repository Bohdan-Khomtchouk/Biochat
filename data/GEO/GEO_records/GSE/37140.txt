TITLE
SRL1 encodes a putative GPI-anchored protein and modulates rice leaf rolling by regulating the differentiation of bulliform cells

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To identify genes involved in the differentiation of bulliform cells,  genome-wide analysis of gene expression profiles was performed in cells to be differentiated into bulliform cells in srl1-1 but epidermal cells in Nip.

DESIGN
The seedlings of Nip and srl1-1 were fixed at 5 DAG (day after germination), and cells to be differentiated into bulliform cells in srl1-1 but epidermal cells in Nip were isolated by LCM (laser capture microdissection). Then total RNA were extracted from two independent biological replicates.
