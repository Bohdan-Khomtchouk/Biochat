TITLE
Expression data from Rheumatoid Arthritis synovial tissue samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex and clinically heterogeneous autoimmune disease. Microarray analysis of 83 synovial samples provides insight into the expression-level differences between patients at the site of disease activity.

DESIGN
Synovial samples from Rheumatoid Arthritis patients were obtained during joint resection and profiled using microarrays.
