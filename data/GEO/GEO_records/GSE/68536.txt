TITLE
H3K27me3 profiles along the length of the  X chromosome in trophoblast stem (TS) cells showing inverted X-inactivation profiles, ChIP-chip

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This analysis includes H3K27me3 profiles along the length of the X-chromosome in male (F2) and female (F3) TS cells and in female TS cells showing a complete reversal of X-chromosome inactivation (F3 clone1#A).

DESIGN
Analysis of H3K27me3 profiles in three different cell populations. Two independent biological replicates for each cell population are provided. The array includes approx. 162,5 Mb of the X chromosome and approx. 14,6 Mb of chromosome 17 as a control.

PLATFORM
