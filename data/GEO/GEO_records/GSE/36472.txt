TITLE
Whole blood-derived miRNA signatures in mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To profile the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the whole blood of mice in exposure to intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. C57BL/6 mice which received intraperitoneal injections of different concentration (ranged from 10 to 1000 μg) of LPS originated from different bacteria, including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and Serratia marcescens were sacrificed at indicated survival times (2, 6, 24, and 72 h) following LPS injection. The whole blood was drawn and the tissues including lung, brain, liver and spleen were harvested for miRNAs expression analysis with miRNA array (Phalanx Mouse & Rat miRNA OneArray® 1.0). These differentially expressed miRNAs were applied for hierarchical cluster analysis using average linkage and Pearson correlation as a measure of similarity.

DESIGN
lung, brain, liver, spleen, blood in experiment mice exposed to 100 ug lipopolysaccharide or control mice exposed to PBS solution were harvested 6 h later (n=3 in each specimens, total 5(tissues)*3(n=3)*2(experiment vs control)=30 arrays were used)
