TITLE
Expression profiles of OE (Overexpression of ANAC069) plants and KO (Knockout of ANAC069, SALK_095231C) plants under salt stress conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify the target genes regulated by ANAC069, the expression profiles of OE (Overexpression of ANAC069) plants and KO (Knockout of ANAC069, SALK_095231C) plants under salt stress conditions were compared using Affymetrix Arabidopsis gene chips.

DESIGN
Four-week-old OE (OE-3 line) and KO (KO-2 line) plants were treated with 200 mM NaCl for 3 h. Then gene expression in OE and KO plants was compared using Affymetrix Arabidopsis gene chips (ATH1 Genome Array), performed with three independent biological replicates.
