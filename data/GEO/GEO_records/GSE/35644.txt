TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the role of FOG-1 in GATA-1 chromatin occupancy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report ChIP-Seq data for GATA-1 and the FOG-binding mutant of GATA-1 (GATA-1^V205G) in G1ME cells, a Gata1-null cell line with both erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation potential.  We introduced HA-tagged GATA-1 or V205G into G1ME cells via retroviral transduction.  The cells were crosslinked at 48h post-transduction, and an HA antibody was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).  ChIP and input samples were sequenced on Illumina GAII high-throughput sequencer.  The data reveal GATA-1-specific and V205G-specific bidning sites, indicating that FOG-1 both faacilitates and prohibits GATA-1 chromatin occupancy in a context-dependent manner.

DESIGN
Examinaton of chromatin occupancy of GATA-1 anda FOG-binding mutant of GATA-1 in G1ME cells cultured in TPO.
