TITLE
Molecular signatures in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Molecular signatures to improve diagnosis in PTCL and prognostication in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). Gene expression profiling of PTCL patient samples was performed to investigate whether molecular signatures can be used to identify distinct entities of PTCL.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed  on PTCL and natural-killer cell lymphoma (NKCL) to define molecular classifiers for the more common entities of PTCL, to identify unique entities within PTCL-U, to elucidate unique tumor and microenvironmental interactions and oncogenic pathways in AITL, and to construct a molecular prognosticator for AITL.
