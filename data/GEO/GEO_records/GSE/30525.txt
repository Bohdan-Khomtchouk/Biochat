TITLE
miRNA-29 regulation of gene expression in helper T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify genes regulated by miRNA-29 in helper T cells. We compared gene expression in miRNA-deficient helper T cells (DGCR8-deficient) transfected with miR-29b versus control miRNA.  We also compared gene expression in wildtype helper T cells transfected with miR-29 inhibitor to cells transfected with control inhibitor

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of each genotype (DGCR8-deficient or Wildtype C57BL/6 mice), with 2 conditions per genotype for 12 samples total. Cells from each DGCR8-deficient mouse were transfected with either miR-29b or control miRNA and cells from wildtype mice were transfected with either miR-29 inhibitors or control inhibitors
