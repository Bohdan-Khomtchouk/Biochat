TITLE
Whole transcriptome analysis of sinonasal sarcoma with translocation t(2;4)(q37.1;q31.3)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Conventioal cytogenetic on 2 sinonasal sarcoma (SNS) cases showed t(2;4)(q37.1;q31.3) translocation previously. The aim of this whole transcriptome analysis is to determine potential candidate genes involved in this translocation.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from frozen cultured primary tumor cells from a SNS characterized at the cytogenetics level was subjected to Illumina whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing anslysis.
