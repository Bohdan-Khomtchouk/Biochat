TITLE
Expression data from inducible ES stable cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of the induction of the gene of interest on the mouse ES transcriptome, we performed Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridization experiments for the different inducible cell lines Transcriptome analysis of the inducible transgenic mouse ES cell lines

DESIGN
For the analysis on the different inducible cell lines, total RNA was extracted from three biological replicates grown in medium deprived of Tetracycline for 17 and 24 hours; RNA extracted from un-induced clones was used as control. Total RNA extracted from parental cell line EBRTcH3 (EB3) was used as additional control.
