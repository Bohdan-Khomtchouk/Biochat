TITLE
Mucosal miRNA expression profiling in (un)inflamed colon of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated if miRNA expression in UC mucosa is altered and correlated our findings with mucosal mRNA expression. Integration of mRNA and miRNA expression profiling may allow the identification of functional links between dysregulated miRNAs and their predicted target mRNA.

DESIGN
Colonic mucosal biopsies were obtained during endoscopy from 17 UC (10 active and 7 inactive) patients and 10 normal controls. Total RNA, including small RNA, was isolated from colonic mucosal biopsies, labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix Genechip miRNA 2.0 Arrays.
