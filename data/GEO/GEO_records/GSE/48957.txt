TITLE
Mucosal miRNA expression profiling in (un)inflamed colon of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated if miRNA expression in UC mucosa is altered and correlated our findings with mucosal mRNA expression. Integration of mRNA and miRNA expression profiling may allow the identification of functional links between dysregulated miRNAs and their predicted target mRNA.
