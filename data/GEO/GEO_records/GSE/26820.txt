TITLE
Expression data from GFAP-negative LC cells exposed to 24 hours of hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Vascular hypoperfusion is a pathological phenomenon in the glaucomatous optic nerve head. We report transcriptional responses in GFAP-negative LC cells exposed to in-vitro hypoxic stress (1%O2).

DESIGN
The study design was as follows: For GSM659595: " human donor 1 " LC cells were passaged into three p100 plates of cells and then exposed to normoxia for 24 hours. The RNA from each of these three plates was then extracted, pooled and hybridised to the microarray " normoxia_1 " . For GSM659592: " human donor 1 " LC cells were passaged into three p100 plates of cells and then exposed to hypoxia for 24 hours. The RNA from each of these three plates was then extracted, pooled and hybridised to the microarray " hypoxia_1 " . " hypoxia_1 " and " normoxia_1 " microarray data were then compared to calculate differential gene expression in response to hypoxia. This experiment (same design) was then conducted a second and third time using biologically independent " human donor 2 " and " human donor 3 " cell lines respectively.
