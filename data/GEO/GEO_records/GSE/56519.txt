TITLE
Alterations in gene expression following knockdown of thioredoxin 1 (TR1) with stable viral transduction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment was to determine if we could observe changes in gene expression following the attenuation of one of the primary redox regulators of cells - thioredoxin reductase 1. The experiment was set up with two cell lines that expressed different basal levels of TR1. LOX cells represent an aggressive melanoma in xenograft models and are high expressors of TR1 while SK Mel-28 cells represent a non-aggressive melanoma in xenografts adn are low expressors of TR1.

DESIGN
The experimental design was to set up direct comparisons for melanoma cells with the induction of a control miRNA or the miRNA directed against TR1 - with an evaluation of the uninduced situation. Melanoma cell lines stabily transfected with tetracyclin-inducible microRNA - directed at either control, or to TR1.
