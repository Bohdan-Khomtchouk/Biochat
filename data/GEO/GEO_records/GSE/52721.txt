TITLE
Effects of O-GlcNAc modification on gene expression using O-GlcNAcase deleted Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single O-GlcNAc modification orchestrate by O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA alias MGEA5) enzymes, affects signal transduction and gene expression by chromatin modulation. We developed Oga deleted MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblast) cells to investigate effects of O-GlcNAc modification in mice. RNA isolated from Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast cells generated from Oga Knock out (KO) Heterozygous (Het) and wild type (WT) cells and subjected to microarray analysis. Results provide insight into regulatory pattern of O-GlcNAc modification, and associated signaling pathways

DESIGN
Conditionally deleted Oga heterozygous mice (Oga +/-) were derived by crossing Oga floxed male mouse (Oga floxed/+  in genetic background C57B1/6)  with the MMTV-cre female mouse (B6129-Tgn(MMTV-Cre)1Mam. Resultant Oga heterozygous mice cross bred and collected MEF cells (mouse embryonic fibroblast) from wild type (WT), Heterozygous (het) and Knock out (KO) embryos at E12.5 dpc. RNA extracted from female MEF cell lines and conducted microarray  analysis in 3 technical replicates.
