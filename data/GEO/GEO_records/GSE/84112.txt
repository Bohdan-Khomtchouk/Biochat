TITLE
Global analysis of selenoprotein expression reveals differential roles for Secisbp2 in UGA redefinition and mRNA stabilization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We describe the effects of knocking out the Secisbp2 and Trsp genes on selenoprotein expression and translation in mouse liver

DESIGN
Livers from wild type mice and mice that were deleted for the Secisbp2 or Sec-tRNA (Trsp) genes (conditional deletion in hepatocytes) were harvested and processed for RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling. RNA-Seq was used to monitor mRNA abundance and ribosome profiling was used to monitor translation initiation and UGA-Sec redefinition efficiency.
