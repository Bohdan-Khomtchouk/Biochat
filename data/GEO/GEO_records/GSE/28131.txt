TITLE
Expression Analysis of Trimethyltin Chlorides (TMT) Impact on Embryonic Development

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome expression pattern of 60 and 72 hours post fertilization Danio Rerio embryos exposed to TMT and vehicle control

DESIGN
Embryos were exposed to 10uM TMT or control from 48hpf to 60 or 72 hpf. Three replicates were collected for each time point. 40 embryos were pooled to comprise a replicate.
