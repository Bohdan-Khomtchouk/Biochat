TITLE
Gene expression profiling of TGF-B/PDGF-induced CAF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have found aerobic glycolysis is increased in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). To explore the mechanism by which glucolysis was switched from oxidative phosphorylation, two in vitro CAF models were successfully established. To screen genes potentially regulate aerobic glysolysis, we analyzed gene expression profiling of CAF, and compared with control fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Primary fibroblasts separately treated with PDGF or TGF-B for 96 hours to induce CAF formation, control fibroblast were treated with 1% BSA. mRNA profiling were analyzed by deep sequencing.
