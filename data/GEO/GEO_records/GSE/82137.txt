TITLE
Molecular impact of electronic cigarette aerosol exposure in human bronchial epithelium

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary human bronchial epithelial cells grown in air liquid interface, exposed in vitro to whole tobacco cigarette smoke (48 puffs, 48 minutes) and electronic cigarette aerosol (400 puffs, 200 minutes). Electronic cigarette exposures included two flavors (menthol, tobacco) both with, and without nicotine.

DESIGN
Human bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to whole tobacco cigarette smoke (n=3), Blu e-cig tobacco flavor, no nicotine (n=3), Blu e-cig tobacco flavor, with nicotine (n=3), Blu e-cig menthol flavor, no nicotine (n=3), Blu e-cig menthol flavor, with nicotine (n=3) or air controls (n=3) in a Vitrocell smoking machine and then rested for 24 hours.
