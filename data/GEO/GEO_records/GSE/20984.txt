TITLE
Alternate protein kinase A activity identifies a unique population of stromal cells in adult bone

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the Prkar1a+/- mice when bred with Prkaca+/- genetic backgrounds. Prkar1a+/-Prkaca+/- mice not only continued to develop bone lesions but also demonstrated a significant increase in both the number and the severity of the lesions, as well as a reduction in the age of first appearance of any bone abnormality.  Histological analysis of bone from Prkar1a+/-Prkaca+/- mice showed that lesions had similarity to tumors from humans with CNC and some resemblance (but also differences) from humans and mice with fibrous dysplasia (FD). Prkar1a+/- and Prkar1a+/-Prkaca+/- mouse lesions always involved a particular sub-population of cells that could be identified as belonging to the osteoblastic lineage, that were initially located on the endosteal surface of the periosteum and nearby trabecular bone proximal to the growth plate of the long bones and vertebrae, and resembled bone stromal cells (BSCs). The bone lesions expressed high level of mesenchymal proteins like n-cadherin, vimentin, snail1, twist1, mmp2 and mmp9 when compared to WT bone. On top of this, bone lesions from  Prkar1a+/-Prkaca+/- mice also showed an increased expression of keratin related genes, which are involved in hair follicle and epithelial differentiation, when compared to lesions from Prkar1a+/- mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from bone lesions from Prkar1a+/- and Prkar1a+/-Prkaca+/- mice were compared to those obtained from WT and Prkaca+/- mice.
