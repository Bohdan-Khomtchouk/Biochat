TITLE
Expression data from human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line SupB15 and its drug resistant subpopulations SupB15-MR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SupB15 cells are highly sensitive to Mitoxantrone treatment. To obtain drug resistant subpopulations, SupB15 cells were incubated in normal medium or BMSC derived conditioned medium, treated with 10nM of Mitoxantrone for 6 days. SupB15 cells in normal medium could not survive. a small population of SupB15 cells in conditioned medium group survived the treatment and ecpanded, termed as SupB15-MR. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array were performed to compare gene expression between SupB15 and SupB15-MR cells
