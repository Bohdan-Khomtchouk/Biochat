TITLE
Warm sensor protein TRPM2 is required for brain development via Î²-catenin in hyperthermia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of gene expression. The goals of this study are to compare the different transcripts between TRPM2 knockdown and control in the neural progenitor cells when the maternal hyperthermia was induced.

DESIGN
Methods: the in utero electroporation was employed to introduce the TRPM2 knockdown or control plasmids into the E13 embryonic cortex. and then the GFP+ neural progenitor cell isolated from E15 mice by using FACS. RNA utilized for global transcriptome analysis were extracted from these GFP+ neural stem cells and sequenced by Hiseq 2500. Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified when we compared Normalized Reads Count between groups with p < 0.05 and |Log2FoldChange| > 1.

PLATFORM
