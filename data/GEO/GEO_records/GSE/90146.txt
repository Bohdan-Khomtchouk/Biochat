TITLE
miRNA expression data in Huh-7 cell line transfected with HBeAg-expression vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The HBeAg is a well-documented risk factor for HCC in epidemiological studies. The biological role of HBeAg in HBV-related HCC remains poorly understood. The HBeAg-mediated differential expression of host miRNAs We used miRNA microarray chips to assess the host cellular miRNA expression profile in response to HBeAg expression in Huh7 cells

DESIGN
The total RNA from Huh-7 cells transfected with control and HBeAg-expression vector was harvested 48 hours post transfection and miRNA profiling was done miRNA-2_0 arrays

PLATFORM
GPL14613 [miRNA-2] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-2 Array
