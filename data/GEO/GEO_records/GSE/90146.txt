TITLE
miRNA expression data in Huh-7 cell line transfected with HBeAg-expression vector

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The HBeAg is a well-documented risk factor for HCC in epidemiological studies. The biological role of HBeAg in HBV-related HCC remains poorly understood. The HBeAg-mediated differential expression of host miRNAs We used miRNA microarray chips to assess the host cellular miRNA expression profile in response to HBeAg expression in Huh7 cells
