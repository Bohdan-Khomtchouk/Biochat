TITLE
Gene expression analysis in TGFbeta/TNFalpha treated A549 spheroid cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGFbeta/TNFalpha treated spheroid A549 cultures are a model of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These experiments capture the changes in global gene expression that result from cells being induced to undergo EMT (3D control vs 3D treated), but also the differences in gene expression when A549 is grown in spheroid cultures (2D control vs 3D untreated). EMT is efficiently induced only in the spheroid culture model.

DESIGN
A total of 8 samples are analyzed, corresponding to 4 conditions (2D control, 2D treated, 3D control, 3D treated) and 2 biological replicates.
