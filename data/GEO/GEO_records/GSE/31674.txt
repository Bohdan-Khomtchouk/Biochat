TITLE
Pinot Noir berry transcriptome during ripening.

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of grapevine cv. Pinot Noir berries during development and ripening. Time-course comparison of samples collected at three developmental stages (stages 33, 34 and 36 according to the modified E-L system, ref: Coombe BG, Aust J Grape Wine Res 1995, 1: 104-110) during three seasons (2003, 2005 and 2006).    Data for each of the three seasons were normalized independently within each season, using gcRMA. PLEXdb ( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Stefania Pilati.  The equivalent experiment is VV11 at PLEXdb.
