TITLE
Identifying gene expression profiles in hypoplastic left heart syndrome and age-matched normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix GeneChip Exon-1.0ST was used to study the differential gene profiles in RV (right ventricle) samples from neonates with HLHS (hypoplastic left heart syndrome) versus RV and LV (left ventricle) samples obtained from age-matched controls. Although few significant changes were observed in the genetic profiles between control LV and control RV, many genes passed the false discovery rate in comparing HLHS-RV to RV and LV control groups, with greater differential profiles noted between HLHS-RV and control RV.

DESIGN
Myocardial samples were isolated from the RV of 6 HLHS neonates, diagnosed based upon clinical features including hypoplasia/atresia of the ascending aorta, various degrees of underdevelopment of the aortic valve, mitral valve, and LV cavity, and retrograde flow in the aortic arch as determined by conventional 2-D echocardiography. The mean gestational age at birth of all subjects was 38 weeks (range 36-39) and the mean body weight at surgery of 2.7 kg (range 2.1-3.4 kg) (3 males, 3 females). All subjects were undergoing stage 1 Norwood reconstruction. Children with HLHS and other complex cardiac anomalies entailing non-HLHS single ventricle circulation were excluded from our study. For control samples, RV and LV myocardial tissue was obtained from 5 newborns aged between 1-28 days (mean 18 days; 3 males and 2 females) with normal cardiac anatomy and expired from non-cardiac diseases processes.
