TITLE
Expression data from MCF7/HER2-18 xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate molecular mechanisms of resistance, we used two different in vivo xenograft models of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, with or without HER2 over-expression (MCF7/HER2-18 and MCF7 wt, respectively). Mice with established tumors were assigned to the following treatment groups: continued estrogen supplementation (E2), estrogen deprivation (ED), ED plus tamoxifen (Tam), all with or without the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefinitinib (G).  Another group received ED plus the antiestrogen fulvestrant (MCF7 wt only). Tumors with acquired or de novo resistance to these endocrine therapies were profiled for mRNA expression using Affymetrix Genechip arrays. Keywords: multiple group comparison
