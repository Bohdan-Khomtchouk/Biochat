TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles Predict Infliximab Treatment Response in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further explore predictors and targets of response to infliximab, differential gene expression was examined at baseline and after 6 and 24 hours and 2 weeks after the first infusion of infliximab in TRD patients who were infliximab responders versus nonresponders, and compared to placebo-treated patients. All subjects were administered either infliximab (5mg/kg, n=30) or placebo (n=30) through an indwelling catheter at the Emory Division of Digestive Diseases at 3 separate time points (baseline, 2 weeks and 6 weeks). Infliximab infusion dosing protocol and scheduling were matched to the standard intravenous induction routine for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

DESIGN
In a recent clinical trial, the TNF antagonist infliximab was found to reduce depressive symptoms compared to placebo but only in patients with increased inflammation as reflected by a CRP > 5 mg/L. To further explore predictors and targets of response to infliximab, differential gene expression was examined at baseline and after 6 and 24 hours and 2 weeks after the first infusion of infliximab in TRD patients who were infliximab responders versus nonresponders, and compared to placebo-treated patients.
