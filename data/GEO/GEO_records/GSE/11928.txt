TITLE
Differential expression of inflammatory and immune response genes in rams experimentally infected with Brucella ovis

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Infection of sheep with Brucella ovis results in ovine brucellosis, a disease characterized by infertility in rams, abortion in ewes and increased perinatal mortality in lambs. During the course of the infection both the ovine immune response and host cell gene expression are modified. The objective of this research was to conduct a preliminary characterization of differential gene expression in rams experimentally infected with B. ovis by microarray hybridization and real-time RT-PCR.
