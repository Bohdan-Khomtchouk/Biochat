TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of high-grade osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide gene expression data of high-grade osteosarcoma samples. In order to detect osteosarcoma drivers, we integrated these data with copy number data. We performed two different methods - a non-paired and a paired integrative analysis.

DESIGN
Genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed on 84 pre-treatment high-grade osteosarcoma diagnostic biopsies, of which 29 overlapped with the 32 samples used for copy number analysis. Two different sets of control samples were used for comparison: osteoblasts (n=3) and mesenchymal stem cells (n=12, GEO accession number GSE28974).
