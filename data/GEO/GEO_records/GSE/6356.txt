TITLE
Characterization of human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum eIF4E homologue and mRNA 5′ cap status

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
The mRNA 5′ cap is normally essential for eukaryotic mRNA translation, stabilization and transport and both the cap and eIF4E are important elements of post-transcriptional gene regulation. To further our understanding of mRNA translation in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, we have investigated the parasite translation initiation factor eIF4E and its interaction with 5′ capped mRNA. We have purified P. falciparum eIF4E as a recombinant protein and demonstrated that it has canonical mRNA 5′ cap binding activity. We used this protein to purify P. falciparum full-length 5′ capped mRNAs from total parasite RNA. Microarray analysis comparing total and eIF4E-purified 5′ capped mRNAs shows that a subset of 34 features were more than two-fold under-represented in the purified RNA sample, including 19 features representative of nuclear transcripts. The uncapped nuclear transcripts may represent a class of mRNAs targeted for storage and cap removal. Keywords: total RNA vs purified capped mRNA
