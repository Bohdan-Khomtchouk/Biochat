TITLE
Expression data from B6C3F1 mice treated with baclofen

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were treated with either 100mg/kg baclofen or 0.5% methylcellulose alone by oral gavage for 1 or 5 days.

DESIGN
Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after either a single dose (1day) or 5 daily doses (5 days) of either baclofen or 0.5% methylcellulose two hours after the last dose. The bone marrow from the right humerus, a portion of the left lateral liver lobe and half a cross-section of the spleen were harvested and the RNA was isolated from these tissues using standard Qiagen reagents. Standard Affymetrix protocols were used for GeneChip probe preparations. 59 arrays.
