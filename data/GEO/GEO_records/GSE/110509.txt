TITLE
Analysis of microRNA expression profiles in exosomes of proximal renal tubular cells in response to oxalate crystal

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The present study aims to compare the miRNA expression profiles in exosomes derived from HK-2 cells treated with 0, 1, 2 mM sodium oxalate, and to explore the roles of different exosomal-miRNAs in the regulation of calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones formation.

DESIGN
microRNA microarray was applied to evaluate the expression of exosomes derived from HK-2 cells exposed to 0, 1, 2 mM sodium oxalate for 48 hours.
