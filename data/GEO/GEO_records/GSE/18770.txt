TITLE
Myeloid progenitor cells lacking p53 exhibit delayed upregulation of Puma, prolonged survival after cytokine deprivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated WT and p53-/- Factor Dependent Myeloid (FDM) cells and found that p53-/- cells were protected against IL-3 withdrawal. A survival advantage was also observed in untransformed p53-/- hematopoietic progenitor cells cultured in the presence or absence of cytokines. Array analysis was perfomed on RNA extracted from WT and p53-/- FDM cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from WT and p53-/- FDM cells cultured in the presence or absence of IL-3

PLATFORM
GPL6105 Illumina mouse-6 v1.1 expression beadchip
