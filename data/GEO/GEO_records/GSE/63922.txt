TITLE
Gene expression changes in Oidiodendron maius- Vaccinium myrtillus mycorrhizal roots compared to Oidiodendron maius free-living mycelium

ORGANISM
Oidiodendron maius

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Oidiodendron maius mycorrhizal roots compared to free-living mycelium . Mycorrhizal roots and control mycelium were harvested after 45 days and used for RNA extraction. Reads of 2X100bp were generated and aligned to Oidiodendron maius transcripts ( http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Oidma1 ) using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Oidiodendron maius mycorrhizal roots and free-living mycelium were generated by paired-end (2x100bp) Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Three biological replicates were sequenced for mycorrhizal and mycelium samples.
