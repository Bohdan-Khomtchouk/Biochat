TITLE
Maskless photolithography genome tiling experiment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to identify transcribed sequences across the human genome, particularly those distinct from previously annotated genes. To measure global transcriptional activity a series of high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays was constructed to represent sense and antisense strands of the entire nonrepetitive sequence of the genome (1.5 Gb). A total of 51,874,388 36mer oligonucleotide probes, positioned every 46 nt on average, were synthesized via maskless photolithography at a feature density of approximately 390,000 probes per slide. The arrays were hybridized to fluorescence-labeled cDNA reverse-transcribed from triple-selected poly (A)+ liver tissue RNA.
