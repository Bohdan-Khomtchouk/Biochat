TITLE
Muscle-released exosomes modulate gene expressions in beta-cells in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exosomes are cell-released bioactive nanovesicles now considered as new partners in the inter-organ cross-talks. The possibility that skeletal muscle (SkM)-derived exosomes act as a mode of systemic communication has been described. Thus, in this study we have tested the hypothesis that through the exosomal route, muscle might transmit specific signals during insulin-resistance.

DESIGN
Methods: Muscle from mice submitted to an high fat diet or a control diet were dissected. These muscles were incubated in media and exosomes released were purified. Exosomes released from high fat diet muscle (EXO-HP)  and from standard diet muscle (EXO-STD) were collected by ultracentrifugation. Then MIN6 (pancreatic cell line) were treated with either EXO-HP or EXO-STD. RNA was extracted and global transcriptomic analysis was performed.
