TITLE
Human whole blood microarray study to compare patients with tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, pneumonia, and lung cancer (training)

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
This study used whole blood transcriptional signatures from patients with tuberculosis compared to those with similar pulmonary diseases, sarcoidosis, pneumonia and primary lung cancer. TB and sarcoidosis had similar signatures that were distinct from pneumonia and lung cancer.

DESIGN
