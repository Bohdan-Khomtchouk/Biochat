TITLE
miRNA expression profiles of frontal cortex and hippocampus from adult C57BL/6J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix miRNA arrays to analyze the expression of miRNAs in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of 8-week-old C57BL/6J wt mice. We compared these microarray-based expression profiles to ones obtained by miRNA sequencing from the same brain regions of the same mouse strain.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiling of frontal cortex and hippocampus from C57BL/6J mice (N=3) was performed with Affymetrix miRNA array

PLATFORM
GPL8786 [miRNA-1] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-1 Array
