TITLE
miRNA expression profiles of frontal cortex and hippocampus from adult C57BL/6J mice

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix miRNA arrays to analyze the expression of miRNAs in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of 8-week-old C57BL/6J wt mice. We compared these microarray-based expression profiles to ones obtained by miRNA sequencing from the same brain regions of the same mouse strain.
