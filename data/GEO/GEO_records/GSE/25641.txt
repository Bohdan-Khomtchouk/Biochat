TITLE
Expression data from SPAK transfected Caco2-BBE cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ste20-related proline/alanine rich kinase (SPAK) is involved in diverse function, such as the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. It is very important to study the underlying mechanisms by which SPAK regulates the progress of IBD. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
We transfected colon cancer modified cell line Caco2-BBE cells with SPAK plasmid and vector for RNA extraction and hybridization on VMSR Human 30k oligonucleotide microarrays.
