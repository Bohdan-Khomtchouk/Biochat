TITLE
Rice plants treated with D-allose

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rare sugars are monosaccharides that are rarely present in nature. One of the rare sugars, D-allose had a negative effect on shoot growth of rice. This negative effect to rice growth was not observed in other tested rare sugars. To clarify the response to the D-allose in rice at gene expression level, we performed a microarray analysis using the Agilent Rice Oligo Microarray (44k, custom-made; Agilent Technologies, Redwood City, CA, USA). As a result, treatment of D-allose caused high induction of many defense-related genes including pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in rice.
