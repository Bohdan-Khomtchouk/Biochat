TITLE
[E-MTAB-442] ChIP-seq of mouse liver with no antibody to provide input sequences for ChIP experiments on C57BJ/6J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Odom_mouse_C57BL6J_input This experiment provides chromatin immunoprecipitation input sequences (i.e. no antibody was added during the ChIP protocol), suitable for use as input for ChIP experiments on C57BJ/6J mice.
