TITLE
Aflatoxin B1 exposure induces epigenetic mechanisms in primary human hepatocytes revealing novel biological processes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (Affymetrix)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study investigated differential gene expression, microRNA expression and DNA methylation changes in a pool of primary human hepatocyte RNA and DNA following 5 days of repetitive exposure to a low (LD) or moderate (MD) dose of aflatoxin B1 or DMSO. Three biological replicates per compound/solvent.

DESIGN
In total 8 arrays. The PHH_5D_MD_control and PHH_LD_5D_control Samples are the same Samples just processed differently. The CEL files for these Samples are on the Series record.
