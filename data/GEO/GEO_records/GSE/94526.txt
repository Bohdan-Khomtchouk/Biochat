TITLE
Post transcriptional modifications of miRNAs in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis

ORGANISM
Nematostella vectensis

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs of bilaterian animals undergo posttranscriptional modifications such as methylation, tailing and trimming that regulate miRNA stability and function.  To gain insight on the evolution of miRNA posttranscriptional modification, we studied regulation of miRNA stability by methylation in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a representative of Cnidaria, the sister group of Bilateria.

DESIGN
Employ height throughput sequence of endogenous small RNAs
