TITLE
The cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein MMS19 regulates transcriptional gene silencing, DNA repair, and flowering time in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To study how MMS19 and ABO4 affect gene expression, we performed RNA deep sequencing for the seedlings materials Col, mms19-1,and abo4 mutants.

DESIGN
Compare the mRNA profiles of 14-day old seedlings materials of mutants (mms19-1 and abo4) to wild type Col by Illumina suquencing.
