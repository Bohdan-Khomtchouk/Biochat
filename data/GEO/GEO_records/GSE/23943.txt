TITLE
Epigenome and transcriptome of naive pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells cultured in 2i serum-free medium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study describes the epigenetic and transcriptome profiling of mouse ES cells cultures in 2i serum-free medium. The proteins for which ChIP-Seq profiles were generated in these cells, as well as for cells grown in serum conditions,  include H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3, Suz12 and Ezh2. A sequence profile of genomic DNA is also included. Furthermore, we included RNA-Seq of ds_cDNA synthesized from double poly(A) selected mRNA and from rRNA depleted (strand specific) total RNA.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq profiling and RNA-Seq profiling on mouse naive ES cells
