TITLE
Expression data from uterine endometrial tissues of Holstein-Friesian cows on days 14-16 after calving

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Most dairy cows suffer uterine microbial contamination postpartum. Persistent endometritis often develops, associated with reduced fertility. We used a model of differential feeding and milking regimes to produce cows in differing negative energy balance (NEB) status in early lactation. We used Affymetrix GeneChip√í Bovine Genome Array  to investigate  the global  gene expression underlying  negative energy balance and to  identify the significantly differentially expressed genes during this process.

DESIGN
We investigate the differences of gene expression profiles in uterine endometrial tissues between the cows with mild and severe negative energy balance.
