TITLE
Reprogramming of DNA methylation in pollen guides epigenetic inheritance via small RNA.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Epigenetic inheritance is more widespread in plants than in mammals, in part because mammals erase epigenetic information each generation by germline reprogramming. To assess the extent of germline reprogramming in plants, we sequenced the methylome of three haploid cell types from developing pollen: the sperm cell (SC), the vegetative cell, and their precursor the post-meiotic microspore.

DESIGN
Whole genome bisulfite sequencing of FACS-purified sperm cells, vegetative nuclei and microspores

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana) GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
