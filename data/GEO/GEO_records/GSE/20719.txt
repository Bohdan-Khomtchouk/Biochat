TITLE
Gene expression changes upon treatment of T47D breast cancer cells with the Pan-PI3 kinase inhibitor GDC-0941

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to determine genes whose expression changed upon treatment with a selective inhibitor of class I PI3 kinase.

DESIGN
Total of 6 samples: cells were treated with GDC-0941 at a concentration of 1mM for 6 hours (3 replicates) and control (3 replicates)
