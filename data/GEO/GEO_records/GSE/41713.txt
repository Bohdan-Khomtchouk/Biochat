TITLE
Differences in gene expression of delta-fmt and wild-type Staphylococcus aureus RN4220

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Formyltransferase lacking mutants exhibit reduced growth rates in exponential phase indicating that the function of certain proteins depends on formylated N-termini but it has remained unclear, which cellular processes are abrogated by the lack of formylation. In order to elucidate how global metabolic processes are affected by the absence of formylated proteins the transcription of the fmt mutant was compared with that of the parental strain.
