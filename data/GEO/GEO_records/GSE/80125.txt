TITLE
Treatment of extracellular vesicles change gene expression in mesothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate whether the EVs from cancer cell lines could change gene expression in mesothelial cells, the EVs from five types of cells (ES-2 cells, A2780 cells, SKOV3 cells, HOSE1 cells and HOSE2 cells) were added to MeT-5A cells (Fig. 2a). All three selected cancer cell lines expressed metastatic phenotypes in mouse model (Fig. 1c), and EVs from HOSE2 cell line, established together with HOSE1 cell line, was also set as control. Total mRNAs were extracted by MeT-5A cells treated with EVs, and then microarray analysis was performed.

DESIGN
Treatment of extracellular vesicles from ES-2, SKOV3, A2780, HOSE1 and HOSE2 cells induced gene expression in human mesothelial cell lines was measured at 12 and 48 hours after exposure to doses of 10 and 30 mg
