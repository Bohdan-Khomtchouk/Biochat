TITLE
Expression profiling of soybean genes in response to drought (reproductive stage)

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Drought-responsive genes in soybean leaves were successfully identified using Affymetrix Soybean Gene 1.0 ST arrays on leaves samples of reproductive-stage soybean plants. R1 soybean plants planted in pots were imposed drought by withholding water for 5 days until the soil moisture content dropped to 5%, and 3rd trifoliates (now at the R2 stage) were collected for expression profiling.

DESIGN
Soybean plants were grown in pots. When the plants reached the R1 stage (started flowering), drought treatment was imposed by withholding water. The soil moisture content was monitored during the process until the 5th day of water withholding, when soil moisture content reached 5%. The 3rd trifoliate (counting from shoots), now at the R2 stage, was collected for total RNA extraction, while other 3rd trifoliates of similar chlorophyl index were collected for leaves water content determination to identify the severity of the stress. Total RNA from 3rd trifoliates were used for expression profiling using Affymetrix Soybean Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Four biological repeats per treatment were performed, three biological repeats were chosen for expression profiling.
