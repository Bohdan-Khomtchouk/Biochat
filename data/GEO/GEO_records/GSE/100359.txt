TITLE
Integrated Transcriptomic and Proteomic Dynamics of Everolimus Treatment in B Lymphoblastoid Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The investigation aims to profile the molecular dynamics of Everolimus treatment in cells.  Specifically, a B-lymphoblast cells line was treated with Everolimus and sampled every half-hour over a 12 hour period. Treated and untreated cells were processed to extract RNA and protein that were subsequently used in high-throughput analysis of the transcriptome (RNA-Sequencing) and proteome (mass spectrometry).

DESIGN
Examination of dynamics in a treated cell line and a parallel untreated controlline, both sampled over 12hrs every half hour. Validation using a new repeated experiment, with treated and untreated tracks, sampled over 6 selected time points.
