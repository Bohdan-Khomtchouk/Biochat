TITLE
Affymetrix profile of human liver progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human liver progenitor cells (LPCs) show therapeutic potential, however, their in vitro culture results in inadequate function and phenotypic instability reflecting incomplete understanding of in vivo processes. Foetal LPCs capable of differentiation to a hepatocyte phenotype were isolated and mRNA expression profiling carried out using Affymetrix HGU133plus2 microarrays. This was compared to profiles from mature human hepatocytes and human embryonic stem cells undergoing hepatocytic differentiation. Foetal LPCs exhibit a distinct molecular profile consistent with a stem cell signature, cell division, and some liver-specific functions.

DESIGN
9 independent samples of second trimester liver progenitor cells were profiled along with 3 independent mature hepatocyte samples and 3 each of embryonic stem cells at day 9 and day 17 of differentiation to hepatocyte like cells.
