TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the periovulatory follicle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Gonadotropin surge acts on the preovulatory follicle of the ovary to induce luteinization of follicular cells, oocyte meiotic maturation, cumulus expansion and follicular rupture leading to ovulation. These processes are brought about by spatial and temporal changes in transcriptional regulation of genes in the follicular cells in response to the gonadotropin surge. Analysis of gene expression changes in the periovulatory follicular cells will help in delineating the signal transduction pathways involved in the above mentioned processes. In monoovulatory species like bovines, the time interval of 24-28 hours between gonadotropin surge and ovulation provides distinct advantage for studying the temporal changes in the gene expression pattern. Thus, in the present study, we attempt to identify the temporal changes in the global gene expression profile in the periovulatory follicle of buffalo cows in response to gonadotropin surge and the results suggest the involvement of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 and cytokine signaling pathways in the periovulatory events.
