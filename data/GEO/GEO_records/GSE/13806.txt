TITLE
Effect of ectopic expression of sFRP1 on MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo as xenograft

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from ectopically sFRP1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells and control MDA-MB-231 cells and as well from tumor lysates arising from these cells as nude mouse xenograft.  Gene expression profiles for these samples were investigated using Affymetrix arrays.
