TITLE
Dynamics of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and chromatin marks in mammalian neurogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
H3K36me3 (ChIp-ChIp), H3K4me3 (ChIp-ChIp), H3K27me3 (ChIp-ChIp), 5mC (MIRA) and 5hmC (hMeDIP)  profiles were analyzed in neural progenitor cells (NPC) and neurons by using Nimblegen Mouse ChIP-chip 2.1M Economy Whole-Genome Tiling - 4 Array Set. In order to compare two different techniques of 5hmC profiling, we performed 5hmC profiling with Hydroxymethyl Collectorâ„¢ Kit (Active Motif) method and hybridized it on mouse Chr7 fragment (Nimblegen). As an independent experiment, 5hmC profiling was performed by using hMeDIP method and hybridized on mouse Chr7 fragment (Nimblegen).  After MIRA enrichment and genome amplification, DNA was hybridized on mouse Chr7 fragment (Nimblegen).

DESIGN
Analysis of epigenetic changes during neural differentiation due to comparisson of  epigenetic patterns in neural progenitor cells versus neurons.
