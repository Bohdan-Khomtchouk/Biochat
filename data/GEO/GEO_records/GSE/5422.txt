TITLE
Knock-down of three core transcription factors in hEC cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three transcription factors were silenced in human embryonic carcinoma cells, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2. Downstream effects were analysed by means of microarrays to obtain insights into the regulation of self-renewal in these cells. Keywords: RNAi-chip

DESIGN
Cells were transfected with esiRNA against the respective transcription factor transcripts. Knock-down efficiencies were high as monitored by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Samples for chip hybridisations were harvested 2.5 days after transfection.
