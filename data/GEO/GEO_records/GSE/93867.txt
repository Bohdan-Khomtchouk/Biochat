TITLE
RNA sequencing of ID4-GFP Bright and ID4-GFP Dim spermatogonia from postnatal day 8 transgenic Id4-Gfp (LT11) mouse pups

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Spermatogonia expressing the highest levels of ID4 (ID4-GFP Bright) represent a population highly enriched for spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) while those expressing lower levels (ID4-GFP Dim) are the putative immediate progenitors.  Comparing the transcriptome of these populations can provide insight into the SSC to progenitor transition.
