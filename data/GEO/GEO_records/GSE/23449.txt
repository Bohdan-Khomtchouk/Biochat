TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles in Immature and In vitro matured bovine Oocytes

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In cattle, almost all fully grown vesicle stage oocytes (GV) have the ability to resume meisos, develop to Metaphase II stage (MII), support fertilization and progress through the early embryonic cycles in vitro. Yet without intensive selection, the majority fail to develop to the blastocyst stage. Using the Affymetrix Bovine Genome Array, global mRNA expression analysis of immature (GV) and in vitro matured (IVM) bovine oocytes was carried out to characterize the transcriptome of the bovine oocyte and to identify the key pathways associated with oocyte meiotic maturation and developmental potential.
