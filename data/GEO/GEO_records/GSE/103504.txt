TITLE
BRD4 promotes distinct transcriptional programs in bulk and stem-like prostate tumor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genetic knockdown or chemical inhibitors of BRD4 elicited different biological responses in bulk tumor cells in 2D cultures and CSC-enriched tumor-sphere cultures. Gene profiling revealed that BRD4 inhibition affected different sets of genes in two cell contexts. BRD4 drives a CSC-specific transcriptional programs that can be disrupted by chemical inhibitors causing exhaustion and elimination of prostate CSCs.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from prostato-spheres and adherent cells was compared.  Additionally Total RNA obtained from prostato-spheres and adherent cells after OTX015 treatment at 0, 4 and 24 h was measured and compared.
