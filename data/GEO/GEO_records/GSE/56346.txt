TITLE
Next generation sequencing of Phaeodactylum tricornutum grown with and without nitrogen

ORGANISM
Phaeodactylum tricornutum

SUMMARY
We have done next generation sequencing of optically thin, exponentialy growing Phaeodactylum tricornutum cultures grown with and without nitrogen source to improve our undestanding of the pathways regulation under conditions that promote lipid accumulation (N-starvation).

DESIGN
3 biologically independent exponentially growing culture of Phaeodactylum tricornutum were pelleted and washed several times with N-free media. Each culture was devided to 2 replicates with initial cell concentration of 2X105 cells/mL, one with NaNO3 as nitrogen source and the other without any nitrogen source. The cuture were bubbled foro 48 hours and sampled for transcriptome together with other physiological parameters and lipid analysis.
