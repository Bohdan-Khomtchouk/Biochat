TITLE
Phosphate starvation/sufficient treatment of rice seedling

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
We compared our mRNA-seq expression data with that from Rice 44K oligomicroarray, and about 95.5% (root) and 95.4% (shoot) transcripts supported by the array were confirmed expression both by the array and by mRNA-seq.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, non-treatment vs. phosphate starvation/sufficient treatment of rice seedling. Biological replicates: 3 non-treatment replicates, 3  phosphate starvation/sufficient treatment replicates. *** This submission represents the microarray component of the study
