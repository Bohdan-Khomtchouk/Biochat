TITLE
The gene regulatory cascade linking proneural specification with differentiation in Drosophila sensory neurons

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
A challenge in systems biology is to understand the gene regulatory networks that connect early cellular specification to terminal differentiation of specific cell types. In neurogenesis, neural specification has been well studied, but the link between the proneural transcriptional regulators of specification and the genes that must be activated to construct differentiated neurons is obscure. High resolution temporal profiling of gene expression reveals the events downstream of Atonal (Ato) proneural gene function in Drosophila sensory neurons. Unexpectedly, many differentiation genes are activated soon after specification, even before cell cycle exit and overt neuronal differentiation. Prominent among them are genes required for construction of the ciliary dendrite. Ato activates differentiation both directly and indirectly via several intermediate transcriptional regulators, including Rfx and a new Forkhead family factor. Our analysis of these factors and their regulation provides insight into how proneural factors regulate neuronal subtype differentiation. Investigating the molecular mechanisms of peripheral nervous sytem development in Drosophila melanogaster.
