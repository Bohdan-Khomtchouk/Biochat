TITLE
Schizophrenia: postmortem dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq analysis of post-mortem tissue from DLPFC of 19 schizophrenia patients and 19 controls.

DESIGN
mRNA sequencing of post-mortem brain tissue from the  dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)  from 19 male controls and 19 male schizophrenia patients generated by deep sequening using the Applied Biosystems SOLiD platform. Raw reads were mapped with Tophat2 to create the associated bam files. Feature counting was performed with HTSeq-count. This mapping and analysis protocol differs from the mapping and analysis reported previously in Fillman et al. Molecular Psychiatry (2012) 1-9.
