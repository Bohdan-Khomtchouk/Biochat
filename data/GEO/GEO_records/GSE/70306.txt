TITLE
Comparison of mRNA expression pattern between wild-type regulatory T (Treg) cells and Nr4a-deficient Treg cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulatory T (Treg) cells, as central mediators of immune suppression, play crucial roles in many aspects of immune system physiology and pathophysiology. Treg cells are characterized by a distinct pattern of gene expression, including upregulation of immune-suppressive genes and silencing of inflammatory cytokine genes. However, the molecular mechanisms that establish and/or maintain such gene regulation in Treg cells remain largely unknown. We recently reported that Nr4a family nuclear orphan receptors are essential for the development of Treg cells. The fact that Treg cells maintain high levels of expression of all Nr4a family components suggests that they may also play critical roles beyond Treg cell development. Thus, we compared mRNA expression pattern between wild-type Treg cells and Nr4a-deficietn Treg cells. As a result, we found that expression of 'Treg-signature genes' were globally down regulated in Nr4a-deficient Treg cells.

DESIGN
mRNA from wild-type and Nr4a-deficient Treg cells were analyzed.
