TITLE
ChIP-chip with anti-HP1 from third instar larvae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To investigate how dSETDB1 regulated the genome-wide distribution of HP1 proteins, we performed ChIP-chip assay on the third instar larval lysate from the dSETDB1null mutants in comparison to the wild type.

DESIGN
Third instar larvae from the wild type and dSETDB1null mutants were collected. Three independent biological replicates of ChIP with anti-HP1 were performed.
