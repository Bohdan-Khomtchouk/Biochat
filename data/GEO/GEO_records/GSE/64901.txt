TITLE
Microarray analysis on livers of young Nile rats fed palm fruit juice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis on livers of young (three weeks old) Nile rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) fed with either a high carbohydrate diet only (percentage energy from carbohydrate:fat:protein = 70:10:20, 16.7 kJ/g) or a high carbohydrate diet supplemented with palm fruit juice (PFJ) (415 ml of 13000 ppm gallic acid equivalent (GAE) for a final concentration of 5.4 g GAE per kg diet or 2.7 g per 2000 kcal) PFJ (415 ml of 13000 ppm gallic acid equivalent (GAE) for a final concentration of 5.4 g GAE per kg diet or 2.7 g per 2000 kcal) was supplemented to young Nile rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) given a high carbohydrate diet (percentage energy from carbohydrate:fat:protein = 70:10:20, 16.7 kJ/g) to observe for possible anti-diabetic effects. Livers were harvested four weeks after the feeding regimen for gene expression studies. Results from the microarray data analysis carried out show that rats given PFJ had down-regulated insulin signalling, consistent with anti-diabetic effects observed in vivo.
