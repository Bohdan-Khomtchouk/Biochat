TITLE
Genome-wide identification of glucocorticoid receptor binding sites in the whole hippocampus of adrenalectomised male rats given corticosterone infusion and stressed or non-stressed.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have applied next-generation sequencing technology to obtain high through-put profiling of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) DNA binding in whole hippocampus from male rat brain. By obtaining sequence from immunoprecipitated, sonicated chromatin, we have generated genome-wide binding maps for GR in two contexts, testing whether chromatin is primed for GR binding according to the animal's acute experience. In one context (stressed) adrenalectomised rats are infused with corticosterone while undergoing restraint stress. In the second context (non-stressed control) rats are infused with the same corticosterone profile but restraint stress is omitted. We find that GR binding was highly similar suggesting factors other than GR binding may account for any context-dependent alterations in GR function associated with acute stress. We show that GR is positioned near to genes associated with structural and functional organisation of the hippocampus at largely intergenic and intronic sites. Glucocorticoid response element sequences support a majority of GR binding in this tissue but may be reinforced by NF-1 and/or basic-helix loop helix transcription factors binding their nearby recognition motifs. We found little evidence for tethering of GR to other factors, or for the usage of negative glucocorticoid response elements.

DESIGN
Examination of glucocorticoid receptor binding in two different physiological contexts (stressed and non-stressed controls).
