TITLE
A functional liaison between E2F and the aberrant ETS oncogene EWS/FLI1 in Ewing's sarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Translocations of ETS transcription factors are driver mutations in diverse cancers. We investigated the genomic network of the ETS fusion EWS/FLI1 in Ewing's sarcoma (ESFT) as a model of ETS-driven tumorigenesis. ChIP-Seq and transcriptional analysis identified E2F3 as a principle co-factor of EWSFLI1 defining functionally distinct gene sets. While EWS/FLI1 binding independent of E2F3 predominantly associated with repressed differentiation genes, significant co-localization with E2F3 was discovered at proximal promoters of activated growth-related genes. Thus, EWS/FLI1 promotes oncogenesis by simultaneously perturbing differentiation state and augmenting the expression of genes co-regulated by E2F3. Integration of additional E2F3 and ERG localization data from prostate cancer containing TMPRSS2/ERG verified that the ETS-E2F module is also found in prostate cancer and may be of general relevance to ETS driven cancers.
