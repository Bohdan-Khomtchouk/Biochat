TITLE
Response of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 to challenges with sublethal concentrations of enterocin AS-48

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579

SUMMARY
Enterocin AS-48 is produced by Enterococcus faecalis S48 to compete with other bacteria in their environment. Due to its activity against various Gram positive and some Gram negative bacteria it has clear potential for use as a food preservative. Here, we studied the effect of enterocin AS-48 challenges on vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 by use of transcriptome analysis.

DESIGN
Control: Wild type against Target: Enterocin AS-48 challenge A supplementary file containing processed data of all samples combined is linked below. Mn column is the lowess normalized LN (Target/Control).
