TITLE
CGH: FN1.4_v_M92-220

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Soybean fast neutron (FN) mutant lines were compared by CGH to catalog structurally variant (e.g. deletion and duplication) regions compared to the parent line (M92-220). The CGH comparisons reveal reveal putative deletions and duplications among the mutant lines.

DESIGN
FN lines were compared through a common reference, M92-220 (this is a sub-line individual isolated from the M92-220 seed stock).  Each FN line was represented by a single individual plant.  The reported values show the log2 ratio of the normalized FN line hybridization signals (Cy3) over the normalized M92-220 hybridization signal (Cy5).
