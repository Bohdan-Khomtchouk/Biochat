TITLE
Sheep longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle from 40 individual progeny belonging to six Poll Dorset industry sires

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of sheep born to Australian industry sires with high and low genetic merit (Estimated Breeding Values or EBVs) for eye muscle depth (EMD). Progeny (40) from six Poll Dorset sires representing well defined extremes of EBVs for Eye Muscle Depth (low EBV EMD and high EBV EMD) were selected for analysis. The six sires were Australian industry sires with three sires representative of low EBV EMD and three representing high EBV EMD. Microarrays were used for transcription profiling of skeletal muscle samples taken from 40 individual progeny belonging to six Poll Dorset industry sires, with 3 sires extreme for high and 3 sires extreme for low muscling (based on EBV for EMD).

DESIGN
Sheep longissimus dorsi (LD) skeletal muscle samples were collected from 40 individual progeny belonging to six Poll Dorset industry sires, with 3 sires extreme for high and 3 sires extreme for low muscling (based on EBV for EMD).
