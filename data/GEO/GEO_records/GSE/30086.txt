TITLE
piRNA production requires heterochromatin formation in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here, we analyzed two small RNA libraries derived from ovarian tissue mutant for either the Drosophila SETDB1 gene, or the Bam gene. Here we show that deposition of histone 3 lysine 9 by the methyltransferase dSETDB1 (egg) is required for piRNA cluster transcription. In the absence of dSETDB1, cluster precursor transcription collapses in germline and somatic gonadal cells and TEs are activated, resulting in germline loss and a block in germline stem cell differentiation. We propose that heterochromatin protects the germline by activating the piRNA pathway. Keyword : Epigenetics

DESIGN
2 libraries were analyzed, with 1 being a developmental control (Bam Mutant).
