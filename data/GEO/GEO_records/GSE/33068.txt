TITLE
Wine yeast EC1118 and CSM comparative transcriptomics during synthetic grape juice fermentation MS300 at day 6

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
CSM is a commercial wine yeast with a long chronological life span, while commercial strain EC1118 displays a short life span in laboratory synthetic complete medium SC. Our aim is compare their expression profile on a high sugar fermentation

DESIGN
From a preculture of two days in YPD, MS300 was innoculated at 10exp6 cells/mL in filled-in 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes and they were cultivated at 24ÂºC with mild shaking for 6 days.
