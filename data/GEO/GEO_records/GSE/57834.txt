TITLE
Isolation and Characterisation of a Novel Trophoblast Hoescht Side-Population with Stem Cell Properties from First Trimester Placentae

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this work, we have isolated a Hoescht side-population of trophoblasts from first trimester human placentae that cluster separately from more differentiated trophoblast populations, and have a transcriptomic profile indicative of a stem cell population.

DESIGN
Hoescht side-population cells were compared in quintuplicate with extravillous trophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts extracted from the same placentae, giving a total of 15 samples.
