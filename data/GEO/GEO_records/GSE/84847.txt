TITLE
Expression data of the acrR mutant E.coli compared to wild-type

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
AcrR is a known transcriptional repressor for AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux system and mar-sox regulators. We used microarrays to investigate genome-wide target genes for AcrR. In the acrR deletion mutant, the transcription of genes for flagella and motility are significantly increased, indicating that AcrR plays a role in motility of E. coli.

DESIGN
Two E. coli strains, acrR deletion mutant and wild-type, grew on LB medium. At exponential phase (OD600=0.8), RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to find the genes that the transcription is significantly increased in the acrR deletion mutant.
