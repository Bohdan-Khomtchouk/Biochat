TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of RNAs immunoprecipitated with Cyt c under hyperosmotic stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
For the detection of tiRNAs accumulated in Cyt c-IP vs tiRNAs in total cell lysates during hyperosmotic stress in the presence of angiogenin

DESIGN
Total cell lysates from mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with angiogenin under hyperosmotic stress.  Lysates split into two parts: one part serveed as the total RNA, the other part served as Cyt c-IP fraction.  Small RNAs were enriched from both parts and went through deep sequencing followed by bioinformatic analysis.
