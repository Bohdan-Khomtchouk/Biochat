TITLE
Genome wide microarray based expression profiles associated with BmNPV resistantance and susceptibility in Indian silkworm races of Bombyx mori

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanism involved in BmNPV resistance was investigated using a genome wide microarray in the midgut tissues of BmNPV infected resistant (Sarupat) and susceptible (CSR-2) Indian silkworm races. In the resistant race, 735 genes were upregulated and 589 genes were down regulated at 12 hours of BmNPV post infection. Similarly in case of susceptible race, 2183 genes were up regulated and 2115 genes were down regulated.  Among the differentially expressed genes, nine upregulated and eight down regulated genes were validated using real time qPCR  analysis. In Sarupat, the significantly upregulated genes are vacuolar protein sorting associated gene, X fin like protein  and Carboxy peptidase E like protein in BmNPV infected midguts, whereas the prominent down regulated genes are glutamate receptor ionotropic kainite 2-like, BTB/POZ domain  and transferrin. In the case of CSR-2, the considerably upregulated genes are  Peptidoglycan recognition protein S6 precursor and rapamycin while the conspicuous down regulated genes are  facilitated trehalose transporter and zinc transporter  ZIP1-like gene. Our results provided a vital insights of  Bombyx mori  in reference with its molecular mechanism in immune response against the BmNPV invasion.
