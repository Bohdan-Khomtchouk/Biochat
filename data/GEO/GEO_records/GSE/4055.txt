TITLE
ORNL Hr(Rh-R) mouse cutaneous array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These data is from 10 day-old Hr(Rh-R)/Hr(Rh-R) vs Hr(Rh-R)/+ mice. Mouse 15k microarray from the Center for Applied Genomics was used to survey the gene expression. The data was acquired with ImaGene and processed with GeneSight from BioDiscovery. Keywords: Genetic mutants

DESIGN
Three pairs of littermates from one liter, 10 day-old Hr(Rh-R)/Hr(Rh-R) vs Hr(Rh-R)/+ mice, were used for the hybridization. Dye-swapping was done for each pair of littermates.
