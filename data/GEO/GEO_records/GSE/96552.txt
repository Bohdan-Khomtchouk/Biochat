TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of somato-dendritic mRNA distribution in the hippocampus in RNG105/caprin1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: mRNA localization and translation in neuronal dendrites are the basis for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation. RNA granules, membrane-less macromolecular assemblies in which dendritic mRNAs are recruited, are thought to contribute to these processes. RNG105/caprin1 is an RNA granule assembly factor involved in mRNA transport. Results: Genome-wide profiling of mRNA distribution in distinct hippocampal layers revealed dendritically and somatically enriched mRNAs, and demonstrated marked reduction in the differential somato-dendritic localization of the mRNAs in RNG105 cKO mice. Conclusion: RNG105 is an essential factor for the localization of many, but particularly for specific mRNAs localized to dendrites.

DESIGN
mRNAs isolated from stratum pyramidale (SP) and stratum radiatum (SR) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus from control mice and RNG105 cKO mice were deep sequenced in triplicate using a HiSeq1500 (Illumina).
