TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis of human keratinocyte HaCaT cells treated with obacunone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Obacunone treatment upregulates gene expression of cholesterol and lipid metabolism-associated genes in HaCaT cells

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HaCaT cells treated with 10, 50, or 100 uM obacunoe for 4 h was compared to that of vehicle control cells.

PLATFORM
