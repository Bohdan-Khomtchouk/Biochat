TITLE
A lack of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) causes defects in granulocytic differentiation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from CD34+ hematopoietic cells transduced with control or anti-SLPI shRNA, serum starved and treated with G-CSF.

DESIGN
CD34+ hematopoietic cells were isolated from the bone marrow of healthy individuals, transduced with lenitvirus-based RFP-expressed shRNA constructs targeting SLPI mRNA or scrambled control shRNA. After 3 days of the transductions, RFP+ cells were sorted, serum starved for 24 hours and treated with G-CSF 10 ng/ml for 18 hours. Total RNA of sorted cells was isolated and used for Affymetrix Exome arrays.
