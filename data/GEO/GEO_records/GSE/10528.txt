TITLE
The retinal transcriptional response to light damage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles were compared between dark adapted and light damaged BALBc (albino) mouse retinas. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
BALBc mice were dark adapted for one week. To produce light damage a subset of the mice were then exposed to 6,000 lux white fluorescent light for 6 hours. Retinas were collected for RNA extraction 24 hours after light damage.
