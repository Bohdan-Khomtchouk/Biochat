TITLE
Odd skipped-related 1 (Osr1) identifies a population of embryonic fibro-adipogenic progenitors regulating myogenesis during limb development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced total RNAs that were extracted from Osr1-expressing cells isolated by FACS-sorting from E13.5 limbs of two heterozygous (Osr1 GCE/+) and two homozygous (Osr1 GCE/GCE) mouse embryos.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of Osr1-expressing cells at E13.5

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
