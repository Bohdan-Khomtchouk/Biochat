TITLE
Differentially expressed genes in zebrafish vascular development

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to identify using tissue specific transgenic zebrafish (Fli:EGFP), genes of interest important for embryonic vascular development. Keywords: time course, GFP cell isolation, zebrafish

DESIGN
The experiment contained 6 samples. A18, A24 = total RNA isolated from 18 and 24 hpf zebrafish embryo; B2, C and D2=RNA isolated from GFP positive cells sorted at 18, 24 and 28 hpf respectively from Tg(Fli1:EGFP) embryos; E2 = RNA isolated from GFP positive cells sorted at 18 hpf from Tg(Flk:GRCFP) embryos.
