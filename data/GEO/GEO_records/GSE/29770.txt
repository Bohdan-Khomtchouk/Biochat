TITLE
Transduction of human fibroblasts with Zic3 combined with OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4 induces stable neural progenitor cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lineage specific transcription factors (TF) define and reinforce tissue specific cell types. For instance, stable endoderm progenitors were established from human ESC by constitutive expression of SOX7 or SOX17. We hypothesized that combinatorial expression of OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4 together with the neural-lineage TF, Zic3, could directly convert fibroblasts into stable neuronal progenitor cells (NPC). Ensuing colonies predominantly expressed genes present in human NPC, as demonstrated by genome wide transcriptional analysis, and this phenotype could be maintained through many passages.  When injected in immunodeficient mice, Zic3-induced (Zi)NPC form neuroendocrine tumors without evidence of mesoderm or endoderm. In vitro, ZiNPC spontaneously differentiated to neural cells only, and could be differentiated into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and motor neuron lineages. In conclusion, addition of Zic3 during induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation, allows for the derivation of stable neural lineage progenitor cells.

DESIGN
3 hESC, 3 hESC-derived neurosphere and 3 ZiNPC samples were analyzed
