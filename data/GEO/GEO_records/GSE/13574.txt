TITLE
Mouse heart cells' gene expression difference compared with that of MEF cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse somatic heart cell had different gene expression level compared with that of the MEF cells. This difference gave the mouse somatic heart cell unique characteristics which could then be compared with the mouse ES cells by genes comparison to show the gene expression difference between mouse somatic heart cells and mouse ES cells.

DESIGN
There were two replicates sample of the mouse somatic heart cell named 1, 2. And the control cells were the MEF cells. Mouse somatic heart cells samples were labled with Cy3 and the MEF cells were labled with Cy5. The data was process to show the mouse somatic heart cells' gene expression difference compared with that of MEF cells.
