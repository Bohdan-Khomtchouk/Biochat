TITLE
Mouse heart cells' gene expression difference compared with that of MEF cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse somatic heart cell had different gene expression level compared with that of the MEF cells. This difference gave the mouse somatic heart cell unique characteristics which could then be compared with the mouse ES cells by genes comparison to show the gene expression difference between mouse somatic heart cells and mouse ES cells.
