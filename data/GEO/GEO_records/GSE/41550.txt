TITLE
The midgut of domestic silkworm: Control vs. phoxim treated

ORGANISM
Bombyx mori

SUMMARY
Transcriptional characteristics of genes in the midgut of domestic silkworms after 24 h exposure to phoxim through whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray.

DESIGN
Transcription profiling experiments, phoxim-treated midgut (samples) were analyzed. Dual-channel experiments, with test samples labeled by Cy5 and control samples labeled by Cy3. Three Biological replicate. No dye-swaps.

PLATFORM
GPL9527 Silkworm 23K oligo array version 2.0
