TITLE
Differential expression of genes in human CD8+ T cell clones expanded with eAPC vs eAPC:4-1BBL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular mechanism of 4-1BB co-stimulation on T cells, CD8+ T cell clones were expanded with either eAPC or eAPC:4-1BBL. The global programme of gene expression identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes in T cell clones expanded with eAPC:4-1BBL (4-1BB costimulation) compared to eAPC (without co-stimulation).

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed (day 3 and day 7) on CD8+ T cell clones expanded with either eAPC or eAPC:4-1BBL in media containing IL-2 (50cu/ml), and anti-CD3 antibody (25ng/ml).
