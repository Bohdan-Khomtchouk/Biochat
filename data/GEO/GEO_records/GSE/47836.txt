TITLE
Human colon carcinoma cell line treated with bafilomycin A1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of mRNA expression changes in human colon carcinoma cell lines (HCT116 H2B-GFP) after treatment bafilomycin A1.

DESIGN
mRNA expression analysis of HCT116 H2B-GFP treated with bafilomycin A1 compared to untreated HCT116 H2B-GFP. Four biological replicates were performed for treated samples.
