TITLE
Histone H3Lys4 trimethylation in budding yeast S. cerevisiae for wild type and cnc1Djhd2D yeast mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study, we measured histone H3Lys4 trimethylation in budding yeast S. cerevisiae for wild type and cnc1Djhd2D yeast mutants. These experiments were performed for yeast cultured to mid-logarithmic phase in non-fermentable carbon.

DESIGN
Measurement of histone H3Lys4 3me relative to histone H3 for two different genotypes with biological replicates. NGS was performed twice on each biological replicate resulting in 16 samples total.
