TITLE
Repo-Man/PP1 regulates heterochromatin formation in interphase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Repo-Man chromatin binding sites were obtained by expression of GST:Repo-Man and incubation with nucleosomes extracted from HeLa cells (GST alone signal was used as a negative control and subtracted from the GST:Repo-Man chromatin bound fraction)

DESIGN
Two replicates were produced for GST:Repo-Man and GST alone bound nucleosomes
