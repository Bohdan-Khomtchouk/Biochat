TITLE
Wild type E.coli SE15 vs. LuxS mutant E.coli SE15

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli SE15

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of  E.coli SE15 comparing wild type E.coli SE15 with Autoindecur 2 synthesis gene LuxS mutnat E.coli SE15. E.coli SE15 is isolated from indwelling catheter of urinary tract infected patient. Examine change of quorum sensing related gene by deleting autoinducer 2 synthesis gene LuxS in E.coli

DESIGN
One array: Wild type E.coli SE15 vs. LuxS mutant E.coli SE15

PLATFORM
GPL17523 Escherichia coli SE15 30K Microarray
