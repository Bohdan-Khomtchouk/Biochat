TITLE
Gene expression data from induced Pluripotent Stem cells from OPA1 Haploinsufficiency patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have generated human induced Pluripotent Stem cells (hiPSc) from two individuals with OPA1 haploinsufficiency, and one control donor, using Sendai virus-mediated delivery of reprogramming factors. hiPSc lines have been screened using SNP array to assess chromosomal stability (alongside the fibroblast lines from which they derived), and validation of the pluripotency of the hiPSc lines is provided by Pluritest assessment of transcriptome datasets, prior to differentiation to dopaminergic neuronal clutures and downstream functional assays. Mitochondrial fragmentation in iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons with OPA1 haploinsufficiency underpins increased apoptosis   and syndromic Parkinsonism.

DESIGN
human iPSc lines were derived from human dermal fibroblasts from 2 related individuals with heterozygous OPA1 mutations, one of whom had syndromic Parkinsonism,  and 1 control donor.
