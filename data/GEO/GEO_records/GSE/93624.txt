TITLE
Profiling of Ileal Transcriptome in Pediatric Crohn Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report ileal gene expression at diagnosis in a cohort of 210 treatment-na√Øve patients of pediatric Crohn's disease and 35 non-IBD controls from the RISK study. After three years of follow-up after diagnosis, 27 of the CD patients progressed to complicated disease (B2 and/or B3). We aim to test whether Transcriptional Risk Scores helps to distinguish between patient subgroups, improving the predictive power gained from Genetic Risk Scores.

DESIGN
Ileal biopsies were obtained during diagnostic colonoscopies of children and adolescents ( < 17 years) who presented with symptoms of IBD. Non-IBD control label corresponds to those with suspected IBD, but without inflammation and normal endoscopic findings. Biopsies were stored at -80 degrees.
