TITLE
B. subtilis response to rotten meat volatiles.

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
To find a promoter upregulated in the presence of rotten meat, we exposed B. subtilis 168 to the volatiles of rotten meat (mixed beef/pork) and performed a microarray comparing it to B. subtilis  which was not exposed to the meat. The results where used to build iGEM Groningen 2012s Food Warden, a spoiled meat detector. Find more information at: 2012.igem.org/Team:Groningen

DESIGN
One condition design; including dye swap, two technical replicates and two experimental replicates

PLATFORM
GPL17671 Bacillus subtilis 168 Oligo Array
