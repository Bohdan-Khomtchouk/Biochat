TITLE
Cell autonomous and non-autonomous interactions of a western-style diet and the vitamin D receptor in intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These data suggest that co-culture with macrophages increases expression of NDRG-1 in epithelial cell lines.  The finding is confirmed in 2 human epithelial cell lines, and in tissue derived from mice genetically and dietetically altered to increase macrophage infiltration of the small and large intestinal epithelium.  NDRG1 is identified as a potential mediator of macrophage effects on tumorigenesis in the large and small intestine. Array data is part of a larger study involving the effects of Vitamin D, in concert with macrophages, on intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Cells from mouse epithelial cell line CT26 were cultured either alone, or with RAW macrophages in a system which allowed no physical contact but exchange of soluble factors between the cell types.  The experiment was peformed twice.
