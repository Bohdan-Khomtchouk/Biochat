TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq of smooth muscle actin cell in the lung.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we characterize mesenchymal cell populations expressing Lgr5 and Lgr6 in the adult lung. We show that Lgr5 and Lgr6 expression can be used to identify distinct mesenchymal lineages that drive lineage-specific differentiation of epithelial progenitor cells in adult lung.

DESIGN
Mouse lungs were disassociated, sorted by FACS and expression level were quantified using the SmarySeq2.
