TITLE
LMO2 expression in HSCs causes T-ALL in the presence of an intact thymic niche [nude mice]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in tumor-bearing Sca1-TOMATO-Lmo2 Nu/Nu mice

DESIGN
Tumor-bearing bone marrows of three Sca1-TOMATO-Lmo2 Nu/Nu mice compared with bone marrow cells from four Control Nude mice and with thymus leukemic cells from ten Sca1-TOMATO-Lmo2 mice. GSM2209767 - GSM2209776 are re-analyses of GSE83570 (GSM2209749 - GSM220975 and GSM2209757 - GSM2209759).

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
