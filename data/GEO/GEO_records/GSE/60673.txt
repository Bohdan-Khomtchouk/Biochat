TITLE
Pharmacologic inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction blocks progression of MLL leukemia in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosomal translocations affecting Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene result in acute leukemias resistant to therapy. The leukemogenic activity of MLL fusion proteins is dependent on their interaction with menin, providing basis for therapeutic intervention. Here we report development of novel, highly potent and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction, MI-463 and MI-503, show their profound effects in MLL leukemia cells and substantial survival benefit in mice models of MLL leukemia. Finally, we demonstrate efficacy of these compounds in primary samples derived from MLL leukemia patients. Overall, we demonstrate for the first time that pharmacologic inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction represents an effective treatment for MLL leukemias in vivo and provide advanced molecular scaffold for clinical lead identification.

DESIGN
MV4;11 human MLL leukemia cells were treated with the menin-MLL inhibitor MI-389
