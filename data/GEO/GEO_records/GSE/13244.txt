TITLE
Identification of Pax6-dependent gene regulatory networks in the mouse lens

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This is an integrative genome-wide approach to identify downstream networks controlled by Pax6 during mouse lens and forebrain development. Differential gene expression was analyzed in Pax6 mouse heterozygous and wildtype newborn mouse lenses, with subsequent comparison of  this data  with Pax6 forebrain expression data (Holm et al., 2007). Keywords: Differential gene expression

DESIGN
Three biological replicate experiments were performed from wildtype and heterozygote mice.
