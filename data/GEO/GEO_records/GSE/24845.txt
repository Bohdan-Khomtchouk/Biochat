TITLE
mRNA microarray analysis on young adult Drosophila exposed to benzene, toluene, and formaldehyde

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In order to evaluate the identification of genes and pathways, the global gene expression profiles were assessed in response to three chemicals (benzene (B), toluene (T), formaldehyde (F)) on Drosophila melanogaster. We performed whole genome DNA microarray experiments with subsequent quantitative analysis conducted on selected genes.

DESIGN
We used young adults of D. melanogaster exposed to B, T, or F, and whole genome microarrays to screen for global changes in D. melanogaster transcription profiles. Young adult flies were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
