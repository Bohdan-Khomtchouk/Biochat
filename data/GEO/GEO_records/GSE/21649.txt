TITLE
Human bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells: SLE patients vs normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Previous studies showed that bone marrow derived-mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus animal models have deficiency in their capacities of proliferation, differentiation, secretion of cytokines and other functions. In this study, we aim to investigate the different gene patterns of BMMSCs between normal and SLE individuals using genome-scale DNA microarrays. We found that among all the genes investigated in microarray slides, a total of 1, 905 genes were differentially expressed by BMMSCs SLE patients, in which 652 genes were up-regulated and 1253 genes were down-regulated. Gene ontology analysis showed that the majority of these genes were related to cell cycle and protein binding. Pathway analysis showed that differentially regulated signal pathways involved actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, tight junction and TGF-Î² pathway. Our data suggested that there were differential gene expression patterns of BMMSCs between normal and SLE individuals, and further studies are needed to reveal the mechanisms for such differences.

DESIGN
Bone marrow (BM) was obtained from 4 patients with SLE and 4 normal controls. BMMSCs were cultured and mRNA was extracted. Standard human reference RNA were purchased. Every slide: SLE or normal vs control, then SLE vs normals.
