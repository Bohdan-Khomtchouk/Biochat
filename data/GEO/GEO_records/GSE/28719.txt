TITLE
Gene expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pae) delta PA1006/nbvF mutant in the absence and presence of nitrate

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The Pae PA1006/nbvF gene was found to be essential for nitrate utilization, biofilm maturation, and virulence. Microarrays were employed to assess global gene expression changes in response to NO3 compared to wild-type.

DESIGN
Cells were grown aerobically in the absence or presence of nitrate and the effect on global gene expression was determined; two to three biological replicates for each condition were analyzed.
