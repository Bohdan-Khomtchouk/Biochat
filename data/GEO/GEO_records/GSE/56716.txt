TITLE
A healthy Nordic diet has a beneficial influence on the expression of genes involved in inflammation in subcutaneous adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a randomized controlled dietary intervention study we compared an isocaloric Healthy Nordic diet with the average Nordic diet for influence on abdominal subcutaneous adipose tisse gene expression. We studied obese adults with features of the metabolic syndrom, n=56. There was no significant difference in age, BMI, or gene expression between the groups before the intervention. The intervention lasted for 18-24 weeks. Gene expression was analyzed using linear mixed-effects models including specific genes as dependent variable, subject identifier as a random effect, and body weight, age, gender, study centre (i.e. also study duration), study group, time-point and study group * time-point interaction as covariates. 128 genes were significantly different regulated by the two diets with a FDR of 24%. TThese genes were overrepresented in pathways related to immune response. I conclusion, a Healthy Nordic diet reduces inflammatory gene expression in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. This could contribute to beneficial influences on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease.

DESIGN
Abdominal subcutaneous adipose needle biopsies were obtained before (W0) and after completion (W18-24) of the dietary intervention. From the biopsies we extracted RNA. From total RNA we prepared and hybridised biotinylated complementary RNA to GeneChip Human Gene 1.1 ST Arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA), and then washed, stained and scanned the slides using standardised protocols (Affymetrix Inc.).
