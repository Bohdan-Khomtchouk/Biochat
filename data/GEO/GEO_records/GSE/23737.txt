TITLE
Mouse placenta in spontaneous abortion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genetic profiles of mouse placenta were examined especially at the implantation sites of causing spontaneous abortion at day 14.5 of pregnancy. There is a number of the suffered patients from the recurrent spontaneous abortion by unknown causes. It is an important process to   understand genetic profiles in the abortion placentas for the investigation of specific causes to induce rejection of normal embryos from the maternal attack. Our study was carried out on the laboratory mice targeted spontaneous abortion to approximate human disease models.

DESIGN
Three samples from the each implantation site of normal and abortion in the same pregnant uterus.
