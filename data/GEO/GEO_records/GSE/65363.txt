Expression data from U-87 human glioma cells with proficient and deficient NF-кB after treatment with temozolomide

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor, NF-кB, plays a central role in the response to DNA damage. This ubiquitous family of proteins is made up of five subunits: p50 (NF-κB1, p105), p52 (NF-κB2, p100), p65 (relA), relB, and crel that appear in their mature form as dimers. Following stimulation, NF-κB dimers translocate to the nucleus where they bind specific consensus elements (κB-sites) in the promoter region of genes involved in cell survival, inflammation and the immune system. While there is a general propensity of NF-кB to mediate survival, this is not always the case and several reports note the pro-apoptotic nature of the NF-кB pathway. In examining the NF-кB response to DNA damage, we have found that the p50 subunit plays a central role in modulating cytotoxicity following TMZ treatment in malignant glioma. In the current study, given the importance of p50 to the cytotoxic response to TMZ, we set out to identify NF-кB-dependent factors that modulate the response to TMZ.

DESIGN
U-87 glioma cells stably transfected with either control-shRNA or p105-shRNA and subsequently treated with temozolomide (TMZ) were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Each category contains 3 biologic replicates.
