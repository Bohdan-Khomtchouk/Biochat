TITLE
Expression data of rhabdomyosarcoma cells and spheres

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Rhabomyosarcoma cells can be cultured in stem cell medium over several passages and form spheres being enriched in putative cancer stem cell markers and expressing high levels of stem cell genes. In this dataset, we include RNA samples from 2 rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and 3 different sphere passages of each cell line.

DESIGN
16 samples were analyzed and all sphere passages were compared to the expression level of their corresponding adherent cell line. We wanted to see an up- or downregulation of genes in the spheres to identify new potential cancer stem cell marker.
