TITLE
Transcription profiling of major depression peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at clinical remission compared to severe acute state

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PBMCs from major depressive episode (MDE) subjects were obtained at two time points: during a severe episode of depression and eight week later after clinical remission. PBMCs from sex- and age-machted controls were also obtained at an eight weeks interval. PBMC total RNAs from MDE and control subjects were profiled after hybridization with Agilent SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray to identify blood biomarkers of MDE.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from 36 samples including: 9 control and 9 MDE subjects at two point of time (first and eight week later)
