TITLE
Epigenome analysis of CD4 T cells from treated and untreated patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of CD4 T cells from treated and untreated patients with multiple sclerosis. The Illumina InfiniumEPIC methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 850,000 CpGs of CD4 T cells from patients with multiple sclerosis.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from CD4 T cells that were positively isolated with magnetic beads from treated and untreated patients with multiple sclerosis. Therapy abbreviations: Naive=untreated/treatment naive MS patients FAE=MS patients treated with fumaric acid esters, such as dimethyl fumarate GA=MS patients treated with glatiramer acetate

PLATFORM
GPL21145 Infinium MethylationEPIC
