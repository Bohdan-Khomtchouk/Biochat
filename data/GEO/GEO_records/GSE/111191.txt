TITLE
Expression data from PDVC57 cells stimulated with or without Onscostatin M

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common skin cancer in caucasian population and it's important to find new therapeutic targets. Cytokines expressed in tumor microenvironment can have strong effects on tumor cell phenotype.  We have characterized the effect of Oncostatin M (OSM), a cytokine belonging to the IL-6 familly on the transcriptome of transformed keratinocytes cell line, PDVC57 cells. In this dataset, we have included the expression data obtained from transformed keratinocytes PDVC57 cells stimulated or not with OSM for 6  or 24 hours. These data have shown that 32 genes were differentially expressed in response to OSM stimulation.

DESIGN
4 samples were analyzed, non stimulated (NS) for 6 or 24 hours used as controls and treated with OSM (10 ng/mL) for 6 or 24 hours. We generated the following pairwise comparisons NS 6h vs OSM 6h and NS 24h vs OSM 24h. Genes with a fold-change ≤0.5 or a fold-change ≥2 were selected.
