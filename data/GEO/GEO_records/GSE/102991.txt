TITLE
Gene expression assessed by genome wide hybridization bead array in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) isolated from small intestinal biopsies of celiac disease  patients with active disease and clinical controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of role of small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in the immunopathology of celiac disease

DESIGN
Four samples of purified IECs from duodenal mucosa of CD patients with active disease, 4 samples of purified IECs of clinical controls were individually subjected to genome-wide hybridization bead array analysis for gene expression.
