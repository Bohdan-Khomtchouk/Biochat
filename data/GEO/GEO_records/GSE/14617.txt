TITLE
CRY2 knockout in MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CRY2 expression was silenced in MCF7 cells using siRNA oligos, in order to examine the impact of CRY2 knockdown on carcinogenic processes.  CRY2 was ~3-fold down-regulated in both replicates, relative to negative control.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were transfected with either a negative control siRNA, or an siRNA oligo targeting CRY2.  Each treatment was performed on two independent cell populations (biological replicates).  Knockdown was confirmed by qRT-PCR.
