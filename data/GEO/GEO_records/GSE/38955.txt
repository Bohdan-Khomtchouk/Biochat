TITLE
Expression profiling of purified hematopoietic stem cells from patients with MDS and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis on purified human long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC; CD34+CD38-CD90+) and short-term HSC (ST-HSC; CD34+CD38-CD90-) derived from healthy control patients and patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)

DESIGN
Analysis of gene experssion of ST-HSCs and LT-HSCs derived from two patients with MDS and three healthy controls
