SUMMARY
We conducted ChIP-Seq of KDM5c in neurons isolated from E16.5 mouse embryonic cortices from WT and SMCX KO mice and harvested after 10 days in vitro culture.

DESIGN
We sequenced KDM5c ChIP and Input samples from mouse embryonic cortical neurons cultured in vitro for 10 days using Active Motif's Spike-In ChIP-protocol. Experiments were performed in biological and technical duplicates.
