TITLE
PELP1 ChIP-chip from MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) is a transcriptional coactivator that has previously been shown to collaborate with nuclear receptors. Evidence from other groups suggest that PELP1 may stimulate transcription by displacing the linker histone H1 and/or by recruiting the lysine demethylase KDM1 to demethylate H3K9me2. Also known as modulator of the non-genomic activity of estrogen receptor (MNAR), PELP1 has also been implicated promoting estrogen receptor signaling from the plasma membrane. We recently identified PELP1 a factor that interacts with the macro domain of the histone variant macroH2A1. To determine if PELP1 interacts with macroH2A1 in cells, we performed PELP1 ChIP-chip from MCF-7 cells. The pattern of PELP1 bind across the genome strongly correlates with that previously determined for macroH2A1. This data combined with additional experiments allow us to conclude that macroH2A1 regulates target gene expression in part by recruiting the transcriptional coregulator PELP1.

DESIGN
Two PELP1 ChIP-chip biological replicates from MCF-7 human breast cancer cells are included.
