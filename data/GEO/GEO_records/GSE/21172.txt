TITLE
Developmental Regulation and Individual Differences of Neuronal Epigenomes in the Prefrontal Cortex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report global distribution of trimethylated Histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4me3) in human prefrontal cortex neurons at different ages

DESIGN
Neuronal nuclei from human prefrontal cortex were isolated by FACS. Regions marked by H3K4me3 were identified by chromatin immunoprecipiation followed by deep sequencing.
