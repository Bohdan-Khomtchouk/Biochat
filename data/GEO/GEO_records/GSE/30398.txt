TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana growth time series

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. thaliana seedlings (early development) at 7 time points We investigate biomass heterosis by scoring partial correlations of transcriptional profiles.

DESIGN
We compare 4 genotypes: Col-0 (homozygous parental line), C24 (homozygous parental line), Col-0xC24 and C24xCol-0 (crossings) using 2-4 replicates each
