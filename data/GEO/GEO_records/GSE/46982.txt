TITLE
Whole-genome expression analysis reveals a role for death-related genes in stress acclimation of the diatom Thalasiossira pseudonana

ORGANISM
Thalassiosira pseudonana

SUMMARY
To identify genes involved in the iron-limited stress response and the induction of programmed cell death, gene expression analaysis using whole-genome microarrays was performed on cultures of T. pseudonana growing in replete or iron-limiting conditions Samples were collected at day 3 and day 5 from duplicate cultures; RNA was extracted and microarray analysis was performed

DESIGN
Duplicate biological replicates were analyzed from replete growing or iron-limited cultures; Analysis was performed on cultures harvested in late exponential phase (day 3) and stationary phase (day 5)
