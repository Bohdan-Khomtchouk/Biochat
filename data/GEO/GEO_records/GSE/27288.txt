TITLE
MicroRNA expression of C. eleagans in space environment

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The expression of 228 microRNAs, of the 232 analysed, were also unaffected during 4 and 8 d spaceflight (P > 0.05).

DESIGN
Entire microRNA expression were analyzed using the FilgenÂ® Array miRNA Caenorhabditis elegans 232 probes (Filgen). In the microRNA expression analysis, we compared the expression data between two groups: micro-gravity samples (4 d and 8 d) and controls (4 d and 8 d ground control and 1 G centrifuge onboard ISS).
