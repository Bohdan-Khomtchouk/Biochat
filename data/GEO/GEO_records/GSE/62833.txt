TITLE
The DREAM complex promotes gene body deposition of H2A.Z for target repression

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
As part of a study of the function of the C. elegans DREAM complex, here we have used ChIP-seq to analyze the patterns of histone variant HTZ-1/H2A.Z and various histone modifications in lin-35(n745) mutants. In addition, we have used RNA-seq to analyze gene expression in lin-35 and htz-1 mutants as compared with wild-type L3 larvae.
