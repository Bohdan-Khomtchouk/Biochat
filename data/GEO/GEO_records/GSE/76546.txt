TITLE
17-DMAG treatment in primary CLL B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to analyze gene expression following treatment of leukemic B cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG. Gene expression profiling reveals the role of SOCS3 in cytokine signaling in CLL

DESIGN
Primary cells from CLL patients were isolated and treated in vitro with 17-DMAG. Cells were collected for viability, gene expression analysis and cell signaling and migration assays.
