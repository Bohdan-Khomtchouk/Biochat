TITLE
Deconvolution of ChIP-chip MBF occupancies reveals the temporal recruitment of Rep2 at the MBF-target genes

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Deconvolution analysis using Rpb1 ChIP-chip results distinguishes the Cdc10 bindings at the Rpb1-poor loci (promoters) from those at the Rpb1-rich loci (intragenic sequences). Importantly, Res1 binding at the Rpb1-poor loci, but not at the Rpb1-rich loci, are dependent on the Cdc10 function, suggesting a distinct binding mechanism. Most Cdc10 promoter bindings at the Rpb1-poor loci are associated with the G1/S-phase genes. While Res1 or Res2 is found at both the Cdc10 promoter and intragenic binding sites, Rep2 appears to be absent at the Cdc10 promoter binding sites but present at the intragenic sites. Time-course ChIP-chip analysis demonstrates that Rep2 is temporally accumulated at the coding region of the MBF-target genes, resembling the RNAP-II occupancies.

DESIGN
We analyzed MBF binding sites using Nimblegen arrays.
