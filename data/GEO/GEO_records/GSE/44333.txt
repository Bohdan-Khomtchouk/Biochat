TITLE
Analysis of the host transcriptome from demyelinating spinal cord of murine coronavirus infected mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We use transcriptome analysis to study the spinal cord transcriptome during MHV-induced demyelinating disease and find important biological pathways for demyelinating pathology.  We find evidence of a Th1 cytokine response, ongoing antigen presentation and lymphocyte proliferation, lipid metabolism changes, and eicosanoid inflammation.  In addition, we report several genes important for osteoclast function have augmented expression in the CNS during demyelination, suggesting a parallel between the osteoclast and microglial functions in maintaining homeostasis and the fidelity of specialized extracellular matrices in their respective compartments.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of mock-infected and MHV-infected spinal cord tissue at 33 days post-infection, the peak of demyelination.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
