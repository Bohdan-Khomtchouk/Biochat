TITLE
DNA microarrays of 4 human iPSC cell lines and the ESC cell line H9

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Documents of DNA expression of 4 human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from umbilical cord mesenchymal cells (UMCs) and amniotic mesenchymal cells (AMCs). We used microarrays to identify similarity between 4 iPSC cell lines and the human embryonic stem cell (ESC) line H9.

DESIGN
2 AMC iPSC cell lines, 2 UMC iPSC cell lines, H9 ESC cell line. TRIZOL cell lysates were prepared.
