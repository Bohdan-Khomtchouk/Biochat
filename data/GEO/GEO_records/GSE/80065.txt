TITLE
Gene expression in TAMs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify different gene expression in normal or tumor-primed peritoneal macrophages

DESIGN
Mouse peritoneal macrophages were extracted and treated with regular medium or CT-26 cell medium for 24 hours, and then subjected to microarray assays. Each group contain 3 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
