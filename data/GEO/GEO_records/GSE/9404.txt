SUMMARY
Screening of genes that respond to cryopreservation stress using yeast DNA microarray.: We studied the response of yeast cells after cryopreservation treatment using DNA microarray technology. Genes that contribute to " Cell rescue, defense and virulence, " " energy, " and " metabolism, " were significantly induced. These genes were classified as encoding heat shock proteins, oxidative stress scavenger, and enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. The expression profile of mRNA after cryopreservation treatment was calculated to be closer to that following treatment with detergent or plant oils rather than by other stress factors such as heavy metals and agricultural chemicals. These results suggest that the cryopreservation treatment caused damage to the structure of the cell wall and cellular organelles. This was supported by the localization of the products of the induced genes at the cell wall and within cellular organelles. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
