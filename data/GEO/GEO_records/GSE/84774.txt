TITLE
Integrative analysis of DNA methylation and expression during EPC differentiation_MeDIP-Seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression changes during regulated endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs). Results provide information of DNA methylation and gene expression pattern during cord-blood derived EPCs differentiation. Taken together, we discovered specific set of genes regulated by hyper- and hypo-methylation during differentiation.

DESIGN
mRNA and MeDIP seq using total RNA and genomic DNA isolated from cord blood-derived EPCs and OECs.
