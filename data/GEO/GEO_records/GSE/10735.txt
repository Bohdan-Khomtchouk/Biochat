TITLE
Microarray of Genes affected by BlxR deletion

ORGANISM
Brucella melitensis

SUMMARY
A mini-microarray containing spotted oligos corresponding to 289 B. melitensis genes was used to identify candidate genes whose transcription is influenced by BlxR.  This microarray contains genes encoding the type IV secretion system, flagella, transcriptional regulators, transporters, and proteins involved in outer membrane biogenesis, iron acquisition, and denitrification.  RNA was prepared from both B. melitensis 16M, and the blxR deletion strain, 16M(delta)blxR, grown to late log phase in TSB. Keywords: genetic modification
