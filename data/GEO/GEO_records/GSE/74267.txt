TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of Penicillium oxalicum transcription factor mutant strains in response to cellulose

ORGANISM
Penicillium oxalicum

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was used to analyze the responses of Penicillium oxalicum strains to cellulose. The transcription facor (PoflbC, CA and PoClrC) mutants were studied.

DESIGN
A total of 9 samples were analzyed, which include biological triplicates.
