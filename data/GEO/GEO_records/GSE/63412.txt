TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of contextual fear conditioning

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This dataset constitutes the first RNA-seq study of gene expression following contextual fear conditioning in the mouse hippocampus.

DESIGN
15 total samples were analyzed, including animals trained in a contexual conditioning paradigm (FC) and controls. Tissue was collected at 30 minutes (FC),  as well as 30 minutes after testing for retrieval of the memory (RT). Testing was performed at 24 hours after training over a 5-minute interval. Animals that were handled but not trained were dissected at the same time of day to control for variations due to circadian rhythms (CC3). The protocol was repeated over the course of 5 days to obtain 9 animals (2 hippocampi) per group, so that 5 independent FC experiments were represented in each time point and all animals for each group were dissected at the exactly the same time of day.
