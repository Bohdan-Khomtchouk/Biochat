TITLE
Genome-wide map of HBO1  in cancer derived human cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used ChIP-seq technology in order to map chromatin binding sites of the HBO1 MYST complex in the RKO cell line. We obtained a significant enrichment of the HBO1 signal right after TSS regions of genes and also In the proximal promoter region, with no signal on TSS. This enrichment also correlates with gene expression level.

DESIGN
HBO1 signal in RKO cell line.
