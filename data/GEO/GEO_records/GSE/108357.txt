TITLE
Randomized PAM depeletion of NmeCas9

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We report the PAMs of NmeCas9 using a cell-free TXTL-based cleavage assay. By adding randomized PAM library and NmeCas9-gRNA in vitro, functional PAM sequences were cleaved, while non-functional PAMs remained. By amplifying the non-cleaved DNA, we use next-generation sequencing to analyze the depletion of functional PAMs of NmeCas9.

DESIGN
Pam determination assay for NmeCas9

PLATFORM
GPL17769 Illumina MiSeq (synthetic construct)
