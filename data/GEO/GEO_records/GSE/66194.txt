TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of methanol-adapted Sporomusa ovata DSM-2662

ORGANISM
Sporomusa ovata DSM 2662

SUMMARY
Expression profile of wild-type S. ovata and methanol-adapted strain grown autotrophically with H2 as the source of electron.

DESIGN
Illumina RNA-Seq of total RNA extracted from a strain of S. ovata evolved by adaptive laboratory evolution to grow faster with methanol 2% as the sole susbtrate and from the wild type. The adapted strain was transfer 18 times on methanol 2%.  Total RNA was extracted from both strains growing with H2/CO2.
