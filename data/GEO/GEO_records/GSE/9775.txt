TITLE
RNAi expression experiments on Illumina BeadChip

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) were depleted of Klf2, Klf4, and Klf5 by ectopic expression of shRNA. Control RNAi was performed using shRNA against luciferase. At 2 days, 4 days and 6 days post-transfection of shRNA-encoding vectors, cells are harvested for RNA isolation. Keywords: RNAi expression, Mouse ES cells
