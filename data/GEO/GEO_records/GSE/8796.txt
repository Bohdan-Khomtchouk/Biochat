TITLE
Excessive leukotriene B4 in nucleus tractus solitarii is pro-hypertensive in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have used Affymetrix microarray-driven  gene profiling to comprehensively describe the expression of mRNAs in  the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in the adult male spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) as compared to  its normotensive parental Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) strain. Keywords: Gene expression

DESIGN
NTS was dissected from  hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive (WKY) strains of rat. For each structure, 10 independent Affymetrix Genechip 230 2.0 experiments were performed (5 SHR, 5 WKY), with each chip representing an independent biological replication (n=5).
