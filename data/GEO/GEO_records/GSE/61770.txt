TITLE
microRNA sequencing of HEK293 and H9c2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The human HEK293 / 293T and rat cardiomyoblast H9c2 cell lines are commonly employed for microRNA-mRNA interaction studies. Here, I provide microRNA sequencing data obtained from each of these lines to better document which microRNAs are endogenously expressed at high or low levels.

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing profiles were generated from cultured HEK293 and H9c2 cells on Illumina HiSeq 2000 instruments.
