TITLE
DDB2 regulates gene expression in ovarian cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DDB2 has been suggested to function as a transcription regulator in various cancer cell lines. We stably overexpressed DDB2 in ovarian cancer cell line A2780-CP70, and compared the gene expression profiles between DDB2-overexpressed and empty vector-transfected cells.

DESIGN
Empty vector and DDB2-expressing vector were transfected into A2780-CP70 separately. The stable transfection clones were selected, and gene expression patterns in these clones were investigated through microarray analysis.
