TITLE
Exposure of Barrett's associated adenocarcinoma cell lines SKGT4 to deoxycholic acid (DCA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The involvment of bile acids such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) in gastro-esophageal reflux disease and subsequent Barrett’s metaplsia has been postulated. This study examines gene expression induced by exposure to DCA in esophageal cells and may be utilised in cross-comparisons with data derived from gene expression studies of Barrett’s esophagus and associated adenocarcinoma.

DESIGN
SKGT4 cells were exposed to 300um DCA over 24 hours in duplicate experiments including matched timepoint controls. RNA samples were taken at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours from DCA (DCA) exposed and resting (REST) timepoint controls.
