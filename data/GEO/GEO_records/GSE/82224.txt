TITLE
Effects of SOCS2-AS1 inhibition in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and AR downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. We identified a novel androgen-regulated long non-coding (lnc) RNA, SOCS2-AS1.

DESIGN
In order to investigate the SOCS2-AS1 function in prostate cancer cells, we performed gene expression in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and LTAD) after siSOCS2-AS1 or siSOCS2 treatment. We also treated cells with vehicle or androgen to analyzed the effects of siSOCS2-AS1 on AR function. Observation of androgen dependent gene expression changes after treatmet with siSOCS2-AS1 with microarray.
