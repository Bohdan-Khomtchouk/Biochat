TITLE
Hep3B time-course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A time-course (T0, 15, 30 min, 1, 3, 6 or 16 hours) of mRNA abundance changes was studied in the human Hep3B hepatoma cell line challenged with a pro-inflammatory cytokine-enriched medium (CM,conditionned medium) vs control medium (NCM,non conditionned medium). Paired cultures prepared from a same batch of trypsinized cells were challenged with CM vs NCM for a given length of time and this was repeated in three independent experiments (S1,S2,S3). Keywords: time-course
