TITLE
Deep Sequencing Leads to the Identification of Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 5A as a Key Element in Rsv1-Mediated Lethal Systemic Hypersensitive Response to Soybean Mosaic Virus Infection in Soybean

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
We reported a genome-wide investigation to gain insight into the molecular signaling pathway involved in SMV G7 provoking Rsv1-mediated LSHR based on sRNA-seq, degradome-seq and transcriptome-seq analysis.

DESIGN
mRNA, miRNAs and degradome profiles of Rsv1-genotype soybean (PI96983) after 14 days post-inoculation (dpi) by SMV-L (avirulent strain), SMV-G7 (virulent strain) and Mock (control) were generated by deep sequencing, pooled from three biological replicates (5 plants in each replicate) for each treatment, using Illumina Miseq.

PLATFORM
GPL21309 Illumina MiSeq (Glycine max)
