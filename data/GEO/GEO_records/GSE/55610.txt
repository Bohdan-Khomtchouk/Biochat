TITLE
Differential gene expression profilings between diploid and triploid Fujian Oyster

ORGANISM
Crassostrea angulata

SUMMARY
The systematic deep sequencing analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptome complexity of 2n and 3n Fujian oyster. This information broadens our understanding of the mechanisms of C.angulata polyploidization and contributes to molecular and genetic research by enriching the oyster database. This is the first report on genome-wide transcriptional analysis of adductor muscle of diploid and triploid Fujian oyster and has demonstrated triploid oysters are morphologically almost identical to their diploid counterparts, but have faster growth, due to the reorientation of energetic allocation from gametogenesis to somatic investment. This study provides a foundation for further analysis of the gene expression patterns and signaling pathways which regulate the molecular mechanisms of diploid and triploid oyster.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different samples, including diploid (DF and DM) and triplod(T) oyster.

PLATFORM
GPL18377 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Crassostrea angulata)
