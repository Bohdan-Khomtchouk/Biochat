TITLE
Global gene expression of nasal epithelial cells in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of nasal epithelial cells from adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and from non allergic controls. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with inflammatory responses in nasal mucosa.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from nasal epithelial cells of 7 seasonal allergic rhinitis patients and 5 non-allergic control subjects
