TITLE
Dicer Partner Proteins Tune the Length of Mature miRNAs in Flies and Mammals

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Drosophila Dicer-1 produces microRNAs (miRNAs) from pre-miRNA, whereas Dicer-2 generates small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from long dsRNA. loquacious (loqs) encodes three Dicer partner proteins, Loqs-PA, Loqs-PB, and, Loqs-PD, generated by alternative splicing. To understand the function of each Loqs isoform, we constructed loqs isoform-specific rescue flies. Loqs-PD promotes siRNA production in vivo by Dicer-2. Loqs-PA or Loqs-PB is required for viability, but the proteins are not fully redundant: Loqs-PB is required to produce a specific subset of miRNAs. Surprisingly, Loqs-PB tunes the product size cleaved by Dicer-1 from pre-miR-307a, generating a longer miRNA isoform with a distinct seed sequence and target specificity. The mouse and human Dicer-binding partner TRBP, a homolog of Loqs-PB, similarly tunes the site of pre-miR-132 cleavage by mammalian Dicer. Thus, Dicer-binding partner proteins can change the choice of cleavage site by Dicer, producing miRNAs with different target specificities than those that would be made by Dicer alone.

DESIGN
Examination of Dicer-binding proteins on small RNA profiles of female fly heads, fly ovaries, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and mouse tail fibroblasts.
