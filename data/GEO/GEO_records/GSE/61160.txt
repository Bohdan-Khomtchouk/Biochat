TITLE
Codeletion of 1p and 19q Determines Distinct Gene Methylation and Expression Profiles in IDH-mutated Oligodendroglial Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of oligodendroglial tumors (OTs) and five non tumoral brain tissue (NTBT) samples. The Illumina Infinium Human DNA methylation 450k Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in tumoral samples. Samples included 46 OTs and 5 NTBT.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 51 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
