TITLE
Life on the edge: Functional genomic response of Ignicoccus hospitalis to cellular takeover by Nanoarchaeum equitans

ORGANISM
Ignicoccus hospitalis KIN4/I

SUMMARY
Investigation of changes in global gene expression patterns as Ignicoccus hospitalis becomes increasingly populated by Nanoarchaeum equitans These microarray data are complemented by shot gun proteomics (see manuscript)

DESIGN
A total of 16 chips were used (each experimental sample was done in duplicate, totally 8 samples) to examine total RNA from I. hospiatalis over a time course grown in pure culture and in co-culture with N. equitans.
