TITLE
Analysis of miRNA expression profiling in 3 samples(normal, cigarette smoking and lung cancer population's serum)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive miRNA array, we determined the serum miRNAs profiles of 10 non-smokers, 10 smokers and 10 lung cancer patients by miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Arrays. Differential expressed miRNAs were further validated in a larger scale samples. We found that let-7i-3p and miR-154-5p were significantly downregulation in serum of smokers and lung cancer patients. The serum level of let-7i-3p and miR-154-5p is associated with smoking and smoking-related lung cancer.

DESIGN
In this study,  we mix 10 samples with equal volume of each group(non-smoking control group,smoking group and lung cancer group ) and run RNA extractions. And then miRCURYTM LNA Array (v.16.0) was applied in the studying of miRNA expression profile and its alteration to gain the miRNA expression profile to compare the variety between each two groups respectively.
