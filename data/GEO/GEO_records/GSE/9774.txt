TITLE
ChIP-chip on custom NimbleGen genomic tiling arrays

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Performing Chromatin IP of Klf2, Klf4, Klf5 and p53 in mouse embryonic stem cells with NimbleGen custom genomic tiling arrays, we sought to decipher Klf2, Klf4, Klf5-regulated genes. Keywords: genomic tiling arrays, ES cells

DESIGN
12 samples: Chromatin IP of Klf2, Klf4, Klf5 and p53 in mouse embryonic stem cells with NimbleGen custom genomic tiling arrays; three independent experimental replicates for each experimental condition were  performed.
