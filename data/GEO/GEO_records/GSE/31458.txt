TITLE
Expression data from na√Øve and MPTP-exposed cholinergic transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PD  is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide with growing prevalence. MPTP is a neurotoxin which causes the appearance of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology.  The involvement of the cholinergic system in PD has been identified decades ago and anti-cholinergic drugs were upon the first drugs used for symptomatic treatment of PD. Of note, MPTP intoxication is a model of choice for symptomatic neuroprotective therapies since it have been quite predictive. Mice were exposed to the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), with or without the protective acetylcholinesterase (AChE-R) variant. Transgenic AChE-S (the synaptic variant), AChE-R (the shorter, protective variant) and FVB/N control mice were included in this study. Two brain regions were examined: the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and the striatal caudate-putamen (CPu). Each condition (i.e brain region and transgenic variant) was examined on both naive and MPTP-exposed mice.

DESIGN
29 microarrays including hybridizations of control FVB/N PFC, control FVB/N CPu,control S transgenics PFC, control S transgenics CPu, control R transgenics PFC, control R transgenice CPu,  MPTP FVB/N PFC, MPTP FVB/N CPu, MPTP S transgenics PFC, MPTP S transgenics CPu, MPTP R transgenics PFC and MPTP R transgenice CPu mRNA.
