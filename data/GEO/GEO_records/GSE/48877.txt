TITLE
The 8q24 Enhancer Region including rs6983267 Directly Interacts with Promoter of Oncogenic LncRNA CARLo-5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanism by which rs6983267 at 8q24.21 increases cancer risk is unclear for the lack of protein?coding genes in the region although the variant is strongly associated with cancer pathogenesis. Here we identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) near the 8q24 region and show that expression of lncRNA CARLo-5 is significantly correlated with the risk allele of the cancer-associated variant rs6883267. We further report that the 8q24 enhancer region including the variant directly interacts with active regulatory region of the lncRNA CARLo-5 promtoer. Finally, we demonstrate that CARLo-5 has an oncogenic function by regulating cell proliferation and cell-cycle. Our data provide new insight of disease-related variants in a gene desert.

DESIGN
Comparison and identification of cell cycle-related genes differentially expressed by CARLo-5 knockdown using Nanostring analysis in HCT116 cells.
