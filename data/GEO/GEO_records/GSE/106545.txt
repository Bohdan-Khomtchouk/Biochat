TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and AXL-/- astrocytes Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study are to compare Wild Type astrocytes transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) to AXL-/- astrocytes transcriptome profiling and to explore the mechanism by which AXL interferes with type I IFN signaling in WT astrocytes. We performed an RNA-Seq analysis of WT and AXL-/- U-251MG cells in the absence of ZIKV. Surprisingly, the intrinsic level of type I IFN signaling was lower in AXL-/- cells than in WT cells. This result was further confirmed by RT-qPCR

DESIGN
U251 mRNA profiles of wild type (WT) and AXL-/- cells were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, usingIllumina Hiseq, PE150.

PLATFORM
