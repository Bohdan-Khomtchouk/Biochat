TITLE
Clr4/Suv39 and RNA quality control factors cooperate to trigger RNAi and suppress antisense RNA (expression)

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Expression profile of Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome  in ∆mlo3, mlo3-A, mlo3-A∆h2a.z,  ∆cid14∆h2a.z and mlo3-A∆cid14 cells. Expression profile of mutant cells compared to wild-type cells.

DESIGN
Agilent 60mer oligonucleotide custom array containing probes spanning large portion of chromosome 2 at 50bp resolution was used to profile expression levels in mutant cells and to compare them to levels in wild-type cells.

PLATFORM
GPL8908 NCI S. pombe 44K C50
