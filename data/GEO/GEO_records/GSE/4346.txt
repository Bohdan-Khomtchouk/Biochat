TITLE
Global gene expression in Moraxella catarrhalis ATCC 43617 grown under iron-replete and iron-limiting conditions

ORGANISM
Moraxella catarrhalis

SUMMARY
Total RNA samples were isolated from M. catarrhalis grown in BHI (iron-replete condition, designated DF0) and in BHI containing 30 mM Desferal (iron-limiting condition, designated DF30).  Total RNA and M. catarrhalis genome-directed primers (GDPs) were used for synthesis of Cy3- or Cy5-labeled cDNA samples.  Three independent M. catarrhalis growth experiments and total RNA isolations were used for synthesis of cDNA samples, and a total of six DNA microarray hybridizations were performed in this study. Keywords: Effect of Growth Environment on Global Gene Expression by Moraxella catarrhalis

DESIGN
A Moraxella catarrhalis DNA microarray was constructed based on the nucleotide sequence of the genome of M. catarrhalis strain ATCC 43617.  The ORFs in the genome were identified by using GLIMMER 2.02.  The 1,761 annotated ORFs were used to design 70-mer oligonucleotides that would specifically anneal to each ORF.  Because genome-directed primers that annealed within the 3' 30% of each ORF were used to synthesize cDNA, each 70-mer probe was designed to anneal to a region within the 5' 70% of each ORF.
