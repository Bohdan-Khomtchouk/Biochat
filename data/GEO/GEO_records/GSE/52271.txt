TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of the functional DNA methylation landscape at base-pair resolution in human cancer types [BS-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome bisulphite sequencing of 13 human cancer samples and 9 normal controls. The main goal is to find the Diffrenetial methylated regions (DMR) at Genome wide level in different tissues and cancer types

DESIGN
Sequencing of bisulfite converted DNA human cancer samples and normal control tissue types.

PLATFORM
