TITLE
Continue study of the roles of galectins in parasitic infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our laboratory previously reported that galectins may act as parasite recognizing molecules (Leishmania) (JBC 277:17663 and JBC 278:22223).  Now we are studying the role of galectin-3 in leishmaniasis in vivo, using G3KO mice.

DESIGN
Thus, we analyzed RNA from leuckotyes of draining lymph nodes of both KO and WT mice at 3 different time points using gene microarrays.
