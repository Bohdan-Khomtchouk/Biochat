TITLE
HITS-CLIP analysis of Yb binding sites in Drosophila ovary cell line

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
piRNAs direct Piwi to repress transposons to maintain genome integrity in Drosophila ovarian somatic cells. piRNA maturation and association with Piwi occur at perinuclear Yb bodies, the centers of piRNA biogenesis. Here, we show that piRNA intermediates arising from the piRNA cluster flamenco (flam) concentrate into perinuclear foci adjacent to Yb bodies, termed Flam bodies. Although flam expression is not required for Yb body formation, Yb, the core component of Yb bodies, is required for Flam body formation. Abolishment of the RNA-binding activity of Yb disrupts both Yb bodies and Flam bodies. Loss of Zucchini, an endoribonuclease necessary for piRNA maturation, enlarges Flam bodies, which now superimpose with Yb bodies. Yb directly binds flam, but not neighboring protein-coding gene, transcripts. Thus, Yb integrates piRNA processing factors and piRNA intermediates into Yb bodies and Flam bodies, respectively, through direct binding to enhance piRNA biogenesis and formation of piRNA-inducing silencing complexes.

DESIGN
HITS-CLIP was performed using OSC (Ovarian Somatic Cells). The antibody for Drosophila Yb, which was generated in this study, was used. Obtained CLIP tags were analyzed using illumina HiSeq200.
