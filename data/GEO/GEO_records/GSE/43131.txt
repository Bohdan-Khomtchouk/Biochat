TITLE
Genomic copy number aberrations in primary lung squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosomal instability is one of the hallmarks of tumors, which can result in the gain or loss of specific genomic regions or even entire chromosomes.  These copy number aberrations (CNAs) play an important role in carcinogenesis and malignant progression through CNA-induced gene expression alterations and, subsequently, key cancer-specific processes.  In the current study, we applied aCGH analysis to screen out CNAs with potential prognostic value in lung SCC patients.

DESIGN
Depending on their survival time, 100 patients with primary SCC were separated into high- or low-risk groups of prognosis, and copy number aberration (CNA) were analyzed by array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH).
