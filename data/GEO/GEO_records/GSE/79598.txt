TITLE
Expression data from H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) infected with either lentiviral non-silencing shRNA or shRUNX1, and differentiated to early mesendoderm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression during early hESC differentiation to mesendoderm using FBS, with and without RUNX1 depletion.

DESIGN
Samples of hESCs were taken at undifferentiated state (0h), 8h of differentiation, 24h of differentiation, and 72h of differentiation with three replicates at each time point; (A, B, and C) for the non-silencing timecourse, and (C, D, and E) for the shRUNX1 timecourse.
