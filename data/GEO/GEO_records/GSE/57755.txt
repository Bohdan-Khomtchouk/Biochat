TITLE
Methylation Changes in Arabidopsis Mature Green Seed Parts

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Seeds are comprised of three major parts of distinct parental origin: the seed coat, embryo, and endosperm. The maternally-derived seed coat is important for nurturing and protecting the seeds during development. By contrast, the embryo and the endosperm are derived from a double fertilization event, where one sperm fertilizes the egg to form the diploid zygote and the other sperm fertilizes the central cell to form the triploid endosperm. Each seed part undergoes distinct developmental programs during seed development. What methylation changes occur in the different seed parts, if any, remains unknown. To uncover the possible role of DNA methylation in different parts of the seed, we characterized the methylome of two major parts of Arabidopsis mature green stage seeds, the seed coat and embryo, using Illumina sequencing.

DESIGN
Illumina sequencing of bisulfite-converted genomic DNA from two parts of Arabidopsis mature green seeds: seed coat (SC) and embryo (EMB).

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
