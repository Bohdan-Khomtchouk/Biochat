TITLE
Expression data from liver of the KRAP deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
KRAP (Ki-ras-induced actin-interacting protein) is a cytoskeleton-associated protein and a ubiquitous protein among tissues, originally identified as a cancer-related molecule.  KRAP-deficient (KRAP-/-) mice show enhanced metabolic rate, decreased adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, hypoinsulinemia and hypoleptinemia.  KRAP-/- mice are also protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance despite of hyperphagia.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from livers of three pairs of littermates (KO1 vs. WT1, KO2 vs. WT2 and KO3 vs. WT3) fed normal chow.
