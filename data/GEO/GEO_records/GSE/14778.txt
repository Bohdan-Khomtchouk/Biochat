TITLE
Gene expression profiling of rice seedling with 2-azahypoxanthine

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rings or arcs of fungus-stimulated plant growth occur often on the floor of woodlands which are commonly called “fairy rings”. We purified a plant growth-stimulating compound, 2-azahypoxanthine (AHX), from the fairy ring-forming fungus Lepista sordida, and the detection of AHX in the fungus-infected soil near the growth-stimulated turfgrass roots. The growth-promoting activity of AHX towards rice was further analyzed by oligo DNA microarrays.
