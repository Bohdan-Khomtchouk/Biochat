TITLE
Expression data from PEG-GNRs treated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression treated with PEG-GNRs and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
HREC treated with PEG-GNRs were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain expression profiles for Human retinal micro endothelial cells (HREC) treated with PEG-GNRs.We divided two groups: (T1) control group were cultured HREC without treatment (T2) PEG-GNRs treated group were HREC treated with 100μg/mL PEG-GNRs

PLATFORM
