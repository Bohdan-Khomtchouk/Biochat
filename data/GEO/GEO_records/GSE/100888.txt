TITLE
Transcriptional effects of motor neuron autophagy inhibition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of motor neuron autophagy in ALS, we generated mice in which the critical autophagy gene Atg7 was specifically disrupted in motor neurons (Atg7 cKO). We also bred these mice to the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. Then we performed RNA sequencing on lumbar spinal cords from these mice to determine how motor neuron autophagy inhibition altered gene expression.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of lumbar spinal cords from four biological replicates each of 150 day-old Atg7 cWT, Atg7 cWT; SOD1G93A, Atg7 cKO and Atg7 cKO; SOD1G93A mice

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
