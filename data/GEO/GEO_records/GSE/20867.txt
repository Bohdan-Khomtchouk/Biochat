TITLE
Genome-wide maps of RAP1 binding sites.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with ultra-high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we find that RAP1 binds to telomeres as well as to extra-telomeric sites through the (TTAGGG)2 consensus motif. Extra-telomeric RAP1 binding sites are particularly abundant at subtelomeric regions, and this is in agreement with preferential deregulation of subtelomeric genes in Rap1-deficient cells. Significantly, more than 70% of extratelomeric RAP1 binding sites are located in the vicinity of known genes and about 40% of the genes deregulated in Rap1-null cells contain binding sites for RAP1, suggesting a role of RAP1 in transcriptional control.

DESIGN
Examination of RAP1 binding by CHIP-seq in two independent wild-type mefs using as negative control two independent RAP1-deleted mefs

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
