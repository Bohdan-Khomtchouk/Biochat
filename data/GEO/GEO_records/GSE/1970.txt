SUMMARY
RNA from all normal tissues were pooled in equal amounts and used to create the normal tissue library. RNA from all immune stimulated tissues (Salmonella infection, CT+LPS, and PBC, with and without cycloheximide) were pooled in equal amounts and used to create the immune stimulated tissue library. The subtracted library was created by combining the normal and immune stimulated libraries and by subtracting porcine fibroblast RNA. Keywords: other
