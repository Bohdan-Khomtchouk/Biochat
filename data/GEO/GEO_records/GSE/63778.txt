TITLE
Distinct roles of Brd2 and Brd4 in potentiating the transcriptional program for Th17 cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the ChIP-seq data of Brd2 and Brd4 in Th17 cells. We find that Brd2 and Brd4 have distinct genome-wide deposition in Th17 cells, further experiments reveal tht Brd2 faciliates TF-complex formation in enhancers, enhancer-promoter interaction while Brd4 enhances transcriptional elongation.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq study of Brd2, Cohesin and Brd4 in Th17 cells. Additional samples include Nipbl, Smc1, Smc3 ChIP-seq samples. The Th17 cells are differentiated for 48hrs and ChIP with the corresponding antibodies and ChIP-seq libraries are made. Additional samples are intended to determine the global occupancy of cohesin proteins.
