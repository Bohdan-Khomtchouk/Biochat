TITLE
Skn-1-deficient effect on the gastrocnemius

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gastrocnemius from male wild type(WT) and Skn-1-deficient mice. Skn-1-deficient mice have reduced body weight with low body fat due to increased energy expenditure. Results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms up-regulating metabolism.

DESIGN
Using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array, we compared global gene expression on the gastrocnemius between Skn-1-deficient mice and WT mice after 18h fasting
