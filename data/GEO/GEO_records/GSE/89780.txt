TITLE
Classifying chemical endocrine activity using transcriptome profiling in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We employed whole-genome microarray expression profiling in 48 hpf zebrafish as a tool to classify the activity of 25 endocrine disrupting chemicals

DESIGN
Chemical-induced transcriptional changes were measured in 48 hpf embryos exposed to vehicle control of the effective concentration where 80% of the exposed population has an adverse effect (EC80) from 6-48 hpf. Four biological replicates of 8 pooled whole embryos were used for each treatment Please note that nine samples were removed from analysis due to outlier detection (resulting in 107 samples included in the records, out of total 116 samples).

PLATFORM
GPL20686 Agilent-069507 ArrayXS_Danio_rerio_V1 (Probe Name version)
