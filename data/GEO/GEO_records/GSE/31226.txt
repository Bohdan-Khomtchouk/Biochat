TITLE
Heat-shock protein 90 globally targets paused promoters and regulates environment-induced gene expression

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In this study we provide evidence that Hsp90 binds chromatin at specific sites close to several TSS in Drosophila S2 cell line. In addition of finding a preference for stalled promoter regions of annotated genes, we uncover many intergenic Hsp90 binding sites coinciding with non-annotated transcription start sites. Interestingly, this set includes promoters for primary transcripts of microRNA genes, thereby expanding the scope of Hsp90 to transcriptional control of many genes. We finally conclude that Hsp90 contacts NelfE and thus regulates pol II pausing.

DESIGN
Our Dataset comprises of 1 ChIP-seq sample using chromatin from S2 cells which was immunoprecipitated, using antibodies against Drosophila Hsp90. The two biological replicates are submitted along with the input replicates.
