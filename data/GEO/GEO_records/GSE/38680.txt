TITLE
GAA deficiency (Pompe Disease) in infantile-onset patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pompe disease is a genetic disorder resulting from a deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) that manifests as a clinical spectrum with regard to symptom severity and rate of progression. In this study, we used microarrays to examine gene expression from the muscle of two cohorts of infantile-onset Pompe patients to identify transcriptional differences that may contribute to the disease phenotype. We found strong similarities among the gene expression profiles generated from biceps and quadriceps, and identified a number of signaling pathways altered in both cohorts. We also found that infantile-onset Pompe patient muscle had a gene expression pattern characteristic of immature or regenerating muscle, and exhibited many transcriptional markers of inflammation, despite having few overt signs of inflammatory infiltrate. Further, we identified genes exhibiting correlation between expression at baseline and response to therapy. This combined dataset can serve as a foundation for biological discovery and biomarker development to improve the treatment of Pompe disease.

DESIGN
Biceps biopsies from 9 infantile-onset Pompe patients and 10 controls were compared.  In a separate experiment, quadriceps biopsies from 11 Pompe patients at either 0, 12, or 52 weeks after the initiation of treatment with rhGAA were compared to quadriceps biopsies from 7 controls.  No technical replicates were included.
