TITLE
Expression data of TAGLN-overexpressing RKO human colon cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transgelin was the top-ranked marker of metastatic potential identified in the comparison of node-positive colorectal cancer (CRC) versus node-negative CRC in our previous study. Transgelin is localized in the nucleus of cultured CRC cells and microRNA-mediated knockdown of TAGLN (the gene encoding transgelin) expression modulates the expression of genes involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. We performed gene expression profiling on control and transgelin-overexpressing RKO cells using Affymetrix microarray technology.

DESIGN
The plasmid carrying TAGLN was generated using the pcDNA6.2/EmGFP-Bsd/V5-DEST vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the pDONR221-TAGLN-mut plasmid from a previous study by an LR recombination reaction ( ). After lipofectamine-mediated transfection of the TAGLN-carrying plasmid or the vector-only control plasmid, stable transfectants were selected and cultured in medium containing 25 Î¼g/ml blasticidin followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Six samples were obtained from three independent experiments (technical replicates).
