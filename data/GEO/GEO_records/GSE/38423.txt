TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Pseudomonas syringae pv phaseolicola at low temperature

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. phaseolicola

SUMMARY
In order to obtain a global view about the strategies used by phytopathogenic bacteria, in response to physiologically relevant temperature changes. We used the DNA microarray technology to compare gene expression profile in the model bacterial pathogen P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS3121 grown at 18 ºC and 28ºC.

DESIGN
To carry out this study, we used this DNA microarray of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS3121. Each microarray experiment was repeated six times; two technical replicates with the same RNA samples and three biological replicates using RNA isolated from a different culture.
