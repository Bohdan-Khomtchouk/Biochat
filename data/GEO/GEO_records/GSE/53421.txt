TITLE
Long term demasculinization of X-linked intergenic noncoding RNAs in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Recent studies have revealed key roles of non-coding RNAs in sex-related pathways, but little is known about the evolutionary forces acting on these non-coding RNAs. We used whole-genome tiling arrays to profile the transcriptome of Drosophila melanogaster tissues and found that 15% of male-biased transcribed fragments (transfrags) are intergenic non-coding RNAs (incRNAs), suggesting a potentially important role for incRNAs in sex-related biological processes. Statistical analysis revealed a paucity of male-biased incRNAs and coding genes on the X chromosome, suggesting that similar evolutionary forces could be affecting the genomic organization of both coding and non-coding genes. Expression profiling across germline and somatic tissues further suggests that both male meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) and sexual antagonism contribute to the chromosomal distribution of male-biased incRNAs. Comparative sequence analysis shows that the evolutionary age of male-biased incRNAs is a significant predictor of their chromosomal locations. In addition to identifying abundant sex-biased incRNAs in fly genome, our work unveils a global picture of the complex interplay between non-coding RNAs and sexual chromosome evolution.

DESIGN
We used whole-genome tiling arrays to assess sex-biased transcription in D. melanogaster adult whole bodies, and testis, ovary, and accessory gland samples. Gut and thorax, tissues expected to exhibit little or no sex-biased expression, were included as controls. Expression was measured in 2-4 replicates for each tissue.
