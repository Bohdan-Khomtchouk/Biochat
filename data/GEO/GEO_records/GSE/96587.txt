TITLE
Gene expression profiles in the liver of spontaneously hypertensive rats at different stages of hypertension

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to characterize differences in the global gene expression profiles of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) at different stages of hypertension. Using RNA isolated from liver of SHR and WKY rats, we compared the gene expression profiles by microarrays. Differential gene expression was detected in the liver of SHR rats compared to WKY control rats, possibly contributing to hypertension

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, WKY vs. SHR1 liver tissue, WKY vs. SHR3 liver tissue, SHR1 vs. SHR3 liver tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL23179 Rattus norvegicus 5K
