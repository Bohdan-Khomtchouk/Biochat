TITLE
Renal cells Carcinoma (RCC) Genome variation profiling by genome tiling array with Agilent CGH array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is the second most frequent renal cell carcinomas (RCC) after clear cell RCC. In contrast to clear cell RCC, there is no consensual protocol using targeted therapy for metastatic pRCC. Moreover, diagnosis of some pRCC, especially pRCC of type 2 (pRCC2) may be challenging. Our aim was to identify molecular biomarkers that could be helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of pRCC.

DESIGN
9 samples was analysed by arrayCGH method using Agilen recommendations. Sample was labeled in Cy5 and co-hybridized with control DNA cy3 labeled.
