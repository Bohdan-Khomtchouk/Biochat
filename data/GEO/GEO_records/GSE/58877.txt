TITLE
Gene Expression in Taxol Resistance SKOV3 Cells (II)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the differences in gene expression between parental SKOV3 cells and the two taxol-resistant cell lines SKOV3/Tx50 and SKOV3/Tx600.

DESIGN
Two Taxol resistant cell lines were established by stepwise increasing Taxol concentration. RNA from these resistant lines and its parental SKOV3 cells were labeled with Cy5 and were hybridized to oligo DNA array. Signals were scanned and analyzed to find out the candidate genes involved in Taxol resistant mechanism.
