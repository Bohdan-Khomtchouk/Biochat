TITLE
Effect of OVO-like 1 knockdown on global transcript expression in differentiated BeWo trophoblast cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We had previously discovered that the transcription factor OVO-like 1 (OVOL1) was highly induced during trophoblast differentiation. In this study, we used an lentiviral shRNA strategy to decrease OVOL1 expression in BeWo trophoblast cells. Control cells were transduced with shRNAs targeting no known mammalian transcript (shCont). Following stimulation of differentiation (48h exposure to 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate), a RNA-seq approach was used to determine global transcript differences in OVOL1-knockdown cells compared to control cells.

DESIGN
Trophoblast cells transduced with control shRNAs were used as controls. Cells transduced with shRNAs targeting OVOL1 were used as treatment. All cells received 250 uM 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate to stimulate differentiation. Three independent replicates of control and treatment groups were analyzed.
