TITLE
The induction of integrin beta3 signaling in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the molecules involved in beta3 integrin signaling in HSCs, we carried out DNA microarray analyses using HSCs stimulated with ligand-mimic antibody for intetegrin beta3 in the presence of stem cell factor(SCF) and/or thrombopoietin (TPO). All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate using sorted cells that were independently prepared in separate experiments.

DESIGN
After CD34-KSL HSCs were cultured with 2C9.G2 or control IgG for 5 days in S-Clone SF-03 medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml SCF and/or 50 ng/ml TPO, gene expression profiles were examimed using 5,000 sorted CD48-KSL cells from each sample.
