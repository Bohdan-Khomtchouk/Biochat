TITLE
MicroRNA expression in the glomerulus of C57BL/6 mice and B6.MRLc1 glomerulonephritis mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In isolated glomeruli by beads-perfusion methods, microRNA (miRNA) expression was analyzed in healthy C57BL/6 and B6.MRLc1 glomerulonephritis mice. The expression of 1,135 miRNAs was examined, and up-regulated or down-regulated miRNA was determined. These results provide a basical information of molecular pathology in glomerulonephritis.

DESIGN
The glomeruli were collected from female C57BL/6 (n=3, 9-month-old, healthy control) and female B6.MRLc1 (n=3, 14-month-old, early stage of glomerulonephritis; n=3, 9-month-old, late stage of glomerulonephritis). The total RNA sample was purified, and total 1,135 microRNA expression was compared among healthy, early stage, and late stage.
