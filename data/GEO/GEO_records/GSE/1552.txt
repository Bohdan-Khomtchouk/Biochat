TITLE
gene activation by IFNs in wild type and Pias1 null BMMs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was designed to study the effect of PIAS1 on interferon (IFN) signaling pathway by comparing the gene activation profiles of wild type and Pias1 null cells in response to IFN treatments. Microarray analysis was performed essentially following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Affymetrix). Briefly, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from wile type or Pias1 null littermates were either untreated, or treated with IFN-beta (500 U/ml) or IFN-gamma (10 ng/ml) for 2h or 4h. Total RNA was prepared with RNA-STAT60 (TEL-TEST) and purified with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Double stranded complementary DNA was synthesized from 20 ug of total RNA according to Affymetrix methodology, and purified with Phase Lock Gels (Eppendorf). Biotin-labeled RNA was synthesized with the BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo). Samples were cleaned, fragmentated and hybridized to murine genome (MGU74Av2) Genechips (Affymetrix) as instructed. GeneChips were stained with phycoerythrin-streptavidin (Molecular Probes) and scanned with a GeneChip scanner (Affymetrix). Keywords: parallel sample
