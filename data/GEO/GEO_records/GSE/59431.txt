TITLE
Effect of PML/RARA on the transcriptome of preleukemic early promyelocytes vs PML/RARA-Flt3ITD leukemic promyelocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of murine cells expressing PML/RARA at the early promyelocyte stage (4 weeks old, preleukemic) and in full blown PML/RARA leukemia generated by transducing PML/RARA bone marrow with a Flt3-ITD retroviral vector

DESIGN
Two-conditions experiment: preleukemic early promyelocytes vs leukemic promyelocytes
