TITLE
Alternative splicing regulation by homologous Muscleblind proteins

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We provide data showing alternative splicing regulation by Muscleblind proteins in MEFs. MEFs lacking functional Muscleblind (DKO MEFs) were stably reconstituted with Muscleblind proteins from Homo sapiens, Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans or Trichoplax adhaerens and splicing regulation was explored using RNA-seq analysis followed by MISO (Mixture of Isoforms).

DESIGN
Alternative splicing was accessed using RNA-sequencing data from five DKO MEF lines reconstituted with different GFP-tagged Muscleblind homologs or GFP alone and compared to RNA-seq data from three WT MEF lines and three control DKO MEFs (no Muscleblind reconstitution). A total of 12 samples were used for high-throughput sequencing.
