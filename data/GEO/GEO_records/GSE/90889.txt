TITLE
Expression data for hiPSC-derived RPE treated with 10mM Nicotinamide or vehicle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We did the RNA-seq analysis to examine the global impact of Nicotinamide (NAM) on hiPSC-derived RPE transcriptome in order to better understand the mechanism of action of NAM. NAM inhibited the expression of Age related Macular degeneration (AMD) associated protein transcripts in hiPSC-derived RPE.

DESIGN
Seven hiPSC-RPE lines (4 AMD donors and 3 Control donors) that had been cultured with 10mM NAM or vehicle for three weeks were used for RNA extraction and RNA-seq analysis. We treated 4 AMD hiPSC-RPE and 3 Control hiPSC-RPE lines with 10mM NAM or vehicle.
