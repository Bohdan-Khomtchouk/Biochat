TITLE
Spt6 regulates intragenic and antisense transcription, nucleosome positioning, and histone modifications genome-wide in fission yeast [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Spt6 is a highly conserved histone chaperone that interacts directly with both RNA polymerase II and histones to regulate gene expression.  To gain a comprehensive understanding of the requirements for this critical factor, we have performed genome-wide analyses of transcription, chromatin structure, and histone modifications in an S. pombe spt6 mutant.  Our results demonstrate several dramatic changes to transcription and chromatin structure in the spt6 mutant, including an elevation of antisense transcripts at over 70 percent of all genes and general loss of the +1 nucleosome.  Furthermore, Spt6 is required for the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysines 4 and 36, marks associated with active transcription.  Taken together, our results indicate that Spt6 is critical for the accuracy of transcription and the integrity of chromatin, likely via its direct interactions with RNA polymerase II and histones.
