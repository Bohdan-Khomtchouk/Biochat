TITLE
Impaired post-ischemic angiogenesis in rats with chronic kidney disease

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Impaired post-ischemic angiogenesis in rats with chronic kidney disease: underlying changes in ischemia-induced early regulation of gene expression We investigated potential molecular mechanisms underlying impaired angiogenesis by a systematic comparison of early gene expression in response to ischemia in rats with or without CKD

DESIGN
CKD was induced in male rats by 5/6 nephrectomy (SNX); control rats were sham operated (sham). Eight weeks later, ischemia of the right limb was induced by ligation and resection of the femoral artery. Rats were sacrificed 24 hours after the onset of ischemia, and RNA was extracted from the musculus soleus of the ischemic and the nonischemic hindlimb. RNA was isolated and subjected to Affymetrix gene chip analysis
