TITLE
Epigenetic Effects of Maternal Obesity on Wharton's Jelly (WJ) Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs): Implications For Cellular Therapy. (methylation study)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
7 WJ-MSC lines from non-obese BMI < 25 kg/m2 were compared with 7 WJ-MSC lines obese BMI > 30 kg/m2.  No template was used as a negative control Triplicates for each line were analyses for epigenome-wide methylation ( > 480,000 CpG sites) using Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip Kit (Illumina).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA (500 ng/sample) from the 15 samples (triplicates from 14 lines + 3 repiclates from no template samples) were hybridised to the Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip Kit (Illumina)

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
