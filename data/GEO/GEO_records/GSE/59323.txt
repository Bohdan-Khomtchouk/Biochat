TITLE
Expression of miRNA induced by SDF-1/CXCR4 system on oral cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined the metastasis-related miRNAs induced by SDF-1/CXCR4 system, using oral cancer cells.  Consequently, we identified 4 kinds of upregulated-miRNAs in B88-SDF-1.

DESIGN
The metastasis-related miRNAs induced by SDF-1/CXCR4 system in oral cancer are largely unknown.  Thus, we examined the metastasis-related miRNAs induced by SDF-1/CXCR4 system, using four types of oral cancer cells; mock cells vs forced-expression of SDF-1cells and parental cells vs parental cells treated by SDF-1.
