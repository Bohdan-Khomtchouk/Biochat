TITLE
Genome-wide screening and identification of long noncoding RNAs and their interaction with protein coding RNAs in bladder urothelial cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the role of long non-coding RNAs and interaction with coding RNAs in bladder urothelial cell carcinoma (BUCC), we performed genome-wide screening long non-coding RNAs and coding RNAs expression on primary BUCC tissues and  normal tissues using long non-coding RNA array (Agilent  plateform (GPL13825). By comparing these two groups,  significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs  and coding RNAs  were identified. We further identifed a subset of long noncoding RNAs and their correlation with neighboring coding genes using bioinformatic tools. This analysis provides foundamental understaning of transcriptomic landscape changing during bladder carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
12 BUCC primary tumors and 3 normal tissues were used for long noncoding RNA array experiments which including long non-coding RNAs and coding RNAs. The differential expression of subset of long noncoding RNAs and their interaction with coding RNAs in BUCC compared with normal tissue will be identified with comtational analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL13825 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent-033010)
