TITLE
Tup11-GFP ChIP-CHIP

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We have performed a genome wide investigation for the binding locations of the transcriptional co-repressor proteins Ssn6, Tup11 and Tup12 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We have used a ChIP protocol described previously (Robyr et al, 2003) with microarrays containing ORF and IGR fragments representing the complete fission yeast genome (Wiren et al, 2005). Keywords: ChIP-CHIP
