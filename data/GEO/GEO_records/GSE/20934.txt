TITLE
Expression data from cord blood derived CD4+ CD25+ (Treg) and CD4+ CD25- (Thelper) cells, both while resting

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we compare the effects of stimulation on cord blood derived CD4+ CD25+ (Treg) and CD4+ CD25- (Thelper) cells, isolated by MACS protocols & expanded in vitro using dynabeads. Expansion was carried out at a ratio of 3 beads/cell in the presence of 1000units/ml of recombinant human IL2 for 8 days, followed by 3 days of culture without beads. RNA was extracted from resting cells on day 4 after expansion. Stimulated cells were treated with Ionomycin for 2hrs prior to RNA extraction.

DESIGN
Four way comparison of resting and stimulated Tregs versus Thelpers. A total of 18 arrays were analysed containing RNA from 5 individual cord blood donors.
