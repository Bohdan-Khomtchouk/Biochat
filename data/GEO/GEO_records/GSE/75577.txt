TITLE
Effect of loss of Jmjd1c on H3K9me2 level across the genome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of H3K9me2 level in MLL-AF9 leukemia cells upon deletion of Jmjd1c. Jmjd1c has been shown to be a H3K9me1/2 demethylase and these results provide insight into its role in MLL-Af9 leukemia

DESIGN
We used primary Jmjd1c f/f MLL-AF9-GFP leukemia cells and delivered Cre-Tomato retroviral infection. Cells infected with virus made from empty vector was used as control (MIT).  We sorted GFP and Tomato double positive cells 6 days after infection and subjected the samples to ChIP-seq. We also carried out ChIP-seq in single cell clone (SSC) derived from methylcult culture of Jmjd1c f/f MLL-AF9-GFP/ Cre cells.
