TITLE
Mammary carcinomas in c-Myc transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene microarray data of mammary carcinomas arising in mice transgenic for the myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-Myc). These neoplasms belonged to three groups: (1) the first group was composed of neoplasms that were exclusively comprised of neoplastic cells with an epithelial phenotype (n=5); (2) the second group was composed of neoplasm that were almost entirely composed of cells with an epithelial phenotype and that also contain minute areas of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (n=5); the third group was composed of neoplasms that contained areas of epithelial to mesenchymal transition that accounted for > 10% of these neoplasms (n=5). A neoplasm composed exclusively of cells with an epithelial phenotype was subsequently excluded from the first group based on gene array data that indicated a salivary origin for this neoplasm. Keywords: parallel sample
