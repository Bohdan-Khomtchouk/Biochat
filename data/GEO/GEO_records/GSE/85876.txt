TITLE
Transcriptomic and epigenetic responses to social challenge and their association with future behavior in honey bees (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
We studied behavioral, brain transcriptomic and epigenetic responses of honey bees to social challenge. Bees were exposed to two intruders at different intervals. The initial exposure caused two behavioral effects at the individual level: an increase in the intensity of aggression toward a second intruder at 30 and 60 minutes, and an increased probability of responding aggressively toward a second intruder that persisted for two hours. The shorter-lived response was associated with one pattern of gene expression in the mushroom bodies, highlighted by genes related to cytoskeleton remodeling. The longer-lived response was associated with a different pattern; highlighted by genes related to hormones, stress response and transcription factors. Histone profiling revealed few changes in chromatin accessibility in response to social challenge; most differentially expressed genes were “ready” to be activated. These results demonstrate how biological embedding of a social challenge involves changes in the neurogenomic state to influence future behavior.

DESIGN
There are a total of 180 samples equally balanced between 3 factors: 90 challenge (X) and 90 control (C); 60 30m, 60 60m, and 60 120m; 60 colony R02, 60 colony R03, and 60 colony R21. The control and experimental samples are paired. We excluded a total of 26 samples with a proportion of reads mapping to the Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) genome of ≥ 0.005.
