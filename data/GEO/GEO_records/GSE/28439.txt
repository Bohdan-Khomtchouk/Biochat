TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Vitis vinifera during grapevine-downy mildew interaction using cDNA microarrays

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Study of gene expression during Plasmopara viticola infection in the resistant Vitis vinifera cultivar 'Regent'. The oomycete fungus Plasmopara viticola (Berk. et Curt.) Berl. et de Toni is responsible for grapevine downy mildew disease. Most of the cultivated grapevines are sensitive to this pathogen, thus requiring intensive fungicide treatments. The molecular basis of resistance to this pathogen is poorly understood. We have carried out a cDNA microarray transcriptome analysis to identify grapevine genes associated with resistance traits. Early transcriptional changes associated with downy mildew infection in the resistant Vitis vinifera cultivar ‘Regent’, when compared to the susceptible cultivar ‘Trincadeira’, were analyzed. Transcript levels were measured at three time-points: 0, 6 and 12 hours post inoculation (hpi). Our data indicate that resistance in V. vinifera ‘Regent’ is induced after infection. This study provides the identification of several candidate genes that may be related to ‘Regent’ defense mechanisms, allowing a better understanding of this cultivar's resistance traits.
