TITLE
Highly efficient methane biocatalysis revealed in a methanotrophic bacterium

ORGANISM
Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq profiling of Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum strain 20Z grown in batch on methane.  The RNA-Seq work is one part of a systems approach to characterizing metabolism of 20Z during growth on methane.  We demonstrate that methane assimilation is coupled with a highly efficient pyrophosphate-mediated glycolytic pathway, which under O2 limitation participates in a novel form of fermentation-based methanotrophy. This surprising discovery suggests a novel mode of methane utilization in oxygen-limited environments, and opens new opportunities for a modular approach towards producing a variety of excreted chemical products using methane as a feedstock.
