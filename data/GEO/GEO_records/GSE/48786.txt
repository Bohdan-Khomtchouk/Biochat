TITLE
Expression data from endothelial cells sorted from breast cancer cells MDA-MB231 as compared with normal endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied the crosstalk between tumor and endothelial cells to explore the role of tumor microenvironment on cancer growth and progression.  As part of our investigation, we showed that contact-dependent interaction of endothelial cells with breast tumor cells triggered the differential expression of a large number of genes in endothelium.

DESIGN
Endothelial and MDA-MB231 cells were co-cultured together under serum- cytokine-free environment for 5 days followed by sorting endothelial cells and extracting RNA for microarray analysis. All conditions were made in triplicate.  Endothelial cells were obtained using the methods described in Seandel M. & Butler J.M., 2008. WCMC-Q Genomics Core
