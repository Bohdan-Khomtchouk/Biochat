TITLE
High expression genes in urethane-induced lung tumor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We estimated differences of urethane-induced tumors between Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- ICR mouse.  To identify Nrf2-regulated genes in tumors, we examined the mRNA expression profile both in tumor and non-tumor tissue of mouse 4 months after urethane administration.

DESIGN
We performed microarray analyses using the comparable size of lung tumors (1.0 mm < tumor diameter < 1.5 mm) and intact non-tumor lung tissues derived either from Nrf2+/+ (n=8) or Nrf2–/–mice (n=8) at 16-weeks after urethane(1-g/kg body weight) treatment.
