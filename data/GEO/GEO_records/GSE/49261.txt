TITLE
microRNA profiling of multiple myeloma bone marrow

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bone marrow microenvironment in MM contains a unique miR signature, which is partially present and detectable in the peripheral blood. A subset of miRs (let-7i, miR-106b, miR-15a, and miR16) shows aberrant expression in the precursor lesion of MGUS, while aberrant expression of other miRs (let-7a, miR-15a/b, miR-19b, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-223, and miR-361) is associated with cell proliferation and disease progression.

DESIGN
miRNA profiling was performed using Agilent miRNA array platforms with RNAs isolated from the bone marrow supernatant of multiple myeloma.

PLATFORM
GPL17759 Agilent Human miRNA Microarray
