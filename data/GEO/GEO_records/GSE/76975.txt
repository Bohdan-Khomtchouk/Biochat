TITLE
Identification of Chd7 and Top2b regulated genes in cerebellar granule neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed array-based expression profiling to determine genes regulated by Chd7 and Top2b in CGNs. Our data show Chd7 and Top2b coregulate a common set of neuronal genes. Furthermore, we compared the gene expession in proliferating and postmitotic granule cells.

DESIGN
Three independent expesssion profiling. Two conditions for each.
