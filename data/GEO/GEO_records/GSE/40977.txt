TITLE
Combined treatment of rapamycin and dietary restriction has a larger effect on the transcriptome and metabolome of liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rapamycin (Rapa) and dietary restriction (DR) have consistently been shown to increase lifespan. To investigate whether Rapa and DR affect similar pathways in mice, we compared the effects of feeding mice ad libitum (AL), Rapa, DR, or a combination of Rapa and DR (Rapa + DR) on the transcriptome and metabolome of the liver. The principal component analysis shows that Rapa and DR are distinct groups. Over 2500 genes are significantly changed with either Rapa or DR when compared with mice fed AL; more than 80% are unique to DR or Rapa. A similar observation was made when genes were grouped into pathways; two-thirds of the pathways were uniquely changed by DR or Rapa. The metabolome shows an even greater difference between Rapa and DR; no metabolites in Rapa-treated mice were changed significantly from AL mice, whereas 173 metabolites were changed in the DR mice. Interestingly, the number of genes significantly changed by Rapa + DR when compared with AL is twice as large as the number of genes significantly altered by either DR or Rapa alone. In summary, the global effects of DR or Rapa on the liver are quite different and a combination of Rapa and DR results in alterations in a large number of genes and metabolites that are not significantly changed by either manipulation alone, suggesting that a combination of DR and Rapa would be more effective in extending longevity than either treatment alone.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from livers of 8 month old C57BL6/J mice started on ad libitum (AL), 40% dietary restriction (DR), 14 ppm rapamycin (Rapa), and 14 ppm rapamycin + 40% dietary restriction (Rapa+DR) from 2 months of age on 6 months of treatment. Number of samples total: 46, with 11 samples in AL, 11 samples in DR, 12 samples in Rapa, and 12 samples in Rapa+DR
