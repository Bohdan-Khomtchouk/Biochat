TITLE
mRNA expression  profiles in human cervix at preterm delivery, delivery after preterm premature rupture of membranes and term delivery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: Mechanisms of preterm labour (PTL) are not fully elucidated. Cervical ripening plays an important role. We aimed to investigate possible differences in gene expression in human cervix between PTL and term labour (TL) and between PTL and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).

DESIGN
Cervical biopsies were obtained from women immediately postpartum (within 30 minutes). The biopsies were taken transvaginally with scissors and tweezers at twelve o'clock position. There were 3 women in each group (preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes and term labor) included.
