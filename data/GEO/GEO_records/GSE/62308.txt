TITLE
Expression data from ABA up-regulated rice under drought stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular mechanism of drought stress resistance mediated by OsABA8ox3 gene, we checked the genome-wide expression profile changes in the OsABA8ox3 RNAi and WT seedlings using the Affymetrix GeneChip under the normal condition and drought stress. A total of 1436 genes showed greater than 2-fold higher expression levels in both WT and RNAi-9 seedlings after drought stress, and most of them had higher up-regulated folds in RNAi-9 seedlings than that of WT.

DESIGN
Gene expressions in the OsABA8ox3 RNAi and WT seedlings under the normal and drought stress conditions.
