TITLE
Altered gene expression pattern in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with acute myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite a substantial progress in diagnosis and therapy, acute myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of mortality in the general population. A novel insight into the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction obtained by studying gene expression should help to discover novel biomarkers of MI and to suggest novel strategies of therapy. The aim of our study was to establish gene expression patterns in leukocytes from acute myocardial infarction patients. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction alters expression of several groups of genes. On admission, several genes and pathways that could be directly or indirectly linked with lipid/glucose metabolism, platelet function and atherosclerotic plaque stability were affected (signaling of PPAR, IL-10, IL-6). Analysis at discharge highlighted specific immune response (upregulation of immunoglobulins). Highly significant and substantial upregulation of SOCS3 and FAM20 genes expression in the first 4-6 days of myocardial infarction in all patients is the most robust observation of our work

DESIGN
Twenty-eight patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were included. The blood was collected on the 1st day of myocardial infarction, after 4-6 days, and after 6 months. Control group comprised 14 patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), without history of myocardial infarction. Gene expression analysis was performed with Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST microarrays and GCS3000 TG system.
