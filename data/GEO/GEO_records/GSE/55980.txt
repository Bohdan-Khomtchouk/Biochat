TITLE
Expression analysis of Staphylococcus aureus USA300 LAC in response to vehicle and benzbromarone.

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus USA300

SUMMARY
Compilation fo whole genome gene expression changes in Staphylococcus aureus USA300 LAC cultures grown in the presence of vehicle or the anti-gout drug benzbromarone. The drug was intially screened as effective against the agr quorum sensing system in Staphylococcus aureus AH1677.

DESIGN
A microarray study using total RNA harvested from three cultures of Staphylococcus aureus USA300 LAC plus vehicle control and three cultures of Staphylococcus aureus USA300 LAC plus 12 uM benzbromarone.

PLATFORM
GPL18434 NimbleGen Staphylococcus aureus IRN 4000005890 (NimbleGen Design Name)
