TITLE
Whole genome ChIP-seq of histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We used ChIP-seq to determine the whole-genome enrichment of histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation (H3 T11ph) during Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis. S. cerevisiae SK1 cells were synchronized for meiotic entry and 3 and 4 hour meiotic samples were obtained. As H3 T11ph is dependent on the formation of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs), a negative control ChIP-seq sample was obtained from a strain lacking DSBs (spo11-yf). Concurrently, ChIP-seq was carried out for histone H3 as a control for comparision.

DESIGN
Ten ChIP-seq samples total were taken from the following conditions: Anti-H3 T11ph and anti-H3, 3 and 4 hours synchronous meiosis, biological replicates from wild type strain (8 samples). Anti-H3 T11ph and anti-H3, 3.5 hours synchronous meiosis single sample from spo11-Y135F DSB-negative mutant (2 samples).
