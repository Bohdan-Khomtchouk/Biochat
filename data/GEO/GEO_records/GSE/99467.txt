TITLE
Gene Expression Changes in MDP and CDP from PyMT B6 Tumor Bearing Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand how tumor burden influences gene expression in dendritic cell progenitors, we profiled gene expression in macrophage dendritic cell progenitors (MDP) and common dendritic cell progenitors (CDP) by microarray

DESIGN
MDPs and CDPs were isolated from the bone marrow of mice bearing end stage orthotopic PyMT B6 mammary tumors, and non-tumor bearing controls. Four independent experiments were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
