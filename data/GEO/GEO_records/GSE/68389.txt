TITLE
Identification of down-stream targets of Notch signaling within the developing mosue kidney collecting ducts.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Notch signaling deficient kidney collecting ducts may serve as a useful resource to identify principal cell lineage and intercalated lineage specific factors since they develop a reduced number of principal cells and an increased number of intercalated cells compared with wild type kidney collecting ducts. We compared RNA from three E18.5 mouse kidneys per group: HoxB7Cre;RBPJf/-;Rosa+/Eyfp (Notch signaling deficient; mutant) versus RBPJf/f;Rosa+/Eyfp (wild type).

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from three mutant and three wild type E18.5 kidneys. N=3 per group. Mutant = Notch signaling deficient collecting ducts. Wilt-type= control littermate kidneys. The sex was not determined.
