TITLE
Gene expression during ligands activation of RXR in activated RAW264.7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ligands activation of RXR modulate host antivarl response. We used microarray to determine if 9cRA could regulate the antiviral gene expression in LPS- and polyI:C triggered RAW264.7 cells.

DESIGN
RAW 264.7 cells were pre-treated with DMSO or 100nM of 9cis-retinoic acid for 16hours.  The cells were then stimulated with polyI:C (6ug transfected) or LPS (500ng/mL) for 2 hours.
