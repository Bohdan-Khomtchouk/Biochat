TITLE
Long noncoding RNA as putative biomarkers for protstate cancer detection [Set 2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify which lncRNAs are differentially expressed in prostate cancer, the total RNA from prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, LNCaP), normal epithelial prostatic cells and the pool of 10 prostate tumor tissues and 10 adjacent normal prostate tissues were screened using SurePrint G3 human lncRNA microarrays (Agilent). The SurePrint G3 Human Gene array contains 16,472 lincRNAs and 34,127 mRNA genes.

DESIGN
Gene expression in prostate cell lines and pooled tissue samples was measured. Three independent experiments (biological replicates) for cell lines (epithelial cells, PC3 and LNCap) and two independent experiments (technical replicates) for pooled prostate tissues (tumor and adjacent normal) samples were performed.
