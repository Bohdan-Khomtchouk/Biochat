TITLE
mRNA expression analysis of AR, HOXC6 and NKX2-2 overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of mRNA expression level changes in RWPE1 cells with AR,HOXC6 and NKX2-2 overexpression. RNA quantity and quality were measured by NanoDrop ND-1000. RNA integrity was assessed by standard denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis.

DESIGN
The Human 12 x 135K Gene Expression Array was manufactured by Roche NimbleGen. This array enables you to conveniently and simultaneously hybridize 12 samples on each slide. About 45033 genes were collected from the authoritative data source including NCBI.
