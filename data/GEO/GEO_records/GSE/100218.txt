TITLE
Comparison of non-coding RNAs in exosomes and functional efficacy of human embryonic stem cell- versus induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the exosomal secretome of ESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs, samples were analyzed using the Human LncRNA Array v4.0 (8 x 60K, Arraystar)

DESIGN
Two independent lines for both ESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs were used, with two replicates (from two different differentiations) per line. Exosomes were collected from media from both cell types at 36 hours, and isolated using Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (Life Technologies)

PLATFORM
