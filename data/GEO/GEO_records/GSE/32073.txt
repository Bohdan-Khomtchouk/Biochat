TITLE
Rbfox1 downregulation and altered Calpain 3 splicing by FRG1 in a mouse model of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FRG1 over-expression results in an FSHD-like phenotype in mice. Muscles (vastus lateralis and biceps brachii) from wild type and FRG1 over-expressing mice were compared at 4 and 13 weeks of age by splicing sensitive microarray.

DESIGN
Comparisons at 4 different time points/muscles were performed between groups of 3 each FRG1 and WT mice.
