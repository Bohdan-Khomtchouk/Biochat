TITLE
Expression data of Sox9+ and Ngn3+ mouse pancreas cells at different stages of development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genes specific to Sox9+ pancreatic progenitors were identified by comparing the gene expression in embryonic and adult Sox9+ cells. We used microarray analysis to detail the global changes in gene expression as Sox9 positive embryonic pancreatic progenitors differentiatiate into adult ductal cells or the endocrine lineage.

DESIGN
GFP positive cells from Sox9-EGFP mouse pancreas were isolated by FACS at different stages of development (e10.5, e15.5, and p23) for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays. To obtain populations highly enriched in Sox9 expression, we collected only GFP Hi populations for analysis.  To identify gene expression changes specific to the differentiation of progenitors to ductal cells or endocrine cells, we also isolated and analyzed the gene expression profile of GFP negative cells isolated at p23, as well as GFP positive cells isolated from Ngn3-EGFP mouse pancreas at e15.5. These two populations allow the identification of genes whose expression is associated with the newly differentiated endocrine progeny in the embryo (Ngn3-GFP positive) and adult acinar and endocrine cells at p23.
