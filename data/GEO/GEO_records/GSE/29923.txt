TITLE
Gene expression in B cells from mice with the autoimmune disease nephrotoxic nephritis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Studying the differences in glycosylation in B cells of normal mice and mice with an autoimmune disease (nephrotoxic nephritis).

DESIGN
Differences in glycosylation in B cells of normal mice and mice with an autoimmune disease (nephrotoxic nephritis) were studied via gene expression analysis. RNA from mouse resting spleen B cells and B cells stimulated with antiCD40, CpG, and IL4 for 5 days, was isolated and prepared. One sample for each class was prepared.  RNA was labeled and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 array. Resulting Gene expression patterns were analyzed.
