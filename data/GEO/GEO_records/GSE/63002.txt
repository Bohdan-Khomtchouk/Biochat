TITLE
Renal cells Carcinoma (RCC) Genome variation profiling by genome tiling array with Perkin Elmer Constituionnal Chip platform

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is the second most frequent renal cell carcinomas (RCC) after clear cell RCC. In contrast to clear cell RCC, there is no consensual protocol using targeted therapy for metastatic pRCC. Moreover, diagnosis of some pRCC, especially pRCC of type 2 (pRCC2) may be challenging. Our aim was to identify molecular biomarkers that could be helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of pRCC.

DESIGN
10 samples was analysed by arrayCGH method using Perkin Elmer recommendations. Sample was labeled in Cy3 and co-hybridized with control DNA cy5 labeled. Please note that normalized data matrix contains logRatio Cy3/Cy5 values with non-unique 'CLONE_ID' identifiers, and thus included as a Series supplementary file.
