TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression of mouse ovarian cancer cell lines generated in vivo and in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse ovarian cancer cells lines were generated from primary tumor tissues, metastatic tumor tissues and in vitro cultured ovarian bursa cells. Gene transcripts from the whole genome were tested using WG6 microarray to compare gene expression level of cells lines with and without Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition(EMT).

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from different cell lines with two time points for each cell line and compare the differentially expressed genes in cell lines with different biological characteristics.
