TITLE
Expression data from Dmp1-Cre targeted and non-targeted Cxcl12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells in mouse bone marrow

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In mouse bone marrow, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) has the potential to form osteocytes, adipocytes and cartilage. In the process of osteogenesis, MSCs differenetiate into stromal cells, such as CAR cells. Osteoblast is responsible for the formation of osteocytes and osteoblasts may be differentiated from a subset of CAR cells. Dmp1-Cre targeted CAR cells are thought to enrich for a osteoblast progenitor population. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression profiles among Dmp1-Cre targeted and non-targeted CAR cells. Gene expression diffferences were compared to support the hypothesis that Dmp1-Cre targeted CAR cells may be enriched for osteoblast progenitors.

DESIGN
Dmp1-Cre targeted and non-targeted CAR cells were FACS sorted from three mice. RNA were extracted from these sorted cells and processed for microarray using Affymetrix mogene 1.0 ST chip. Cells from one mouse represent one sample
