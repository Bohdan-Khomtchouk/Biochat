TITLE
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are currently studying how these information-carrying oligosaccharides are involved in cellular stress responses, particularly in human genetic diseases called Congenital Disorders Of Glycosylation in which oligosaccharide assembly is defective. We are interested in endoplasmic stress responses/unfolded protein responses. ER glycans and ER lectins are intimately involved in the folding of ER proteins. Therefore, ER lectins and ER glycosyltransferases may be controlled by these stress responses, to produce and/or recognize key glycans in the stress response. Our model system is the human dermal fibroblast. We have successfully calibrated the ER stress responses in these cells by determining the magnitudes of various stress effects (such as chaperone transcription) with different forms of ER stress. We are also completing a study in which activation the signaling molecules Ire1 and ATF6 are also calibrated. We prepared multiple identical aliquots of RNA from cells stressed under several of these calibrated conditions.

DESIGN
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR): Study of the role of ER stress in the expression of genes for ER transferases and lectins that participate in ER folding and quality control using human skin fibroblasts. The UPR response in these cells has been calibrated using various readouts in response to different stresses: 1) 40 nM L-azetidine-2-carboxylate (AZC) 1 hour, 2) 0.2 mg/ml castanospermine, 24 hours, 3) 2 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT), 20 minutes, 4) 100nm Thapsigargin (TG), 30 minutes, 5) 5 ug/ml tunicamycin, 5 hours, 6) untreated control cells
