TITLE
Characterization of stress-responsive lncRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We sequenced the total RNA from a tissues mixed sample (inflorescences, rosette leaves, cauline leaves and stems) of Arabidopsis thaliana. After total RNA extraction, the same amount of tissue RNA were mixed. Ribosomal RNAs were deleted from the mixed tissue total RNAs using RiboMinusâ„¢ Plant Kit repeated three times.   We also sequenced 9 poly(A)- RNAs from seedlings treated with different stress conditions at different times. The poly(A)- RNAs were collected by removing poly(A)+ RNAs four times . Then rRNAs were removed from poly(A)- RNAs three times.

DESIGN
Sequencing of total RNAs from the mixed tissues sample is taken as an example of collecting novel transcripts from high-throughput data, which could be clarified by noncoding scores derived from our integrative models. Sequencing of nonpolyA RNAs are used for identifing stress-responsive nonpolyA lncRNAs and for validation of predicted lncRNAs.
