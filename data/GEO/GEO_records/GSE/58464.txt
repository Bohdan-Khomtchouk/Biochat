TITLE
Rapid isolation of extracellular vesicles from cell culture and biological fluids using a synthetic peptide with specific affinity for heat shock proteins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Exosomes and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as important sources of biomarkers for disease study and diagnosis. Results: A synthetic peptide, Vn96, allows for capture of EVs from biological fluids using basic laboratory equipment. Conclusion: The Vn96-captured EVs are qualitatively equivalent or superior to exosomes isolated by ultracentrifugation. Significance: The Vn96 peptide provides an effective affinity-capture method for the isolation of EVs from biological fluids.

DESIGN
In order to compare different methods of exosome purification, we compared RNA content of exosomes purified with each method. We used two different breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. We processed data in order to identify large RNAs as well as small RNA by using different methods for the alignment

PLATFORM
GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)
