TITLE
Mouse oral tumors induced by activation of Ras and p53 mutations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The p53 gain of function p53R172H promotes accelerated tumor growth and progression to carcinoma.  To identify gene expression changes associated with the oncogenic function of mutant p53 we compared the expression profiles of oral tumors induced by activation of oncogenic K-ras and p53 gain- or loss-of-function mutations Oral tumors were induced by activation of endogenous oncogenic K-rasG12D and p53  loss- or gain-of-function mutations (p53R172H)

DESIGN
Oral tumors from mice carrying the p53R172H mutation or deletion of p53 were collected for gene expression analysis
