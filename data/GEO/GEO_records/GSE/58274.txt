TITLE
Mouse ureter: wild type vs miR-143/145 knock out

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA profiling of mouse ureters comparing wild-type ureter vs. ureters from mice having whole body deletion of miR-143 and miR-145 which results in abnormal ureter peristalsis and hydronephrosis We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in wild-type and miR-143/145-deficient ureters which revealed dysregulation of genes linked to smooth muscle morphology and function.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment: wild type vs miR-143/145 KO; biological replicates: individual mice - 2 wild type, 2 mutant. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
