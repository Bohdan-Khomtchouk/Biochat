TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing evolution among Mus subspecies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus castaneus

SUMMARY
We studied the evolution of alternative splicing in the early stages of species divergence in the house mouse.

DESIGN
We sequenced the testis transcriptomes of three Mus musculus subspecies and Mus spretus using Illumina technology. On the basis of a genome-wide analysis of read coverage differences among subspecies, we identified several hundred candidate alternatively spliced regions.
