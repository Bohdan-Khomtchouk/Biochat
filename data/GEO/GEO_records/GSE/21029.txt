TITLE
The lymph node microenvironment promotes B-cell receptor signaling, NF-ÎºB activation, and tumor proliferation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate effects of tumor host interactions in vivo in CLL, purified tumor cells were obtained concurrently from blood, bone marrow and/or lymph node and analyzed by gene expression profiling. Keywords: RNA

DESIGN
Comparision of gene expression  profiling in matched pairs of peripheral blood (PB) vs.  bone marrow (BM) or lymph nodes (LN) derived CLL cells

PLATFORM
