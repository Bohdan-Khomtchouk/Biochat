TITLE
Expression data of human neuroblastoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human neuroblatoma cell lines (N=25) and retinal pigmented epithelium cell lines (N=4) were analyzed for gene expression under untreated/baseline growth conditions.

DESIGN
Expression profiling and characterization of a set of Neuroblastoma and retinal pigmented epithelium cell lines
