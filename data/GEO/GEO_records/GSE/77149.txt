TITLE
Human colorectal cancer cell line CRC#21: ALDH-high cells vs. ALDH-low cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of cancer stem cells (ALDH-high cells) comparing non-cancer stem cells (ALDH-low cells), sorted out using ALDEFLUOR assay. Goal was to identity cancer stem cell-specific genes.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, sphere-cultured cells vs. adherent-cultured cells: 1 ALDH-high replicate and 1 ALDH-low replicate.
