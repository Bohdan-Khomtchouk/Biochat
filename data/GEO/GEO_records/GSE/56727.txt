TITLE
Functional characterization of the TERRA transcriptome at damaged telomeres

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We characterize the TERRA transcriptome at normal and TRF2-depleted telomeres by RNA-seq and we demonstrate that TERRA upregulation is occurring at all transcribed telomeres upon depletion of TRF2.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of HeLa mRNA, 4 samples: with or without TERRA enrichment by IP (respectively " IP " and " input " ), with or without TFR-2 knock-down (respectively " _T " and " _EV " ).

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
