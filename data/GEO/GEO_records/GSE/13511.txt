SUMMARY
Genome-wide profiling of PPARγ:RXR and RNA polymerase II reveals temporal activation of distinct metabolic pathways in RXR dimer composition during adipogenesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing was performed to generate genome-wide maps of peroxisome prolifelator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) binding sites, and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy at high resolution throughout adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells.  The data  provides the first positional and temporal map PPARγ and RXR occupancy during adipocyte differentiation at a global scale. The number of PPARγ:RXR shared binding sites is steadily increasing from D0 to D6. At Day6 there are over 5000 high confidence shared PPARy:RXR binding sites. We show that at the early days of differentiation several of these sites bind not only PPARγ:RXR but also other RXR dimers. The data also provides a comprehensive temporal map of RNAPII occupancy at genes throughout 3T3-L1 adipogenesis thereby uncovering groups of similarly regulated genes belonging to glucose and lipid metabolic pathways. The majority of the upregulated but very few downregulated genes have assigned PPARγ:RXR target sites, thereby underscoring the importance of PPARγ:RXR in gene activation during adipogenesis and indicating that a hitherto unrecognized high number of adipocyte genes are directly activated by PPARγ:RXR

DESIGN
Examination of PPARg and RXR bindingsites during adipocyte differentiation (day 0 to 6) and association with transcription via RNAPII occupancy.
