TITLE
MK886 treatment of H720 non-small cell lung cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this experiments different treatments were applied to lung cancer cell lines 1)H720 cell line suspension was treated by 1 micromole of 5-lipoxygenase activating protein inhibitor MK886 serum-free in TIS medium for 24 h. 2) A549 cell line was treated as H720 by MK886 3) A549 was treated by 100 nM of silencing cocktail (siRNA) prepared against the 4-th exon of the gene and generated by RNASEIII digestion of double stranded RNA. The cocktail was prepared by Ambion technology, see the manufacturer's protocol. The observed  silencing was > 90% 4) Based on Oligoengine vectors, silencing constructs were created against HRPA2B1 transcript(HNRPA2B1 is a subunit of spliceosome). Stable transfectants were raised harboring the construct. Keywords: drug treatment
