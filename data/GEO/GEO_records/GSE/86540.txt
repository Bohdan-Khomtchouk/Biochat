TITLE
Effects of pH on the transcriptional profile of adenylate cyclase (cyr1) mutants

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Purpose : To determine the role played by CaCYR1 in the transcriptional response to differences in medium pH Methods : RNA was extracted from cells subjected to RNA seq

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of C. albicans cells grown for four hours at 37C in YNB medium/.2% glucose/5mM GlcNAc/50 mM citrate at the indicated pH
