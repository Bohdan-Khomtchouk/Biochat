TITLE
Med1 Deletion in Heart Causes Dilated Cardiomyopathy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis reveals that Med1 regulates many genes involved in energy metabolism, calcium signaling, and oxidative phosphorylation in myocardium.

DESIGN
RNA samples were prepared from hearts of 5 controls Med1 floxed mice (Med1fl/fl) and 5 Cre-loxP-mediated cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Med1 (csMed1-/-) mice. RNA were pooled and subjected to RNA-seq analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
