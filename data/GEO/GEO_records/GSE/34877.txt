TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between wild type and AP2-L KO parasites

ORGANISM
Plasmodium berghei ANKA

SUMMARY
In the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei, we found that an AP2 family transcription factor designated AP2-L plays a critical role in the development of the liver stage. Using DNA microarray analysis we showed that the expression of several genes, including those of parasitophorous vacuole membrane proteins, was significantly decreased in the early liver stage of AP2-L-depleted parasites.
