TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between wild type and AP2-L KO parasites

ORGANISM
Plasmodium berghei

SUMMARY
In the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei, we found that an AP2 family transcription factor designated AP2-L plays a critical role in the development of the liver stage. Using DNA microarray analysis we showed that the expression of several genes, including those of parasitophorous vacuole membrane proteins, was significantly decreased in the early liver stage of AP2-L-depleted parasites.

DESIGN
Gene expression of P. berghei  liver stages was compared between wild type and AP2-L KO parasites. Liver stage parasites were cultured for 24h using HepG2 cells. Ten and seven biologically independent experiments were performed for wild type and AP2-L KO parasites, respectively.
