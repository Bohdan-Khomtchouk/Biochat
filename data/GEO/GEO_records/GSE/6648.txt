TITLE
Gene expression in Entamoeba histolytica cysts and trophozoites

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
We compared multiple strains of lab trophozoites to recent clinical isolates. Clinical isolates were grown in xenic media, and maintained many characteristics of the cyst stage of devlopment Keywords: Stage conversion

DESIGN
E. histolytica trophozoites of three different strains (HM1:IMSS, Rahman, and 200:NIH) and grown under multiple conditions (Long term axenic growth in TYI, Growth in low glucose media, Mouse adapted parasites and in vivo growth in a mouse model) were compared to recent clinical isolates that had grown in xenic culture for 1-8 weeks.
