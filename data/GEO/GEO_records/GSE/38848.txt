TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study we focus on two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with varying production of heterologous Î±-amylase and we compare the metabolic fluxes and transcriptional regulation at aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in particular with the objective to identify the final electron acceptor for protein folding. We found that anaerobic conditions showed high amount of amylase productions when comparing to aerobic conditions and the genome-scale transcriptional analysis suggested that genes related to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lipid synthesis and stress responses were generally up-regulated at anaerobic conditions. Moreover, we proposed a model for the electron transfer from ER to the final electron acceptor, fumarate under anaerobic conditions.

DESIGN
Three Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with varied amylase productions were selected at early glucose phase in batch fermentations for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Biological triplicates were applied, and strains with empty plasmid (no amylase productions) were used as control strain.
