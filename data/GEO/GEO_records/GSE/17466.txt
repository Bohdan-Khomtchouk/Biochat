TITLE
Gene expression in iPrEC cell line transfected with wild-type USP2A, mutant USP2A, or empty vector.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression was measured on the Affymetrix platform in  iPrEC cell line transfected with wild-type USP2A, mutant USP2A, or empty vector.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in 3 distinct groups (cell transfected with wild-type USP2A, mutant USP2A, or the empty vector). For each group 5 biological replicates were obtained and gene expression was measured on the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Differential gene expression was obtained for all the 3 possible pair-wise comparisons (WT versus MUT, WT versus EV, and MUT versus EV).

PLATFORM
