TITLE
Pre-miR-375_A549 vs. Pre-miR-NC#2 (Ambion) _A549

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the functional significance of ASH1-inducible miR-375 in terms of biologic phenotypes of ASH1-positive lung cancer cells. To this end, we conducted genome-wide expression profiling analysis of miR-375-transfected A549 cells.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis using a Whole Human Genome 4 x 44K Microarray G4112F (Agilent) was conducted to examine changes in expression of potential target genes of miR-375 by transfection of Pre-miR-375 or Pre-miR-NC#2 (Ambion) in A549 cells, which were then harvested at 12, 24, 48, and 96 hours after transfection.
