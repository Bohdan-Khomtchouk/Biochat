TITLE
PDL2+, PDL2- and LPS treated PDL2- WT bone-marrow derived murine DCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cultured BMDCs were purified by FACS sorting for PDL2 surface expression and stimulated with LPS at 100 ng/mL or left unstimulated. Microarray data was used to demonstrate gene expression differences between PDL2- and PDL2+ DC populations. Microarray data was also used to show that PDL2+ mature DCs were distinct from LPS treated DCs.

DESIGN
Two populations of murine DCs derived from ex vivo culture were compared.
