TITLE
CpG site methylation of HCV-cirrhotic, HCV-HCC, and normal liver tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we used a high-throughput method for assaying methylation of CpG sites simultaneously in a single sample for identifying differences in methylation observed in tissues ranging from normal liver to pre-neoplastic (cirrhosis) and neoplastic (HCC) states. Since there are important clinical and prognostic differences among HCC patients due to etiology, this study was designed to focus on HCC due to HCV-infection, a more common etiology of HCC among Western countries

DESIGN
cross-sectional: 20 cirrhosis, 20 HCC, and 16 normal patients, 87 arrays

PLATFORM
GPL9183 Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I
