TITLE
Expression profile of third instar larval fat body and midgut tissues

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We use mRNA-seq to transcriptionally profile larval fat body and midgut tissues from Drosophila third instar larvae. These data provide insights into tissue physiology and can be used to identify tissue specific transcripts.

DESIGN
Fat bodies from wandering third instar larvae were dissected from ~50 male larvae and gonads were removed to eliminate contaminating transctips from the gonads. Larval midguts were dissected from ~50 wandering third instar larvae. Larval tissues were removed to Graces unsupplemented medium on ice prior to RNA extraction with TRIzol reagent. mRNA-seq samples were prepared from 5ug of total RNA and subject to Illumina based sequencing.
