TITLE
Expression data from day 17 bovine endometrium

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
The potential for dietary supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) to improve reproductive efficiency in cattle has received much interest. The mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA may affect physiological and biochemical processes in key reproductive tissues are likely to be mediated by significant alterations in gene expression. We used microarrays to assess endometrial gene expression on day 17 of the estrous cycle in n-3 PUFA compared with control fed heifers.

DESIGN
Beef heifers were supplemented with a rumen protected source of either a saturated fatty acid (CON; palmitic acid) or high n-3 PUFA (n-3 PUFA; 275 g) diet per animal per day for 45 days and global gene expression was determined in uterine endometrial tissue using an AffymetrixÂ® oligonucleotide bovine array.
