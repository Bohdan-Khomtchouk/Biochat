TITLE
Gestational high salt stressed new born BdkrB2 knockout collecting duct cells vs BdkrB2 wild type collecting duct cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of new born mouse kidney collecting duct (CD) cells comparing the infuence of gestational high salt stress on gene expression remolding of BdkrB2 receptor knockout CD cells with that of BdkrB2 receptor wild type CD cells. The BdkrB2 receptor has been shown to be playing a role in renal vascular tone, kidney secretion and reabsorption function, normal kidney development, while impaired BdkrB2 receptor in kidney shown being associated with renal agenesis and renal dysplasia. Goal was to determine the effects of BdkrB2 receptor knockout together with gestational high salt stress on collecting duct gene expression pattern.

DESIGN
Single color microarray experiment, BdkrB2 knockout new born mouse CD cells vs. BdkrB2 WT mosue CD cells with both on gestational high salt stress. Biological replicates: 3 BdkrB2 null replicates, 3 BdkrB2 WT replicates. Expression level of each sample was normalized to WT1 replicate.

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
