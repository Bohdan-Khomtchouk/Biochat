TITLE
Gene Expression Comparing Col to WS to Identify conserved cold-responsive Affymetrix signatures

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Gene expression Arabidopsis 24h cold-treated, 4c, seedlings to identify a *gold-standard* set of cold-responsive transcripts. Most of the CBF overexpression lines are in WS, therefore, it is necessary to identify a consistent set of transcripts that are detectible as cold-induced on the ATH1 platform for both WS and Columbia, so that appropriate comparisons can be made to determine the effects of low temperature in CBF overexpressing or loss of function plants in a WS background and an attempt can be made to compare the results of altered CBF function to published microarray studies.  We aimed to identify a set of *gold-standard* cold responsive transcripts that were induced in multiple different experiments performed by different researchers and were detectible in both the WS and Col-0 ecotypes.  This series contributes the 24h cold-treated WS ecotypes, along with additional Col-0 cold-treated and control samples for normalization purposes. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
Col-0 and WS seedlings were sown on Gamborg's media with 0.7% agar, stratified for 3d, and grown in continuous low light (60-80 microE) at 22C, for 10 days and either moved to a new 22C chamber or transferred to a 4C chamber. After 24h tissue was harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Whole seedlings (including root tissue) were taken from the plate).
