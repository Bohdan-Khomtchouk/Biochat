TITLE
gravity-Gravitational signature of synchronized cell cultures in particular cell cycle stages

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au13-11_gravity - gravity - Cell cycle and cell proliferation are decoupled under altered gravity conditions. We have previously shown that semisolid cell cultures of Arabidopsis suffer overall genome changes in response to altered gravity and also that cell cycle stages duration is altered. By using synchronized cell cultures we will demonstrate the precise alterations in cell cycle duration and also the transcriptional signature in any of them. - Experiments consists on exposures of Arabidopsis cell cultures to 1g control/simulated microgravity (RPM) conditions. Asynchronous cells exposed for 14 h + Syncronous populations choosen to have an enrichment of cell cycle phases were used (being T7/T10 samples on G2 phase, T14/T16 samples on G1 phase).

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - time course,treated vs untreated comparison

GPL17404 INRA-CNRS-UEVE Arabidopsis thaliana 73K [120228_Athal_CATMA62_AA_exp]
