TITLE
Ventral hippocampal lesion, tetrodotoxin disruption of the ventral hippocampus, and chronic administration of neuroleptics (colan-affy-rat-89421)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In pevious research we have shown that the disruption of the normal development of the ventral hippocampus in rodents leads to cellular abnormalities in the frontal cortex and behavioral deficits related to schizophenia (Neurotox Res. 2002, 4(5-6):469-475). We propose the use of gene expression analysis to investigate the molecular underpinnings of these processes which may shed light on the molecular processes relevant to human schizophrenia. In addition, we seek to characterize expression differences induced by chronic administration of antipsychotic medications, which may give insight into the molecular processes involved in ameliorating psychotic symptoms. Using both surgical and drug interventions, we aim to examine experimentally induced expression differences in the rodent  brain that are relevant to human neuropsychiatric disorders. Disruption of the normal development of the vental hippocampus or chronic neuroleptic administration,  will result in gene expression changes in the frontal cortex of rats. Elucidation of the molecular cascades underlying these treatments will shed light on both the pathoetiology (from the lesion experiments) and theurapeutic processes (from the antipsychotic treatment experiments) involved in human schizophrenia. We have developed 3 groups of samples: 1] Ventral hippocampal lesion in neonatal rats (treatment and controls, total N=22) 2] Tetrodotoxin disruption of the ventral hippocampus (treatment and controls, total N=20) 3] Chronic administration of neuroleptics (multiple drugs, multiple doses, and controls, total N=63) Grand Total N=105
