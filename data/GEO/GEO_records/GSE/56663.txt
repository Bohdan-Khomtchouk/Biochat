TITLE
miRNA expression of tube forming HUVECs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the miRNAs specifically upregulated during tube formation of primary endothelial cells , HUVECs were cultured in culture plates with or without matrigel-coating and the miRNAs from them were compared.

DESIGN
HUVECs Plate culture reps 1-3 are control and compared to HUVECs Matrigel culture reps 1-3.
