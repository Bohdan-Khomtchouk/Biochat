TITLE
DNA methylation patterns associate with genetic and gene expression variation in HapMap cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We measured the methylation status at 27,578 CpG sites using the Human Methylation27 DNA array in 77 HapMap Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from 77 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
