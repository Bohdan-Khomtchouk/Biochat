TITLE
RNA deep sequencing reveals novel candidate genes and polymorphisms in boar testis and liver tissues with divergent androstenone levels.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Boar taint described as an offensive odor that is released while cooking pork. Androstenone, a steroid mainly synthesized in testis and metabolized in liver is one of the major causes of boar taint. The aim of the present study was to investigate transcriptome differences in boar testis and liver tissues with divergent androstenone levels using RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq). For this purpose, mRNA expression from testis and liver  tissue samples from 10 boars, 5 samples  each for high and low androstenone levels were quantified and analyzed. The results shows that in testis samples 46 genes were differentially regulated whereas 25 genes showed differential expression in the liver.  Digital gene expression analysis identified genes in keratin family, desmoplakin and Interferon-induced protein family for as candidate genes for low androstenone testis sample and genes in flavin monooxygenease family, cytochrome P450 family and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family as candidate genes for low androstenone liver sample. Additionally, the results revealed that mutations in  genes IRG6, DSP, IFIT2 were specific for low androstenone testis tissues and mutations in genes FMO5, HIST1H4K and TSKU were specific for low androstenone  liver samples.

DESIGN
Testis and liver mRNA profile of high and low androstenone level were generated by RNA deep sequencing, in five animal for each group, Ilumina HiSeq 2000
