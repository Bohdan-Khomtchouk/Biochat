TITLE
ChIP-chip of siGFP- or siHOTTIP-treated foreskin fibroblasts with anti-H3K4me3, anti-H3K27me3, anti-H3K4me2, anti-histone, anti-MLL1, and anti-WDR5 antibodies on HOX tiling array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Coordinate loss of MLL1 and WDR5 occupancy caused by HOTTIP knockdown were observed in distal HOXA genes. These regions correspondingly lost H3K4me3 and H3K4me2, without changes in pan-histone or H3K27me3. human foreskin fibroblasts (CRL2091), anti-H3K4me3 (Abcam ab8580, lot#1016899), anti-H3K4me2 (Abcam ab32356, lot#947550), anti-H3K27me3 (Abcam ab4729, lot#1021724), anti-histone H3 (Abcam ab1791, lot#1025144), anti-MLL1 (gift of R. Roeder, Rockefeller University), and anti-WDR5 (gift of W. Herr, UNIL)

DESIGN
Comparison of occupancy of MLL1 and WDR5 of siGFP and siHOTTIP foreskin fibroblasts on HOX tiling array. Human foreskin fibroblasts are transfected with siGFP or siHOTTIP for 72 hrs. The cells are harvesed and ChIP performed with H3K4me3, H4K27me3, H3K4me2, MLL1, WDR5, and histone antibodies.
