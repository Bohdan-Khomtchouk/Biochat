TITLE
Liver transcriptional profile of wild-type and IL-10 knockout mice with colitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the experiment was to compare the liver transcriptional profile of wild-type and IL-10 knockout mice with colitis. Colitis was induced in 6 week old female wild-type and IL-10-deficient C57BL/6 mice by administration of 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in the drinking water for 7 days. At necropsy, segments of liver were homogenized in Trizol and total RNA prepared for the transcriptional profiling.

DESIGN
Total RNA from 4 wild-type and 4 IL-10 knockout mice with colitis was used to hybridize to Affymetrix Gene Chip Mouse 2.0 ST arrays.
