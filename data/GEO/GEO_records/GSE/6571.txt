TITLE
UCP exposure of ovalbumin sensitized and challenged mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the promoting effect of ultrafine particle inhalation on development and progression of allergic asthma, we selected an experimental approach involving exposure to ultrafine carbon particles (UCP) and gene expression profiling of lungs from mice with experimental, ovalbumin induced allergy. Comparative gene expression analysis was performed by hybridizing pooled cDNA samples from lavaged lungs of different groups. The results suggest that allergic sensitization may represent an susceptibility factor for effects of UCP on gene expression in the lung. In sensitized individuals UCP exposure, such as found in polluted air, thus may contribute to the development and/or aggrevation of allergic asthma. Keywords: Particle Inhalation, lung, ovalbumin sensitized and challanged, expression profling

DESIGN
Lungs of groups of six sensitized  or sensitized and challanged BALB/cJ mice, either subjected to particle-free or UCP containing air; two replicates including one dye swap experiment have been performed for lungs: a) sensitized particle free air versus sensitized UCP exposure; b) sensitized and challanged particle free air versus sensitized and challanged UCP exposure
