TITLE
Chronic Pentylenetetrazol withdrawal induced successive gene expression changes in Drosophila head

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Kindling induced by Pentylenetetrazol is an established rodent model of epileptogenesis. The molecular basis of the long-term plasticity involved is however not clear. In addition, rodent models of kindling plasticity are not useful for large-scale screening of compounds to identify antiepileptogenic drugs. Given this, we have developed a fly model of chronic PTZ- and withdrawal-induced behavioral plasticity. In our fly model, the chronic PTZ treatment is given for 7 days. This is then followed by 7 day long withdrawal. Expression profiling of fly heads at three time points in the 7 day long withdrawal period â€“ 8th day, 10th day, and 14th day from the beginning of the treatment - showed a dynamic and widespread alteration of various functional categories of genes. Keywords: time series
