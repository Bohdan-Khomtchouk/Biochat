TITLE
Langerhans cells from aryl hydrocarbon receptor deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The arylhydrocarbon receptor is a ligand inducible transcription factor. Known to control xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, it also affects - depending on the cell type - numerous other genes, either directly or indirectly. With respect to the immune system, persistent activation leads to immunosuppression. We asked how the AhR is involved in Langerhans cells. These antigen presenting cells of the skin are responsible for allergies against chemicals (thus xenobiotic metabolism might be relevant) and a recently detected endogenous ligand, FICZ made by UVB radiation from tryptophane, is particularly abundant in the skin. Keywords: comparison gene deficient mouse cells with wild-type
