TITLE
Microarray analysis of rat testis following combined fetal and postnatal DBP exposure

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

DESIGN
Pregnant Fisher 344 rats will be purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. and delivered to CIIT on gestational day (GD) 7 (GD0 = day first vaginal plug positive).  At gestational day 12 (GD12), the dams will be exposed once/day until GD20 to 50 mg/kg dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in corn oil vehicle via oral gavage.  Each dose group will contain 4-6 vehicle control or phthalate treated dams.   Groups of animals will be sacrificed at GD20, postnatal day (PND) 35, and PND90 for endpoint analysis. At GD20, treated and control animals will be examined for various endpoints including body weight, testicular histopathology, gene expression profile via microarray analysis, and anogenital distance (AGD).  AGD (at parturition; PND1) and nipple number/location (at PND14 and day of sacrifice) will be determined on animals in the postnatal groups.  At PND35 or 90, one male from each in utero corn oil vehicle or DBP exposed group will receive a second gavage of either corn oil or 500 mg/kg DBP.  6 hours after the second gavage, the following endpoints will be examined: 1) testis histopathology; 2) spermatid head quantification (PND90 only); 3) testis and body weights; 5) genome-wide gene expression (via microarray); and 6) germ cell apoptosis (TUNEL assay).
