TITLE
FOXR2 Interacts with MYC to Promote Its Transcriptional Activities and Tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Combining the results of a large scale proteomic analysis of human transcription factor interaction network with knowledge databases, we identified FOXR2 as one of the top-ranked candidate proto-oncogenes. Here, we show that FOXR2 forms a stable complex with MYC and MAX and subsequently regulates cell proliferation by promoting MYCâ€™s transcriptional activities. We demonstrated that FOXR2 is highly expressed in several breast, lung, and liver cancer cell lines and related patient tumor samples, while reduction of FOXR2 expression in a xenograft model inhibits tumor growth. These results indicate that FOXR2 acts with MYC to promote cancer cell proliferation, which is a potential tumor-specific target for therapeutic intervention against MYC-driven cancers.
