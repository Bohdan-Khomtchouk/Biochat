TITLE
Inhibition of BET bromodomain proteins as a therapeutic approach in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed transcriptional changes in 4 prostate cancer cell lines following treatment with the BET inhibitor I-BET762 using  Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.

DESIGN
Four prostate cancer cell lines (NCI-H660, VCaP, LNCaP, PC-3) were treated with DMSO (control) or I-BET762 at 0.5uM or 10uM concentrations for 24 hours. Two biological replicates are included for each treatment group.
