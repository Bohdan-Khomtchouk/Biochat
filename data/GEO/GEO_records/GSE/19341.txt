TITLE
Arabidopsis pvip mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional comparison of Arabidopsis thaliana pvip1;pvip2 RNAi double mutants against Col-0 wildtype. Tissue used: whole rosettes of 4-week-old plants grown under short-day conditions (8h light; 20oC). 3 biological replicates for each. Control = Col-0 and mutant = pvip1;pvip2. PVIP = Potyvirus-VPg-interacting protein (Dunoyer et al. 2004 J. Virol. 78: 2301-2309).

DESIGN
6 samples were used in this experiment.
