TITLE
Mucosal vaccination with attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces strong central memory responses and protects against tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
This submission includes DNA microarray gene expression data from two sets of experiments where bronchoalveolar lavage cell transcription from rhesus macaques vaccinated via aerosols with either BCG or attenuated MtbDsigH mutant were compared to unvaccinated (naive samples) using two color arrays

DESIGN
Two color Agilent 4x44k arrays were run to compare the gene-expression in BAL samples derived from three BCG (aerosol) vaccinated and three MtbDsigH (aerosol) vaccinated Indian rhesus macaques. The baseline in the experiment was BAL from the same animals prior to infection and the experimental post-vaccination BAL was derived at week 3.
