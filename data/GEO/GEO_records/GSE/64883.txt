TITLE
Expression profiles of allopolyploids and their parents lines during allopolyploidization

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
We profiled genome-wide gene expression changes in newly hybridized triploids (ABD), its genome-duplicated hexaploid (AABBDD), stable synthetic hexaploid (AABBDD) and T. turgidum (AABB) and Ae. tauschii (DD) parental lines of two independent crosses to reconstruct the events of allopolyploidization and genome stabilization.
