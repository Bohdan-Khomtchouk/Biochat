TITLE
Expression profiles of allopolyploids and their parents lines during allopolyploidization

ORGANISM
Triticum turgidum subsp. durum ; Triticum dicoccon ; Aegilops tauschii subsp. strangulata ; Triticum dicoccon x Aegilops tauschii subsp. strangulata ; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum x Aegilops tauschii subsp. strangulata

SUMMARY
We profiled genome-wide gene expression changes in newly hybridized triploids (ABD), its genome-duplicated hexaploid (AABBDD), stable synthetic hexaploid (AABBDD) and T. turgidum (AABB) and Ae. tauschii (DD) parental lines of two independent crosses to reconstruct the events of allopolyploidization and genome stabilization.

DESIGN
Gene expression levels of newly hybridized triploids (ABD), its chromosome-doubled hexaploids (AABBDD), stable synthetic hexaploid (AABBDD) which were selfed during 4 and 13 generations, and their parents, Triticum turgidum (AABB) and Aegilops tauschii (DD) were compared. Total RNA of each line was extracted from three biological replicates of two leaves seedlings except for triploids.For newly hybridized triploids, biological duplicates of two leaves seedlings were used.
