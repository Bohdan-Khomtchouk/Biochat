TITLE
Layer 4 Visual Cortex Star Pyramid Monocular Deprivation Microarray Study

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray expression profiling of manually sorted m-citirin-labeled layer 4 visual cortex star pyramid neurons from deprived and non-deprived hemispheres.

DESIGN
Monocular deprivation by TTX-injection (at P12-13 and again at P13-14), followed by manual sorting of m-Citrin-labeled Layer 4 Visual Cortex Star Pyramid neurons in deprived and non-deprived hemispheres. RNA was extracted using PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit, reverse transcribed, and amplified using a standard T7 IVT protocol (Affymetrix Small Sample Target Labeling Assay Version II).

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
