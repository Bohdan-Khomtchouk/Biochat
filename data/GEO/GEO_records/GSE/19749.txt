TITLE
Gene expression screening during early granulation tissue formation (II)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Subcutaneous implantation of cellulose sponges has been used for decades to induce vital granulation tissue formation. Illumina microarray was done in order to study the early gene expression in the granulation tissue formation.

DESIGN
A total of six samples from six different rats was analyzed.  Three samples were collected after 24 hours of implantation and three after 72 hours of implantation.
