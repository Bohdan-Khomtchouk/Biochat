TITLE
Gene expression data in over expressed Human Fetal Lung Fibroblasts with IPF downregulated miRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an untreatable fibrotic lung disease characterized by fibroblast proliferation and epithelial mesenchymal transition.miRNA let-7d and mir30b were found to be signifcantly down regulated in IPF. Compared to control we over expressed these miRNAs in Human Fetal Lung Fibroblast cell line

DESIGN
Fetal lung tissues were collected through the University of Pittsburgh Tissue Bank through approved IRB protocol 0506140.  The samples were de-identified using an honest broker system and immediately transferred to the IRB exempt protocol PRO09040459 (PI: D. Carlisle).  Total RNA was labeled with Cy3 and hybridized on Agilent 8X44K gene expression array (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). After 17 hours hybridization, arrays were washed and scanned according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol.
