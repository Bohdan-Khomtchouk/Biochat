TITLE
Intra-macrophage Expression data of Francisella tularensis novicida U112

ORGANISM
Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida U112

SUMMARY
These samples are part of an experiment comparing the expression profiles of Francisella tularensis novicida grown in chemically defined medium and bacteria isolated 24 hours post infection of J774 macrophages to identify virulence factors

DESIGN
Custom microarray submitted previously was used as the platform (GPL20119). The samples submitted here were compared with samples submitted previously (GSM1673555-57 in GSE68478) and differentially expressed genes during the intra-macrophage growth were identified.

PLATFORM
GPL20119 [GMH2006a530238N] Affymetrix Francisella Array
