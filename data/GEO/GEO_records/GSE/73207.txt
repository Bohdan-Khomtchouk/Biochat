TITLE
ChIP-Seq on Cohesin mutant TF-1 Cell Line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding the binding of GATA2, RUNX1 and SMC3 in RAD21 WT vs. mutant TF-1 Cells

DESIGN
We examined GATA2, RUNX1 and SMC3 using ChIP-seq in TF-1 erythroleukemia cells that were transduced with an inducible vector expression WT or mutant (Q592*) RAD21 after 6 days of DOX induction

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
