TITLE
Immune response gene-1 prevents neutrophil mediated immunopathology during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, in vitro data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Immunoresponsive gene 1 (Irg1) is a host mitochondrial enzyme that produces itaconate under inflammatory conditions. Recent in vitro studies have suggested that itaconate can modulate inflammation and also have bactericidal effects by inhibiting isocitrate lyse (ICL), a bacterial glyoxylate shunt enzyme. To evaluate the function of Irg1 in vivo, we challenged wild-type (WT) and Irg1-/- mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and evaluated effects on morbidity, mortality, and immune response. Irg1-/- but not WT mice succumbed rapidly to Mtb, and the mortality was associated with increased infection, inflammation, and lung injury. This phenotype was due in part to a pathogenic neutrophil response, as it was reversed in depletion studies. Transcriptional profiling experiments and studies with WT and ICL-deficient Mtb suggest that Irg1 regulates mitochondrial metabolic pathways to temper inflammation rather than acting as a direct anti-bacterial mediator. Our data establishes that Irg1 modulates the immunometabolism axis to curtail Mtb-induced lung disease.

DESIGN
Neutrophils were purified from bone marrow of naïve mice by negative selection using magnetic-activated cell sorting beads (Miltenyi). Neutrophil purity ( > 95%) was assessed by flow cytometry as the percentage of Ly6G+ CD11b+ cells. Neutrophils were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids at 37°C, 5% CO2. GFP-Mtb was grown to mid-log phase, washed with PBS, sonicated to disperse clumps, and resuspended in neutrophil culture media. GFP-Mtb then was opsonized prior to infection by mixing with an equal volume of normal mouse sera (Sigma) and incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Neutrophils were mock-infected or infected with opsonized GFP-Mtb at MOI 1 and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2.
