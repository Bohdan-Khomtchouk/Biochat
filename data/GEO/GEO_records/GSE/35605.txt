TITLE
Global transcriptional analysis of S. mutans sugar transporters in biofilm

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans

SUMMARY
In this study we showed that one PTS of S. mutans is specific for biofilm mode of growth in the presence of sucrose. Our data indicates that this PTS is involved in transport and metabolism of disaccharides and possibly oligosaccharides synthesized by GtfI and GtfSI.
