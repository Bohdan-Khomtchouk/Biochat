TITLE
M12-8: MRX34 Biomarker study in animals bearing Hep3B orthotopic liver tumors [Illumina]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify direct tumor mRNA targets of miR-34a, tumor RNAs isolated from whole tumors from animals treated with negative control and MRX34

DESIGN
Hep3B cells were surgically implanted into the livers of Nod/Scid mice and allow to grow for multiple weeks.  Once serum AFP levels reached levels consistent with tumor growth of ~80-100 mg, animals were subjected to a single IV injection of MRX34.  Twenty-four hours later animals were sacrificed, tumors resected and RNA isolated for subsequent microarray analysis.
