TITLE
Imporatance of substantial weight loss for altering gene expression during intensive cardiovascular lifestyle modification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to examine relationships between weight loss through changes in lifestyle and peripheral blood gene expression profiles. Substantial weight loss (-15.2+3.8%) in lifestyle participants was associated with improvement in selected cardiovascular risk factors and significant changes in peripheral blood gene expression from pre- to post-intervention: 132 unique genes showed significant expression changes related to immune function and inflammatory responses involving endothelial activation. In contrast, participants losing minimal weight (-3.1+2.5%) showed only minor changes in cardiovascular risk factors and markers of inflammation, and no changes in gene expression compared to non-intervention controls after 1 year. Weight loss ( > 10%) during lifestyle modification is associated with down-regulation of genetic pathways governing interactions between circulating immune cells and the vascular endothelium and may be required to successfully reduce CVD risk.

DESIGN
A prospective nonrandomized trail was conducted over 1 year in participants undergoing intensive lifestyle modification to reverse or stabilize progression of coronary artery disease. Cardiovascular risk factors, inflammatory biomarkers, and gene expression as a function of weight loss were assessed in 89 lifestyle participants and 71 retrospectively matched controls undergoing usual care.
