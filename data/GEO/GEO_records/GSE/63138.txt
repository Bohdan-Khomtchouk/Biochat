TITLE
mRNA Expression profiles of MDA-231-Gem cells and MDA-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gemcitabine was approved to be sufficient effects on most solid tumors, including breast cancer and others. There has been little study of how the evolution of chemoresistance in cancer affects other aspects of disease pathogenesis. The primary aim of this study was to explore the molecules involved in gemcitabine resistance and its underlying regulatory mechanisms in breast cancer.

DESIGN
MDA-231-Gem and MDA-231 cells were collected at logarithmic growth phase for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to explore the diffierential genes expression between MDA-231-Gem and MDA-231 cells, in order to explore the underlying mechanisms accounting for the resistance to gemcitabine in breast cancer.
