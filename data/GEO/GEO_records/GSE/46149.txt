TITLE
Transcriptome analysis during somatic cell reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By combining deep sequencing with high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR, we reveal that somatic splicing profiles are reorganized to pluripotent splicing profiles during reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The splicing pattern in pluripotent stem cells resembles that in testis, and the regulatory regions have specific characters in length and sequence. These results indicate that the dynamic alteration in splicing is an integral part of the molecular network involved in the reprogramming process.

DESIGN
Sequencing data from MEF, two iPS cell lines and one ES cell line. RT-PCR data will be represented within Figures or Tables in published manuscripts.
