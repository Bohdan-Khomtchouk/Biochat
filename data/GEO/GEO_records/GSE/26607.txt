TITLE
Genomic hybridizations for the parents and progeny of the Toxoplasma gondii I X III genetic cross

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
The parents and progeny of the I X III genetic cross were genotyped using the ToxoGeneChip in order to generate a more detailed genetic map.  We also used the genomic hybridization data to look for copy number variations (CNV) and segmental duplications.

DESIGN
The ToxoGeneChip microarray ( ) was used to hybridize genomic DNA for the parents and progeny of the I X III cross. The parents of the cross are CTGara and GT1-Fudr.  The rest comprise the 34 informative progeny.
