TITLE
Osteoblast Gene Expression in Response to Bicc1 Knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We recently identified Bicc1 as a regulator of osteoblast differentiation and bone mass.  Bicc1 encodes an RNA-binding protein.  Here, we have used siRNA to decrease Bicc1 expression in primary calvarial osteoblasts.  Illlumina microarrays were then used to profile global gene expression changes.

DESIGN
The experiment consisted of 16 total samples in 4 treatment groups (N=4 replicates per treatment).  The treatment groups were osteoblasts treated with 1). control scrambled siRNA, 2) Bicc1_1 siRNA, 3) Bicc1_2 siRNA and 3) Bicc1_3 siRNA.  Cells were isolated, transfected and 48 hours later RNA was isolated and hybridized to arrays.
