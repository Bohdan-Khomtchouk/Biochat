TITLE
S-phase time-course of Lachancea kluyveri cells

ORGANISM
Lachancea kluyveri

SUMMARY
Haploid cells of Lachancea kluyveri were arrested in G1 phase using Saccharomices cerevisiae alpha factor. After, release in a new media, cells go synchronously through S-phase. One sample is taken every five minutes. Microarrays are used to monitor the change of DNA copy number from 1 to 2, all along the genome during S-phase.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, G1 cells vs. S-phase cells at different time points. Biological replicates: 3 biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL15421 Agilent-018632 kluyveri_V1
