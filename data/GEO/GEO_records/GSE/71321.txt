TITLE
Expression analysis of leafy spurge crown buds during seasonal dormancy transitions.

ORGANISM
Euphorbia esula

SUMMARY
This submission contains the RNAseq data from a study of leafy spurge crown buds transitioning through a seasonal dormancy time course where buds transitioned from paradoprmancy to endodormancy and then to ecodormancy. The sequences in this study were mapped to an assembled transcriptome built from sequences from this study along with sequences from : 1) A study of leafy spurge crown buds through a time course for paradormancy release induced by excision of the aerial portion of the shoot (Series GSE71317). 2) A study identical to this study but where leafy spurge plants were first treated with glyphosate (Series GSE71406). 3) A previously submitted study of leafy spurge shoots following treatment with glyphosate was also used to assemble the transcriptome (Series GSE56509).

DESIGN
This crown buds transitioning through a seasonal dormancy time course study has 4 biological replicates collected at each of the three dormancy states (paradormant, endodormant, and ecodormant).
