TITLE
Genome-wide microarray analysis of normal human fibroblasts in response to genistein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Establishment of a transcriptomic profile of human cells treated with genistein with particular emphasis on signature of genes coding for enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis stands for the present study. The hypothesis tested was that genistein influences expression of some genes among which are those coding for enzymes required for synthesis of different GAGs being pathologically accumulated in mucopolysaccharidoses. Results provide important information concerning the extent of action of genistein at the molecular level in terms of modulation of gene expression by this substance.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDFa) subjected to 1, 24 or 48 hours in vitro exposure to 30, 60 or 100 ÂµM genistein, or 0.05%DMSO (K1), compared to untreated control (K2).
