TITLE
SSEA4 is a marker for chemotherapy resistance [miRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By coupling PDX and cell surface marker screening technologies, we have identified distinct tumor cell sub-populations that are associated  with tumor resistance to chemotherapy. In the majority of relapsed tumors, the percentage of the marker-positive cells shifted back to pretreatment  levels. SSEA4 is one of the cell surface molecules tested that could distinguish enriched residual tumor cells in all the different TNBC PDX  models analyzed. The expression of SSEA4 is associated with tumor resistance to chemotherapy and SSEA4+ cells show increased gene expression of  genes involved in response to toxins, cellular import/export, cell migration and EMT.

DESIGN
The dataset comprises four different sample groups including SSEA4- and SSEA4+ cell fractions isolated from mouse xenografts of human breast cancer cells. Two technical replicates were generated for each cell fraction. Microarray analysis was performed on the Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray 8x60K (v2) platform.
