TITLE
A role for SIR-2.1 regulation of ER stress response genes in determining C. elegans life span

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Abstract: C. elegans SIR-2.1, a member of the Sir-2 family of NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases, has been shown to regulate nematode aging via the insulin/IGF pathway transcription factor daf-16. Treatment of C. elegans with the small molecule resveratrol, however, extends life span in a manner fully dependent upon sir-2.1, but independent of daf-16. Microarray analysis of worms treated with resveratrol demonstrates the transcriptional induction of a family of genes encoding prion-like glutamine/asparagine-rich proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response to unfolded proteins. RNA interference of abu-11, a member of this ER stress gene family, abolishes resveratrol-mediated life span extension, and overexpression of abu-11 extends the life span of transgenic animals. Furthermore, SIR-2.1 normally represses transcription of abu-11 and other ER stress gene family members, indicating that resveratrol extends life span by inhibiting sir-2.1-mediated repression of ER stress genes. Our findings demonstrate that abu-11 and other members of its ER stress gene family are positive determinants of C. elegans life span. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
