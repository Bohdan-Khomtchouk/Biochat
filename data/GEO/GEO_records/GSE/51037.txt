TITLE
M. tuberculosis (Mtb) Produces Nitrite in Human Macrophages in Physiologic Oxygen to Impact Mycobacterial ATP Consumption and Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from Mtb that had been treated with 5 mM nitrate or was untreated in standard 7H9/ADNaCl medium. This generated the first analysis of gene expression following mycobacterial nitrate respiration.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in Mtb following nitrate respiration, which results in the production of nitrite.
