TITLE
Expression data roots of Arabidopsis plants inoculated with Verticillium longisporum

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Identification of genes differentially expressed in roots of Arabidopsis Col-0 and ndr1-1 mutants 48 h post inoculation with the fungal pathogen Verticillium longisporum.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis Col-0 and ndr1-1 seeds were grown in petri dishes with liquid MS medium supplemented with 0.2% sucrose. After two weeks on a horizontal shaker (40 rpm), plants were rinsed twice in sterile distilled water and transferred to liquid 0.5xMS medium without sucrose, supplemented with 200 conidia ml-1 of V. longisporum isolate VL1 (CBS110220). Control plants were grown in 0.5x MS only. At 48 hours post inoculation, materials were harvested in biological replicates ( > 50 plant roots) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted with Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit (Bio-Rad) and hybridized to the Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array at the DNAVision facility (Gosselies, Belgium). Microarray assays were performed with triplicate biological root samples. Normalization of the microarray data was performed using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method as implemented by the “quantile normalization” function in the Bioconductor 1.3 software.
