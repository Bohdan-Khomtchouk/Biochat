SUMMARY
au15-04_xeno - transcriptomic analysis of the effects of low levels of atrazine and by-products - Identification of xenobiotic direct sensing and of low chemical stress transduction networks in Arabidopsis thaliana. - Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia ecotype, Col-0) were surfaced-sterilized in bayrochlore/ethanol (1/1, v/v), rinsed in absolute ethanol and dried overnight. Germination and growth were carried out under axenic conditions in square Petri dishes. After seeds were sowed, Petri dishes were placed in the dark at 4 °C for 72 h in order to break dormancy and homogenize germination, and were then transferred to a control growth chamber at 22 °C/20 °C under a 16 h light (6000 lux)/8 h dark regime. Growth medium consisted of 0.8% (w/v) agar in Hoagland basal salt mix (H2395, Sigma-Aldrich) adjusted to pH 6. After 13 days of growth under optimal conditions, seedlings were transferred to fresh growth medium containing pesticides during 24 h (Control, Atrazine 1µM, Hydroxyatrazine 1µM or Desethylatrazine 1µM). Then control and treated seedlings were harvested and ground in liquid nitrogen until RNA extraction by RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and DNase digestion. RNA was extracted on at least 2 independent biological replicates of 30 pooled plantlets.

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison
