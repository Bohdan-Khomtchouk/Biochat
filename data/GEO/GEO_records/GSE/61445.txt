TITLE
Differential expressed miRNAs between tumor tissues and adjecent normal tissues from a patient with glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal malignant brain tumor. miRNA expression profiling could be useful in improving the classification of tumors and predicting their behavior. In this study, the miRNA expression patterns in glioblastoma tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were identified through expression profiling of a patient with glioblastoma. The results will hopefully enhance our understandings of the epigentic changes in glioblastoma progression and provide candidates for miRNAs-based targeting tharapy.

DESIGN
A paired miRNAs tumor tissues and adjacent tissues of a glioblastoma patient was used in this study. miRNAs were isolated using miRNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen). Profiling was established by applying the Agilent human miRNA Microarray (8 Ã— 60K, v16.0) (Agilent Technologies).
