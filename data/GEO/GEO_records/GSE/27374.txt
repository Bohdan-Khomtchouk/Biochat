TITLE
Methylation profile in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Agilent CpG microarray in combination with enriched methylated DNA by a MBD protein were carried out in each pool of genomic DNA from primary breast tumor and matched adjacent normal tissues.

DESIGN
1.Common reference vs enriched methylated DNA in tumor 2. Common reference vs enriched methylated DNA in adjacent normal 3. Then compare two data indirectly
