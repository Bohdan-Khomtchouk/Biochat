TITLE
Inhibition of Lymphotoxin-LIGHT Signaling Reduces the Interferon Signature in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole blood expression was profiled in Rheumatoid Arthiritis and SLE (Systemic LUPUS Erythomatosus) patients.

DESIGN
Expression in the whole blood of RA and SLE patients, comparing  gene expression signatures in SLE, and RA DMARD-IR and RA TNF-IR patients. This is baseline whole blood expression data for 3 patient populations (SLE, RA DMARD-IR and RA TNF-IR) and 20 Controls.
