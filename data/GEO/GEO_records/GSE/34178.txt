TITLE
Maternal tract distinguish between spermatozoa and other pathogenic and non-pathogenic entities

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The mammalian oviduct is a dynamic organ and the venue of important events leading to the establishment of pregnancy. Oviductal epithelial cells are involved in direct contact and specific interactions with different self and non-self entities (oocyte, sperm, etc.).The aim of this study was to determine if the oviduct is able to distinguish between different types of non-self-entities. We used an in vitro model to determine genes altered in oviductal epithelial cell (OPEC) in response to the presence of spermatozoa, mammalian somatic cells (red blood cell) or bacteria. We hypothesised that alteration of OPEC expression profile in response to boar spermatozoa (friendly non-self entity), red blood cells (non-pathogenic, non-self entity) and bacteria (pathogenic non-self entity) is indicative of recognition of self and non-self entities by these cells as well as recognition of pathogenic from non-pathogenic non-self entities.

DESIGN
Oviductal epithelial cells (OPEC) were co-incubated in the presence of (i) bacteria (1 x 10˄8 bacteria), (ii) sperm (1 X 10 ˄ 6 spermatozoa/ml) or (iii) red blood cell (5 x 10 ˄ 6 red blood cell/ml) for 24 hours in HAM-12 media. Three biological replicates were performed for each group and a total of 12 Affymetrix Porcine arrays were used to identify the expression profiles of OPEC alone (3 arrays) or in the presence of (i) bacteria (3 arrays), (ii) sperm (3 arrays) or (iii) red blood cells (3 arrays).
