TITLE
Gene expression data from malignant gliomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of varying grade (II-IV) malignant gliomas were measured by Illumina cDNA-mediated Annealing, Selection, extension and ligration (DASL) platform. DASL platform was selected for its specialized design for partially degraded RNA.

DESIGN
Overall mRNA was extracted from FFPE samples using the GoldenGate Assay protocol and hybridized to Illumina BeadChips.

PLATFORM
GPL18281 Illumina HumanHT-12 WG-DASL V4.0 R2 expression beadchip [gene symbol version]
