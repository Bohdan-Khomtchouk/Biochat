SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3630 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of David MacAlpine. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: The relative time of replication for all unique sequences in the Drosophila genome was determined by sequencing replication intermediates that were differentially labeled with BrdU during S-phase progression.  Briefly, cells were pulse labeled with BrdU and sorted into early, middle and late S-phase fractions.  BrdU labeled sequences from each fraction of S-phase were enriched by immunoprecipitation and sequenced on the Illumina platform.
