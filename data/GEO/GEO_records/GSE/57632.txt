TITLE
MMSET alters EZH2 Binding in Myeloma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated EZH2 binding in the presence and absence of MMSET protein. MMSET overexpression in t(4;14)+ myeloma leads to global loss of H3K27 methylation and redistribution of EZH2 binding throughout the genome

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for EZH2 in two cell types

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
