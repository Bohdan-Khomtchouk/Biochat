TITLE
Formaldehyde treatment with 1.8 mM for 2 h

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The number and type of synthetic chemicals that are being produced worldwide continues to increase significantly. While these industrial chemicals provide numerous benefits, there is no doubt that some have potential to damage the environment and health. Toxicity must be evaluated and use must be carefully controlled and monitored in order to minimize potential damage. DNA microarray technology has become an important new technique in toxicology. We are using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism for toxicological study because it is a simple, fast-growing eukaryote that has been thoroughly characterized. To obtain varied toxicity-induced gene expression alteration profiles, we examined many kinds of chemicals and compared the gene expression profiles as chemical toxicity each other. Consequently, cells need to be exposed with same experimental cellular condition, semi lethal (IC50), respectively. In the case of formaldehyde (CAS; 50-00-0), the exposure dose was decided as 1.8 mM by growth curve with continuously diluted exposure.  Formaldehyde is one of the aldehydes. This substrate is recognized as a carcinogen and suspected to be gastrointestinal or liver toxicant, immunotoxicant, neurotoxicant, reproductive toxicant, respiratory toxicant, skin or sense organ toxicant. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Series containes 3 hybridization results from independent biological samples, and each experiment have high and low power scanned data respectively.
