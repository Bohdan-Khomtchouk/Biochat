TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of small non-coding RNAs in the tissue of patients with renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-coding RNAs play an important role in the pathogenesis of human malignancies. So far, microRNAs have been investigated in detail in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, but the knowledge about other small non-coding RNAs like snoRNA, tRNA and piRNA remains small. There is increasing evidence that these non-coding RNAs are also involved in  regulation of gene expression, and we therefore performed small RNA sequencing in a cohort of 18 corresponding normal and malignant tissue samples from patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We observed differential expression of microRNAs, but also some dysregulated tRNA and snoRNA in clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissue

DESIGN
small RNA expression profiling in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and corresponding normal renal tissues samples Please note that each 'ccRCC' sample is followed by the corresponding normal renal tissue sample. For example, the '2014_001_002' is the corresponding normal tissue for '2014_001_001' ccRCC sample, except the last two samples 2014_001_028 and 2014_001_029 are listed in an inverse order.
