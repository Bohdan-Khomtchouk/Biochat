TITLE
Gene expression of Kit225 cells upon NC1153 treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NC1153 was shown to inhibit JAK3 tyrosine kinase. Lymphocytes survival depends on the integrity of STAT5, the primary downstream target of JAK3. In this study microarrays were used to test the effect of a JAK3 inhibitor, NC1153, on the gene expression profile of a human leukemia cell line.

DESIGN
Kit225 human leukemia cells were treated with NC1153 or DMSO (vehicle) for 12 h then harvested for RNA isolation.
