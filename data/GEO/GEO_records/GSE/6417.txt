TITLE
A genome-wide analysis indicates that yeast pre-mRNA splicing is predominantly post-transcriptional

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Recent ChIP experiments indicate that spliceosome assembly and splicing can occur cotranscriptionally in S. cerevisiae. However, only a few genes have been examined, and all have long second exons. To extend these studies, we analyzed intron-containing genes with different second exon lengths, by ChIP as well as by whole-genome tiling arrays (ChIP-CHIP). The data indicate that U1 snRNP recruitment is independent of exon length. Recursive splicing constructs, which uncouple U1 recruitment from transcription, suggest that cotranscriptional U1 recruitment contributes to optimal splicing efficiency. In contrast, U2 snRNP recruitment as well as cotranscriptional splicing is deficient on short second exon-genes. We estimate that approximately 90% of endogenous yeast splicing is post-transcriptional, consistent with an analysis of post-transcriptional snRNP-associated pre-mRNA. Keywords: ChIP-CHIP

DESIGN
ChIP-CHIP was performed on tagged U1, U2, and U5 snRNPs to address spliceosome assembly on intron-containing genes in S. cerevisiae. Data expressed as log2 (immunoprecipitation/input) ratios.
