SUMMARY
Expression data from Breast cancer subtypes

DESIGN
In a cohort study of primary invasive breast cancer (41 TN, 30 HER2, 29 Luminal A and 30 Luminal B) as well as 11 normal tissues samples and 14 cell lines , we obtained a tumor specimen at surgery before any patient treatment. Total RNA was extracted from all samples and the whole transcriptome was quantified with Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Chips.
