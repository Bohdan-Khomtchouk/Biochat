TITLE
Microarray analysis in senescent chicken embryo fibroblast

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of healthy chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF, P4) cells comparing senescent chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF, P18) cells. Goal was to identify differentially expressed genes comparing between healthy (P4) and senescent (P18) CEF cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, healthy CEF (P4) vs. senescence CEF (P18). Biological replicates: 1 control CEF (P4) sample, 1 CEF (P18) experimental sample.
