TITLE
Murine fast-twitch muscle: two-week progression of denervation atrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The right legs of 3 months old CD1 mice were denervated by unilaterally cutting the sciatic nerve at the level of trochanter, resulting in a permanent denervation of the lower hindleg. At the indicated times, animals were killed by cervical dislocation and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were dissected out and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The expression analysis was carried out at five time points, namely just after denervation (time 0) and 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after nerve interruption. The contralateral, left TA muscle from the same individual served as innervated control. We reversed labeling of denervated and contralateral samples in each experiment, thus carrying out two separate hybridizations for each time point. Keywords = mouse Keywords = fast-twitch muscle Keywords = denervation Keywords = atrophy Keywords: time-course
