TITLE
Members of the microRNA-17-92 cluster exhibit a cell intrinsic anti-angiogenic function in endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are endogenously expressed small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression on the posttranscriptional level. The miR-17-92 cluster (encoding miR-17, -18a, -19a/b, -20a and miR-92a) is highly expressed in tumor cells and is up-regulated by ischemia. Whereas miR-92a was recently identified as negative regulator of angiogenesis, the specific functions of the other members of the cluster are less clear. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of miR-17, -18a, -19a and -20a significantly inhibited 3D spheroid sprouting in vitro, whereas inhibition of miR-17, -18a and -20a augmented endothelial cell (EC) sprout formation. Inhibition of miR-17 and miR-20a in vivo using antagomirs significantly increased the number of perfused vessels in matrigel plugs, whereas antagomirs, that specifically target miR-18a and miR-19a were less effective. However, systemic inhibition of miR-17/20 did not affect tumor angiogenesis. Further mechanistic studies showed that miR-17/20 targets several pro-angiogenic genes. Specifically, Janus kinase 1 (Jak1) was shown to be a direct target of miR-17. In summary, we show that miR-17/20 exhibit a cell intrinsic anti-angiogenic activity in ECs. Inhibition of miR-17/20 specifically augmented neovascularization of matrigel plugs, but did not affect tumor angiogenesis indicating a context-dependent regulation of angiogenesis by miR-17/20 in vivo.
