TITLE
Expression data from Che-1 (AATF) depleted SKBR3 and MDA-468 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Che-1 is a RNA Polymerase II binding protein involved in the regulation of gene transcription. We have observed that Che-1 depletion induces apoptosis in several cancer cells expressing mutated forms of p53. We used microarrays to investigate classes of genes regulated by Che-1 in one of these cell lines.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from control and Che-1 depleted SKBR3 and MDA-468 cells 48 hours after transient transfection of siRNA.
