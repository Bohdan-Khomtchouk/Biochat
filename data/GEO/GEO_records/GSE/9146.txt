TITLE
Irradiation response in PKBalpha MEF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MEF proficient or deficient in PKBalpha, or PKBalpha knockout MEF where PKBalpha expression was reconstituted by stable transfection were subjected to 10Gy gamma-IR treatment. 4 or 24 hours after treatment, gene expression changes were analyzed. Keywords: genotype0-specific stress response in PKBalpha MEF

DESIGN
three biological replicates were included in the experiment for each condition analyzed. overall, 27 samples were included in the study. the reference samples were untreated MEF of each respective genotype.
