TITLE
Expression data from white adipose tissue of adult mice with mutations in Regulator of sex-limitation genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulator of sex-limitation (rsl) is a recessive mouse phenotype in which the otherwise male-specific sex-limited protein (Slp) gene is expressed in females. Positional cloning in rsl mice led to the identification of mutations in two neighboring KRAB zinc finger transcriptional repressors, Rsl1 and Rsl2, and BAC transgenic rescue experiements verified their ability to repress male-specific genes in the liver. Microarrays were used here to identify RSL-sensitive genes in mouse abdominal white adipose tissue. Experiment type: sex comparison and genetic modification

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from abdominal white adipose tissue of adult male and female wild type and Rsl-null mice. Equivalent amounts of RNA were pooled from five mice per sex and genotype. Two pools per sex and genotype were hybridized to the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 PM Array Strip.
