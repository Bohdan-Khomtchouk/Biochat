TITLE
Myocardial infarction (MI) primes autoreactive T cells through activation of dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DC subsets of the murine healthy heart consisted of IRF8-dependent conventional (c)DC1,  IRF4-dependent cDC2 and monocyte-derived DCs. In steady state, cardiac self-antigen α-myosin was presented in heart-draining mediastinal lymph node (mLN) by cDC1s, driving the proliferation of antigen-specific CD4+ TCR-M T cells, and their differentiation into Tregs. Following MI, all DC subsets infiltrated the heart, while only cDCs migrated to the mLN. Here, cDC2s induced TCR-M proliferation and differentiation into IL-17/IFNγ producing effector cells. Thus, cardiac specific autoreactive T cells get activated by mature DCs following myocardial infarction.

DESIGN
cDC1s, cDC2s, MFs and moDCs were isolated and sorted from steady state or infarcted hearts in four independent replicates. 31 samples (RNA-Seq) in total. RNA was isolated, amplified by SMARTer amplification, converted to cDNA and then sequenced using Illumina NextSeq.
