TITLE
A zebrafish melanoma model reveals emergence of neural crest identity during melanoma initiation [zebrafish ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report the distribution of H3K27Ac histone marks in a zebrafish melanoma cell line and a zebrafish primary melanoma tumor with the aim of identifying super-enhancer regions and regions of interest.  We also report sox10 ChIP-Seq on the same zebrafish melanoma cell line.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27Ac chromatin marks and sox10 binding in one zebrafish melanoma cell line.  Examination of H3K27Ac chromatin marks in one freshly isolated zebrafish primary melanoma tumor.
