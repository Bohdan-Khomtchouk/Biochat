TITLE
Gene expression of AML cell lines (HL60, KG1a, MOLM14 and U937) untreated or treated with metformin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to obtain gene signature specific of high oxidative phsophorylation function.

DESIGN
Four human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (KG1a, U937, HL60 and MOLM14) were grown and treated with electron transfer chain complex I inhibitor (metformin, 10mM) during 24 hours for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain gene signature specific of high oxidative phsophorylation function.
