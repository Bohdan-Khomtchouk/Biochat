TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling on Stably Expressing ICD JM-a CYT-1 or CYT-2 ERBB4 isoforms in  MCF10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Convergent and divergent effects of two ICD ERBB4 isoforms on gene expression in normal-like MCF10A mammary epithelial cells lacking endogeneous ERBB4 expression.

DESIGN
Control vector (VEC) and ERBB4 expression MCF10A cells (ICD CYT1 or CYT2) maintained in regular medium containing 10% serum, were collected and RNA samples were collected and analyzed.
