TITLE
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression pre-/post- oral glucose challenge

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute metabolic challenges provide insight on how the body responds to metabolic stress. In this study, we assessed transcriptomic response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to an acute glucose challenge.

DESIGN
Participants consumed 75 g glucose (anhydrous) in 150 mL of water. PBMCs were collected at baseline and 60 minutes post-challenge for RNA extractin and microarray hybridization

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
