TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis during differentiation of human embryonic stem (hES) cells into cardiac lineage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
hES cells display an excellent model to study the developmental mechanisms occuring in vivo both at genetic and epigenetic levels. hES cell line were subjected to global transcriptome analysis to study the differentiation patterns during differentiation of pluripotent hES cells into cardic progenitors and beating cardiomyocytes.

DESIGN
In-house derived hES cell line KIND1 was subjected to cardiac directed differentiation protocol leading to derivation of cardiac progenitors on day 12 and beating cardiomyocytes on day 20 of differentiation. With an aim to understand the global transcriptome of differentiated progenies cardiac progenitors (day 12) and beating cardiomyocytes (day 20) were harvested and subjected to microarray analysis. Each of the differentiated progeny was compared to undifferentiated hES cells as day 0 versus day 12, day 0 versus day 20 and day 12 versus day 20
