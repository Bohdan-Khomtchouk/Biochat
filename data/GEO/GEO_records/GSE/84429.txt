TITLE
Expression data from transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to evaluate the change of liver status in the presence of hepatitis B viral proteins We evaluated the messenger RNA expression profiles of liver tissues of transgenic mices carrying wild type or mutant viral surface proteins

DESIGN
We checked the differential RNA expressions in different transgenic mice, each with three biological replicates

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
