TITLE
Gene Expression in the Rice Blast Fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, During Nitrogen Starvation

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe grisea

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to analyze transcriptional changes that occur when the fungal plant pathogen M. grisea is shifted from a complete media to a nitrogen-starved media. Comparisons were made in the following way between fungal mycelial grown in minimal media supplemented with a nitrogen source (MM+N) and minimal media without a nitrogen source (NS) Keywords: parallel sample
