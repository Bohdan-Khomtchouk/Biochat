TITLE
p107 knockout vs. wild type neurospheres

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The ganglionic eminence was dissected and neurospheres were cultured from the brain of E13.5 embroys. RNA was isolated from neurospheres cultured from p107-/- embryos and their wildtype littermates. P107 knockout mice have previously been shown to have an increased number of stem cells and enhanced stem cell self renewal. With the microarray experiment we are hoping to discover the genes involved in stem cell number and self renewal along with p107. Keywords: other
