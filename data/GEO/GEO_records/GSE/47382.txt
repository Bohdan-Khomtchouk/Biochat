TITLE
ChIP-chip Lymphocyte H3K9Me2 from DCCT/EDIC patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to tiling arrays (ChIP-chip) were performed to profile histone H3K9Me2 at 22K gene promoters in peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained in 2009-10 from 60 selected DCCT participants being followed in the long-term observational EDIC study.

DESIGN
Comparison of histone H3K9Me2 at 22K gene promoters in 60 peripheral blood lymphocytes samples obtained from the conventional and intensive therapy DCCT groups
