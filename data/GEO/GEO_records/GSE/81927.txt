TITLE
Expression data from induced astrocytes , primary astrocyte and MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MEFs treated by compounds for 25 days can be induced into astrocytes.  In induced astrocytes, specific astrocytes-related sets of genes are up-regulated, but fibroblasts-related genes are down-regulated.

DESIGN
The induced cells sorted for GFP-positive cells by flow cytometry and primary astrocytes and MEFs were parepared  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to compare the induced astrocytes with primary astrocytes and MEFs.
