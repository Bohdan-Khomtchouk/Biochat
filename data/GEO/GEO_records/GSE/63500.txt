TITLE
Gene expression pattern of Arabidopsis (WT and wrky6) colonized with Piriformospora indica under low and normal phosphate conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A whole cascade of genes involved in abiotic stress tolerance, starting from stress perception to transcriptional activation of downstream genes, leads to stress adaptation and tolerance responses in Arabidopsis. Understanding the function of their gene products is of critical importance for the development of transgenic strategies and to improve stress tolerance in crops. Pi limitation is one of the major abiotic stresses for plants used in agriculture. Using Arabidopsis as a model system, we provide evidence that WRKY6 functions as a repressor of several Pi-related processes in LP-exposed Arabidopsis roots, among them Pi transporter and metabolism genes. Inactivation of WRKY6 stimulates the Pi uptake and metabolism in LP-exposed WT roots. The Pi metabolism is further promoted by P. indica under Pi limitation conditions and the stimulatory effect of the fungus is much stronger in the wrky6 background when compared to the WT. Better performance of P. indica-colonized WT and mutant plants under Pi limitations is manifested by the healthy phenotype of the plants and growth promotion of their underground and aerial parts. In the wrky6 background, this results in larger roots with a bushy phenotype. It allows the identification of genes and mechanisms which trigger root growth and development as well as the alteration of the root architecture for optimal performance in the rhizospheric environment.

DESIGN
Low phosphate induced gene expression in Arabidopsis (WT and wrky6) was measured at 3dpi from P. indica colonized and uncolonized seedlings after exposure to 0.25mM, LP and 2.5mM, NP. Three independent experiments were performed.
