TITLE
Expression data from 290 primary colorectal cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Samples were taken from colorectal cancers in surgically resected specimens in 290 colorectal cancer patients. The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Human Genome U133Plus 2.0 arrays. The training set of our prognosis classifier included the stage A and D samples. Validation used our stage B and C samples. Keywords: Expression profiling by array
