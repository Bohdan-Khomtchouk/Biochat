TITLE
Characterization of Populus Class III HDZIPs

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
Comparison of wild type Populus to transgenics expressing either a miRNA-resistant Populus ortholog of ATHB15/CORONA or miRNA-resistant Populus ortholog of REVOLUTA

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from stem tissue of four biological replicates each for two mutants and wild type controls.  Mutants were lines HBMut2-4-1 (Populus ATHB15/CAN ortholog) and HBMut3-8-1 (Populus REVOLUTA ortholog).
