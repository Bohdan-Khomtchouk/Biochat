TITLE
Short RNA profiling of ES cells with and without Dicer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand Dicer function, and the potential mechanisms by which RNAi contributes to pluripotency, short RNA expression was profiled from 4 ES cell libraries: 2 made from a Dicer-conditional ES cell line before and several months after deletion of Dicer, and 2 made before and 5 days after demethylation of J1 ES cells with 5-aza-deoxycytidine.  Contributed here are the unannotated sequence data from each library, including those sequences that did not match the mouse genome or any known non-coding RNAs. Keywords: 454 sequencing, miRNA, dicer, demethylation
