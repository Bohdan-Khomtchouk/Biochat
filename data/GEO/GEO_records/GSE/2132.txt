TITLE
Comparison of polyribosomal to total transcript profiles

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Total and polyribosomal RNA was extracted from rosette leaves of 5-6-week-old wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Col-0). After linear amplification using a modified Eberwine procedure, Cy3- or Cy5-labeled cDNA targets were produced from sense-strand RNA through reverse transcription Keywords: repeat sample
