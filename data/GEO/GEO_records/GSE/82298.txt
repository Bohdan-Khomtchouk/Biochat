TITLE
Effects of NOTCH3 signalling on gene expression in breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MBA-MB-468 cells were grown and treated with combinations of NOTCH3 inhibiting antibody, NOTCH3 activating antibody, pan-NOTCH pathway inhibitors or activators.

DESIGN
Two sets of experiments were performed, in which breast cancer cells in culture were treated with agonists or antagonists of elements of the NOTCH signaling pathway. Changes in gene expression were assessed using microarrays.
