TITLE
Expression profiling comparisons of human PBMC treated with class I/IIb or class IIa HDAC inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify differential gene expression resulting from the inhibition of class IIa HDACs in human PBMC.

DESIGN
Human PBMC were cultured ex vivo with a mitogenic stimulus (1 ug/ml phytohemagglutinin, PHA) for 60 hours concurrent with exposure to vehicle (DMSO), vorinostat (3 uM), or TMP195 (3 uM).  In addition to the whole PBMC populations, a portion of the cultures treated with DMSO or TMP195 were used for FACS purification of mutually exclusive CD3+ (T cell), CD19+ (B cell), and CD14+ (monocyte) populations. All samples were then processed for RNA extraction, labeling, and hybridization to Affymetrix arrays. Vehicle vs. vorinostat vs. TMP195 treatments in PBMC; Vehicle vs. TMP195 treatment in CD3+, CD19+ or CD14+ cells
