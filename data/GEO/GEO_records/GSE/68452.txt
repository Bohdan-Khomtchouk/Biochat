TITLE
Role of cervicovaginal microbiota in genital inflammation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression analysis using the SCRB-Seq method from cervical and peripheral blood antigen presenting cells that were collected from women with different cervicovaginal bacterial community types.

DESIGN
Cervical and peripheral blood antigen presenting cells were FACS sorted using the gating strategy: FSC vs. SSC  - > Singlets - > Live CD45+ - > HLA-DR+ - > CD11c+ or CD14+. The genital bacterial microbiomes were characterized in the same women and categorized into Lactobacillus dominance, Gardnerella dominance, or Prevotella dominance.
