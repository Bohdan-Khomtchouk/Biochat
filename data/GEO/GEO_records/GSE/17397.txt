TITLE
Alternative splicing in HeLa cells after sodium butyrate treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed a role of histone deacetylases in alternative splicing regulation. Using human exon arrays we identified a list of 683 genes whose splicing changes after HDAC inhibition with sodium butyrate.

DESIGN
6 samples (3 nontreated controls and 3 sodium butyrate treated cells)
