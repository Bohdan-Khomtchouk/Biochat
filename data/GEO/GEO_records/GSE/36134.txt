TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin remodeler SNF5 in human pluripotent cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of SNF5 binding in human pluripotent embryonic carcinoma NCCIT and SNF5 overexpressed NCCIT cells. We generated genome-wide cSNF5 maps of NCCIT and SNF5 overexpressed NCCIT cells from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA. SNF5 and OCT4 seem not to share their binding in OCT4 centered binding plot in control, while SNF5 overexpression directs SNF5 to OCT4 target genes.

DESIGN
Examination of the relationship between SNF5 and OCT4 binding in control and SNF5 overexpressed cells.
