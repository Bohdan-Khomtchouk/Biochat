TITLE
Comparative genomic hybridization suggests a role for NRXN1 and APBA2 in schizophrenia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Copy number variations (CNVs) account for a substantial proportion of human genomic variation, and have been shown to cause neurodevelopmental disorders. We sought to determine the relevance of CNVs to the aetiology of schizophrenia. Whole genome, high resolution, tiling path BAC array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) was employed to test DNA from 91 individuals with DSM-IV schizophrenia. Common DNA copy number changes that are unlikely to be directly pathogenic in schizophrenia were identified by comparison to a reference dataset of 372 control individuals analysed in our laboratory, and a screen against the Database of Genomic Variants. The remaining aberrations were tested for inheritance from the parents, and validated with Affymetrix 250K SNP arrays or 244K Agilent oligo-arrays. Thirteen aberrations satisfied our criteria. Two of them are very likely to be pathogenic. A deletion at 2p16.3 disrupts NRXN1 and was present in an affected sibling. A de novo duplication at 15q13.1 spans APBA2. The proteins of these two genes interact directly and play a role in synaptic development and function. Both genes have been affected by CNVs in other neurodevelopmental disorders. Keywords: Array CGH
