TITLE
Total RNA sequencing of WT intestinal orgaonids.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report elevated expression levels of genes involved in small intestine or colon regional identity. hESCs were differentiated to colonigc organoids, where the total RNA was extracted from.

DESIGN
Comparison of the expression profiles of colonic and small intestinal organoids
