TITLE
Translatome and transcriptome profiling of SH-SY5Y cells treated with staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin oligomers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of translation has the potential to provide major contributions in understanding the pathophysiology of infection processes, given the complex interplay between pathogens and host cells. This study uncovers the reshaping undergoing in the translational control system of the host in response to staphylococcal α-hemolysin oligomers (rAHL). Keywords: translatome profiling, polysomal profiling, polysomal RNA, translational control, translational profiling, polysome profiling, post-transcriptional regulation, staphylococcal α-hemolysin, pore forming toxins, PTF.

DESIGN
The comparison between translatome and transcriptome profiling was used to discover mRNA-specific changes of the SH-SY5Y cells transcriptome and translatome in response to staphylococcal α-hemolysin oligomers (rAHL). To identify translationally regulated mRNAs, gene expression signals derived from the polysomal mRNA populations were compared by microarrays analysis to those obtained from total RNAs. Polysomal mRNA and total mRNA were isolated from SH-SY5Y cells treated with 3nM of extracted oligomers (rAHL) for 2 hours. Cells lysates were collected from untreated cells (control) and from treated cells. All experiments were run in biological triplicates.
