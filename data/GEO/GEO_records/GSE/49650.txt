TITLE
Checkpoints Couple Transcription Network Oscillator Dynamics to Cell-Cycle Progression

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast cell cycle transcript dynamics in three S. cerevisiae strains grown at 30 degrees Celsius: cdc20 GALL-CDC20 (persistent mitotic CDK activity; CDK on), cdc8-ts (DNA replication checkpoint), GAL-cse4-353 (spindle assembly checkpoint), cdc8-ts cdc20 (DNA replication checkpoint, CDK on), and cdc8-ts cdc20, rad53-1 (DNA replication checkpoint without Rad53 activity, CDK on) in a BF264-15DU background. We compared transcript levels of genes previously shown to be periodically expressed in wild-type cells and in cells lacking all mitotic cyclins (clb1,2,3,4,5,6; CDK off).

DESIGN
Two replicate time courses for each of the strains studied are included
