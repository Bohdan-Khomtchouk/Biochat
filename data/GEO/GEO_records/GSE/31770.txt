TITLE
Epigenetic Impact of Long-Term Shiftwork:  Poly Evidence from Cricadian Genes and Whole-Genome Methylation Analyses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of genomic methylation differences between day workers and shift workers.  We hypothesized that there would be differences in methylation patterns between day workers and shift workers, and that some of these differences may explain the association between long-term shift work and breast cancer.  The array provides methylation data on more than 27,000 CpG sites spread across the genome.

DESIGN
Bisulfite-converted DNA from 10 day workers and 10 shift workers were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2.
