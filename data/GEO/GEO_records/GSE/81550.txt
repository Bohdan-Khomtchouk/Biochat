TITLE
RNA-Seq expression profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent non-tumor tissues were from 3 male patients suffering from stage I or II HCC with hepatitis C virus background. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from total RNA using polyA enrichment strategy. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000 instruments.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptome differences between HCC and adjacent non-tumor tissue.

PLATFORM
