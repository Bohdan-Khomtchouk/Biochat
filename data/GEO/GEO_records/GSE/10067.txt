TITLE
Gene expression data from murine liver samples comparing hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) knockout mice vs. wildtype mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HSL is a key enzyme in in the mobilization of fatty acids from the triglyceride stores of white adipose tissue. In addition, it is expressed in mice liver.  In the present microarray study, changes in the transcript profile of murine liver samples due to global HSL knockout were investigated. Keywords: genetic modification
