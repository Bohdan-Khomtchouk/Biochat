TITLE
Genomic changes in low vs high metastatic A549 NSCLC cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic changes in low and highly metastatic A549 cells were analyzed by 500K SNP arrays. A large number of genomic alterations were present in A549 cells but no significant differences were observed between the low or highly metastatic A549 cell lines.

DESIGN
We generated a NSCLC line with highly increased propensity to form tumor nodules in murine lungs after intravenous injections. Extravasation and growth at a distant site are important parts of the metastatic process and we regarded these as a surrogate marker for in vivo aggressiveness and potential metastatic capability. A549 lung asdenocarcimona cell line with initially low metastatic potential was used for this purpose; these cells formed multiple small nodules in NOD/SCID mice after first i.v.-injection, round 1 (R1). Removal of tumor nodules from the lungs and subsequent re-injection led to a rapid increase in metastatic capacity. A highly aggressive phenotype which was stable over time was evident after three rounds (R3) of in vivo selection for the A549 cell line.
