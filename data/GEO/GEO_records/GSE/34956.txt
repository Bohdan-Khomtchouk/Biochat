TITLE
RNA expression for ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain LY180 in the absence and presence of 15 mM furfural for 15 min

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The data explore the transcriptional response of strain LY180 to 15 mM furfural under anaerobic fermentation conditions. The expression differences of oxidoreductase in LY180 are described.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from cultures of LY180 immediately before and 15 min after addition of furfural to 15 mM. The NimbleGen TI83333 chip measures expression of 4,237 genes, with 5 replicates, and 18 probes average per gene.
