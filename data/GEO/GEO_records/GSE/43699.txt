TITLE
microRNA expression patterns related to merkel cell polyomavirus infection in human merkel cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed miRNA expression profiling in  a series of human Merkel Cell carcinoma samples using a microarray approach. Significant differentially expressed miRNAs among groups were identified using SAM analysis.

DESIGN
Agilent microarray platform containing 723 human miRNAs was used to determine miRNA expression profiles in 16 human Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) samples. To validate the microarray platform, the expression levels of selected miRNAs were evaluated using qRT-PCR.
