TITLE
Listeria monocytogenes SOS response determined after mitomycin C exposure

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e

SUMMARY
The SOS response is a conserved pathway that is activated under certain stress conditions and is regulated by the repressor LexA and the activator RecA. The food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes contains RecA and LexA homologs, but their roles in Listeria have not been established. In this study, we identified the SOS regulon in L. monocytogenes by comparing the transcription profiles of the wild-type strain and the Î”recA mutant strain after exposure to the DNA damaging agent mitomycinC (MMC). The SOS response is an inducible pathway involved in DNA repair, restart of stalled replication forks, and in induction of genetic variation in stressed and stationary phase cells. It is regulated by LexA and RecA. LexA is an autoregulatory repressor which binds to a consensus sequence in the promoter region of the SOS response genes, thereby repressing transcription. A consensus LexA binding motif for L. monocytogenes has not been identified thus far. Generally, the SOS response is induced under circumstances in which single stranded DNA accumulates in the cell. This results in activation of  RecA, which in turn stimulates cleavage of LexA, and ultimately in the induction of the SOS response.
