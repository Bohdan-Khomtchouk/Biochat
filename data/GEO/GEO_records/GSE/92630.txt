TITLE
Pig testis extract augments the expression and secretion of adiponectin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adiponectin is known as a key molecule to ameliorate symptoms of the type 2 diabetes mellitus and disorder of lipid metabolism. In this study, we investigated whether hot water extracts of some livestock by-products induced expression of adiponectin using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Out of 11 extracts tested, pig testis extracts (PT) enhanced adiponectin mRNA expression and secretion of adiponectin protein from 3T3-L1 cells. Furthermore, simultaneous treatment with PT and daidzein, soy phytoestrogen, enhanced synergistically adiponectin secretion. Moreover, pretreatment with an estrogen receptor β (ERβ) antagonist (PHTPP) diminished adiponectin secretion in daidzein treated cell, but not in PT treated cells. Transcriptome analyses revealed that daidzein and PT commonly regulated PPAR signaling pathway, although gene expression was differently regulated in PT-treated cells and daidzein-treated cells. The expression of 476 and 380 genes significantly up-regulated in daidzein and PT treatment, although commonly regulated genes were only 86 genes. These results suggested that PT may ameliorate lipid metabolic dysfunction via promote adipocytes differentiation and enhance adiponectin secretion through different mechanism from daidzein.

DESIGN
3T3-L1 cells were induced into differentiated adipocytes and then treated with daidzein (25μM), PT (100μg/ml), daidzein+PT or PBS for 7 days.
