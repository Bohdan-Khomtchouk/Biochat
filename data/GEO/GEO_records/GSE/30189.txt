TITLE
Gene expression analysis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) combined with laser microdissection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wnt3 signaling pathway plays a central role in lymphomagenesis, and that specific mitotic regulators facilitate transformation into more aggressive forms.

DESIGN
For initiation, we compared the tumor cells of MCL in situ (n=4) with normal mantle zone B-lymphocytes (n=4), which were selected by laser microdissection.For transformation, we selected the overlapping genes differentially expressed between both cMCL (n=4) vs aMCL (n=5) and classical vs aggressive areas in iMCL (n=2).
