TITLE
Enrichment of H3K9me2 on unsynapsed chromatin in C. elegans does not target de novo sites [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Characterization of the H3K9me2 distribution in the C. elegans adult hermaphrodite genome using ChIP-Seq

DESIGN
Examination of H3K9me2 in two different nematode strains: fer-1 control and fer-1;him-8 mutant, where the X chromosomes are unsynapsed.  The fer-1 mutation prevents production of embryos.
