TITLE
Relief of feedback inhibition of HER3 transcription by RAF and MEK inhibitors attenuates their antitumor effects in BRAF mutant thyroid carcinomas.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptome kinetics of SW1736 thyroid cancer cell line vs SK-MEL-28 melanoma cell line at various times after addition of 2 µM vemurafenib. The hypothesis tested was that SW1736 cells (vemurafenib-refractory) differentially express genes compared to SK-MEL-28 cells (vemurafenib sensitive) that confer resistance to the RAF inhibitor.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from lysates of SW1726 and SK-MEL-28 cells treated with 2 µM vemurafenib for 0, 1, 6 and 48 h. Experiment was made by triplicate.
