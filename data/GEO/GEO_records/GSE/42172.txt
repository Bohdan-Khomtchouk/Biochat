TITLE
Effect of cigarette smoke extract, cisplatin, nicotine and/or ionizing radiation on gene expression in the NCI-H460 human lung large cell carcinoma cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the effect of nicotine on sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation or anti-cancer drugs, NCI-H460 human lung large cell carcinoma cells were treated with 6 Gy ionizing radiation or 1 uM cisplatin after exposure to 5 uM nicotine or cigarette smoke extract. Whole genome expression in total RNA extracted from the treated cells was quantified using the GeneChip™ Human Gene 1.0 ST microarray platform from Affymetrix® (Santa Clara, CA).

DESIGN
Cells were subjected to one of nine types of treatment in triplicate and harvested for RNA extraction after 2 or 24 hours. Thus, 54 RNA samples representing biological triplicates for nine types of treatments and two time-points were obtained and analyzed using microarrays (one array per RNA sample, without technical replication).
