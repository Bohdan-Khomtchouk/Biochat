TITLE
miRNA profiling of EV71 infected HT29 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HT29 cells was infected with EV71 at MOI 1 or nil respectively and harvested at 36hpi We use miRNA microarray to profile and identify miRNA which are up or down regulated due to EV71 infection

DESIGN
3 biological replicate (6 samples)

PLATFORM
GPL14613 [miRNA-2] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-2 Array
