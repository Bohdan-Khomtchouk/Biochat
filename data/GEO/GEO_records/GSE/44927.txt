TITLE
Transcriptional responses of control and MDV3100 resistant lines to DMSO or MDV3100

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LNCaP-derived MDV3100-resistant clones were treated with MDV3100 for 24h prior to collection This experiment is designed to see if MDV3100 resistant clones remain responsive to MDV3100

DESIGN
Control and resistant clones were seeded in 6-well plates for 3d prior to treatment with DMSO or MDV3100 for 24h

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
