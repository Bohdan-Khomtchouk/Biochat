TITLE
Cooperative function of the three different kinds of nucleoid-associated proteins encoded on the IncP-7 plasmid pCAR1 [pCAR1 plasmid chip]

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida

SUMMARY
Nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) are known to fold bacterial DNA and influence global transcription. Incompatibility P-7 plasmid pCAR1 carries three genes encoding NAPs: H-NS family protein Pmr, NdpA-like protein Pnd, and HU-like protein Phu. Because previous reports about plasmid-encoded NAPs mainly focused on H-NS homologs, functions and importance of different kinds of NAPs encoded on a plasmid remained unknown. Here, we assessed the effects of single or double disruption of pmr, pnd, and phu in a host P. putida KT2440. When pmr and pnd or pmr and phu were disrupted simultaneously, stability and conjugation frequency of pCAR1 decreased significantly. In the comprehensive phenotypes comparisons, host availabilities of some compounds, which were reduced by pCAR1carriage, were restored by NAP-gene(s)-disruption. Transcriptome analyses showed that Pmr and Pnd have different regulons, whereas Phu mainly supports their gene regulation. These cooperative functions of the three NAPs were not simply due to protein-protein interactions because hetero-oligomers of them were not detected in pull-down assays. Our present study is the first report about the cooperative function of plasmid-encoded different kinds of NAPs, which show no homology with each other.

DESIGN
The NAPs-dependent change of RNA maps in early exponential phases.
