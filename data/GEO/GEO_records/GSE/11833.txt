TITLE
LL-sh4/uninfected/shGFP ANOVA group

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify genes with differential gene expression or alternative splicing between the groups LL-sh4, uninfected, and shGFP we study 6 hybridizations on the Human Exon 1.0 ST array using mixed model analysis of variance.  842 genes with significant gene expression differences between the groups and 1118 genes with significant exon-group interaction (a symptom of alternative splicing) were found, including 192 genes with both gene and possible splicing differences (p < 0.01).  Contingency table analysis of the set of studied genes and a dataset of known pathways and gene classifications revealed that the set of alternatively spliced and expressed genes were found to be significantly over-represented in groups of the GOMolFn, GOProcess, GOCellLoc, and Pathway classes  (p < 0.01). Algorithm ANOVA study of 6 Human Exon 1.0 ST files.
