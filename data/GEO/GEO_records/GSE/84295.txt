TITLE
ChIP-chip assay on circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) genomic DNA sample from human telomerase-immortalized corneal epithelial (HTCE) cells with the specification of CTCF binding

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ability of CTCF binding on various gene promoters is essential to regulate their expression. It's been demonstrated that cornea-specific Pax6 expression is regulated conversely by CTCF (Li et al.). circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) and ChIP-chip profiling have been performed using HTCE cells. This approach is to elicit the epigenetic mechanism involving CTCF-mediated chromatin remodeling that regulates Pax6 and some target gene interactions.

DESIGN
Compare CTCF interactions of gene promoters in HTCE cell
