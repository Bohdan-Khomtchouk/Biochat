ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis was also performed on 13 primary and established human ovarian cancer cell lines (A2008, OAW42, OVCAR2, OVCAR3, OVCAR4, OVCAR5, OVCAR8, OVCAR10, OV7M, OV95, PE01, PE04, SKOV3) using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays

DESIGN
The study focused on ovarian cancer chemokine expressions
