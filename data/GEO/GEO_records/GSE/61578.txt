TITLE
Gene Expression and HD-SNP6.0 data from Primary Testicular (PTL), Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) and Primary Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma (PMLBCL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We obtained gene expression data and HD-SNP6.0 copy number data from PTL, PCNSL and PMLBCL samples and performed an integrative analysis on them. RNA was whole genome amplified using Nugen.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles (GEP) and copy number (CN) data were obtained from 7 PTL. GEP was obtained from 15 PCNSL and CN from 23 PCNSL (overlap of 11). The PMLBCL series contained GEP of 9 and CN data from 11 cases (overlap of 9). 180 samples from GSE34171 provide the framework for the CN analysis and are therefore added to the segmented CN file (input_to_gistic.seg.txt).
