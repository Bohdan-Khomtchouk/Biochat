TITLE
Sleep apnea and glucose metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study examines the relationship between sleep apnea and glucose metabolism.  Physiological studies have demonstrated that 5 days of exposure to intermittent hypoxia (similar to what occurs with sleep apnea) leads to significant improvements in glucose tolerance. Therefore, this study investigates the hypothesis that intermittent hypoxia may lead to upregulation of some novel peptide(s) that have a powerful glucose lowering action. Keywords: other
