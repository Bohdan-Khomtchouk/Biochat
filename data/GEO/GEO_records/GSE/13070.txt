TITLE
Human Insulin Resistance and Thiazolidinedione-Mediated Insulin Sensitization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cellular and tissue defects associated with insulin resistance are coincident with transcriptional abnormalities and are improved after insulin sensitization with thiazolidinedione (TZD) PPARÎ³ ligands. We transcriptionally profiled 364 biopsies gathered from 72 human subjects harvested before and after hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, at baseline and after three-month TZD treatment. Subjects range from insulin-sensitive to insulin-resistant. Insulin resistant subjects responded to TZD treatment with varied improvements in insulin sensitivity, thus they were ranked by their degree of TZD response to define responder and non-responder subgroups.

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from vastus lateralis before and after hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, at baseline and after three-month TZD treatment. Adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from abdominal subcutaneous before clamp, at baseline and after three-month TZD treatment. *** CEL files not provided for 40 Samples. ***
