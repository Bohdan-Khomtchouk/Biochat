TITLE
Gene expression profiles of mouse long term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells treated with p300/catenin antagonist YH250 vs control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report a single dose administration of p300/catenin antagonist YH250 can up-regulate ID2 gene expression and promote long term HSC non-differenciative proliferation.

DESIGN
It is expected that some genes playing roles in maintenance of stemness and symetyric expansion will be upregulated by the treatment of YH250 compared with control.

PLATFORM
