TITLE
Expression data from lupus NZB/W and NZW/BXSB mouse prenephritic kidneys

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We defined the shared and unique features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) nephritis in 2 mouse models of proliferative renal disease. We identified shared inflammatory mechanisms of SLE nephritis that can be therapeutically targeted. Some common mechanisms are shared with non-immune-mediated renal diseases, suggesting that new strategies to prevent tissue hypoxia and remodeling may be useful in SLE nephritis.

DESIGN
RNA from whole kidneys was extracted and processed for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
