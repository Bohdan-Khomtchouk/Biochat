TITLE
Chronological expression data from mouse skeletal muscle stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Satellite cells are the primary source of stem cells for skeletal muscle growth and regeneration. Since adult stem cell maintenance involves a fine balance between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, we performed genome-wide chronological expression profiling to identify the transcriptomic changes involved in acquisition of muscle stem cell characteristics.

DESIGN
Muscle samples were isolated from the trunk during development, postnatally and in adult and aged Pax3GFP/+ mice. After digestion, GFP cells were purified via FACS and process for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays). The different ages selected for sample isolation were E11.5-E12.5-E13.5-E14.5-E15.5-E17.5-P1-P12-1MO-2MO-18MO (E, Embryonic days; P, Postnatal days; MO, age in months), covering embryonic and fetal progenitors and proliferant, quiescent satellite cells. The eleven stages were done in triplicate for E11.5-E12.5-E14.5-E15.5-1MO-2MO-18MO, twice for E13.5, 4 times for P1-P12 and 5 times for E17.5, so 36 samples included in the microarray.
