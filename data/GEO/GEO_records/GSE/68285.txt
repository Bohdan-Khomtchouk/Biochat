TITLE
miRNAs expression profile of the cumulus cell samples with PCOS and non-PCOS

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
To reveal microRNAs expression differences in cumulus cells between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and non-PCOS women. miRNAs expression profile of the cumulus cell samples with PCOS and non-PCOS were determined by Affymetrix miRNA 2.0.
