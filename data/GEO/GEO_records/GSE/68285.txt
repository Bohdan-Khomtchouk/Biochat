TITLE
miRNAs expression profile of the cumulus cell samples with PCOS and non-PCOS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To reveal microRNAs expression differences in cumulus cells between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and non-PCOS women. miRNAs expression profile of the cumulus cell samples with PCOS and non-PCOS were determined by Affymetrix miRNA 2.0.

DESIGN
Six pooled RNAs from CC samples (three PCOS and three non-PCOS pooled RNAs) were separately analyzed on 6 GeneChip miRNA 2.0 Array (miRBase V15)
