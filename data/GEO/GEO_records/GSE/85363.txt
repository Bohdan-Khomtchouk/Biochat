TITLE
microRNA profiles of CD4 T cells after cognate antigen specfic stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of miRNAs from CD4 T cells after their encounter with DCs in the presence of the antigen vs the absence

DESIGN
To determine the changes on miRNA repertoires CD4 T cells upon antigen specfic activation, CD4 T cells were cocultuered for 18 h with dendric cells in the absense or presence of the specific antigen OVA. Subsecuently, CD4 T cells where sorted by flow cytometry and their RNA isolated for the microarray analysis.
