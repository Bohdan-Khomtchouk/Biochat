TITLE
Differential expression in Wn5a and vector transduced 4T1 cells. [Affymetrix microarray data]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A highly metastatic breast cancer cell line, 4T1, was used to generate stable Wnt5a expressing and vector only control cells.  Cells were generated using lentivirus infection and selection with blasticidin. Expression of Wnt5a was confirmed using western blot.  Cell behaviour was characterized. Wnt5a expressing cells exhibited reduced migration in a transwell assay and reduced metastasis in a tail vein injection assay. Growth was not significantly affected.

DESIGN
Four total samples.  Two biological replicates of the Wnt5a expressing cells and two biological replicates of the vector only control cells. RNA was isolated from cells close to confluence (70%).
