TITLE
Comparison between WT and bes1 in an in vitro tissue culture system, VISUAL

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We have previously established an in vitro tissue culture system (named VISUAL; Kondo et al., 2016), in which xylem and phloem differentiation can be induced with Arabidopsis thaliana cotyledons To compare gene expression profiles between WT and bes1 during vascular development, we performed GeneChip analysis using VISUAL.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis cotyledons were sampled at 0 h and 72 h after VISUAL induction.
