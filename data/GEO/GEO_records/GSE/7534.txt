TITLE
Pedigreed Primate Embryonic Stem Cells Express Homogeneous Familial Gene Profiles

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Pedigreed primate ESCs display homogeneous and reliable expression profiles. These similarities to mouse ESCs suggest that heterogeneities found among hESCs result from their disparate origins rather than intrinsic biological limitations with primate embryonic stem cells. Keywords: different nhpESC lines

DESIGN
RNA extraction was performed from 10 nhpESC and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To determine whether primate ESCs have intrinsic biological limitations compared with mouse ESCs [mESCs], we examined expression profiles and pluripotency of newly established pedigreed non-human primate ESC (nhpESCs).  Ten pedigreed nhpESCs, seven full-siblings (fraternal quadruplets and fraternal triplets) and nine half-siblings were derived from 41 rhesus embryos Information about pedigrees may be found in Pedigree_Attributes.xls.
