TITLE
Pedigreed Primate Embryonic Stem Cells Express Homogeneous Familial Gene Profiles

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Pedigreed primate ESCs display homogeneous and reliable expression profiles. These similarities to mouse ESCs suggest that heterogeneities found among hESCs result from their disparate origins rather than intrinsic biological limitations with primate embryonic stem cells. Keywords: different nhpESC lines
