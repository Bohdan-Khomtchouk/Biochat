TITLE
miRNA array data of human ESCC tissues and normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human miRNA profiles of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are rarely reported. Surgically removed human ESCC tissues and matched normal esophageal epithelial tissues (5cm away from tumor) were collected to make an Agilent microarray.

DESIGN
Three paired of human ESCC tissues and normal controls were collected. All patients have no radiotherapy or chemotherapy before surgery. None of these three patients have distant metastasis.
