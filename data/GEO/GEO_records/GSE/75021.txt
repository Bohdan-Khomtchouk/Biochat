TITLE
Gene expression data of rat prostate cancer tissue treated with OBP-801, novel HDAC inhibitor

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide gene expression was obtained from non-treated or OBP-801 treated TRAP rats which develop prostate cancer. The primary aim was to identify genes which regulate prostate carcinogenesis induced by OBP-801.

DESIGN
Six week-old male TRAP rats were intravenously injected with 1mg of OBP-801 or saline 2 times a week. After 8 weeks, rats were sacrificed and total RNAs were extracted from ventral and lateral prostate. The RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen); RNA samples were amplified, And the cDNA was hybridized onto rat microarrays.
