TITLE
Assessing rejection-related disease in kidney transplant biopsies based on archetypal analysis of molecular phenotypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Molecular phenotyping of biopsies affords opportunities for increased precision and improved disease classification to address the limitations of conventional histologic diagnostic systems. We applied archetypal analysis, an unsupervised method similar to cluster analysis, to microarray data from 1208 prospectively collected kidney transplant biopsies from 13 centers. Seven machine learning-generated cross-validated classifier scores per biopsy were used as input for the archetypal analysis. Six archetypes representing extreme phenotypes were generated: no rejection; T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR); three phenotypes associated with antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) - early-stage, fully-developed, and late-stage; and mixed rejection (TCMR plus early-stage ABMR). Each biopsy was assigned six scores, one for each archetype, that together represent a probabilistic assessment of that biopsy based on its rejection-related molecular properties. Viewed as clusters, the archetypes were similar to existing histologic Banff categories, but there was 32% disagreement, much of it probably reflecting the “noise” in the current histologic assessment system. Graft survival was worst for fully-developed and late-stage ABMR and was better predicted by molecular archetype scores than histologic diagnoses. The results provide a system for precision molecular assessment of biopsies and a new standard for recalibrating conventional diagnostic systems. (ClinicalTrials.gov NTC1299168)
