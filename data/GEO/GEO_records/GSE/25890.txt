TITLE
Expression data from mouse Nuocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nuocytes are a recently described cell that responds to both IL-25 and IL-33 and produce high levels of IL-13 and IL-5

DESIGN
Mice were administered with 3 daily doses of IL-25 (400 ng/dose).  Nuocytes were purified by flow cytometry. Spleen cells prepared from IL-25-treated mice were depleted of lineage+ cells before cell sorting by incubation with biotin-conjugated anti-CD3, anti-CD19, anti-CD11b and anti-FcεRI antibodies before removal of antibody-bound cells by magnetic separation using Dynabeads (Invitrogen). Lineage-depleted cells were stained with PE-conjugated antibodies against CD4, CD8, B220, TER-119 and CD11b, a FITC-conjugated antibody against CD45, and an APC-conjugated antibody against ICOS. PE−, FITC+, APC+ cells were collected using a Mo-flo cell sorter, and purity was checked by staining with lineage antibodies and antibodies against IL-17BR and T1/ST2.  Following purification nuocytes were prepared directly for microarray gene expression analysis or cultured with IL-33 and IL-7 (both at 10 nanograms/ml) for 9 days before being prepared for microarray gene expression analysis.
