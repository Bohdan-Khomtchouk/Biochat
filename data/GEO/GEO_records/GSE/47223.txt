TITLE
Global transcriptional profile of Streptomyces avermitilis wild-type strain ATCC31267 and avermectin overproducing strain 76-02-e at different time points

ORGANISM
Streptomyces avermitilis

SUMMARY
To discover novel regulators that influence avermectin biosynthesis, comparative transcriptome analysis between wild-type strain ATCC31267 and avermectin overproducing strain 76-02-e were performed to reveal some differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
Global gene expression in ATCC31267 and 76-02-e was measured  at day 2 (early exponential phase) or day 6 (stationary phase), respectively. Three independent experiments for 76-02-e and one for ATCC31267 were performed at each condition.

PLATFORM
GPL17193 Agilent-020986 Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680 microarray
