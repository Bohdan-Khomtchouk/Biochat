TITLE
H3K27me3 dynamics dictate evolving uterine states in pregnancy and parturition [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Uncovering the causes of pregnancy complications such as preterm labor requires greater insight into how the uterus remains in a non-contractile state until term and then surmounts this state to enter labor. Here, we show in mice that dynamic deposition and removal of repressive H3K27me3 chromatin marks in decidual stromal cells dictate both elements of pregnancy success. In early gestation, H3K27me3-induced transcriptional silencing of select gene targets insures uterine quiescence by preventing the decidua from expressing parturition-inducing hormone receptors, manifesting type 1 immunity, and, most unexpectedly, generating myofibroblasts and associated wound healing responses. In late gestation, genome-wide H3K27 demethylation allows for target gene upregulation, decidual activation, and labor entry. Strikingly, pharmacological inhibition of this latter process not only prevented term parturition, but also inhibited delivery while maintaining pup viability in a non-inflammatory model of preterm parturition. Immunofluorescence analysis of human specimens suggested that similar regulatory events might occur in the human decidua. Together, these results reveal the centrality of regulated gene silencing in the uterine adaptation to pregnancy and suggest new areas in the study and treatment of pregnancy disorders.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was performed on stromal cells purified from different uterine tissue layers and cultured for 24 prior to analysis.  Biological replicates (1-3) are indicated.
