TITLE
Microarray analysis of Normal and MPS VII mouse aorta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII) is due to mutations within the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase, and results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans.  MPS VII causes aortic dilatation and elastin fragmentation. In this study we performed microarray analysis of ascending aortas from normal and MPS VII mice, trying to find out possible genes responsible for the phenotype observed. In addition, during our breeding strategy, we noticed that some MPS VII mice had less dilated aortas, and we proposed that an yet-unidentified gene could be responsible for the difference observed. We therefore included in the analysis two MPS VII mice with aortas that were not dilated.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from ascending aortas from 3 Normal mice, 3 MPS VII mice with dilated aortas and 2 MPS VII mice with aortas that were not dilated.
