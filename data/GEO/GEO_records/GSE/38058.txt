TITLE
Gene expression profiling in HSF1-knockdown human oral squamous cell carcinoma HSC-3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) is recognized as the major regulator of the heat shock transcriptional response, and also plays a central role in the cellular functions of cancer cells. Here, to identify the molecular mechanism by which HSF1 regulates the proliferation of cancer cells, comparative gene expression analysis was performed with mock and HSF1-knockdown cells. Silencing of HSF1 in human oral squamous cell carcinoma HSC-3 cells was carried out by siRNA technology and the expression of HSF1 was confirmed by Western blotting. Gene expression was analyzed using GeneChip oligonucleotide microarrays and computational gene expression analysis tools. HSF1 knockdown significantly decreased the number of viable cells. Of the 54,675 probe sets analyzed, 221 probe sets were up-regulated and 423 probe sets were down-regulated by > 2-fold in HSF1-knockdown cells.

DESIGN
HSC-3 human oral squamous carcinoma cells were treated with siRNA for HSF1 or luciferase. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with a Human Genome U133-plus 2.0 array. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.
