TITLE
The ISW1 and CHD1 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers compete to set nucleosome spacing in vivo

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We addressed the roles of three nucleosome spacing enzymes (ISW1, ISW2 and CHD1) in specifying chromatin organization in S. cerevisiae.

DESIGN
Comparison of budding yeast nucleosome positions obtained using micrococcal nuclease digestion followed by paired-end sequencing (MNase-seq). We sequenced nucleosomes from isogenic strains with the isw1Δ, isw2Δ or chd1Δ mutations in all combinations. We measured gene activity by ChIP-seq for the Rpb3 subunit of RNA polymerase II for some of these mutants.
