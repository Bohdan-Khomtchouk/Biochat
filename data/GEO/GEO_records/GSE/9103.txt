TITLE
Skeletal Muscle Transcript Profiles in Trained or Sedentary Young and Old Subjects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aging  is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance. We conducted a study to determine the role of long-term vigorous endurance exercise on age-related changes in insulin sensitivity and various indices of mitochondrial functions. Keywords: The effect of excises in young and old human subjects by transcription profiling

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle transcript profiling was done using  Vastus Lateralis muscle biopsy samples from 10 young sedentary (YS), 10 older sedentary (OS), 10 young trained (YT) and 10 older trained (OT) men and women.  Note that YT2, YS1, and OT1 didn't pass the Quality Control Step of dChip (high array/single outliers). Sedentary subjects exercised less than 30 min/day, twice per week.  Trained subjects performed â‰¥ 1 hour cycling or running 6 days/week over the past 4 years.
