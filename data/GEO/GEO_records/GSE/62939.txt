TITLE
Expression data of human tympanic membrane cells and epidermal keratinocytes [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The data set compares the gene expression of two types of keratinocytes from the tympanic membrane and epidermis of the body. Healthy human samples were harvested for the analysis. Cells were cultivated to evaluate the effekt of keratinocytes only. 626 Chip Ids considered differentially expressed between the cell types. Enrichment tests show genes related to migration are over-represented in the highly expressed genes of TMK vs. EK.

DESIGN
Six samples were analysed in total. Each cell type in biological triplicates. Genes of p-value < 0.05 and fold change of â‰¥ 1.5 were considered significant.
