TITLE
Mouse HCC model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A mouse model of HCC has been developed based on the reported inactivation of the RB pathway in the majority of human HCC. This mouse model harbors floxed alleles of Rb and p130 genes, as well as germline mutation of the p107 gene. Various strategies to activate the activity of a Cre recombinase leads to the efficient deletion of the three genes in the liver of adult mice (TKO mice). Disruption of the RB pathway induces the rapid development of HCC. These HCCs share many similar features of human HCC.

DESIGN
The goal of this array is to assess genome wide expression of TKO HCCs. Gene expression of control livers (n=4) or TKO HCCs (n=5) was measured using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430-2.0 arrays
