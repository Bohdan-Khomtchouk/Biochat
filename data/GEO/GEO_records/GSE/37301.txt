TITLE
Expression data of Rag2-deficient Ets1++ and Rag2-deficient Ets1-- mature NK cells and WT bone marrow progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of Rag2-deficient Ets1++ and Rag2-deficient Ets1-- mature NK cells and WT bone marrow progenitors, WT T cells, and WT Pro B cells

DESIGN
WT Hematopoietic progenitors, CD4 T cells, Pro B cells, and WT and Ets1-deficient NK cells were FACs sorted. RNA was subsequently extracted, labelled, and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. The goal if this experiment was to identify Ets1 dependent genes in NK cells
