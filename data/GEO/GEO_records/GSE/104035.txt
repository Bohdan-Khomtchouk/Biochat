TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of gibberellic acid and paclobutrazol treated rice seedlings under submergence

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Analysis of the impact of plant growth regulators on submergence tolerance of rice at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the submergence-tolerance was improved by foliar application of paclobutrazol under sumergence stress conditions.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from leaves of rice treated by plant growth regulators subjected to 4 days in submergence condition compared to un-plant growth regulators treatment.

PLATFORM
GPL13160 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Oryza sativa)
