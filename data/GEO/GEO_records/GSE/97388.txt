TITLE
In vitro differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into ovarian follicle-like cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding the unique mechanisms of human oogenesis necessitates the development of an in vitro system of stem cell differentiation into oocytes. Specialized cell types and organoids have been derived from human pluripotent stem cells in vitro, but generating a human ovarian follicle remains a challenge. Here we report that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be induced to differentiate into ovarian follicle-like cells in vitro. First, we find that two RNA-binding proteins specifically expressed in germ cells, DAZL and BOULE, regulate the exit from pluripotency and entry into meiosis. By expressing DAZL and BOULE with recombinant human GDF9 and BMP15, these meiotic germ cells are further induced to form ovarian follicle-like cells (FLCs), including oocytes and granulosa cells. This robust in vitro differentiation system will allow the study of the unique molecular mechanisms underlying human pluripotent stem cell differentiation into late PGCs, meiotic germ cells, and ovarian follicles.
