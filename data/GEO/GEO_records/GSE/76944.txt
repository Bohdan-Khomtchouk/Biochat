TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression profile of the inguinal fat in C57BL/6J mice after weight regain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To search for genes and pathways that are involved in obesity memory, we harvested the inguinal fat after weight regain and performed gene expression profiling using mouse gene expression microarrays.

DESIGN
The gene expression profiles were measured in mice which experienced high fat diet induced obesity, calorie restriction and weight regain (DIO group) and control mice (CTR group), each group have three replicates.
