TITLE
ChIP-Seq data for histone marks in estrogen-inducible MyoD1 fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The conversion of fibroblasts to myotubes by forced expression of MyoD1 is among the earliest demonstrations of reprogramming of vertebrate cell state.   To gain insights into the chromatin state of genes required for reprogramming, we profiled H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3.

DESIGN
DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. ChIP was performed using an antibody against H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3.
