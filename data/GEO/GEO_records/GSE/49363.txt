TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of a Sordaria macrospora nox1 mutant

ORGANISM
Sordaria macrospora

SUMMARY
The Sordaria macrospora nox1 mutant has a block in sexual development at the stage of protoperithecia formation, and therefore is sterile. The aim of this study was to determine the transcriptome of microdissected protoperithecia from the mutant, as well as the transcriptomes of total RNA from the mutant and the wild type for comparison. The data were then compared with transcriptome data from protoperithecia of the wild type and the developemental mutant pro1; the corresponding data were generated in a previous study (Teichert et al. 2012, BMC Genomics 13: 511, GEO accession GSE33668).

DESIGN
The samples (amplified RNA from nox1 microdissected protoperithecia and total RNA from nox1 and wild type mycelia undergoing sexual development) were sequenced as paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000, two independent biological replicates for each nox1 sample and one replicate for the wild type.
