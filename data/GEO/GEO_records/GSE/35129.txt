TITLE
Expression data from Integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-deficient epidermis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ILK is essential for proper development of hair follicles, and for epidermal integrity and repair after injury. To better understand the pathways modulated by ILK in the epidermis, we compared the transcriptomes of ILK-deficient and -expressing epidermis using microarray analyses.

DESIGN
Ilktm1Star (with floxed Ilk alleles) and Tg(KRT14-cre)1Amc/J mice were bred, and the resulting mice were bred again with Ilktm1Star mice, to generate animals heterozygos for the  KRT14-cre transgene and either heterozygous (ILK-expressing) or homozygous (ILK-deficient) for the floxed Ilk alleles. The epidermis of 3 day-old animals was harvested and used to prepare RNA for the microarrays. The animals used were littermates. RNA from the epidermis of five ILK-deficient and five ILK-expressing mice were used.
