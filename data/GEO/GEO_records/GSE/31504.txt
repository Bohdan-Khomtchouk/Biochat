TITLE
Impact of Gene Expression Profiling Based Risk Stratification in Patients with Myeloma Receiving Initial Therapy with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Detection of specific chromosomal abnormalities by FISH and metaphase cytogenetics allows risk stratification in multiple myeloma (MM); however, gene expression profiling (GEP) based signatures may enable more specific risk categorization. We examined the utility of two GEP-based risk stratification systems among patients undergoing initial therapy with lenalidomide in the context of a phase 3 trial.

DESIGN
The E4A03 clinical trial randomized patients with previously untreated MM to lenalidomide and either standard-dose dexamethasone. Baseline bone marrow samples were obtained from consenting patients. The marrow aspirates were subjected to a fully automated ROBOSEP cell separation system that utilizes immunomagnetic technology to positively select for CD 138+ cells. The purity of the sorting was confirmed by 3-color immunofluorescent slide based assessment on the sorted cells. The plasma cell gene expression proÔ¨Åles were analyzed using U133 Plus 2.0 array. All samples were run individually with no pooling. The GEP-70 signature was determined as previously described, using log2 transformed raw MAS 5.0 signals. The GEP15 classification was performed as previously described, with the patients in highest quartile for the risk score being considered as high risk.
