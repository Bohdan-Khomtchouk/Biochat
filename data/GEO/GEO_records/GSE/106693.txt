TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of Schistosoma mansoni f zfp-1-1(RNAi) parasites

ORGANISM
Schistosoma mansoni

SUMMARY
We distrupted the expression of the Schistosoma mansoni zfp-1-1 gene using RNA interference and examined the transcriptional effects by illumina sequencing

DESIGN
The transcriptional effects of zfp-1-1 RNAi were examined by RNAseq

PLATFORM
GPL24248 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Schistosoma mansoni)
