TITLE
Methylation profiling of molar tissues caused by recessive maternal-effect NLRP7 mutations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Approximately 70% of women suffering with familial recurrent moles (RHM) are associated with recessive mutations of NLRP7, which cause the RHM by maternal-effect. It has been proposed that the phenotypes of molar pregnancies are associated with aberrant genomic imprinting. Using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip arrays we characterize the genome-wide methylation profile of 4 molar samples and blood from the female patients. We confirm widespread loss-of-imprinting in the RHM samples but not in the blood-derived DNA from the asymptomatic female patients.  The aberrant methylation at imprinted loci was confirmed using bisulphite PCR and subcloning or pyrosequencing. Finally, by comparing the methylation patterns observed in the RHM with normal placenta biopsies we identify many candidate maternally methylated regions, consistent with novel imprinted genes.

DESIGN
DNA was quantified by Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Reagent (Invitrogen) and the integrity was analyzed in a 1.3% agarose gel. Bisulfite conversion of 600 ng of each sample was perform according to the manufacturer's recommendation for Illumina Infinium Assay. Effective bisulphite conversion was checked for three controls that were converted simultaneously with the samples. 4 ul of bisulfite converted DNA were used to hybridize on Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip, following Illumina Infinium HD Methylation protocol. Chip analysis was performed using Illumina HiScan SQ fluorescent scanner. The intensities of the images are extracted using GenomeStudio (2011.2) Methylation module (1.8.5) software. Methylation score of each CpG is represented as beta value.
