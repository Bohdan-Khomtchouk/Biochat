TITLE
Effect of an AhR-/- on transcription in CD4 T cells from the spleen.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD4+ T cells from 8-12 week female mice were isolated from wt and AhR-/- mice 24h after  injection of 10Âµg/kg TCDD or solvent control. Keywords: TCDD, AHR, immunosuppression

DESIGN
Each experiment was performed in biological duplicates from 4 pooled animals. Since TCDD treatment showed only marginal impact on the gene expression (~10 transcripts effected in wt mice) wt - ko comparisons were performed on pooled profiles from TCDD and solvent mice.
