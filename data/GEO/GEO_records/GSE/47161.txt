TITLE
Expression data from visceral mesothelium (omentum) and parietal meosthelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mesothelia, which cover all coelomic organs and body cavities in vertebrates, perform diverse functions in embryonic and adult life.  Yet, mesothelia are traditionally viewed as simple, uniform epithelia. We used microarrays to demonstrate distinct differences between visceral and parietal mesothelia, the most basic subdivision of this tissue type, in terms of gene expression.

DESIGN
Visceral mesothelium was isolated from the omentum of adult Wt1-cre;Rosa26ReYFP mice. In parallel, parietal mesothelium was isolated by teasing the mesothelium from the underlying skeletal muscle of the body wall of these animals. RNA was then extracted from these native mesothelia samples and used for hybridization in a microarray experiment.
