TITLE
Expression data from PPARg WT and KO macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PPARg is a nuclear receptor that plays an important role in lipid metabolism, homeostasis and immunity. Microarray analysis of gene expression was performed in macrophages from WT and PPARg KO mice. Differentially expressed genes were selected for further analysis.

DESIGN
RNA from WT and PPARg KO macrophages was purified for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Peritoneal macrophages were harvest from WT and PPARg KO mice 3 days after intraperitoneal injection of 2.5ml of 3% thioglycollate.
