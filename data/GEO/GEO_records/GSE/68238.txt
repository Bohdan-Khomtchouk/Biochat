TITLE
Redefining the role of eIF4E dose in development, cancer, and protein synthesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
eIF4E, the major cap-binding protein, has long been considered limiting for translating the mammalian genome. However, the requirement for eIF4E dose at an organismal level remains unexplored. By generating an Eif4e haploinsufficient mouse, we surprisingly found that 50% reduction in eIF4E, while compatible with normal development and global protein synthesis, significantly impeded cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Genome-wide translational profiling uncovered a translational program induced by oncogenic transformation and revealed a critical role for eIF4E dose specifically in translating a network of mRNAs enriched for a unique 5â€™UTR signature. In particular, we demonstrate that eIF4E dose is essential for translating mRNAs regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that fuel transformation and cancer cell survival in vivo. Therefore, mammalian cells have evolved surplus eIF4E levels that cancer cells hijack to drive a translational program supporting tumorigenesis

DESIGN
Total cellular RNA and high MW polysome associated RNA were isolated from matched untransformed and tranformed WT and Eif4e+/- MEFs for analysis on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays. The difference in log2 RMA intensity between matched polysomal RNA and total RNA was taken to quantify translational efficiency (TE).
