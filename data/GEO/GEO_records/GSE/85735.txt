TITLE
miR-449 regulated mitotic genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Progression trough cell cycle depends on the cycling of a significant fraction of the transcriptome and the proteome. This involves transcription and translation of large groups of cycling mRNAs in a given cell cycle stage, and their subsequent rapid degradation and/or translation inhibition in another. miRNAs are strong candidates as regulators of these important fluctuations during cell cycle progression, since they mediate both degradation of target mRNAs with fully complementary sequences, and down-regulation of the translation of mRNAs with non-perfect complementarity. A growing body of evidence suggests that miRNAs play an important role in the control of cell cycle, cell division, and proliferation. In this project we address mitotic gene regulation by miRNA-449 using a gene expression approach.

DESIGN
miR-449 and negative control mimic induced gene expression was measured 48 hours after transfection of the mimic molecules.
