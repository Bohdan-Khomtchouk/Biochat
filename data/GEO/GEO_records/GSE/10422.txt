TITLE
Traf2 and Traf3 B cell knockout mice and Baff tg mice - gene expression in lymph node B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumor necrosis factor-associated factors 2 and 3 (TRAF2 and TRAF3) were shown to function in a co-operative and non-redundant manner to suppress nuclear factor-κB2 (NF-κB2) activation, gene expression and survival in mature B cells. In the absence of this suppressive activity, B cells developed independently of the obligatory B cell survival factor, BAFF (B cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family).  This constitutive, lineage-specific suppression of B cell survival by TRAF2 and TRAF3 determines the requirement for BAFF to sustain B cell development in vivo.  We wished to investigate the effect on gene expression in B cells which lacked the negative regulators TRAF2 and TRAF3, and hence had hyperactive NF-kB2 signalling.  As Baff-tg mice display a similar phenotype, and have a genetic modification which acts in the same pathway, yet further up, than TRAF2 and TRAF3, we wished to compare and contrast Baff-tg B cells with TRAF2 and TRAF3 deficient B cells.  This analysis should identify genes that are important in B cell survival. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Lymph node B cells were purified from Traf2 B cell knockout mice, Traf3 B cell knockout mice, Baff-tg mice and respective controls.  RNA was extracted and hybridised to Affymetrix 430 2.0 Mouse Genome Arrays.  Samples were processed and hence analysed on three spearate days.  Day 1 two control mice: Traf2lox/lox pool and CD19-cretg were compared to two knockout mice: Traf2DB 80 and Traf3DB 94.  On Day 2 three control mice: Traf2lox/lox 77, Traf2lox/lox 79 and Traf3lox/lox 97 were compared to two knockout mice: Traf2DB 76 and Traf3DB 01.  On Day 3 three control mice: WT33, WT34, WT35 were compared to three Baff-tg mice: Baff-tg 99, Baff-tg 100, Baff-tg 101.
