TITLE
Expression data from mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HBV-transgenic mice were treated i.v. with 1x10e11 particles AAV serotype 8 vectors expressing different RNAi-triggers targeting the HBV transcripts. To determine possible toxicities caused by the different vectors (including off-target activity against endogenous genes) we performed a whole transcriptome analysis of RNA of livers harvested 15 days after injection.

DESIGN
4 replicates per treatment group were analyzed. As controls, one group of mice was treated with 0.9% saline (mock) and another group of animals was treated with an empty AAV8 vector (1x10e11 particles i.v.).
