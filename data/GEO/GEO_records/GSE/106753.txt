TITLE
Expression analysis of wild-type Streptococcus pneumoniae PN4595-T23 and TprA2 deletion mutant

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
Investigation of differentially regulated gene in deletion of TprA2 compared to the wild-type. TprA2 is a transcriptional regulator. Its characterization is described in Kadam et al 2017 Promiscuous signaling by a regulatory system unique to the pandemic PMEN1 pneumococcal lineage. PLoS Pathog. 2017 May; 13(5): e1006339.

DESIGN
A three chip study using RNA isolated from three separate wild-type cultures of Streptococcus pneumoniae PN4595-T23 and three separate cultures of TprA2 mutant strain. Cultures were harvested at mid-log phase and used for RNA isolation and cDNA preparation and hybridized onto SpSGH array with custon designed probes. The SpSGH array covers the pneumococcal pangenome and a total of 1,930 genes were relevant for PN4595-T23. The design and validation of SpSGH array is described in Kadam et al 2015 Streptococcus pneumoniae Supragenome Hybridization Arrays for Profiling of Genetic Content and Gene Expression. Curr Protoc Microbiol. 2015; 36: 9D.4.1â€“9D.4.20.
