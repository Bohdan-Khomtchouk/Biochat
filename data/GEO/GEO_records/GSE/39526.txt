TITLE
Identification of microarray probe signals constantly present in multiple sample types (part 1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The correlation of the RNA profiles obtained by microarray analysis was compared with that obtained from RNA-Seq by using reduced complexity sperm datasets. This resolved as a series of discordant probes. The extent of discordancy among other datasets was then determined.

DESIGN
A correlative study between probeâ€™s signal intensity from Illumina bead arrays with its transcript level detected by next generation sequencing technique was performed. RNAs from sperm and testis samples were applied

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
