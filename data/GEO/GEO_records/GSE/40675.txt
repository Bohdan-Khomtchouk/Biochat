TITLE
Expression data from E18.5 mouse dorsal telencephalon

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Radial progenitors deficient in both Mek1 and Mek2 fail to transition to the gliogenic mode in late embryogenesis, and astrocyte and oligodendroglial precursors fail to appear.  In exploring mechanisms, we found the Ets transcription family member Etv5/Erm is strongly regulated by MEK. Our microarray assay showed that Erm is specifically downregulated in Mek mutant brain.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from dorsal corticies of E18.5 WT or Mek1,2\NesCre conditional mutant embryos. There were totally 4 samples: 2 WT and 2 mutants.  200 ng of total RNA was prepared for microarray hybridization according to the GeneChipÂ® Whole Transcript (WT) Sense Target Labeling Assay user manual.
