TITLE
De Novo Transcriptome Sequencing for Tetramorium bicarinatum: The first comprehensive venom gland transcriptome analysis from an ant species.

ORGANISM
Tetramorium bicarinatum

SUMMARY
In order to provide a global insight on the transcripts expressed in the venom gland of the Brazilian ant species Tetramorium bicarinatum and to unveil the potential of its products, high-throughput expressed sequence tags were generated using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. A total of 212,371,758 pairs of quality-filtered, 100-base-pair Illumina reads were obtained. The de novo assemblies yielded 36,042 contigs for which 27,873 have at least one predicted ORF among which 59.77% produce significant hits in the available databases. The investigation of the reads mapping toxin class revealed a high diversification with the major part consistent with the classical hymenopteran venom protein signature represented by venom allergen (33.3%) followed by a diverse toxin-expression profile including several distinct isoforms of phospholipase A1 and A2, venom serine protease, hyaluronidase, protease inhibitor and secapin. Moreover, our results revealed for the first time the presence of toxin-like peptides that have been previously identified from unrelated venomous animals such as waprin-like (snakes) and agatoxins (spiders and conus).

DESIGN
300 ant specimens from the species Tetramorium bicarinatum were dissected in order to extract the RNA from their venom gland, The whole ant body was used as a reference,
