TITLE
Effects of DKK1 on gene expression on melanocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dickkopf 1 (DKK1), which is expressed at high mRNA levels by fibroblasts in the dermis of human skin on the palms and soles, inhibits the function and proliferation of melanocytes in the epidermis of those areas via the suppression of beta-catenin and microphthalmia-associated transcriptor factor (MITF). In this study, we investigated the effects of DKK1 on melanocyte gene expression profiles and on Wnt signaling pathways using DNA microarray technology. Keywords: compound treatment design

DESIGN
Paired cDNA samples, labeled by cyanine 3- and cyanine 5-dUTP incorporation (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) during reverse transcription (Qiagen), were hybridized simultaneously with one oligo-DNA chip (HS-Operon V2vB2.2p13) as per NCI in-house protocol (available at http://mach1.nci.nih.gov/ ). Two fluorescent intensities of the oligo-DNA chip were scanned using a microarray scanner (GenePix 4000A, Axon Instruments, Inc., Molecular Device Corp., Sunnyvale, CA).

PLATFORM
