TITLE
Effects of DKK1 on gene expression on melanocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dickkopf 1 (DKK1), which is expressed at high mRNA levels by fibroblasts in the dermis of human skin on the palms and soles, inhibits the function and proliferation of melanocytes in the epidermis of those areas via the suppression of beta-catenin and microphthalmia-associated transcriptor factor (MITF). In this study, we investigated the effects of DKK1 on melanocyte gene expression profiles and on Wnt signaling pathways using DNA microarray technology. Keywords: compound treatment design
