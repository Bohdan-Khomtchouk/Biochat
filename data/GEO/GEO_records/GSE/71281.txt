TITLE
An IL-23R/IL-22 circuit regulates epithelial serum amyloid A to promote local effector Th17 responses II [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare in vitro polarized T helper 17 cell transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) in the presence or absence of recombinant murine SAA1 Methods: Th17 mRNA profiles of 96hrs in vitro cultured T helper 17 cells treated with vehicle or recombinant murine SAA1 were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina RapidRun. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and TopHat followed by CuffDiff. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results: 177 genes were changed more than 2 folds in the presence of recombinant murine SAA1. Conclusions: Our study suggest that SAA1 could augment subset of Th17 transcription program in vitro.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 48hr in vitro cultured Th17 from wild type (WT) mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina RapidRun.
