TITLE
Nanostring Immunology V2 panel comparing expression in kidney tissue from lupus nephritis patients at diagnosis (A) and at flare (B)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of the experiment was to compare the transcriptional profile of lupus nephritis kidney tissue at a first flare and expression at a repeated lupus nephritis episode. All samples were laser microdissected into glomerular and tubular compartments and samples were ran in different cartridges.

DESIGN
Fourteen lupus nephritis patients and ten normal controls (7 for glomeruli) FFPE samples were laser microdissected and then ran into 5 cartridges for glomeruli and 5 cartridges for tubulointerstitium
