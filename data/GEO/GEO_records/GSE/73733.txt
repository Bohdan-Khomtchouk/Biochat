TITLE
Gene expression profiling of novel glucocorticoids in RAW264.7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the anti-inflammation activity of novel glucocorticoids on gene expression of macrohpage cells, we use mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells to profiling gene expression pattern of novel glucocorticoids upon the onset of inflammation response.

DESIGN
Pretreated cells with various glucocorticoids (Dexamethasone, VSG22, VSGC12 and Fluticasone Furoate) one hour before induction of inflammation resposne via LPS for overnight, each treatment has two replicate. 16 hours after treatment, harvest total RNA for gene profiling.
