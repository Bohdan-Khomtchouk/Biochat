TITLE
The Scc2NIPBL/Scc4MAU2 complex acts in sister chromatid cohesion and transcriptional regulation by maintaining nucleosome-free regions [Mnase-seq]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Scc2/Scc4 complex binds to broad nucleosome-free regions in the promoters of highly expressed genes. The cohesin loader is recruited to these sites by the RSC chromatin remodeling complex

DESIGN
MNase digestion of purified DNA followed by paired-end sequencing was performed in order to investigate genome-wide nucleosomal positioning in S. cerevisiae under multiple experimental conditions.
