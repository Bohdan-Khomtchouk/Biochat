TITLE
Effects of leptin on gene transcription of human epidermal keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Subcutaneous fat adipocytes and dermal adipocytes produce leptin. Association of leptin with cutaneous would healing is known, however, the response of human epidermal keratinocytes to leptin has not unclear in a molecular level. In order to get biological insights on the role of leptin in epidermal physiology, the genome scale transcriptional response of normal human keratinocytes to leptin was investigated.

DESIGN
Normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) were treated with 10 ng/ml of leptin for 24 hours and harvested for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Human GeneChip 133 2.0 microarrays.
