TITLE
Gene expression in Histone H1 variant deletion chicken DT40 mutant cell

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
There are six histone H1 variant in chicken. 01H1/02H1/03H1/.10H1/H1L and H1R. In those variant we forcused on H1L and H1R those molecule were most similar H1 among six H1 variants. we established linker histone H1L and H1R deleted mutant in chicken B-cell derived DT40 cell and assay gene expression in normal condition in those mutant cells. The detail charactalization of those mutant cell was published in Takami et al., BBRC 268, 501-508 (2000) and Hashimoto et al., DNA repair (2007) Keywords: gene expression array-based, count

DESIGN
There are six linker histone H1 variant in chicken. Linker histone was thought to be general gene supplesser. We established linker histone H1 variant mutant in chicken B-cell derived DT40 cell, and analyze total protein by 2D-PAGE to  find up- or down- regulatd protein.  In these mutant, there are some up regulated protein expression and down regulated protein expression (Takami et al., BBRC 268, 501-508 (2000), PubMedID 10679234). These 2D-PAGE experiment were limited at low density protein region, we use Affymetrix array to search the gene that were regulated specific linker histone H1 variant mutant. We assayed total gene expression profile in H1L and H1R deleted mutant cells. all mutant cells were cultured in normal culture condition in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% FCS (Biowest) and 1% chicken serum (Gibco) at 39.5˚C. Total RNA were isolated from exponently growing DT40 cells.
