TITLE
Sequencing mRNA from cryo-sliced Drosophila embryos to determine genome-wide spatial patterns of gene expression

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from transverse slices of embryos at the blastoderm stage to determine genome-wide patterns of gene expression.

DESIGN
mRNA from transverse sections of single D. melanogaster embryos was sequenced
