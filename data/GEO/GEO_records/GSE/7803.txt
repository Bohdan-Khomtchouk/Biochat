TITLE
Human pre-invasive and invasive cervical squamous cell carcinomas and normal cervical epithelia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
10 normal squamous cervical epitheilia samples, 7 high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 21 invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix samples were obtained using laser capture miicrodissection.  Two rounds of T7-based linear RNA amplification using the Arcturus RiboAmp kit were performed for each sample, and assayed using Affymetrix HG_U133A arrays. Keywords: disease state analysis
