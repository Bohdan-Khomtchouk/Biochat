TITLE
In vivo transcriptional activation using CRISPR-Cas9 in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Identifying putative transcription factor target genes by combining CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activation with RNAseq in Drosophila S2R+ cells. This study focuses on the transcription factors Twist and Snail, singly and together.

DESIGN
RNA from Drosophila cells following CRISPR/Cas9-based activation of Twist, Snail, or Twist and Snail together, compared with non-targeting sgRNA. Two biological replicates for each experiment

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
