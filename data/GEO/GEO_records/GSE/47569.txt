TITLE
Gene expression changes in  Apc-mutant mouse intestinal organoids 7 and 20 days after the induction of the Apc deletion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We isolated and selected intestinal adenoma organoids from Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreER; Apcflox/flox mice and added tamoxifen to induce the deletion of the Apc gene in the intestinal stem cells. Gene expressions on day7 and day20 after the addition of tamoxifen were compared, representing two stages with different colorectal cancer stem cell content.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from  Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreER; Apcflox/flox organoids were compared 7 days and 20 days after the addition of tamoxifen, cultured without the Wnt-agonist R-Spondin1.
