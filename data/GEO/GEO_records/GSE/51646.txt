TITLE
Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of Wangiella dermatitidis, a major cause of phaeohyphomycosis and a model black yeast human pathogen

ORGANISM
Exophiala dermatitidis

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from Wangiella dermatitidis at two pH conditions (2.5 and 6), including three biological replicates of each sample.

DESIGN
Examination of transcript level changes in reponse to low pH stress.
