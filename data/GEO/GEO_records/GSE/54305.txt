TITLE
Analysis of the iron stimulon and fur regulon of Geobacter sulfurreducens [ChIP-chip]

ORGANISM
Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA

SUMMARY
Fur is a transcriptional regulator whose activity is dependent on Fe(II) concentrations. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to microarray analysis allowed for the identification of Fur binding sites within the G. sulfurreducens genome.

DESIGN
Wild type G. sulfurreducnes was cultured on fresh water media (harvested during log phase), and ChIP was used to identify Fur binding regions.
