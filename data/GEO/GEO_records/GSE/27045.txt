TITLE
Expression data from macrophages isolated from lupus NZB/W mouse kidneys prenephritic, nephritic or after complete remission.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Renal infiltration with mononuclear cells is associated with poor prognosis in SLE. A renal macrophage/dendritic cell signature is associated with onset of nephritis in NZB/W mice and immune modulating therapies can reverse this signature and the associated renal damage despite ongoing immune complex deposition. Our findings suggest that mononuclear phagocytes with an aberrant activation profile contribute to tissue damage in lupus nephritis by mediating both local inflammation and excessive tissue remodeling. We used microarrays to analyze the gene expression of renal isolated macrophages at early stage of lupus (young) during lupus nephritis (sick) and after induction of remission (Rem)

DESIGN
NZB/W F4/80hi mouse cells were isolated using flow cytometry; RNA from cells (young, sick and after complete remission) was extracted and processed for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
