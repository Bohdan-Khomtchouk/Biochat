TITLE
Analysis of the DNA methylome and transcriptome in granulopoiesis reveal timed changes and dynamic enhancer methylation [expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study investigated the changes in DNA-methylation and gene expression during granulopoiesis. To this end CMP, GMP, PMC and PMN cell populations were isolated by FACS from bonemarrow from healty donors and analysed by CAGE as well as expression and DNA microarrays

DESIGN
total RNA was isolated from CMP, GMP, PMC and PMN cells from human bonemarrow from 5 healty donors.

PLATFORM
