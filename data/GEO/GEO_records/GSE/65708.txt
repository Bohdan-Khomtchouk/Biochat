TITLE
Identification of the serum microRNAs (miRNAs) displaying differential levels between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify serum miRNAs for the diagnosis of HCC, the profiling of 754 human miRNAs was analyzed in sera from six histopathologically confirmed HCC patients and eight CHB controls, using TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA A+B Cards Set v3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Serum miRNAs with differential levels between HCC and CHB were identified by comparing serum miRNA profiling of HCC patients with that of CHB controls.

DESIGN
Sera from six HCC patients and eight CHB were subjucted to miRNA array analysis.
