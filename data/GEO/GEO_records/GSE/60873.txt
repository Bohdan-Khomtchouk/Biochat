TITLE
Transcriptome of EBV-infected gastric cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand epigenic dysregulation of host and viral genes upon EBV infection in human gastric cancer, genome wide transcripts by RNAseq were undertaken for total RNAs of 3 EBVnGC, their isogenic cell lines converted by in vitro EBV-infection and 3 EBV-naturally infected GC cell lines.

DESIGN
Three independent gastric cancer (GC) cell lines (NUGC3, SNU-484, SNU-638) were experimentally infected with AKATA strain of EBV to derive EBV-infected isogenic GC cell lines (NUGC3EBV, SNU-484EBV, SNU-638EBV). Three indepedent GC cell lines with natural EBV-infection (SNU-719, NCC24, YCCEL1)) were also included in this study.
