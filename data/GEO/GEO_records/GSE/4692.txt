TITLE
Diet-induced obesity Kozak1_ABI_ING

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The experimental goals of this study were to determine differences in adipose tissue gene expression in genetically identical mice that have variability in their susceptibility towards diet-induced obesity following 4 weeks feeding a high saturated fat diet. Keywords: comparative gene expression analysis

DESIGN
Gene expression analyses was performed from pooled inguinal fat RNA from male C57BL/6J mice exhibiting high or low weight gain after 4 weeks on a high saturated fat diet (D12331; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). Mice were singly-housed at weaning and fed the high saturated diet starting at 8 weeks fo age. Three technical replicates were performed for each pool of RNA from high (H1, H2 and H3) and low (L1, L2 and L3) weight gaining mice.
