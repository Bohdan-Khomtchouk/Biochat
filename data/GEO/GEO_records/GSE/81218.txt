TITLE
Expression data from 10-day-old Arabidopsis Col-0 and rns2-2 seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Housekeeping degradation of normal ribosomal RNA in eukaryotes is completed by the RNase T2 family of ribonucleases. This family of ribonucleases is found through eukaryotes, and the Arabidopsis RNase T2 which degrades ribosomal RNA is RNS2. A null mutant in RNS2, rns2-2, has higher levels of RNA, vacuolar accumulation of rRNA and constitutive autophagy. We used microarray to detail the global changes in gene expression in response to mutation of RNS2 (rns2-2) and identified key biological processes differentially regulated in response to this mutation.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings of two genotypes, Col-0 (the control) and rns2-2, the experimental. RNA was hybridized on Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays. Twenty seedlings were grown on MS-agar for ten days. Three independent biological samples were taken, forming three biological replicates.
