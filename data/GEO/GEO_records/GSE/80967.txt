TITLE
Genome-wide characterization of CREB-dependent transcriptional programs in astrocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiling of astrocyte cultures treated with forskolin (FSK), noradrenaline (NE) or infected with adenovirus carrying a constitutively active form of CREB (VP16-CREB) vs. untreated or infected with null virus. Goal is to characterize the transcriptional programs elicited by CREB activation in astrocytes.

DESIGN
Five group experiment. Two independent experiments for the treated (loop design) and the infected samples (direct comparison). Each group was balanced with respect to the use of Cy3 and Cy5 in the samples. Number of replicates: FSK: 3; NE:3; Ctrl:3; VP16: 3; Null: 3.
