TITLE
Genome wide profiling of FOXE1 binding sites in PCCL3 rat cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
FoxE1 transcriptional profiling of rat PCCL3 cells comparing wild type cells with FoxE1 silenced cells and scramble treated with FoxE1 silenced cells.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment, FoxE1 silenced vs. Wild type cells. Biological replicates: 4 replicates, 1pooled sample dye-swap. and FoxE1 silenced vs scramble treated cells. Biological replicates: 4 replicates, 1 pooled sample dye-swap.

PLATFORM
