TITLE
Cross-talk between species that do not share often the same environment

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida ; Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We report the application of a high-throughput technique, RNA-seq, to study the transcriptomic response of P. putida DOT-T1E and E. coli growing in co-cultures

DESIGN
P. putida DOT-T1E and E. coli mRNA profiles comparing their growth in single-cultures and in co-cultures in LB at exponential phase
