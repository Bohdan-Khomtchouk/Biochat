TITLE
Spreading of X-chromosome inactivation via a hierarchy of defined Polycomb stations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Binding of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and chromatin composition of the inactive X (Xi) before, during and after X chromosome inactivation reveal that spreading is driven by a combination of Xi-specific strong and moderate Ezh2 sites. Sequence context of these sites shows a moderate enrichment of SINEs and simple repeats. The general pattern of Ezh2 and H3K27me3 distribution over the chromosome reflect a graded concentration originating from strong Ezh2 sites, around which moderate sites are clustered, suggesting a hierarchy of Ezh2 sites govern spreading.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of Ezh2 and H3K27me3 as well as the three active marks H3K4me3, H3K36me3 and RNA-POLII-serine5 phosphorylation (RNA-polII-S5P) in female cell lines: undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells (d0), differentiating ES cells (d7) and a transformed embryonic fibroblast cell line (MEF).
