TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type, DDX5 knockout, RORc knockout, RmrpG262T knockin T helper 17 cell Transcriptomes [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare in vitro polarized T helper 17 cell transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) in different genetic background. Methods: Th17 mRNA profiles of 96hrs in vitro cultured T helper 17 cells from wild-type and mutant mice were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina RapidRun. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and TopHat followed by CuffDiff. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results: Among the 325 genes that were significantly dysregulated in DDX5-deficient T cells, approximately 40% were previously identified as RORγt targets in Th17 cells. 96 RORγt-dependent Th17 cell genes co-regulated by Rmrp together with DDX5. Conclusions: Our study suggest that the DDX5-Rmrp axis is critical for expression of a critical subset of the RORγt transcriptional targets in Th17 cells.

DESIGN
