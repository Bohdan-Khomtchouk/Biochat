TITLE
miRNA expression profiling of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) during maturation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiling of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) during maturation. Immature, 4h and 16h LPS-activated moDCs were used.

DESIGN
In this study were analysed 2 biological samples of RNA extracted from 4h-post LPS stimulation moDCs and 2 bfrom 16h-post LPS stimulation. The RNA from 0h-post LPS stimulation were used as reference sample. Were also performed dye-swaps of each biological sample as technical replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL7534 National DNA microarray facility of University of Aveiro miRNA chip v1.1
