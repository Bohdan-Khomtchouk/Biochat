TITLE
The trunk notochord and the tail of the mouse originate from stem cells expressing Oct4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The trunk of mammalian embryos is thought to be derived from neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), marked by co-expression of the master regulators Sox2 and Brachyury (T), which give rise to the neural and mesodermal lineages. Here we have identified a novel class of stem cells, characterized by co-expression of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and T, which is involved in trunk and tail development. We show that Oct4+/Sox2+/T+ triple-positive cells (OST) are located at the posterior end of the notochord and contribute Oct4-reporter positive (Oct4+) cells to the trunk notochord. At the late-trunk and tail stage (E9.5-E11.5) Oct4+ cells also contribute to the notochord, neural tube and mesoderm. We show that OST cells are highly WNT-dependent and give rise to mesodermal and neural descendants in vitro. Our study establishes a new model for the origin of cell lineages forming the trunk and tail, further elucidating the organization of body axis elongation in mammals.

DESIGN
The transcriptomes of ES, ICM and epiblast cells, were analyzed by strand-specific RNA-Seq of ribosomal RNA-depleted total RNA and compared to subpopulations of T/Sox2 or T/Sox2/Oct4 expressing cells at embryonic trunk development.
