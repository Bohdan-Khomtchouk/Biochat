TITLE
Analysis of RLI on RNA stability in A. thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A number of RNA encoding different functions have been detected in the plant vasculature. An RNase L inhibitor, similar to that present in humans have been identified in the phloem sap of cucurbits. We are interested in analyze the role of this putative inhibitor on the transcript levels that could be present in the vasculature and mainly in the phloem stream. For this purpose, we obtained an RLI T-DNA insertion mutant and generated A. thaliana overexpressing lines using the ORF of the two alleles found in the database. Keywords: Expression profilling by array

DESIGN
6 samples were used in this experiment
