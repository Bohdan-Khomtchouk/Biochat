TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mouse 4T1 tumor cells derived clone (4T1ch9) gene expression subjected to transduction with STC1-specific or non-targeting shRNA  lentiviral particles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of genes regulated by STC1 down-regulation in mouse 4T1 derived clone, 4T1ch9.  STC1 expression is associated with tumor growth and metastasis.  This study looks at genes affected when STC1 expression is down-regulated by STC1 shRNA.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from shRNA transduced cells subjected to puromycin selection for  5-6 days.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
