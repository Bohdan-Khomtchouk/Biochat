TITLE
Expression Data of Reactive Oxygen Species Signalling in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We have shown that worms that possess mutations in two electron transport chain subunits live longer due to mtROS signalling. Wild type worms can also live longer by treatment with the pro-oxidant paraquat. Paraquat treatment is not additive to the mutations in the ETC subunits. We aimed to determine the underlying changes in gene expression that were common to both paraquat treatment and the two mutations. We also have shown genetically that the mtROS signal that leads to extended lifespan is dependent on CED-4. We generated double mutants that lack functional CED-4 with the two mutations in the ETC subunits. We have found that a large number of gene expression changes by mtROS signalling are reverted by loss of CED-4.

DESIGN
Young adult C. elegans were grown using a 4-hour synchronized lay and harvested by hand picking. At least three biological repeats were obtained for each condition. Worm RNA was extracted and prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix chips. We compared the gene expression patterns of genetic mutants and the wild type treated with paraquat all against a wild type control. We sought to obtain a common pattern of expression between two genetic mutants, isp-1 and nuo-6, and paraquat treatment.
