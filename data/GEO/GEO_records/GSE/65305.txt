TITLE
Identification of Novel and Differentially Expressed MicroRNAs in Goat Enzootic Nasal Adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
Enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma (ENA), an epithelial tumor induced in goats and sheep by enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV), is a chronic, progressive, contact sexually transmitted disease. This study aimed to identify novel and differentially expressed miRNAs in the tumor and para-carcinoma nasal tissues of Nanjiang yellow goats with ENA. Small RNA Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to construct a goat nasal miRNA library; 406 known miRNAs and 29 novel miRNAs were identified. A total of 116 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in para-carcinoma nasal tissues and ENA (54 downregulated; 60 upregulated; 2 only expressed in control group); Target gene prediction and functional analysis revealed that 6176 non-redundancy target genes, 1792 significant GO and 97 significant KEGG pathway for 121 miRNAs (116 significant expression miRNAs and 5 star sequence) were predicted. GO and KEGG pathway analysis revealed the majority of target genes in ENA are involved in cell proliferation, signal transduction and other processes associated with cancer. This is the first large-scale identification of miRNAs in Capra hircus ENA and provides a theoretical basis for investigating the complicated miRNA-mediated regulatory networks involved in the pathogenesis and progression of ENA.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiles of goat nose tissues between enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma and para-carcinoma nasal tissues were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq 2500
