cDNA-Shigella flexnerri- Furazolidone

ORGANISM
Shigella flexneri

SUMMARY
Shigella flexneri is a facultative intracellular pathogen which is mainly responsible for endemic shigellosis in developing countries. In the present study, we demonstrated S.flexnerri was susceptible to furazolidone, a nitrofuran derivative that has been used as therapeutic regimen against a variety of gastro-intestinal bacterial infections. To identify the global transcriptional responses of S.flexnerri in response to furazolidone treatment, S.flexnrri was exposed to both subinhibitory and inhibitory concentrations of furazolidone and microarray analysis was used to examine gene expressions after both short and long period of incubation. Analysis of microarray data revealed that genes involved in soxRS and oxyR regulons, iron metabolism, DNA replication and repair and lipid peroxidation were induced by the drug, while a large percentage of genes involved in energy production, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism were significantly repressed after the drug treatment. In addition, many genes related to preventing against injuries of iron-sulfur clusters known to be caused by superoxide radicals were also up-regulated. These data establish potential for furazolidone to enhance free radical reactions through its reductive activation, which indicates oxidative damages may be implicated in antibacterial effect of the drug.
