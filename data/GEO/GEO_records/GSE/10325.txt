TITLE
Expression data from human peripheral blood subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile studies have identified an interferon signature in whole blood or mononuclear cell samples from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. This study was designed to determine whether specific lymphocyte and myeloid subsets freshly isolated from the blood of systemic lupus erythematosus patients demonstrated unique gene expression profiles compared to subsets isolated from healthy controls. Keywords: patient compared to control

DESIGN
The entire study included 67 samples. One CEL file was not available for SLE13_CD4
