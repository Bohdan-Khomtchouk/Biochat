TITLE
Down-regulation of Interferon signature in systemic lupus erythematosus patients by active immunization with Interferon alpha-Kinoid

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a phase I/II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study to examine the safety, immunogenicity, and biological effects of active immunization with interferon alpha-Kinoid (IFN-K) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Women 18-50 years of age with mild to moderate SLE were immunized with three (n=10) or four doses (n=9) of 30, 60, 120, 240 microgram IFN-K or saline. Anti-IFNalpha antibodies were detected in all IFN-K-immunized patients. Transcriptomic analysis separated patients at baseline into type I IFN signature-positive and -negative groups. IFN-K induced higher anti-IFNalpha titers in signature-positive than in signature-negative patients and, in signature-positive patients, reduced the expression of IFN-induced genes. The decrease in IFN score correlated with the anti-IFNalpha antibody titers, and with baseline IFN score.

DESIGN
IFN-K or placebo was administered at day 0, day 7, day 28 in all patients. Half the subjects received a fourth injection at day 84 (see treatment protocol)
