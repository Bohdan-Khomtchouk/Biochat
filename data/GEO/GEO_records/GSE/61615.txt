TITLE
Gene expression signatures for bladder cancer tissues and normal adjacent tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify aberrantly expressed long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in bladder cancer tissues compared with normal adjacent tissues, we have employed microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify lincRNAs that may play important roles in bladder cancer origin and progression. Samples of fresh frozen cancer tissues, together with normal adjacent tissues (3 cm away from the tumor), were obtained during surgical resection, and total RNA was extracted for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Two pairs of fresh frozen bladder cancer tissues and corresponding normal adjacent tissues were used in the microarray analysis.
