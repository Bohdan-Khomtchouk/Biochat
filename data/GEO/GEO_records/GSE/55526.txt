TITLE
Transcription profile of SSEA-3-positive population of MSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of the gene expression profile of SSEA-3-positive human adipose-derived MSCs were performed.

DESIGN
Liposuction aspirates were obtained from the abdomen and thighs. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) was isolated from the aspirated fat. Muse cells that express human SSEA-3 were collected from SVF using anti SSEA-3 antibody conjugated with PE and anti-PE microbeads. SSEA-3-negative fraction was considered ‘Muse-poor population’.
