TITLE
Diurnal variation for rice leaves in Sapporo field in 2013

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Time-course transcriptional profiling of rice leaf in Sapporo field in 2013. This experiment was performed to analyze the dynamics of field transcriptome data. We have previously demonstrated statistical modeling of gene expression under various environmental factors using field transcriptome data obtained from samples grown in a paddy field at Tsukuba, Japan. In this series of experiments, we would like to improve the models for practical use. In order to do that, we have done field transcriptome assay in seven paddy fields at different sites in Japan (or, Sappro, Furukawa, Toyama, Tsukuba, Takatsuki, Furukawa, and Fukuoka). This data is from one of the places, Sapporo.

DESIGN
24h time series with 2h interval were sampled for 1 developmental stage with no replicate. The submitted samples were field transcirptome data in a paddy field at Sapporo in Japan. Leaf samples were harbested in a 2 hr-interval for 13 times. This set corresponds to one-day time-series data. Transplanting dates and sampling dates varied as reported in each sample record..
