TITLE
Detection of differentially expressed genes in Day 30 embryos during gestation in primiparous (PP) sow with different intermittent suckling and breeding strategies

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Day 30 embryos (D30E) was performed. First parity sows were submitted to an ovulation-induction protocol, intermittent suckling (IS), during lactation. IS consisted of 8 h/d separation from their litters during the last 7d of a 28d lactation. During separation, sows received boar exposure. There were 3 treatments: control (C28, n=19), where piglets were weaned at D28 of lactation and were bred after weaning and two IS treatments: sows were either bred at their first induced estrus during lactation (IS21FE, n=18), or were “skipped” and bred at their second estrus (IS21SE, n= 17) which occurred after final weaning at D28. Sows were slaughtered and embryos were collected on D30 of gestation for DNA PCR sexing. Later, D30E from the same sex with similar weight were pooled for further microarray investigation.

DESIGN
Stimulating lactational oestrus then two mating strategies were applied to primiparous sows.  For the microarray experiment, three biological replicates (three sows) were chosen from each treatment group comparing control (C28) to either IS21FE or IS21SE. A pool of females and males D30E were chosen and pooled separately for each comparison.
