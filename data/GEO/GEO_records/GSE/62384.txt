TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of upper airway (i.e., nasal) epithelial cells (i.e., RPMI 2650) exposed to fresh welding fumes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inhaled welding fumes are deposited on all parts of the respiratory system, with the nasal cavity being the initial point of contact. We investigated the influence of fresh welding fumes on nasal epithelial model, i.e., RPMI 2650 cells, at the transcriptome level. Spark-generated welding fumes at two different concentrations (85 µg/m3 - low; 760 µg/m3 - high) were exposed to RPMI 2650 cell monolayers at air-liquid-interface continuously for 6h, followed by zero hours (or) four hours post-exposure incubation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from: 1. unexposed (i.e., incubator control) RPMI 2650 cells (or) 2. cells exposed to particle-free clean air for 6h with 0h (i.e., 6h) post-exposure incubation (or) 3. cells exposed to particle-free clean air for 6h with 4h (i.e., 6-4h) post-exposure incubation (or) 4. cells exposed to welding fumes at each concentration (85 µg/m3 - low; 760 µg/m3 - high) for 6 hours with 0 hours (i.e., 6h) post-exposure incubation (or) 5. cells exposed to welding fumes at each concentration (85 µg/m3 - low; 760 µg/m3 - high) for 6 hours with 4 hours (i.e., 6-4h) post-exposure incubation
