TITLE
Hdac3 regulation of myogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Progenitor cells require coordinated expression of lineage-specific programs, and the nuclear lamina has emerged as an important scaffold for organizing chromatin in many cell types. These transcriptome profiling experiments accompany a study focused on defining nuclear organization changes during cardiac development. This dataset defines gene expression changes induced by Hdac3 deletion during early stages of cardiogenesis, modeled using ESC differentiation assays.

DESIGN
Hdac3 was deleted in an ESC line harboring a CMV-ERCre and in which Hdac3 is floxed. Upon tamoxifen addition, ER-Cre is translocated to the nucleus and Cre recombinase recombines out the DNA between the loxP sites. At day 5 of ESC differentiation, either tamoxifen or vehicle was added and samples were collected on day 8 (n=3 per condition).
