TITLE
Gene expression analysis of IL-4 primed bone marrow macrophages isolated from Irf4-deficient or heterozygous mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyse the Irf4-dependent transcriptional changes of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) in response to IL-4, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling. For this purpose, bone marrow cells were isolated from 8 to 12 weeks old Irf4-deficient or heterozygous mice and cultured in the presence of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) . After seven days of culture, IL-4 was added for 4 and 18 hours. Keywords: Mouse strain comparision; Gene expression profiling

DESIGN
IL-4 induced gene expression was investigated in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) of Irf4-deficient or heterozygous mice. BMM were incubated with mouse recombinant IL-4  for 4 or 18 hours or without for 18 hours. Three independent experiments were performed at each time point (mock, 4 and 18 hours) using littermates for each experiment.
