TITLE
Halobacterium NRC-1 Growth curve and GTF perturbation

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
Total RNA was collected at 6 or 8 points throughout the growth curve of Halobacterium NRC1 for wild-type, non-native expression of general transcription factors and knock-out strains of general transcription factors.  This RNA was hybridized against our standard reference RNA (wild-type OD600 0.5-0.6). Keywords: growth genetic modification

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected at 3 or 4 points throughout the growth-curve for each strain.  Biological duplicates were grown and collected from for each strain making a total of 6 or 8 observations throughout the growth curve. A total of 161 biological samples make up this experiment. Strains include (wild-type NRC-1, delta-ura3 knockout control strain, pMTFcmyc plasmid-only control strain, TFBa,b,c,d and e knockout strains, TFBb, c, and d knock-out strains, cmycTFBa, b, c, d, e, f and g non-native expression strains, and cmycTBPa, b, c, d, e, f non-native expression strains). Samples were hybridized against in-house spotted oligo arrays.  Each sample is represented on two arrays as dye swaps.
