TITLE
Gene expression of E. coli MG1655 wild type and rpoS knock-out strains

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The role of rpoS gene in the formation of Escherichia coli biofilms were investigated. The gene expression was compared among E. coli MG1655 wild type strain and rpoS knock-out strain in the biofilms, the planktonic exponential phase, and the planktonic stationary phase. The analysis revealed that the wild type bilfilms (WBF) showed similar pattern of gene expression with the WT planktonic stationary phase (WS), whereas the rpoS knock-out biofilms (MBF) showed similar pattern of gene expression with the wild type planktonic exponential phase (WE). Genes involved in the energy metabolism and the flagella synthesis showed higher expression in the rpoS knock-out biofilms (MBF), but not in the wild type biofilms (WBF). Moreover, genes involved in the stress responses showed higher expression in the wild type biofilms (WBF), but not in the rpoS knock-out biofilms (MBF). Keywords: cell type comparison (biofilms vs planktonic cells, wild type vs rpoS knock-out strains)

DESIGN
Affymetrix E. coli antisense genome array was used to compare the gene expression among E. coli wild type and rpoS konck-out strains in the biofilms, the planktonic exponential phase, and the planktonic stationary phase. All samples were grown in MOPS minimal media with 0.2% glucose. Biofilms were grown for 72 hours on glass surface in flow cells (1x4x40 mm), and planktonic cells were grown for 8 hours (exponential phase) and 12 hours (stationary phase). Experiments were repeated 3 times, which resulted in 3 replicates of 6 different samples.
