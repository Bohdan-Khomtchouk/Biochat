TITLE
Microarray analysis of NIH/3T3 cells infected with wild type Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and its corresponding RDR mutant virus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cultured NIH/3T3 cels were infeced at MOI of 10 with wild type and RDR mutant of SFV virus.. Total RNA was extracted 8 hours post-infection for gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
NIH/3T3 cells were cultured at 80 confluency prior to infection with SFV wild type or SFV-RDR mutant viruses.  Mock infection included NIH/3T3 cells without virus infection.  All experiments were carried out in triplicate.
