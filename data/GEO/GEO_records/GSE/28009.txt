TITLE
Aldosterone-inducible genes in mineralocorticoid receptor expressed human endothelial cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate the aldosterone-regulated genes in vascular endothelial cells, we developed human endothelial cell line (EAhy926) stably expressing human mineralocorticoid receptor by retroviral system (MR-EAhy). Then gene expression profile of MR-EAhy stimulated with or without aldosterone was compared using DNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
MR-EAhy were serum-deprived for 24h with 0.2% dextran-coated charcoal-treated FBS, and then stimulated with or without aldosterone (10-9 M) for 6 hr. Then cells were harvested for RNA extraction.
