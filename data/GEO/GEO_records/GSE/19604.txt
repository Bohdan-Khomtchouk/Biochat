TITLE
Expression profile of early stage druing induced pluripotency regulated by BMP/FBS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FBS and BMP influence the somatic reprogramming induced by Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/c-Myc similarly. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are abundant in serum and activate Smad1/5/8 to regulated target genes. BMPs play a important role in ES self-renewal, neurogenesis, osteogenesis, angiogenesis. We performed this experiment for identify what targets are regulated by BMPs and FBS.

DESIGN
We performed a expression profile analysis at D3 after reprogramming factor transduction in various media.  The media include standard medium for ES culture (mES), serum free medium for iPS (iPS-SF1), iPS-SF1 supplemented with BMP4, iPS-SF1 supplemented with FBS, iPS-SF1 supplemented with BMP4 and Noggin. Three biological repeats were perfromed.
