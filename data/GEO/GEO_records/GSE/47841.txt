SUMMARY
Background: The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC), clear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCC) and ovarian surface epithelium (OSE). Selected miRNAs were evaluated for association with clinical parameters including survival, and miRNA/mRNA interactions were mapped. Results: Differentially expressed miRNAs between HGSC, CCC and OSE were identified, of which 18 were validated (p < 0.01) using RT-qPCR in an extended cohort. Compared with OSE, miR-205-5p was the most overexpressed miRNA in HGSC. miR-200 family members and miR-182-5p were the most overexpressed in HGSC and CCC compared with OSE, whereas miR-383 was the most underexpressed. miR-509-3-5p, miR-509-5p, miR-509-3p and miR-510 were among the strongest differentiators between HGSC and CCC, all being significantly overexpressed in CCC compared with HGSC. High miR-200c-3p expression was associated with poor progression-free (p=0.031) and overall (p=0.026) survival in HGSC. Interacting miRNAs and mRNA targets, including those of a TP53-related pathway presented previously, were identified in HGSC. Conclusions: Several miRNAs are overexpressed in HGSC and CCC compared with OSE, including the miR-200 family, among which miR-200c-3p is associated with survival in HGSC. A set of miRNAs differentiates CCC from HGSC, of which miR-509-3-5p and miR-509-5p are the strongest classifiers. Several interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs in HGSC were mapped.

DESIGN
Methods: Differences in miRNA expression between HGSC, CCC and OSE scrapings were analyzed by global miRNA expression profiling (Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 2.0 Arrays, n=30), validated by RT-qPCR (n=63), and evaluated for associations with clinical parameters. For HGSC, differentially expressed miRNAs were linked to differentially expressed mRNAs identified previously (GSE36668).
