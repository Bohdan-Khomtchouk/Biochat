TITLE
Profiling DNA Methylation Differences Between Inbred Mouse Strains on the Illumina Human Infinium MethylationEPIC Microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC to measure DNA methylation in mouse liver samples. We identified 13,665 conserved probes and compared methylation signal with sequecing based data (MBD-seq and RRBS)

DESIGN
Mouse tissue were from two different inbred strains (C57BL/6J and DBA/2J) and from 3 age groups classified as young (4 months), mid (11â€“12 months) and old (24 months).

PLATFORM
GPL21145 Infinium MethylationEPIC
