TITLE
HSC 5-FU time course

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HSC (Sca+ SP) were isolated from 8-12 week C57B6 mice at various time points after treatment with 5-Fluorouracil.  RNA was isolated from 50,000-100,000 FACS sorted cells and subjected to two rounds of T7 based linear amplification using Ambion's Message Amp kit.  Two replicates from each time point were analyzed. http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document & =10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0020301 Keywords = HSC Keywords = proliferation Keywords = quiescence Keywords = 5-FU Keywords: time-course
