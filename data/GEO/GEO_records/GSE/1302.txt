TITLE
primary trophoblast study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary cultures of human trophoblasts were established from normal, term placenta. Cells were treated five hours after plating. This sample was treated with 1 uM GW7845. RNA was extracted after 48 hours of treatment using Tri-reagent. Each sample was pooled from three individual placentas prior to target generation. Targets were produced using standard Affymetrix procedures from 30ug of total RNA. Keywords: parallel sample
