Sequential global gene expression analysis of glucose stimulated human islets

SUMMARY
Islet transplantation has the potential to benefit patients with type I diabetes, but this cellular therapy is limited by a shortage of islets, which necessitates the collection or production of islets from alternative sources. If islets produced from stem cells are to be used for transplant therapy they should precisely replicate beta-cell function. Characterization of the unique molecular mechanisms underlying the beta-cellâ€™s response to glucose stimulation will allow a better understanding of critical elements that the alternative cells must possess. Human islets from five donors were stimulated with glucose for various durations of time to discover the glucose-responsive pathways operating at a molecular level in islets. Compared with human hepatocytes, fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, human islets displayed distinct gene expression signatures. Seven hundred and forty genes were differentially expressed in islets during short-term glucose stimulation and 42 of these genes were exclusively expressed in terms of tissue specificity and exposure duration. One thousand six hundred and thirty five genes were differentially expressed in islets during long-term glucose stimulation and 148 of these genes were exclusively expressed. The expression of two important glucose-responsive genes TSC2 and ARF1 were measured by real-time PCR in mouse MIN6 beta-cell line. Insulin secretion from ARF1 knockdown MIN6 cells decreased by 1-fold compared with controls, and TSC2-knockdown MIN6 cells decreased by 2-fold. These findings may allow for better direction of the differentiation of other types of cells such as embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell into insulin-producing cells.
