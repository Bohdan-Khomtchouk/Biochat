TITLE
The nsrR regulon in Salmonella Typhimurium 14028s

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. 14028S

SUMMARY
In this study, we have defined the NsrR regulon in Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium 14028s using a transcriptional microarray. Wild-type and nsrR mutant S. Typhimurium were grown aerobically to early log-phase (OD600~0.5) at 37C in LB medium. Total RNA was isolated from three independent cultures of both strains and interrogated on a PCR product array representing almost all ORFs.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of wt and nsrR mutant total RNAs, Cy3 and Cy5 dye swapped, were hybridized onto six PCR product arrays in two channels.
