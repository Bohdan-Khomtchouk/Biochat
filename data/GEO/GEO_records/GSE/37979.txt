TITLE
Performance Comparison of the Affymetrix SNP6.0 and Cytogenetic 2.7M Whole-genome Microarrays in Complex Cancer Samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a comparison analysis of the Affymetrix arrays SNP6.0 genome wide array (SNP6.0) and cytogenetic 2.7M whole-genome array (Cyto2.7M) using nine human samples. We compared the two array types with respect to four parameters including the size and breakpoints of the alterations detected, the actual CN assigned to the CNVs as well as long stretches of loss of heterozygosity. Overall, we found very good consistency between the two types of array on all parameters compared, even in regions with very complex changes. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
