TITLE
Investigation of gene expression of Pseudomonas putida (NBAII RPF 9) under abiotic stress [heat]

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida

SUMMARY
To undestand the mechanism involved in abitoic stress tolerance of P. Putida (NBAII-RPF 9) the bacterium was grown in liquid LB media overnight and further subjected to heat shock at 45 degrees in incubated shaker for one hour seperately. The cultures were pelleted with centrifuged for total RNA. The RNA was hybridised in 8X15K Agilent array and image analysis carried out with Agilent Microarray scanner

DESIGN
Pseudomonas putida grown was grown in Luria Bertani media and subjected heat shock (45 degrees). Respective controls were used for comparison.

PLATFORM
GPL23943 Agilent-033142 Pseudomonas putida NBAII-RPF9 8x15K array (Probe name version)
