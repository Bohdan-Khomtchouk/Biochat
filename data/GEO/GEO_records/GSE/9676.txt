SUMMARY
Muscle biopsies taken from vastus lateralis muscle of 15 men and 15 women after 3 days of standardized diet and activity to examine effects of sex and age Subjects were either young adults (7 men and 7 women, 20-29 yr old) or older (8 men and 8 women, 65-75 yr old) Affymetrix U133A and U133B arrays were scanned both before (S1) and after (S2) antibody enhancement. This file has U133A S1 data. Effects of age were computed for men and women separately with an alternative method previously and data submitted as GSE362 (men) and GSE674 (women).
