TITLE
Blastomere-specific transcriptome sequencing reveals a determinant of anterior specification in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We sequenced amplified mRNA from 20 pooled AB and 20 pooled P1 blastomeres hand isolated from 2-cell stage C. elegans embryos three replicates each.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiles of each blastomere at the 2-cell stage of the C. elegans early embryo.
