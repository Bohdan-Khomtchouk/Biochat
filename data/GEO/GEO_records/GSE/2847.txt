TITLE
Auxin induction in wild type and arf6 arf8 flowers

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to examine the roles of Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) in flower gene expression. Flowers from arf6 arf8 plants undergo a developmental arrest at approximately stage 12, just prior to flower opening. Wild-type, ARF6/arf6 arf8/arf8, and arf6 arf8 plants were treated with 10 uM indole-3-acetic acid for thirty minutes to identify genes that respond rapidly to auxin in an ARF6/ARF8-dependent manner. Keywords: auxin response; comparison of wild type and arf6 arf8 mutants

DESIGN
Wild-type, ARF6/arf6 arf8/arf8, and arf6 arf8 plants were sprayed with 10 mM indole-3-acetic acid in 1% methanol, 0.05% Tween-20. Thirty minutes after treatment, flowers (stage 1-14) were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and used for RNA extraction.
