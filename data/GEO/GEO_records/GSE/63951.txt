TITLE
Targeted mRNA gene expression profiling of primary tumors and lung metastases using a mouse model of spontaneous metastatic mammary carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we explored the molecular basis of site-specific metastasis of breast cancer to the lungs in a clinically relevant model based on the JygMC(A) cell line. In this dataset, we include expression data from JygMC(A) primary mammary tumors (carcinoma and EMT-like areas), lung metastases, normal mammary glands and normal lung parenchyma.

DESIGN
In total, 36 laser microdissected samples were analyzed. We built a customized NanoString nCounter® Gene Expression Codeset of 104 genes and controls that contained significant embryonic core stem cell genes and EMT-MET markers. This customized assay was performed to target gene expression profiling on the following samples: primary tumor carcinoma, primary tumor EMT, lung metastasis, normal mammary gland and normal lung parenchyma.
