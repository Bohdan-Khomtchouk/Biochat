TITLE
Smooth muscle cell mineralocorticoid receptor regulation of vascular mRNAs with aging

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used a smooth muscle cell-specific mineralocorticoid receptor knockout mouse to generate young and aged MR-intact and SMC-MR-KO aortic mRNA to examine the effect of age on vascular mRNA alterations in the presence and absence of SMC-MR. For more information about the mouse model see: McCurley, A et al. Direct regulation of blood pressure by smooth muscle cell mineralocorticoid receptors. Nat Med. 2012 Sep;18(9):1429-33

DESIGN
Total mRNA was extracted from young (3-4 mo) and aged male (12mo) MR-intact and SMC-MR-KO mice to investigate aging-induced alterations in vascular mRNA expression
