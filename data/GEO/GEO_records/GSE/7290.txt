TITLE
cDNA Microarray Analysis of NILs under Fe Deficient Hydroponic Conditions

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to identify candidate genes related to iron deficiency chlorosis in soybeans that are differentially expressed between near isogenic lines developed for their differential tolerance to low iron conditons. Keywords: Stress Response Analysis

DESIGN
This experiment was a linear dye swapped experiment consisting of 3 biological replicates each wtih two technical replicates for a total of six hybridizations.
