TITLE
Cooperative and Antagonistic Transcriptional Regulation by BRG/BRM [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We monitored the transcription changes associated with loss of BRG1, BRM, or both combined I HepG2 cells to understand the functional relationship between two mutually exlusive subunits of SWI/SNF

DESIGN
Cells were transduced with shRNA targeting the subunits of interested and subjected to RNAseq.

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
