TITLE
Gene expression data from human CD34+ cord blood cells infected with MIGR1, MIGR1-AML1-ETO or MIGR1-AML1-ETO∆NHR1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Compare the gene expression profile among human CD34+ cord blood cells infected with MIGR1, MIGR1-AML1-ETO or MIGR1-AML1-ETO∆NHR1 AML1-ETO promotes the self-renewal of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). We found deletion of NHR1 domain abrogates AML1-ETO induced expasion of HSPCs.

DESIGN
GFP+CD34+ human cord blood cells were sorted by FACS 72 hours after the infection for RNA extraction and hybridyzation for Affymetrix microarrays.
