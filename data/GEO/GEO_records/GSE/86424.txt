TITLE
Whole blood gene expression profiles from a lupus nephritis mouse model: SNF1 (SWR X NZB F1) mice treated with pristane

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We characterized the longitudinal gene expression profiles of whole blood from a novel lupus model nephritis: SNF1 (SWR X NZB F1) mice treated with pristane. Genes from interferon, plasma cell, neutrophil, T-cell and protein synthesis signatures were differentially expressed in the pristane-SNF1 model compared to the untreated matched control animals.

DESIGN
Whole blood was collected from mice SNF1 (SWR X NZB F1) after pristane treatment at different time points (week 0, week 2, week 4, week 8, week 12, week 14) as well as from matched untreated SNF1 mice and from untreated 36-week old SNF1 mice that show spontaneous disease. The study includes blood samples from at least 8 animal for each condition.
