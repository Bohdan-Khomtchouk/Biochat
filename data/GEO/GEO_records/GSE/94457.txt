TITLE
RNA-seq data over Arabidopsis thaliana germination

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
RNAseq profiling of 10 time points during germination in Arabidopsis, from freshly harvested seed, through mature seed, stratification, germination and to post-germination.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis seeds at 10 time points during germination in triplicate. The time points were: freshly harvested seed (H), seeds following 15 days of ripening (0 h), seeds after; 1 h of stratification (1 h S), 12 h of stratification (12 h S), 48 h of stratification (48 h S), followed by seed collected 1 hour into the light (1 h SL), 6 hours into the light (6 h SL), 12 hours into the light (12 h SL), 24 hours into the light (24 h SL) and 48 hours into the light (48 h SL).
