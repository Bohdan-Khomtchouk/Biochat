TITLE
Expression profiling of human peripheral blood before and after omega 3 dietary supplement.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with early stage CLL were recruited into the study and administered a course of omega 3 dietary supplements. Expression profiling of each patient was performed at baseline (before administering the supplement) and after consumption of supplements. Patients were divided into two groups according to the level of NFkB activation at baseline, and then within each of the two groups significant changes in gene expression between baseline and the highest dose of supplements consumed were sought.

DESIGN
Patients were divided into two groups based on initial NFkB levels being below (low expressers) or above (high expressers) the median NFkB Activity level (2.14x10^6 NFkB Luminescence units/Âµg protein). Within each group, paired two class SAM was performed using the maximum supplement dose for each patient versus the baseline.
