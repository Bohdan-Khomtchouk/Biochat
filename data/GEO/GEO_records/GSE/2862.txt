TITLE
Twist Heat Shock in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Three biological replicates of each treatment were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix C. elegans arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes expression patterns. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
Two genotype of C. elegans with 3 biological replicates that were treated with or with no heat shock

PLATFORM
GPL200 [Celegans] Affymetrix C. elegans Genome Array
