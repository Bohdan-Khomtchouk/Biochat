TITLE
The difference of gene expression in mouse OPCs in normothermic and hypothermic culture

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have found that the cell yield of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are higher in 31.5 ℃ than in 37 ℃ not by suppression of apoptosis but by enhancement of proliferation. Here, we performed transcriptome analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip on the primary cultured oligodendrocyte precursor cells prepared from the brain of ICR mice.

DESIGN
Oligodendrocyte precursor cells were prepared from primary mixed cell cultures of embryonic mouse cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral hemispheres from 15-day-old mouse embryos were enzymatically dissociated, seeded and cultured for 5 days in D-MEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were passaged to serum-free basal medium and cultured for further 48 hr at 37 ℃ and 31.5 ℃.
