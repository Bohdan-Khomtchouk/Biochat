TITLE
Time course of prion infected (RML) and globular domain ligands (POM1) in cultured organotypic cerebellar slices (COCS)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cultured organotypic cerebellar slices were exposed for different time points with either prions (RML) versus non-infectious brain homogenate (NBH) or ligands to the globular domain of the prion protein (POM1) vs IgG

DESIGN
We used microarrays to characterize the temporal response of two inducers prion protein dependent cell death: COCS were exposed to RML prions or Non-infectious brain homogenate (NBH) and harvested after 14d, 25d, 38d and 45d (4 replicates each condition). COCS were exposed to POM1 or IgG and harvested after 8h, 1d, 3d, 7d, 10d (4 replicates each condition).
