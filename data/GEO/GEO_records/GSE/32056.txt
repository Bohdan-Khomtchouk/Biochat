TITLE
The effect of trypsin-2 on human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The level of trypsin-2 has been shown to correlate with the malignancy and metastatic potential of many cancer. We used microarrays to detail how tryspin-2 overexpression changes the gene profile of human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line (HSC-3).

DESIGN
We compared trypsin-2 overexpressing HSC-3 line to HSC-3 which was transfected with control vector and because of that did not expressed trypsin-2 at all.
