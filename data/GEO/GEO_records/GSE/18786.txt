TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling in adult mouse liver following benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) treatment [Agilent miRNA array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lack of change in microRNA expression in adult mouse liver following treatment with benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), as detected using Agilent miRNA arrays. We have investigated the effect of exposure to 150 mg/kg benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) for 3 days on mRNA and miRNA expression levels in adult mouse liver. We used Agilent miRNA array platforms to assess effects of BaP exposure on miRNA expression levels. Our results indicate a distinct lack of effect of BaP of miRNA expression, despite widespread changes in mRNA levels. Keywords: Toxicology, miRNA

DESIGN
Adult male B6C3F1 mice were exposed to a daily dose of corn oil (vehicle control group) or 150 mg/kg BaP (treatment group) for 3 d (n=6 per group). Mice were sacrificed at 4 h or 24 h following the last dose and liver lobes were extracted and flash frozen. Agilent miRNA arrays were used to examine changes in miRNA transcript levels in random liver lobe sections.
