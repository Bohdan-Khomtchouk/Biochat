TITLE
Evolution and Pathogenic Mechanism of Rice Sheath Blight Pathogen

ORGANISM
Rhizoctonia solani AG-1 IA

SUMMARY
Analysis of RNA expression of Rhizoctonia solani AG1 IA. mRNA-seq of R. solani AG1 IA at 6 timepoints during the plant infection were sequenced. Cufflinks was used for calculating expected fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments sequenced (FPKM) values. Expression and regulation were identified. Analysis provides suggestion for discovering novel effectors and understanding pathogen factors.

DESIGN
Sequencing mRNA-seq from disease lesions at 10 hour, 18 hour, 24 hour, 32 hour, 48 hour and 72 hour after inoculation to analysis the expression and identify pathogen factors.

PLATFORM
