TITLE
Identification of E2F targets in MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP sequencing for E2F1, E2F3A and E2F3B in mouse embryonic fibroblasts

DESIGN
E2F1, E2F3A and E2F3B ChIPs were performed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts stably overexpressing the proteins. ChIP DNA was processed to generate libraries and then sequenced using the Illumina platform.
