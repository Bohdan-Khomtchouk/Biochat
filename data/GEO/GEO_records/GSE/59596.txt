TITLE
Transcriptional data from yeast expressing mammalian PIK3CA

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We studied the transcriptional profile in response to acute PtdIns-4,5P2 depletion induced by heterologous expression of a plasma membrane-directed version of mammalian PI3K catalytic subunit (p110α-CAAX).

DESIGN
Three biological samples were analyzed for samples expressing for 4 hours p110α-CAAX (PI3K) versus the kinase dead mutant p110α-CAAX K802R (KD), and one microarray experiment was carried out for each sample.
