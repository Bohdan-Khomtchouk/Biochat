TITLE
Molecular rules governing de novo methylation in cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
De novo methylation of CpG islands is seen in many tumors, but the general rules governing this process are not known.  By analyzing DNA from tumors, as well as normal tissues, and by utilizing a wide range of published data, we have been able to identify a well-defined set of tumor targets, each of which has its own “coefficient” of methylation that is largely determined by its inherent relative ability to recruit the polycomb complex.  This pattern is initially formed by a slow process of de novo methylation that occurs during aging and then undergoes expansion early in tumorigenesis, where it may play a role as an inhibitor of development-associated gene activation.  We also demonstrate that DNA methylation patterns can be used to diagnose the primary tissue source of tumor metastases.

DESIGN
CpG-methylated genomic DNA was enriched using a methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation (mDIP) assay. DNA from the input and bound (enriched) DNA for each sample were labeled and hybridized on the array to define the methylation state of each region.
