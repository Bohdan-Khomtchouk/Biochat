TITLE
Identification of IL-1 and IL-6-responsive genes in human monocyte-derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using whole-genome Affymetrix microarrays (HG-U133A), we characterized the transcriptome profile of cultured human macrophages stimulated for 4 h with interleukin 1 (IL-1) or interleukin 6 (IL-6). We found that, in distinction to liver cells, IL-1 is much more potent than IL-6 in modifying macrophage gene expression, although considerable heterogeneity in response of macrophages deriving from individual blood donors was observed. The obtained results permitted to identify a large number of cytokine-responsive genes. coding for proteins of unknown function that are now being studied in our laboratory. They may represent novel targets in the anti-inflammatory therapy. Keywords: Cytokine response

DESIGN
Analysis of the transcriptome of human monocyte-derived macrophages stimulated in vitro by low doses of IL-1 or IL-6.
