TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of CD8 cells laser captured from skin biopsies during the mucocutaneous HSV-2 reactivation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of CD8 cells at the gene expression level during the genital HSV-2 reactivation. We would like to get a comprehensive overview on gene expression of CD8 T-cells during the post healing phases of HSV-2 reactivation. The hypothesis is that CD8 T-cells play a immune surveillance function during the post healing phases.

DESIGN
CD8 cells were immunofluorescently stained and laser captured from post healing biopsies and contralateral control biopsies, total RNA were purified from captured cells and cDNA were amplified from the total RNA using NuGEN pico kits
