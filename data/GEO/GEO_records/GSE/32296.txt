TITLE
Estrogenic modulation of inflammation-related genes in male rats following volume overload

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to determine whether estrogen had an effect on inflammation-related genes that contribute to this estrogen-mediated cardioprotection.  Volume overload on the heart was induced by aortocaval fistula in 8 week old male Sprague Dawley rats and genes of interest in shams, fistula , and  fistula +estrogen were identified using an inflammatory PCR array.

DESIGN
Volume overload was induced in male rats treated with estrogen and non treated male rats to determine if inflammation-related genes contributed to estrogen-mediated cardioprotection.
