TITLE
Gene expression profiling of small intestinal epithelia in AP-1B KO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the function of AP-1B in small intestinal epithelia, which is well known as one of the components of the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex, gene expression profiling of AP-1B KO mice was performed.

DESIGN
Small intestine of AP-1B +/- and -/- mice were dissected and soaked in Hank's Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) (GIBCO) containing 30 mM EDTA. After incubation on ice for 20 min, IECs were isolated by manipulation with a fine needle under stereomicroscopic monitoring (n=2).
