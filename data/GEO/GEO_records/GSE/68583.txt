TITLE
Comparative transcriptome profiling of human epidermis keratinocyte stem cells (KSC) versus keratinocyte progenitors (KP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the global transcriptome of human keratinocyte stem cells (KSC) and keratinocyte progenitors (KP), primary basal keratinocyte subpopulations enriched in quiescent stem cells [Itg-α6bright / Trf-Rdim] or in cycling progenitors [Itg-α6bright / Trf-Rbright] were purified by flow cytometry from human skin samples. Sorted keratinocytes were then seeded in culture plates and maintained in culture medium overnight (15 hours), and genome-wide transcriptome analysis of these two subpopulations was directly performed, in order to globally maintain the initial phenotypes. After RNA preparation, gene profiling was performed using oligonucleotide microarrays (26068 probes). LOWESS normalisation was applied.  Keywords: epidermis, keratinocyte stem cells, progenitors, transcriptome, stemness

DESIGN
Dye-swap hybridization were performed. Slides were scanned with a Genepix 4000 microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Molecular devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For each hybridized spot, the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence values were obtained by using Genepix Pro 4.0 software (Axon Instruments) and were saved as a result file
