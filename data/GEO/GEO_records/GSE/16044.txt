TITLE
AURATUS goldfish environmental genomics projects: dopamine depletion in hypothalamus and telencephalon

ORGANISM
Carassius auratus

SUMMARY
Sexually mature (mid-May) adult female goldfish received a single injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 50 ug/g body weight at 5 uL/g body weight) or 0.6% saline on day 0 and a single injection of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (aMPT;  240 ug/g body weight at 5 uL/g body weight) or 0.6% saline on Day 5 with the goal of severely deplete catecholamine (dopamine and norepinephrine) levels. Hypothalamus tissue was extracted on Day 6. Telencephalon tissue was extracted on Day 6. The objective of this study was to examine gene expression changes in the neuroendocrine brain in response to catecholamine depletion.

DESIGN
A common reference design was used for both the hypothalamus and telencephalon groups: Hypothalamus: 3 independent groups of hypothalami from sexually mature female goldfish treated with 50 ug/g MPTP + 240 ug/g aMPT hybridized against a common vehicle control.  An additional group was used for a dye-swap. Slides 4, 17, 21, 52. Telencephalon: 3 independent groups of telencephali from sexually mature female goldfish treated with 50 ug/g MPTP + 240 ug/g aMPT hybridized against a common vehicle control. An additional group was used for a dye-swap. Slides 28, 34, 43, 48.
