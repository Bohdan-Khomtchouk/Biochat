TITLE
rRNA cleavage ensures translational cessation in the mature sperm

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report how unique RNA seq profiles of ribosomal RNA (18S, 28S) present in sperm indicate specific cleavage sites.  Additionally, these sequencing results reveal how overall character of RNA (GC content) can significantly affect overall distribution of mapped reads.

DESIGN
Examination of rRNA population and distribution in spermatozoa
