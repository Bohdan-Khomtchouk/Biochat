TITLE
Expression profiling of wildtype mouse cornea in development, adult, and aging

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
While the mouse cornea has been well characterized morphologically, the transcriptional changes have not been described in detail. To characterize the genes, pathways, and transcriptional regulators involved in mouse cornea development and aging, we isolated whole cornea from wildtype CB6 mice at several developmental timepoints and every 6 months in the adult. Corneal epithelium and stroma were isolated at one timepoint to provide insights into the genes that are unique to each tissue.

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from whole mouse cornea at 12 time points over the life of the mouse and from corneal epithelium and stroma at a single timepoint.
