TITLE
NanoString miRNA profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-1-infected elite suppressors, viremic patients, and uninfected control donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study used the NanoString nCounter hybridization system and nCounter miRNA expression assays to identify and quantitate circulating cellular miRNAs during HIV-1 elite suppression, active HIV-1 replication, and uninfected status.

DESIGN
Blood samples were from eight uninfected controls, seven HIV-1 elite suppressors with undetectable viral load, and six viremic HIV-1-infected patients.
