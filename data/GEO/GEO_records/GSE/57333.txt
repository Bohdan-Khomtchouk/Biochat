TITLE
Transcriptomes of aneuploid mouse T-ALL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis to map transcriptomes of Mps1DK p53null-driven aneuploid T-ALL, to determine correlation between copy number changes and expression changes and to map the transcriptional response to CIN

DESIGN
Transcriptomes of T-ALL samples described in the accompanying manuscript were compared to the transcriptomes of thymocytes of 6-weeks old wild type mice
