TITLE
Identification of LEDGF-responsive genes in Jurkat cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The LEDGF transcript from the PSIP1 gene was knocked down in Jurkat cells using RNAi technology. The resulting Jurkat-derived cell line (Jurkat-siJK2) was compared to a control cell line (wild type Jurkat) using microarray analysis. Genes identified as being modulated by LEDGF were preferential targets of HIV integration. Keywords: effects of gene knockdown

DESIGN
2 cell lines were used, Jurkat-siJK2 (experimental) and wild-type Jurkat (control). 3 independent cultures of each cell line were used for independent RNA extractions, labeling reactions and array hybridizations.
