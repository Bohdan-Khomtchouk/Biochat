TITLE
Early parity-induced gene expression in total mammary epithelial cells in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study examined the effect of early pregnancy on the gene expression profile of total isolated mammary epithelial cells in mice.

DESIGN
Total mammary epithelial cells were isolated from parous and age-matched virgin control mice. Four independent replicates were assessed per treatment group, resulting in a total of 8 samples.
