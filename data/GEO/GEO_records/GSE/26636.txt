TITLE
PVRL Is A Receptor For Measles Virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Measles virus infects serum activated airway epithelial cells and many adenocarcinoma cell lines.  A microarray analysis was performed on virus permissive versus non-permissive cells.  Membrane protein genes that were upregulated in permissive cells were tested as receptor/entry factors. Membrane protein genes that were upregulated in smooth airway epithelial cells (SAEC) following growth in 10% fetal calf serum that made the cell line permissive to measles virus were identified. Membrane protein genes that were upregulated in adenocarcinoma cells that were permissive to wild type measles virus infection were identified.

DESIGN
[SAEC]: Airway cells (SAEC) grown in serum free media (SAGM) were purchaced from Lonza.  Half the cells were cultured in SAGM, the other half were transferred into Dulbecco's 10% fetal calf serum for 24 hrs.  RNA was harvested from the cells by the Qiagen RNAeasy [Adenocarcinoma cells]: MCF7, MDA-MB-468, T47D, NCI-H358, NCI-H125, MGH24 cells were permissive and A549 and MDA-MB-231 cells were non-permissive.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
