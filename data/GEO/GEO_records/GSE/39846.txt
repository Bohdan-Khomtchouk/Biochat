TITLE
Profiling of lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs in colorectal cancer and of MYC-regulated lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v2.0 was designed for researchers who were interested in profiling both LncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs in human genome. 33,045 LncRNAs were collected from the authoritative data sources including RefSeq, UCSC knowngenes, Ensembl and many related literatures. This experiment is to profile lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs using Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v2.0.

DESIGN
Identification of coding RNAs and lncRNAs that are diffrentially expressed in colorectal cancer by comparing sample A-E (normal colorectal cells) vs sample F-J (colorectal tumor cells) and c-MYC-regulating lncRNAs by comparing sample 1-3 (triplicate of HCT116 cells treated with control siRNA) vs sample 4-6 (triplicate of HCT116 cells treated with siRNA targeting MYC) and sample 7-9 (triplicate of RKO cells treated with control siRNA)  vs sample 10-12 (triplicate of RKO cells treated with siRNA targeting MYC) .
