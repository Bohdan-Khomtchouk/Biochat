TITLE
Expression data from control and Med12-deficient hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors from controls and Med12Flox; mxCre mice treated with pI:pC 4 days afters injection were sorted and Micrroarray Affymetrix mouse 430.2 platform. Results provide insight into the gene signatures regulated by Med12 that are essential for the homeostasis of the hematopoietic system.

DESIGN
Microarrays we used to characterize the gene expression programs regulated by Med12 and identified down-regulated signatures

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
