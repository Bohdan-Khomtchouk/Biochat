TITLE
Expression data of Soybean root apical meristem and leaf

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
we used soybean genome chips to investigate the expression pattern of about 37,500 unique ESTs locating on soybean Affymetrix chips (Affymetrix Inc.). KEYWORDS: Tissue comparison

DESIGN
we compared soybean root meristem samples with non-meristematic tissues in 10 days old vegetative stage seedlings to define a unique set of root meristem enriched genes.

PLATFORM
GPL4592 [Soybean] Affymetrix Soybean Genome Array
