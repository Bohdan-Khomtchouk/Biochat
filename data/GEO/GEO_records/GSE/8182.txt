TITLE
Static, aerobic, and respiratory transcriptomes of Lactococcus lactis

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis

SUMMARY
Compare the physiological state between static, aerobic, and respiratory growth of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis CHCC2862 using whole genome transcriptomes. NOTE: the biological replicate array GSM243206 is dye-swapped relative to GSM202337 (unlike the two other biological replicate arrays GSM243203 and GSM24205). Keywords: Physiological response to aerobic and respiratory growth relative to static.

DESIGN
Static stationary cultures of CHCC2862 (Chr. Hansen Culture Collection, HÃ¸rsholm, Denmark) were inoculated into fresh pre-heated medium at the relevant conditions. OD600 was followed over time. At OD 1.0 samples were harvested for RNA isolation.
