TITLE
miRNA expression in nephron progenitors of the developing kidney

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mIRNA expression profiling of mouse embryonic nephron progenitors at embryonic day 14 isolated by GFP expression driven by Six2-TGC (transgenic mouse line), compared to whole embryonic kidney at day 14

DESIGN
Two types of sample (nephron progenitors versus whole embryonic kidney); three biological replicates for each independently isolated for nephron progenitors ( pooled from 6-7 embryonic kidneys in one litter) compared to one E14 kidney

PLATFORM
