TITLE
Expression data of kidney multiciliated cells from zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Multiciliated cells (MCCs) possess multiple motile cilia on the cell surface and are widely distributed throughout the vertebrate body to perform important physiological functions by regulating fluid movement in the intercellular space. However, neither their function during organ development nor the molecular mechanisms underlying multiciliogenesis are yet well understood. We aim to study the function of miR-34b in multiciliogenesis. We used microarrays to study the global gene expression change in multiciliated cells after miR-34b knockdown.

DESIGN
Multiciliated cells were isolated from 3 dpf control embryos (injected with control morpholino) and miR-34b morphants (injected with miR-34b morpholino) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Two independent sets of biological replicates were used.
