TITLE
Identification of the Thermoproteus tenax small Rnome

ORGANISM
Thermoproteus tenax

SUMMARY
Small RNAs were isolated from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermoproteus tenax and subjected to Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencing. The RNA reads revealed significant abundance of constitutively transcribed CRISPR RNAs and a plethora of C/D box sRNAs. The presence of a rare RNase P RNA variant was verified. Circular RNA molecules could be identified.

DESIGN
A T. tenax small RNA isolate was applied to Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing.
