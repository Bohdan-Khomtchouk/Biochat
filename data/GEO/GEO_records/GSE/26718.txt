TITLE
Macro ncRNAs are abundant in imprinted regions and directly regulated by DNA methylation [tiling array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Imprinted macro ncRNAs such as Airn play an important role in silencing protein-coding genes in cis, macro ncRNAs could be a common feature in all imprinted gene clusters. By applying the RNA Expression on Tiling Array (RETA) technique, macro ncRNAs were found to be abundant in 26 known mouse genomic regions containing imprinted genes were detected. All well-known imprinted macro ncRNAs were up-regulated upon depletion of DNA methylation.

DESIGN
Surveying imprinted macro non-coding RNAs in 26 imprinted mouse regions from different mouse cells and tissues

PLATFORM
