TITLE
Expression data from postnatal piglet hippocampus, investigating how lactoferrin benefit early neurodevelopment and cognition

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Lactoferrin supplementation in pig milk replacer could promote cognitive functions in postnatal piglet behaviour experiment. There are 3 groups of 3-day-old postnatal piglets, feeding basal level, medium dose(0.6g/L) and high dose(1.2g/L) lactoferrin. After 35days  feeding, medium dose group showed better performance in behaviour experiment. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the nervous system development and memory formation.

DESIGN
There are 3 treatment groups and 12 replicates for each group. The 3 treatment groups are control group feeding basal level, medium dose(0.6g/L) and high dose(1.2g/L) lactoferrin. Pig hippocampus tissues were collecteded for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
