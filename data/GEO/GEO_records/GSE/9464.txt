TITLE
Gene-expression profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae irradiated by high-LET radiations

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Ionizing radiations are categorized by linear energy transfer (LET) into low-LET and high-LET.  High-LET is considered to have a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) than low-LET radiations.  However, the details of the effects have not been clearly determined.  The aim of this study was to characterize the difference between high-LET and low LET radiations.  The global effects of the three types of high-LET radiations (fast neutron, heavy ion (C) and thermal neutron) were compared with the low-LET radiation (gamma ray) using yeast DNA microarrays.  Highly induced genes by the three types of high-LET radiations were those genes related to oxidative stress.  Oxidative stress was one of the common factors associated with the four types of radiations.  Oxidative stress induced by high-LET radiations may be more serious than that induced by gamma rays.  Additionally, genes related to protein synthesis and the ubiquitin and proteasome system were detected.  This suggests that more protein damages can be induced by high-LET radiation that denatures the proteins in yeast cells.  The genes specifically altered by each type of high-LET radiation were also studied. Keywords: stress response
