TITLE
Replacing skeletal muscle alpha-actin with cardiac actin in mouse skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle actin mice (Crawford et al., (2002) Mol Cell Biol 22, 5587) were crossed with cardiac actin transgenic mice (termed " ACTC^Coco " or " Coco " for short), to produce mice that had cardiac actin instead of skeletal muscle actin in their skeletal muscles (termed " ACTC^Co/KO " or for short " Coco/KO " ).  Microarray analysis using the Illumina mouse-6 v1.1 expression beadchip was performed on RNA extraced from the soleus muscle of Coco/KO mice and wildtype mice, to confirm the swith in actin isoform expression, and to determine what other differences might exist between wildtype mice and the Coco/KO mice. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
3 RNA samples (each being the pool of two individual samples extracted from different soleus muscles from different individual mice) per genotype (either wildtype or Coco/KO) were used.  The total 6 RNA samples were processed using an Illumina mouse-6 v1.1expression beadchip and then the differentially expressed genes determined.
