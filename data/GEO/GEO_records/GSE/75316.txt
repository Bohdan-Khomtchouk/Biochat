TITLE
Expression data for 59 primary tumors from patients with colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA from 59 primary colorectal tumour samples were extracted and hybridized to HG-U133Plus 2.0 expression arrays. Mutation status for several genes were determined using Sanger sequencing.

DESIGN
59 colorectal cancers samples were analyzed for both microarray expression (Plus2.0 platform) and mutation status of several genes.

PLATFORM
