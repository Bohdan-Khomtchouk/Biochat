TITLE
Transcriptional regulation by H3K122 acetylation in the lateral surface of the histone octamer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We characterize the acetylation of H3K122 for the first time. Towards this we mapped the genomic distribution of H3K122Ac, identified the enzyme introducing H3K122Ac, and addressed the functional contribution H3K122Ac to transcription. We found that H3K122Ac is associated with chromatin marks and genomic regions associated with active transcription and is catalysed by p300/CBP and can be regulated by estrogen signaling in MCF-7. Moreover H3K122Ac stimulates transcription as dermined by in vitro  transcription assays

DESIGN
