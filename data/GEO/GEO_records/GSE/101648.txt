TITLE
Identification of GLYMA.08G357600 binding sites in soybean mid-maturation embryos.

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
To dissect the gene regulatory networks operating during soybean embryo development, we identified the binding sites genome-wide for transcription factor GLYMA.08G357600 in mid-maturation embryos using ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
Identification of Glyma.08G357600 binding sites in soybean embryos at the mid-maturation stage.  ChIP and total chromatin controls (input) were obtained for two biological replicates, with two technical replicates (sequencing lanes) for each sample.  A total of 4 samples were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL19246 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Glycine max)
