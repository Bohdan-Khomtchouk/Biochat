TITLE
ZicL ChIP-chip on Ciona intestinalis embryo (early gastrula)

ORGANISM
Ciona intestinalis

SUMMARY
A genomic overview of in vivo binding of a transcription factor ZicL in the ascidian gastrula embryo. ZicL is a key regulator of the early ascidian development, and so called 'master-regulatory genes' for mesodermal and neural tissues are under the control of ZicL. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Fertilized eggs were electroporated with a construct encoding GFP-tagged ZicL. After fixation, Chromatin was sonicated to obtain DNA fragments with an average of size of 1kb. The DNA fragments were enriched by immunoprecipitation with an polyclonal antibody specific for GFP (Invitrogen). The immunoprecipitated and WCE DNA were amplified by LM-PCR for the Chip analysis. Two independent experiments were performed to reduce experimental errors.
