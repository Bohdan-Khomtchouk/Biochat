TITLE
Gene expression profile of sendai virus infected primary MEFs.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investivate the role of mitochondrial-mediate antiviral innate immunity in MEFs, we performed Sendai virus (SeV) infection experiments at the different cultured conditions of the cells.  We analyzed the gene expression profile of MEFs that infected or uninfected with SeV either cultured the cells under glucose or galactose medium, and investigate its differences.  We found that the both cultured conditions of cells showed normal antiviral responses.

DESIGN
Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (pMEFs) were infected with Sendai virus for 6 h and their gene expressions were analyzed.
