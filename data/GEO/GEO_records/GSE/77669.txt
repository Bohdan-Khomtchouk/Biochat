TITLE
TFIIS.h, a new target of p53, regulates transcription efficiency of pro-apoptotic bax gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in human colon cancer cell lines in response to p53 activation by Inauhzin (INZ), and identification of novel p53 target genes. Part of the data has been described in our publication: Liao, J. M., Zeng, S. X., Zhou, X. & Lu, H. Global effect of inauhzin on human p53-responsive transcriptome. PloS one 7, e52172, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0052172 (2012).

DESIGN
HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53-/- cells were treated with DMSO or 4μM INZ and harvested at 18 hours post treatment. Cells were then homogenized in TriZol reagents. Triplicates were included for each sample. Total RNA was extracted by following the manufacturer’s standard instructions (Invitrogen).
