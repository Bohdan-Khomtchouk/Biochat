Mycobacteria induce TPL-2 mediated IL-10 in IL4 generated alternatively activated macrophages

SUMMARY
IL-4 drives expansion of Th2 cells that cause generation of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs). Filarial infections are established early in life, induce increased IL-4 production are co-endemic with tuberculosis (TB). We sought to understand, therefore, how mycobacteria are handled in the context of IL-4-induced AAM. Comparing IL-4 generated in vitro monocyte derived human AAMs to LPS and IFN-Î³ generated classically macrophages (CAMs), both infected with mycobacteria (BCG), we demonstrated increased early BCG uptake and increased IL-10 production in AAMs compared to CAMs.  We further demonstrated that increased IL-10 production is mediated by upregulation of tumor progression locus 2 (TPL-2), an upstream activator of extracellular signal related kinases (ERKs) in AAMs but not in CAMs, both at the transcript as well as the protein level. Pharmacologic inhibition of TPL-2 significantly diminished IL-10 production only in BCG-infected AAMs. Finally, we validated our findings in an in vivo C57Bl/6 model of filarial infection, where an exaggerated Th2 induced lung-specific alternative activation led to TPL-2 and IL-10 upregulation on subsequent TB infection. These data show that in response to mycobacterial infection, IL-4 generated AAMs in chronic filarial infections have impaired immune responses to TB infection by increasing IL-10 production in a TPL-2 mediated manner. Experimental rationale (microarray): To understand the effect of a pre-existing filiarial infection on the immune response of mice to Mycobacterium tuberculosis

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were infected with B. malayi microfilaria by i.v. injection in the tail vein and/or M. tuberculosis by nose aerosol. At 7 weeks post infection, lungs were harvested and frozen for subsequent RNA extraction and gene expression profiling with Affymetrix microarrays.
