TITLE
Examine differential expression of sulf-1 and sulf-2, enzymes involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our specific aim is to examine differential expression of sulf-1 and sulf-2, enzymes involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis, as well as Wnt ligands and Wnt signaling mediators during corneal wound healing using a mouse corneal scratch model. The specific structural features of heparan sulfate underlie its role in modulating cellular responses to growth factors such as the Wnts. Heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases (sulf-1 and sulf-2) remove 6-O sulfate group from trisulfated disaccharides present on heparan sulfate chains. Our preliminary results suggest that sulf-1 is upregulated at the protein level in the epithelial cells of wounded mouse corneas, as compared to the undamaged contralateral eye.  Modulation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan expression and/or structural modifications of its chains might be an important aspect of the regulation of epithelial cell migration and proliferation during wound healing.

DESIGN
RNA preparations from four different conditions, were sent to Microarray Core (E).  Gene expression was examined in triplicates at 2 time points (8 and 24 hrs post-wounding: 6 arrays), using the contralateral eye as a control at one time point as a control (3 arrays). To account for a systemic response (i.e. bilateral inflammation) to the corneal wounding, corneas of non-wounded mice (3 arrays) were used.  The RNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the GLYCOv3 microarrays.
