TITLE
Bmp-regulated cardiac genes in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify genes that are regulated by Bmp signaling with the zebrafish heart at the heart cone stage around 21-23 hours post fertilization.

DESIGN
In total, 4 samples based on cDNA from extracted cardiac tissue were analyzed: 2 samples of Tg(hsp70l:bmp2b)fr13 transgenic embryos heatshocked at 18 hpf and 2 WT control samples.

PLATFORM
GPL7301 Agilent-019161 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray (V2) G2519F (Probe Name version)
