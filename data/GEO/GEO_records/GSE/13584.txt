TITLE
Stress-induced changes in the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome analyzed using whole genome tiling arrays

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant responses to abiotic stresses are accompanied by massive changes in transcriptome composition. To provide a comprehensive view of stress-induced changes in the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome, we have used whole-genome tiling arrays to analyze the effects of salt, osmotic, cold and heat stress as well as application of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), an important mediator of stress responses.

DESIGN
After seedlings had been grown for 10 days on solid MS medium at 21°C, they were transferred to liquid MS medium containing no additives (mock control), 200 mM NaCl (salt stress), 300 mM mannitol (osmotic stress) or 100 μM ABA. For cold and heat stress, seedlings were transferred to pre-chilled or pre-warmed liquid MS medium and incubated at 8°C and 30°C, respectively. Samples were taken after 1 h and 12 h of continuous stress treatment. RNA was extracted from whole seedlings and converted into double stranded DNA targets that were hybridized to whole genome tiling arrays (Affymetrix Arabidopis Tiling1.0R®). All hybridizations were performed with 3 biological replicates.
