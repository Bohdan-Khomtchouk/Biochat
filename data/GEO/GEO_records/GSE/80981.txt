TITLE
Identification of aging-associated gene expression signatures that precede intestinal tumorigenesis [human]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aging-associated gene expression alterations have been implicated in various cancers including colorectal cancer. We examined aging-associated gene expression signatures that precede intestinal tumorigenesis using surgical specimens of Japanese FAP patients.

DESIGN
We analyzed normal intestinal mucosae located more than 2 cm away from the adenomas (n = 3), normal intestinal mucosae adjacent to adenomas (within 5 mm) (n = 3), and intestinal adenomas (n = 3) from human FAP patients using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console, Expression Console, and Transcriptome Analysis Console software.
