TITLE
Expression profiling of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell line hMSCs, human esophageal carcinoma cell line EC9706 and their hybrids EMFs.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our findings demonstrate that hMSCs can inhibit the malignant phenotypes of ECs through induced cell fusion without potentially cancerous reprogramming. To further understand the differences between before-after cell fusion and the mechanism of suppression, we used gene expression profiling technology from Capitalbio to find out the differences between EC cells, hMSCs and their derived heterokaryons.

DESIGN
Six dual channel Capitalbio 22K Human oligo arrays was used to hybrid six paired samples (EC9706-cy3+EMF1-cy5, EC9706-cy3+EMF2-cy5, EC9706-cy3+EMF3-cy5, EMF1-cy3+hMSCs-cy5, EMF3-cy3+hMSC-cy5, hMSC-cy3+EMF2-cy5).One replicate per array.
