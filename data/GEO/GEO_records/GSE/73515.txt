TITLE
DNA methylation data from primary neuroblastoma tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of primary neuroblastomas. The Illumina  450k methylation array was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs in 105 neuroblastomas. Tumors were derived from 40 low-risk, 9 intermediate-risk and 56 high-risk patients.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 105 samples were hybridised to the llumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
