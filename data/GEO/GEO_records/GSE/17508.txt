TITLE
Identification of human miR-22-responsive transcripts in MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the expression patterns of human miR-22-responsive transcripts in estrogen receptor alpha positive cell line MCF7, we transfected miR-22 duplex or negative control RNA duplex into MCF7 cells. Gene expression patterns were then evaluated using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array microarrays. Keywords: comparision of expression patterns in MCF7 cells with or without  human miR-22 overexpression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from two groups MCF7-NC (MCF7 cells transfected with negative control RNA duplex) and MCF7-miR (MCF7 cells transfected with miR-22 duplex) and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. Each group has three repeat samples.
