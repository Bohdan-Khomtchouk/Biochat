TITLE
Post-transcriptional 3’UTR cleavage of mRNA transcripts generates thousands of stable uncapped autonomous RNA fragments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, using genome wide analysis, we demonstrate that canonical mRNA is processed post-transcriptionally through an alternative cleavage and polyadenylation mechanism. As a result of this process, the downstream cleavage fragment of the 3′UTR remains uncapped and stable This finding indicates that different parts of gene mRNA are separate and independent, by re-annotating the human transcriptome using this model, we provide a new overview of the function and impact of microRNA (miRNA) Our results shed new light on the mammalian transcriptome and show that what were considered as 3′UTRs are in fact autonomous RNA fragments.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels and cleavage across transcripts in U2OS and 293 cell types (3 replicates each)

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
