TITLE
microRNA expression profiles of prostate cancer xenograft model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the role of microRNAs in the progression of CRPC, we evaluated expression profiles by microarray analysis of microRNAs derived from xenograft tumor tissues obtained at the CRPC stage in comparison to those at an androgen dependent stage.

DESIGN
We evaluated expression profiles of microRNAs derived from the KUCaP2 xenograft tumor tissues at the CRPC stage in comparison to those at the androgen dependent stage (n=4) by microRNA microarray analysis.
