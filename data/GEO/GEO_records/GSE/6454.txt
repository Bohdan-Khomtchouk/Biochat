TITLE
Gene expression analysis of commercial baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during an air-drying process

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study, we focused on air-drying stress and analyzed the changes in gene expression of commercial baker’s yeast during the air-drying process. Changes in gene expression profiles of commercial baker’s yeast during an air-drying process at 37oC that simulated dried yeast production were analyzed using DNA microarrays. Keywords: Stress response
