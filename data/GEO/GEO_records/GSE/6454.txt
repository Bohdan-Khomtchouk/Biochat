TITLE
Gene expression analysis of commercial baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during an air-drying process

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study, we focused on air-drying stress and analyzed the changes in gene expression of commercial baker’s yeast during the air-drying process. Changes in gene expression profiles of commercial baker’s yeast during an air-drying process at 37oC that simulated dried yeast production were analyzed using DNA microarrays. Keywords: Stress response

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the stress-treated yeast cells by using a hot phenol method. Poly(A)+ RNA was enriched from total RNA by using an Oligotex dT30 (Super) mRNA purification kit (Takara Bio, Ohtsu, Japan). cDNA synthesis, cRNA synthesis, and labeling were performed according to the Affymetrix user’s manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA). Biotinyated cRNA was fragmented and then used as a probe.Affimetrix Yeast Genome S98 arrays (Affymetrix) were used as DNA microarrays. All experiments were done in duplicate independently.
