TITLE
Role of YbeY in Yersinia enterocolitica O:3

ORGANISM
Yersinia enterocolitica subsp. palearctica Y11

SUMMARY
In order to detect genes that are directly or indirectly affected by the inactivation of the ybeY gene the transcriptomes of the WT and ybeY bacteria grown at 22°C and 37°C were determined. The two temperatures were chosen since temperature is an important cue regulating the virulence genes. When comparing the WT and ybeY mutant strain transcriptomes of bacteria grown at 22°C we found changes in the expression of 350 genes in the ybeY bacteria, out of which 121 (34.6%) were up-regulated and 229 (65.4%) down-regulated. At 37°C 334 genes in the ybeY bacteria showed changes, out of which 48 (14.4%) were up-regulated and 286 (85.6%) down-regulated. Expression of 92 genes was changed at both temperatures, of these 92 genes, 12 were up- and 80 down-regulated.

DESIGN
Bacterial RNA profiles of wild type and ybeY- strains were generated using deep sequencing, in duplicates, under two growth temperatures (22°C and 37°C).
