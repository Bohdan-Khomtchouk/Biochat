TITLE
Identification of gene expression pattern for glioma stem cells in low grade glioma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gioma stem cells from Nf1-associated optic gliomas and NSCs from third ventricle zone show differencies in gene expression patterns and physiological functions. We used microarrays to identify differential gene expression between glioma stem cells and the control counterparts including the wild type and Nf1-/- neural stem cells from the third ventricle.

DESIGN
Cultured glioma stem cells were isolated from mouse optic gliomas. Wild-type and Nf1-/- TVZ NSCs were generated from postnantal day 1 Nf1flox/flox pups. We sought to obtain neural stem cells from three independent cultures. There are 9 samples in total. 3 wild-type TVZ NSCs, 3 Nf1-/- TVZ NSCs, 3 glioma stem cells.
