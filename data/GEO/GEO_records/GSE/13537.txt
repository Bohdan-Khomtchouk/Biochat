TITLE
MEF2 Regulated Genes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling in hippocampal neurons to identify activity-regulated genes controlled by MEF2 Experiments were conducted to identify activity-regulated MEF2 target genes. Keywords: Gene knockdown and depolarization time course

DESIGN
Neurons were depolarized with 55mM extracellular KCl for one or six hours in the presence of control or MEF2-specific shRNAs
