TITLE
Comparison of Cancer-Associated Genetic Abnormalities in Columnar-Lined Esophagus with and without Goblet Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The requirement of goblet cells (intestinal metaplasia; IM) to define Barrett’s esophagus (BE) remains controversial as some studies have shown that the risk of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is similar for non-goblet cell metaplasia (NGM) and IM. IM harbors genomic aberrations in known cancer-associated genes and these have been linked to increased EAC risk. No detailed studies have explored DNA alterations in NGM. We hypothesized that a comparison of DNA alterations in cancer-associated genes in IM and NGM samples would provide insight into their relative risks for progression to EAC.  Patient biopsies were analyzed using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays, FISH, and targeted resequencing of 20 frequently mutated EAC genes. Frequent CNA’s targeting cancer-associated genes were found in IM whereas no such changes were observed in NGM. In one subject, FISH confirmed loss of CDKN2A and amplification of chromosome 8 in IM but not in a nearby NGM biopsy.  Targeted sequencing in a subset of metaplasia tissues revealed 11 non-synonymous mutations in 16 IM samples and 2 mutations in 19 NGM samples. Our results show that IM has a much higher frequency of cancer-associated mutations than NGM and is therefore likely to pose a higher risk for development of EAC.

DESIGN
57 non-goblet metaplasia, intestinal metaplasias, and composite specimens from 45 subjects were studied. DNA copy number abnormalities (CNA’s) were identified using Affymetrix arrays and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Data was processed in Nexus 6.0 (BioDiscovery, CA). Targeted sequencing of all exons from twenty genes found to be frequently mutated in EAC was performed on metaplasia samples using Ion AmpliSeq™ DNA sequencing.
