TITLE
Expression data from intact adipose tissue in human pregnancy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed microarray analysis to evaluate differences in the transcriptome of the adipose tissue before and during pregnancy

DESIGN
Biopsies of adipose tissue of the subcutaneous gluteal depots, processed for adipose cell isolation, the remining tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, adipocytes were isolated by digestion with collagenase
