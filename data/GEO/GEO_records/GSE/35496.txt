TITLE
ChIP-Seq of Sox2 and Brn2 in ESCs, NPCs, and differentiating ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the genome-wide binding of Sox2 and POU factor partner factors, Oct4 in ESCs (using published datasets PMID:18692474 and GSM307137, GSM307154, GSM307155) and Brn2 in NPCs. We found that Sox2 and Oct4 co-occupied a large subset of promoters and enhancers in ESCs, but that Sox2 and Brn2 co-occupy predominantly enhancers.  Further, we overexpressed Brn2 in differentiating ESCs and showed that ectopic Brn2 recruited Sox2 to NPC-specific targets, resulting in skewed differentiation towards the neural lineage.

DESIGN
Examination of transcription factor binding in ESCs, NPCs, and differentiating ESCs by ChIP-Seq.
