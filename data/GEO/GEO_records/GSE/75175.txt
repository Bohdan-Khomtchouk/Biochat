TITLE
Comparison of expression profiles of WT and Nrf2AY/AY mutant macrophages under electrophilic stress agent [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nrf2(A502Y) mutant macrophages Nrf2(AY/AY) macrophages were more susceptible to toxicity of xenobiotics. To confirm preferences of binding sequences of Nrf2 and Nrf2A502Y in vivo, we performed ChIP-Seq analyses using an anti-Nrf2 antibody on the DEM-treated peritoneal macrophages derived from Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2AY/AY mice.

DESIGN
Chromatin occupancy of wild type (WT) Nrf2 and Nrf2AY mutant under DEM-treated condition were analyzed by deep sequencing, in triplicate

PLATFORM
