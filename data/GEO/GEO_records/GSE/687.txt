SUMMARY
To determine changes in gene expression in primary fibroblasts undergoing replicative senescence, a direct comparison between early passage proliferating cells and senescent cells was performed. Frozen stocks of the primary fibroblasts (HMF3) from which the lines HMF3A and HMF3Dwt were derived (O'Hare, PNAS:98, 2001) were serially passaged twice through to senescence to yield 2 independent sets of RNA. A third set of RNA was from a different female donor (F1068). The three different sets of RNA were put on 4 arrays each. Data is also provided for F1068 fibroblasts at late passage. Keywords = fibroblast Keywords = senescence Keywords = breast Keywords: ordered
