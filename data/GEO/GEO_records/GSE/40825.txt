TITLE
Expression analysis of the effect of overexpression of Cebpb shRNA in mouse 4T1 mammary tumor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in mouse 4T1 mammary tumors expressing Cebpb shRNA, compared to 4T1 tumors expressing control shRNA. Analysis of mouse 4T1 mammary tumors expressing Cebpb shRNA compared to control shRNA are further described in Johansson & Berg et al 2012.

DESIGN
A 10 chip study using total RNA recovered from five separate 4T1 tumors expressing Cebpb shRNA and five separate 4T1 tumors expressing control shRNA. All tumors were surgically removed after subcutaneous implantation in syngeneic BALB/c mice two weeks earlier. Each chip measures the expression level of 44,170 genes from Mus Musculus with fourteen 24-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
