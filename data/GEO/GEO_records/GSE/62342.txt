TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of KSHV during de novo primary infection of endothelial (TIVE) cells

ORGANISM
Human gammaherpesvirus 8

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify the viral transcripts packaged into the virion particles and the transcription profiles of the viral genome during early infection, till the virus establishes latent infection in endothelial (TIVE) cells

DESIGN
Samples from each time points were analyzed and the experiments were done in duplicate.

PLATFORM
GPL17680 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Human herpesvirus 8)
