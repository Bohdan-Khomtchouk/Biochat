TITLE
Gene expression data of cSHMT mutant, heterozygous, and wild-type mouse colons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is required for purine, thymidylate, and S-adenosylmethionine synthesis. Impairments in folate metabolism diminish cellular methylation potential and genome stability. Cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyl transferase (cSHMT) regulates partitioning between thymidylate and SAM biosynthesis. These experiments were designed to determine if mutations in cSHMT led to alterations in gene expression. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from proximal colons of cSHMT mutant, heterozygous, and wild-type mice raised on a folate-deficient diet. Three colon samples were isolated from each genotype to provide biological replication.  Mutant and heterozygous data were then compared pair-wise against wild-type expression data.
