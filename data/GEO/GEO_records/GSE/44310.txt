TITLE
Transcriptomic response of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading Sphingomonas sp. LH128 upon short-term starvation stress

ORGANISM
Sphingomonas sp. LH128

SUMMARY
This study examines genome-wide expression of the phenanthrene-degrading Sphingomonas sp. LH128 as a response to short-term starvation stress. For this purpose, the strain was subjected to complete nutrient starvation for 4h after growth on a rich medium. Survival was monitored by plating and transcriptomic response was determined by whole-genome microarray analysis. The data showed no major differences were obsrved in gene expression and the viability of the cells were not affected during short-term incubation time

DESIGN
Transcriptomic response of phenanthrene degrading Sphingomonas sp. LH128 starved for 4h in isotonic solution of 0.01 mM MgS04 was studied using genome-wide gene expression analysis. For this purpose, the strain was pregrown in minimal medium to an OD600 of 0.5, washed twice with 0.01 mM MgS04 and resuspended in the same solution to an OD of 0.5. RNA was extracted both from starved cells and from the initial culture (non-starved cells) and cDNA was synthesized and labeled with Cy3. Transcriptomic response of three replicates were analyzed and compared with the initial inoculum
