TITLE
The Key Role of Segmented Filamentous Bacteria in the Coordinated Maturation of Gut Helper T Cell Responses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microbiota-induced cytokine responses participate in gut homeostasis, but the cytokine balance at steady-state and the role of individual bacterial species in setting the balance remain elusive. Using gnotobiotic mouse models, we provide a systematic analysis of the role of microbiota in the induction of cytokine responses in the normal intestine. Colonization by a whole mouse microbiota orchestrated a broad spectrum of pro-inflammatory (Th1, Th17) and regulatory T cell responses. Unexpectedly, most tested complex microbiota and individual bacteria failed to efficiently stimulate intestinal cytokine responses. A potent cytokine-inducing function was however associated with non-culturable host-specific species, the prototype of which was the Clostridia-related Segmented Filamentous Bacterium, and this bacterial species recapitulated the coordinated maturation of T cell responses induced by the whole mouse microbiota. Our study demonstrates the non-redundant role of microbiota members in the regulation of gut immune homeostasis.

DESIGN
Germfree (GF) female 8-9-week-old mice were gavaged twice at a 24-hr interval with 0.5 mL of fresh anaerobic cultures of fecal homogenate from SFB mono-associated mice, fresh feces from Cv mice (Cvd) or from a healthy human donor (Hum). All mice were sacrificed on d8, 20 and 60 post-colonization in parallel to age-matched Cv and GF controls. RNA was extracted from ileal tissue, and processed to biotin-labelled cRNA, and then hybridized to the NuGO array (mouse) NuGO_Mm1a520177. Microarray analysis compared gene expression in ileum tissue of all the treatment groups GF, Cv, Cvd, Hum and SFB (N=3 per treatment group per time-point). Data was considered significant when P < 0.05 using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery method.
