TITLE
Expression profile analysis of macrosclereid cell development in Medicago truncatula

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
Macrosclereid cells, which form a layer in the seed coat of Medicago truncatula, accumulate large amounts of phytochemicals during their development. To characterize these phytochemicals and provide a broad analysis of gene expression in developing M. truncatula macrosclereid cells, we produced microarrays that displayed approximately 4861 differentially expressed probe sets (absolute fold-change of ≥3.0; LogRatio p-value of ≤0.001) between at least two time points in macrosclereid cell development, inculding 6DPP, 10DPP, 13DPP, 16DPP, 20DPP, 27DPP.
