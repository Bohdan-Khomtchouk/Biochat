TITLE
In vivo genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation for the chondrogenic transcription factors, Sox9, Sox5 and Sox6

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue ChIP-seq was performed on transcription factor Sox5, Sox6 and Sox9 using limbs and tails from E13.5 mouse embryos to find their in vivo binding sites in the genome

DESIGN
Sox9 and Sox6 ChIP-seq was performed on wildtype mice whereas Sox5 ChIP-seq was done using transgenic wildtype mice.
