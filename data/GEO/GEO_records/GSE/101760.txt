TITLE
Viral infection identifies micropeptides differentially regulated in smORF-containing lncRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Influenza A virus (A/reassortant/NIBRG-121(California/07/2009 x PR8)(H1N1))

SUMMARY
We use genome-wide high-throughput methods to identify potential micropeptides in smORF containing lncRNA involved in the immune response. Using influenza as a viral infection model, we performed RNAseq and ribosome profiling to track expression and translation of putative lncRNAs that encode for peptides and identify tens of potential candidates.

DESIGN
RNA-seq and ribosome profiling in A549 cells infected with H1N1 PR8 influenza, PR8dNS1 deletion strain, mock infection, or uninfected, in duplicates
