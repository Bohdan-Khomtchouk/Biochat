TITLE
Peripheral blood lymphocytes with different levels of gH2AX foci and micronuclei

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood lymphocytes with different levels of gH2AX foci and micronuclei after 0 and 2 Gy of gamma-rays. The aim was to identify differentially expressed genes, associated with level of gH2AX and micronuclei.

DESIGN
Radiation induced gene expression in human lymphocytes was measured at 24 hours after exposure to doses of 0 and 2 Gy g-rays. Six independent experiments were performed using different donors for each experiment. Donors were diveded in two groups: 1) with low level of endogenous gH2AX foci and high radiation-induced micronucleus frequency (n=3); 2) with high level of endogenous gH2AX foci and low radiation-induced  micronucleus frequency
