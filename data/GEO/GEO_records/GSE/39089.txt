TITLE
Genome-wide binding sites of Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) and histone modifications

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the high-throughput profilings of HIF1 and histone modifications in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). By obtaining over two billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of HUVEC under normoxia and hypoxia. We find that HIF1binds to not only to transcriptional starting sites but also enhancer regions and that HIF1 binding sites were overlapped with lysine 4 trimethylatio, monomethylation and lysine 27 acetylation . Finally, we show that chromatin state can change under hypoxia by using chromatin conformational capture assay. This study provides novel insights into the interaction between HIF1 and KDM3A and also the epigenetic regulation of HIF1.

DESIGN
Examination of HIF1 and 3 different histone modifications in HUVEC under 2 conditions. Related gene expression data is provided in GSE35932.
