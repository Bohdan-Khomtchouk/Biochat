TITLE
Gene expression in inflammatory macrophages, tissue resident macrophages and neutrophils

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genes expression in Ly6C+/F4/80+ inflammatory macrophages, CX3CR1+/F4/80+ tissue resident macrophages and Ly6G+/F4/80- neutrophils which were isolated from day 3 wounds in C57/B6 mice aged 8 weeks by cell sorting

DESIGN
Ly6C+ macrophages expressed higher (over 5 folds) levels of 241 genes compared to CX3CR1+ macrophages, and 3382 genes compared to neutrophils

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
