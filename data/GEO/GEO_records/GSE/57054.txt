TITLE
A subcutaneous adipose tissue-liver axis in the control of hepatic gluconeogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNA sequencing analysis of hepatic gene expression a few hours after amlexanox treatment, and identified over 1700 differentially expressed genes. Pathway analysis of these differentially regulated genes revealed that the top two most enriched pathways were the adipocytokine signaling pathway and the Jak-STAT signaling pathway.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis of hepatic gene expression was used to identify differentially expressed genes in response to Amlexanox treatment.
