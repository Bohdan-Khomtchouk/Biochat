TITLE
Transcriptome profiling during cutaneous porcine wound repair.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The expression profile during wound repair of cutaneous excisional wound (2x2 cm) was studied. The tissue was sampled from the centre of the open wound (day 3/7/14) or centre of the wound scar (day 21/35/70). The microarray slide were scanned in low intensity scan and high intensity scan mode.

DESIGN
Wound tissue (day 3, day 7, day 14, day 21, day 35, day 70, n = 4 per interval) vs. control - uninjured skin (day 0, n=4 ). In each interval two biological replicates of four were labeled with flip dyes.
