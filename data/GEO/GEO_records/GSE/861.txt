TITLE
Differential expression of Aspergillus genes as a result of disrupting maf1

ORGANISM
Aspergillus flavus

SUMMARY
We identified a 14-3-3 homolog (maf1) in an EST library made under conditions conducive to aflatoxin biosynthesis. Disruption of this gene in A. flavus by site directed mutagenesis abolished aflatoxin production. The maf1 mutant was morphologically similar to wild type but had reduced conidiation and growth on some media. DNA expression analysis of the wild type and maf1 mutant revealed that the mutation affected the expression profile of a set of genes associated with aflatoxin production. Keywords = Aspergillus Keywords = aflatoxin Keywords = 14-3-3 Keywords: repeat sample
