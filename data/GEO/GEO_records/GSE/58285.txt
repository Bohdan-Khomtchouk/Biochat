TITLE
Direct entry by RNase E is a major pathway for the degradation and processing of RNA in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Here we show using RNA-seq that cleavage by RNase E direct entry pervades in both the degradation and processing of RNA. We also give further evidence that direct entry is facilitated by cooperative interaction with segments in addition to the ones in which cleavage occurs.

DESIGN
RNA-seq profiles were compared between a temperature-sensitive mutant of rne and its congenic wild-type incubated at a non-permissive temperature. RNA seq profiles were also compared between samples before and after incubation with a 5'-sensing mutant of RNase E in vitro.
