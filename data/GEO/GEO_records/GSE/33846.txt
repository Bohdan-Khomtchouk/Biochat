TITLE
Expression data of hepatocytes isolated from chimeric mouse livers repopulated with human hepatocytes and from normal human livers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated chimeric mice with livers that were predominantly repopulated with human hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were isolated from the chimeric mouse livers and their gene expressions were compared with hepatocytes isolated from normal human livers . Cluster and principal components analyses showed that gene expression profiles of hepatocytes from the chimeric mice and those from normal human livers were extremely closed. Additionally, we performed microarray experiments to examine gene expression in human tissues. This data was used for comparison with hepatocytes. A total of 22 tissues (bone marrow, cerebellum, colon, cortex, fetal brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, small intestine, spinal cord, spleen, stomach, testes, thymus, thyroid, trachea and uterus) were examined.
