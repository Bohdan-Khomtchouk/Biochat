TITLE
DNA methylation profiles of human blood samples from a severe developmental disorder and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain n=113 Illumina DNA methylation array from whole blood samples. The main goal of the study was to measure the epigenetic age (also known as DNA methylation age) of subjects with a severe developmental disorder (known as syndrome X) and controls. To measure DNA methylation age, we used the epigenetic clock software described in Horvath S (n=2013) DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types. Genome Biology.2013, 14:R115. DOI: 10.1186/10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115 PMID: 24138928.

DESIGN
The data set contains 5 affected female subjects who exhibit a pure form of syndrome X. Further, the study includes two syndrome X-like subjects who also have Down syndrome and Ring- X Turner syndrome, respectively. For the diseased subjects, we collected several family members (parents and possibly siblings). We also collected several control families who do not have an affected child. Apart from family data, we also analyzed 62 blood samples from healthy controls.
