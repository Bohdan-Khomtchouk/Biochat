TITLE
Mechanisms of Myelocytic Nitric Oxide Synthases Against Hypoxia-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to comprehensively identify genes controlled by myelocytic nitric oxide synthases in the lung against hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, and to identify a novel alternative splicing mechanism.

DESIGN
Samples were the lungs of the WT mice with triply n/i/eNOS-/- bone marrow transplantation and  the WT mice with triply n/i/eNOS-/- bone marrow transplantation after 3 days under the hypoxic exposure (4 samples for each groups).

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
