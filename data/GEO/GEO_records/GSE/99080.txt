TITLE
Expression data from NRF3 knocked-down DLD-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Accumulated evidences suggest physiological relevance between the transcription factor NRF3 (NFE2L3) and cancers. However NRF3 target genes in cancer cells remain poorly understood. We used microarrays to identify to identify NRF3 taget genes which regulate cell proliferation.

DESIGN
For RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays, we prepated the DLD-1 cells transfected NRF3 or control siRNA in duplicate.
