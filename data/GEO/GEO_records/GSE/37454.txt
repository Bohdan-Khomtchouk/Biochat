TITLE
Base-pair resolution DNA methylation sequencing reveals profoundly divergent epigenetic landscapes in Acute Myeloid Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we used Illumina NGS for high-throughput profiling of the DNA methylome in two human colon cancer derived cell lines, two human normal bone marrow CD34+ controls and in five human Acutre Myeloid Leukeima patient samples.  These data can be used to determine the CpG cytosine methylation pattern at base pair resolution in each sample and to determine differentially methylated cytosines and regions between samples

DESIGN
Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) and Extended Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (ERRBS) on genomic DNA. We used colon cancer cell lines (two) to establish reproducbility and range of assay sensitivity.  We used Acute Myeloid Leukemia patient samples and CD34+ bone marrow cells as controls to determine the methylome pattern in the patient samples
