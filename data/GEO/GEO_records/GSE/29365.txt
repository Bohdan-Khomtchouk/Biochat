TITLE
Whole genome scanning of lung tumors and mucosal biopsies on Affymetrix NspI-250K platform

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Matched normal lymph node, tumors and corresponding mucosal biopsies from 4 lung cancer patients were scrutinized on Affymetrix 250K-NspI array platform. Frequently deleted regions genes were identified based on the LOH call as per manufacturer's guidelines and normalization. Frequently deleted genes in the tumors and mucosa were identified though this approach

DESIGN
Affymetrix 250K-NspI- SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from lung cancer and corresponding mucosal biopsy specimens. LOH analysis was done to identify genes that are frequently deleted.
