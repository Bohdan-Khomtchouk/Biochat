TITLE
Evaluation of differential expression in the vascular transcriptome among Picea species

ORGANISM
Picea glauca ; Picea sitchensis ; Picea mariana

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment is to assess tissue preferential transcript accumulation and fold difference between two tissues that support secondary vascular growth in three spruces: Picea glauca, Picea sitchensis and Picea mariana. Tissues compared are secondary xylem (wood forming tissue located on the internal side of the cambial meristem) and phelloderm (composite sample of the phloem and phelloderm tissues located on the outer side of the cambial meristem).

DESIGN
One-color comparison of 3 spruce species in 2 tissue types: xylem and phelloderm. 20 biological repetitions per tissue for Picea glauca and 15 for Picea sitchensis and Picea mariana, for a total of 100 slides.
