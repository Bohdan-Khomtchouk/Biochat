TITLE
Expression data of Met-low and Met-high B16-F10 malignant melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B16-F10 malignant mouse melanoma cells have been frequently used as highly metastatic cells. Based on heterogenous cell surface expression of Met/HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) receptor in B16-F10 cells, the cells were divided into Met-low and Met-high cells by flow cytometry and these populations were subjected to microarray analysis. Met-low and Met-high cells showed different expression profiles in genes involved characteristics of tumors, including stem cell maintenance, pigmentation, and angiogenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared respectively from Met-low and Met-high cells cultured for 3 days after cell sorting. RNA samples (n=2 for each groups) were subjected to microarray analysis, using the Whole Mouse Genome (44,000) Oligo Microarray (Agilent Technologies).
