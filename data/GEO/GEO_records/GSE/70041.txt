TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of a Staphylococcus aureus mutant defective in the transcription termination factor Rho.

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
This analysis is part of the study Whole-transcriptome analysis of Staphylococcus aureus under laboratory and infection-mimicking conditions (MÃ¤der, Nicolas et al., to be submitted) where the S. aureus HG001 transcriptome was analyzed under more than 40 different biological conditions. The data revealed a relatively low abundance of antisense RNAs in S. aureus, overlapping only 6% of the coding genes. Transcriptome analysis of the rho deletion mutant revealed a remarkable overall increase in antisense transcription in S. aureus.
