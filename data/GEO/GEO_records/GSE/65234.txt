TITLE
Autoimmune peptide antigen IgG and IgM reactivity in B6 and BXD2 mice with spontaneous systemic autoimmune disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to determine B6 and BXD2 mouse sera IgG and IgM reactivity to linear peptide epitopes at different ages.  Serum from B6 or BXD2 mice was diluted at 1:200 for IgG-specific analysis or 1:1000 for IgM specific analysis and incubated on a PEPperPRINT peptide microarray platform printed with peptide autoantigens.

DESIGN
80 pre-selected peptides based on a previous screen of pooled mouse serum BXD2 against the PEPperCHIP® Autoimmunity Microarray with 2,733 linear  B-cell epitopes were printed in duplicate in 16 copies on a custom PEPperCHIP® Peptide  Microarray.  Flag (DYKDDDDKGG) and  HA (YPYDVPDYAG) control peptides (10 spots each control) were randomly distributed in each array copy as controls.  Sera from 2, 5, or 9 month old B6 or BXD2 mice was profiled for anti-mouse IgG or IgM-specific analysis of autoantibody reactivity to the peptide auto-epitopes.
