TITLE
Rearrangement of actin stress fiber in HUVECs under cyclic stretch

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Time-course of gene profiles indicate that gene expression changing in cyclic stretch are related to cell adhesion and MAPK signaling.

DESIGN
Gene expression changing by uniaxiali stretch was studied in a time course assay within 1.5 hour. Six time points (0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 min) were triplicated

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
