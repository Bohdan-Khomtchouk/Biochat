TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by HSF1 in control and heat-shocked cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the regulation of HSF1-mediated gene expression in control and heat shock conditions, we performed DNA microarray analysis.

DESIGN
mRNA levels in control and heat-shocked MEF cells, which were infected with adenovirus expressing scramble RNA or HSF1 short hairpin RNA, were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis using GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix).

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
