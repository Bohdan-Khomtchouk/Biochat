TITLE
mRNA expression profiles of 71 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) from 71 patients in japan. Integrative analysis of gene expression profiles and genomic alterations obtained from array-CGH and NGS provided us new insight into the pathogenesis of ESCC

DESIGN
Gene expression levels obtained from 71 microdissected ESCC tumors. We used the commercially available Human Whole Genome Oligo DNA Microarray Kit (Agilent Technologies). Labeled cRNAs were fragmented and hybridized to an oligonucleotide microarray (Whole Human Genome 4Ã—44K Agilent G4112F). Fluorescence intensities were determined with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner. The gene expression profiles (GE) obtained from microarray data were quintile normalized. The batch effect in microarray experiments was also adjusted by an empirical Bayesian approach
