TITLE
Expression analysis of uninfected Boechera stricta and infected Boechera stricta with Puccinia monoica forming pseudoflowers using an Arabidopsis thaliana gene expression 4x72K array design from NimbleGen.

ORGANISM
Boechera stricta

SUMMARY
The expression of 30362 plant genes from uninfected flowers of Boechera stricta, uninfected steam and leaves of B. stricta and infected B. stricta with Puccinia monoica forming pseudoflowers. We hybridized cDNA from each sample to an Arabidopsis thaliana gene expression 4x72K format NimbleGen array (ATH6_60mer_expr).

DESIGN
We used a eukaryotic gene expression array design No.5048 from NimbleGen (Cat No. A4511001-00-01). Each 5048 array measures the expression level of 30,362 target genes from Arabidopsis thaliana in a 4-plex format 4x72K with with 72,000 probes per array, a total of two probes per target gene, and 60-mer probe length. Total RNA samples recovered from infected leaves of Boechera stricta with Puccinia monoica (pseudoflowers) and uninfected stem and leaves of B. stricta. Experiments included three/two biological repllicates from each sample. We carried out total RNA extractions for all samples using RNAesy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat No. 74904). cDNA synthesis was performed by NimbleGen.
