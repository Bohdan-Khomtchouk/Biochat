TITLE
Expression analysis of uninfected Boechera stricta and infected Boechera stricta with Puccinia monoica forming pseudoflowers using an Arabidopsis thaliana gene expression 4x72K array design from NimbleGen.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The expression of 30362 plant genes from uninfected flowers of Boechera stricta, uninfected steam and leaves of B. stricta and infected B. stricta with Puccinia monoica forming pseudoflowers. We hybridized cDNA from each sample to an Arabidopsis thaliana gene expression 4x72K format NimbleGen array (ATH6_60mer_expr).
