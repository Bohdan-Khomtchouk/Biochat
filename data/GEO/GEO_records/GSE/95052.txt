TITLE
BET N-terminal bromodomain inhibition selectively blocks Th17 cell differentiation and ameliorates colitis in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptomic changes and Brd4 global occupancy in Th17 cells treated with JQ1 and MS402. We find that MS402 selectively targets Th17 cells and displaces Brd4 occupancy at Th17-selective genes.

DESIGN
RNA-seq samples were analyzed from Th17 cells treated with JQ1 and MS402. ChIP-seq samples were analyzed to determine global Brd4 occupancy in response to MS402 treatement.
