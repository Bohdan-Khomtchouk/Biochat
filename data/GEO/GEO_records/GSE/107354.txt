TITLE
Alteration of treatment of the ALK inhibitor in ALK-amplified neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) most frequently mutated in neuroblastoma (NB) and is atractive molecular target for therapy. However, efficacy of the ALK inhibitor against ALK-amplified NB is unclear. To elucidate genetic alterations induced by treatment of the ALK inhibitor, we compared expression profile between ALK inhibitor-treated and DMSO-treated NB39nu cells using Agilent SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K V2 Microarray Kit

DESIGN
The ALK inhibitor or DMSO-treated NB39nu cells (parental and resistant), which harbor ALK amplification, were for RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL17077 Agilent-039494 SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray 039381 (Probe Name version)
