TITLE
Genes modulated by miR-205 in DU145 prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study was aimed at identifying genes directly or indirectly regulated by miR-205 in the prostate. To this purpose, DU145 prostate cancer cells, which express miR-205 at very low levels, were transfected with miR-205 synthetic precursor and consequent alterations of gene expression analyzed using a microarray approach. Keywords: comparison betweed cells exposed to different miRNA precursors
