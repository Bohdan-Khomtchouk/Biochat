TITLE
The BCL6 RD2 domain governs commitment of activated B-cells to form germinal centers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our data demonstrated that Bcl6 directly binds and represses trafficking receptors S1pr1 and Grp183 by recruiting Hdac2 through the RD2 domain.  Deregulation of these genes impairs B-cell migration and may contribute to the Germinal Center failure in Bcl6RD2MUT mice.

DESIGN
RNAseq was performed in endogenous BCL6-depleted OCI-LY1 cells rescued with either WT or RD mutant BCL6 (N=3 for each group).
