TITLE
Molecular features of subtype-specific progression from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive breast cancer [miRNA data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer consists of at least five main molecular “intrinsic” subtypes, which are reflected in both pre-invasive and invasive disease. Although previous studies have suggested that many of the molecular features of invasive breast cancer are established early, it is unclear what mechanisms drive progression, and whether the mechanisms of progression are dependent or independent of subtype. We have generated mRNA, miRNA and DNA copy number profiles from a total of 59 in situ lesions and 85 invasive tumors, in order to comprehensively identify those genes, signaling pathways, processes, and cell types that are involved in breast cancer progression. Our work provides evidence that there are molecular features associated with disease progression that are unique to the intrinsic subtypes. We additionally establish subtype-specific signatures that are able to identify a small proportion of pre-invasive tumors with expression profiles that resemble invasive carcinoma, indicating a higher likelihood of future disease progression.

DESIGN
One-color design, totaling 48 arrays and 41 unique tissues. Arrays consist of 4 normal controls (1 unique), 28 DCIS lesions (26 unique), and 16 small invasive breast cancers (14 unique).
