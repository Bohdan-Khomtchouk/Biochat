TITLE
Human Erythroid Day 10 ChIP using GATA, PolII, H3 and H4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A large-scale analysis of histone acetylation as well as RNA polymerase II and GATA 1 interactions on chromosome 6q in human erythroid progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Human erythroid progenitors from day 10 erythroid cultures were used for ChIP-chip analysis. For this purpose, the NimbleGen array system was used, following manufacturer's protocols. Samples for ChIP were taken from the same individual and processed for use with each of the following antibodies: GATA1, PolII, AcH3 and AcH4.
