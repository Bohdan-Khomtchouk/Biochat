TITLE
C. elegans: Dauers and Dauer-Exit at 12 hour time-point vs. Mix-stage worms

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of C. elegans worms from (1) dauer stage, or (2) dauer-exit at 12 hours stage, compared to mix-stage worms as a common reference. The goal was to determine genes regulated during dauer development and recovery or exit from dauer stage. This data was then compared to data generated for corresponding developmental stages in the  nematode Pristionchus pacificus (see NCBI GEO series GSE31861) , to study evolution of developmental pathways regulating dauer development.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiments. Experiment 1 = Dauers vs. Mix-stage worms. 4 biological replicates for each condition, including 2 dye-swaps. Experiment 2 = Dauer-Exit at 12 hour time-point s vs. Mix-stage worms. 4 biological replicates for each condition, including 2 dye-swaps. Total samples from both experiments 1 and 2 = 8.

PLATFORM
