TITLE
Mapping interactions for the TNIP2 hub protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment analyzes the set of RNAs copurifying with the protein TNIP2 (amino acids 196-346)

DESIGN
HEK293 cells were transfected with constructs expressing either Halo tag (controls) or Halo-TNIP2 196-346. Total RNA was purified from an aliquot of the whole cell extract (Input samples). Halo-tagged proteins were purified from the remainder of the whole cell extract, and RNA subsequently purified from the Halo purified samples (Pulldown samples).
