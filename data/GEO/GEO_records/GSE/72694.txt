TITLE
miR396-OsGRF6 module controls rice inflorescence architecture

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Developing strategies to increase rice productivity to meet global demand is one of the main challenges for breeders around the world. Here, we report a novel microRNA mediated process that increases rice grain yield in field trials. Expression of target mimicry of microRNA396 (MIM396) significantly increases rice yield by modulating the development of the auxiliary branches and spikelets through promoting the expression of Growth Regulation Factor 6 (OsGRF6). OsGRF6 coordinately induces the expression of several key factors involved in branch and spikelet development, auxin (IAA) biosynthesis, and auxin signaling pathway. Our results demonstrate that the miR396b-GRF6 module acts as a key player in shaping the inflorescence architecture of rice, which could be engineered to generate high-yield rice. This dataset records the profile of the binding peaks of OsGRF6 with GFP antibody in 35S:GRF6-GFP overexpression lines and the differential expressed genes between MIM396 and WT plants.

DESIGN
Examination of OsGRF6 regulated genes.
