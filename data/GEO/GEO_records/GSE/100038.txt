TITLE
Population structure and ancestry of Qinchuan cattle by GeneSeek HD Bovine 77k Genotyping BeadChip

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
GeneSeek HD Bovine 77k Genotyping array is used to estimate population structure and ancestry of bovine and evaluate loci responsible for complex traits. Further, copy number variation of bovine can be estimated by GeneSeek HD Bovine 77k Genotyping array. Here, we estimate population structure and ancestry of Qinchuan cattle.

DESIGN
A total of 288 Qinchuan cattle were conducted by GeneSeek HD Bovine 77k Genotyping Beadchip.

PLATFORM
GPL23582 GeneSeek HD Bovine 77k Genotyping Array
