TITLE
Unique Transcriptional Profile in Wrist Muscles From Cerebral Palsy Patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cerebral palsy is caused be an upper motor neuron lesion which casues spasticity as well as secondary effects on muscle .  Muscle from cerebral palsy patients is has been shown to be smaller, with more ECM and longer sarcomere lengths We used microarrays to globally investigate the transcriptional adaptations of cerebral palsy muscle and research which muscle pathways are altered in the diseased state Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
Muscle biopsies were taken from children undergoing surgery which exposed wrist muscle extensors (n=8) and flexors (n=8) in both cerebral palsy patients (n=6) and control patients (n=2) for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChips .  Cerebral palsy patients were classified by a number of clinical scores.
