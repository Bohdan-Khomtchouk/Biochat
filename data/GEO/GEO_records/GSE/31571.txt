TITLE
High resolution methylome map of rat reveals role of intragenic DNA methylation in identifying coding region and alternative splice site.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the application of next generation sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of cytosine methylation in adult rat liver tissue.

DESIGN
To investigate the role of intragenic methylation, we generated the first high resolution methylation map of rat liver tissue and compared it with the proteome of the same rat tissue.
