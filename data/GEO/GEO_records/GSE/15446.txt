TITLE
Comparison of Arabidopsis stem base to first internode transcriptional profiles

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Subsequently to primary growth, most dicotyledonous plants undergo secondary growth leading to an increased diameter of growth axes. During secondary growth initiation in shoots, a cylindrical meristem, the vascular cambium, is established by the initiation of meristematic activity in interfascicular regions, a process that ultimately leads to the formation of a continuous cylinder of vascular tissue along the shoot axis. In Arabidopsis this happens in a reduced area at the very base of the stem. In this study, a transcriptional comparison between the base and the first internode has been performed in order to asses the physiological state of both sample types and search for potential key regulators of the process.
