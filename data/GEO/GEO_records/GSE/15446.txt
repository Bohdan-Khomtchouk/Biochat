TITLE
Comparison of Arabidopsis stem base to first internode transcriptional profiles

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Subsequently to primary growth, most dicotyledonous plants undergo secondary growth leading to an increased diameter of growth axes. During secondary growth initiation in shoots, a cylindrical meristem, the vascular cambium, is established by the initiation of meristematic activity in interfascicular regions, a process that ultimately leads to the formation of a continuous cylinder of vascular tissue along the shoot axis. In Arabidopsis this happens in a reduced area at the very base of the stem. In this study, a transcriptional comparison between the base and the first internode has been performed in order to asses the physiological state of both sample types and search for potential key regulators of the process.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the base and the first internode from stems of 15cm tall Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Col-0). After RNA amplification, Cy3 or Cy5 targets were produced. Three independent biological replicates were used for each type of sample. Three hybridizations were performed, representing the three independent biological replicates, being one of them a dye swap.
