TITLE
Combinatorial Control Logic of the Gene Expression Response to Endotoxin links Signal-Dependent Transcriptional Factors and Cytoplasmic Mechanisms

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
An iterative Systems Biology approach reveals how the pathogen-responsive transcriptome is specified by combinatorial codes of nuclear transcription factors, cytoplasmic mRNA halflife regulators, and autocrine mechanisms.

DESIGN
RNASeq analysis of BMDMs stimulated with various stimuli for 0, 1, 3 and 8 hours

PLATFORM
