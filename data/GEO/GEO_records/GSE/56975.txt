TITLE
Single-base resolution DNA methylation profiles of two highly inbred chicken lines, Leghorn and Fayoumi, by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (MethylC-seq).

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Here we provided the first single-base resolution DNA methylatome in chicken lungs by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (MethylC-seq). In addition, two genetically distinct highly inbred chicken lines, Leghorn and Fayoumi, were used to examine how DNA methylation regulates mRNA gene expression between two lines. The methylation profile demonstrated that methylcytosines in the chicken were more likely to occur in CG dinucleotides than in non-CG sites. DNA methylation in the gene body region, especially in the internal exons, was higher than in the 5’ and 3’ flanking regions of genes.Differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis indicated widespread differences between the Leghorn and Fayoumi lines. Of particular interest, many identified DMR-associated genes were significantly enriched in immune-related groups, which indicate that DNA methylation may regulate host immune response to pathogen infection in chickens as these two genetic lines have demonstrated differential resistance to a few pathogens. This work establishes a comprehensive and precise DNA methylation pattern in chickens and lays a solid foundation for future studies on epigenetic modifications related to poultry growth, disease, and development.
