TITLE
Changes of the gene expression profiling induced by fenofibrate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To make investigation of the apoptosis-inducing effect of fenofibrate, the Gene expression profile chip was used to compare the changes between the control group (0μM for 24h) and fenofibrate treatment group (50μM for 24h) in MDA-MB-231 cell lines.

DESIGN
Fenofibrate induced gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cell lines was measured at 24 hours after exposure to doses of 0 and 50μM fenofibrate.
