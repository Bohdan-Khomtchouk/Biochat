TITLE
Small RNA transcriptome of Hibiscus syriacus provides insights into the potential influence of microRNAs in flower development and terpene synthesis

ORGANISM
Hibiscus syriacus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential small RNA molecules that regulate the expression of target mRNAs in plants and animals. Here, we aimed to identify miRNAs and their putative targets in Hibiscus syriacus, the national flower of South Korea. Therefore, we employed high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs obtained from four different tissues (i.e., leaf, root, flower, and ovary) and identified 33 conserved and 30 novel miRNA families, many of which showed differential tissue-specific expressions. In addition, we computationally predicted novel targets of miRNAs and validated some of them using 5â€² rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis. One of the validated novel targets of miR477 was a terpene synthase, the primary gene involved in the formation of disease-resistant terpene metabolites such as sterols and phytoalexins. In addition, a predicted target of conserved miRNAs, miR396, is SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE, which is involved in flower initiation and is duplicated in Hibiscus syriacus. Collectively, this study provides the first reliable draft of the Hibiscus syriacus miRNA transcriptome that should constitute a basis for understanding the biological roles of miRNAs in Hibiscus syriacus.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from H. syriacus tissue samples (leaf, root, flower, and ovary).
