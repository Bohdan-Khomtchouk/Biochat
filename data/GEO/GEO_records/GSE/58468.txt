TITLE
Expression data from the spleen of tumor bearing mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identify a new cell subset Ter119+CD45- small cells that promotes tumor metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-bearing mice. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of Ter119+CD45- cells comparing with CD45- cells in the spleen of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-bearing mice.

DESIGN
Ter119+CD45- cells in the spleen of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-bearing mice, being sorted by a MoFlo high-speed cell sorter, were prepared for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The CD45+ cells from the same tumor bearing mice were prepared as control.
