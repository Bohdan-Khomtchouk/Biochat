TITLE
Transcriptomes of human monocytes after ex vivo exposure to uric acid

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Innate immune memory, also refered to as trained immunity (TRIM) is the phenomenon whereby innate immune cells such as monocytes or macrophages undergo functional reprogramming after exposure to microbial components.  In this study  we exposed monocytes from healthy donors to uric acid ex vivo, and analyzed the effect of this exposure on gene expression changes. After 'uric acid' or 'media only' treatments, monocytes were exposed to LPS for 4 hours to measure they response to this pyrogen.

DESIGN
Monocytes from healthy donors were cultured in the presence of uric acid for 24 hours and then exposed to LPS for 4 hours. Cells were then collected for RNA-seq.
