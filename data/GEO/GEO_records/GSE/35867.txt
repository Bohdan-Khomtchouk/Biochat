TITLE
Gene expression profiling of adult female tissues in feeding Rhipicephalus microplus cattle ticks

ORGANISM
Rhipicephalus microplus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of salivary gland, midgut and ovary tissues isolated from  Rhipicephalus microplus females at day 20 post infestation. This enabled the identification of transcripts that are tissue-specific or shared among the tissues tested.

DESIGN
Reference pool design: Each tissue tested was compared to a reference pool comprising ticks (immature to adult stages) sampled on day 4, 5, 7, 13, 15 and tissues collected on  day 20 post infestation. Biological replicates: 2; Technical replicates: 2.

PLATFORM
GPL15231 Agilent-024497 BmicroplusEST_1 custom array (Feature Number version)
