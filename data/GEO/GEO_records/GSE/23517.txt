TITLE
Gene expression in developing wild and domesticated fibers of Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
We explored the transcriptomic alterations associated with domestication by interrogating a developmental time course of cotton fibers from the wild G. hirsutum var. yucatanense and a representative of an elite domesticated line.

DESIGN
30 chip design - including 2 species (wild and domesticated cotton), by 1 tissue (fiber), for 5 timepoints (2,7,10,20, and 25 days after anthesis), with 3 replicates per timepoint
