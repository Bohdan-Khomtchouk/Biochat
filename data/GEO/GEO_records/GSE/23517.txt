TITLE
Gene expression in developing wild and domesticated fibers of Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)

ORGANISM
Gossypium

SUMMARY
We explored the transcriptomic alterations associated with domestication by interrogating a developmental time course of cotton fibers from the wild G. hirsutum var. yucatanense and a representative of an elite domesticated line.
