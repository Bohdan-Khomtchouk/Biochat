Comparison of gene expression profiles of normal human bronchial epithelial cells in 2D and 3D cultural conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment is part of a project to study DNA repair process after ionizing radiation  in organotypic 3-dimentional human bronchial epithlial cell culture.

DESIGN
Human bronchial epithelial cells were grown in tissue culture flask (2D) or in matrics gel (3D). Three independent cultures were done for each condition.
