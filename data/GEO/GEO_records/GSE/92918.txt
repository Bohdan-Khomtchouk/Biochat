TITLE
Expression data from HCT 116 colorectal cancer cells treated with oncolytic virus M1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Virus infection is a kind of immune stimulation, except anti-viral factors, virus also induce tumor cells to secret cytokines which act on neighboring cells. Figuring out the exact cytokines upregulated by M1 virus is of great significance. We used microarry data to detail the expression of cytokines, chemokines and Inflammasomes regulated by oncolytic virus M1.

DESIGN
HCT116 tumor cells were treated with oncolytic virus M1 for 0h or 24h, and we used microarray data to detail the expression of cytokines, chemokines and Inflammasomes regulated by oncolytic virus M1.
