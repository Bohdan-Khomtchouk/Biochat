TITLE
Exon level expression profiling of colorectal cancer tissue samples (77 samples)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These colorectal cancer (CRC) samples have been analyzed by exon expression profiling to identify genes with overexpression of 3â€™ parts. By characterizing underlying transcript structures of such genes with a combination of rapid amplification of cDNA ends and deep-sequencing (RACE-seq), we identify and describe novel RNA-variants in CRC.

DESIGN
We analyzed genome-wide expression at the exon-level using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform. This set of CRC samples is a part of a larger series. Exon level expression values from a total of 202 CRCs and 21 normal colonic mucosa were used to detect samples that possess abnormal expression profiles. This submission includes 77 CRC samples. The remaining 125 CRC samples and 21 normal colonic mucosa samples are already deposited in GEO, accession numbers GSE24550, GSE29638, and GSE42690.
