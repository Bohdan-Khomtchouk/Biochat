TITLE
ReproArray_Pmonodon

ORGANISM
Penaeus monodon

SUMMARY
To construct the first in-house version of cDNA microarrays for P. monodon, the ovary and testes EST libraries were used as templates for reproduction-specific cDNA microarray (ReproArray) fabrication.  ReproArray was used to analyze large-scale gene expression and to demonstrate capacity for studies of reproduction-relevant genes. Keywords: time couse

DESIGN
ReproArray was constructed to analyze large-scale gene expression of reproduction-relevant genes in the broodstocks (P. monodon).  The expression study of female brooders from different ovarian development stages was conducted to identify differential expression profiles and important genes. Stage I (Previtellogenic stage) was used as reference for comparison with Stages II, III, IV (Vitellogenic, Early cortical rod, and Late cortical rod). Two replicated data sets were averaged and analyzed.
