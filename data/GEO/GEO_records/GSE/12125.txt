TITLE
ReproArray_Pmonodon

ORGANISM
Penaeus monodon

SUMMARY
To construct the first in-house version of cDNA microarrays for P. monodon, the ovary and testes EST libraries were used as templates for reproduction-specific cDNA microarray (ReproArray) fabrication.  ReproArray was used to analyze large-scale gene expression and to demonstrate capacity for studies of reproduction-relevant genes. Keywords: time couse
