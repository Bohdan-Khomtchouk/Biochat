TITLE
Human cytomegalovirus reprograms hematopoietic progenitor cells into immunosuppressive monocyte to achieve latency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HCMV NR-1 infection reprograms human CD34+ HPCs into long-life, NO-producing, immune suppressive Mo-MDSC-like cells at the late stage of infection We used microarray to detail the gene expression of human CD34+ HPCs and long-life, NO-producing, immune suppressive Mo-MDSC-like cells at the late stage of infection

DESIGN
The human CD34+ HPCs were selected, RNA was extracted after HCMV NR-1 successfully established latency in HPCs and HPCs without HCMV infection. We sought to obtain the gene expression in human CD34+ HPCs before and after HCMV infection.

PLATFORM
