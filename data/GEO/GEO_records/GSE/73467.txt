TITLE
Embryonic stem cells exhibit mRNA isoform-specific translational regulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of the differential translation rates of individual mRNA variants in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in ESC-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) using polysome profiling coupled to RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Mouse ESCs were differentiated into Sox1-positive neural precursor cells (NPCs). One replicate of ESCs and NPCs were harvested and subjected to polysome fractionation. Fractions containing polysomes were purified and analysed by SOLiD sequencing. Expression levels in NPCs were compared to ESCs.

PLATFORM
GPL10010 AB SOLiD System (Mus musculus)
