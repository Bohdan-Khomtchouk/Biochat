TITLE
Extensively Self-Renewing Erythroblasts Derived from Transgenic Î²-Yac Mice are a Novel Model System for Studying Globin Switching and Erythroid Maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Extensively Self Renewing Erythroblasts (ESREs) are cultured erythroid cells derived from yolk sack or fetal liver. Transcriptome analyses were conducted on ESREs using RNA-seq and compared to published transcriptome analyses of uncultured erythroid cells.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was conducted on proliferating Extensively Self Renewing Erythroblasts (ESREs) and ESREs after one day of maturation.  Biologic duplicates were done at each time point.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
