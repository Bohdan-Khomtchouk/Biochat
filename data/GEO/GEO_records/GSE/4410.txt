TITLE
Genes responsive to sodium butyrate in colonic epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed global scale microarray analysis to identify detailed mechanisms by which sodium butyrate (SB) induce cell growth arrest and differentiation of colonic epithelial cells by using an Affymetrix GeneChip system. Colonic epithelial MCE301 cells used in this study were derived from transgenic mice harboring a tsSV40 large T-antigen. Arrested cell growth and a differentiated phenotype accompanying elevations of alkaline phosphatase activity and histone acetylation were observed in the cells treated with 2 mM SB. Of the 22,690 probe sets analyzed, approximately 2,000 genes were down- and up-regulated by a factor of 2.0 or greater in the cells treated with SB. Keywords: sodium butyrate, gene expression, colonic epithelial cell
