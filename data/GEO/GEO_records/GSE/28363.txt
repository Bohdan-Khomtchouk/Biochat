TITLE
miRNA expression data of shoot meristems of trifoliate orange

ORGANISM
Citrus trifoliata

SUMMARY
In 1976, a spontaneous mutant derived from Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf with short juvenile phase, namely, precocious trifoliate orange, was found in Yichang, Hubei province, China. Compared with 6 to 8 years of the wild-type trifoliate orange, almost all of the seedlings germinated from precocious trifoliate orange only have 1 to 2 yearsâ€™ juvenile period, and 20% seedlings even flowered in the year after germination. Therefore, precocious trifoliate orange is an ideal material for studying the role of miRNAs involved in citrus juvenile and adult developmental stages.  To characterize these miRNAs expressed at the juvenile and adult development stages of citrus, Affymetrix miRNA arrays were used to generate miRNA profiles of shoot meristems of trifoliate orange, the results revealed that some miRNAs were down-regulated expressed at adult stage compared with juvenile stage. Detailed comparison of the expression patterns of miRNAs and corresponding target genes revealed the negative correlation between them, while few of them are positively correlated.

DESIGN
To investigate the expression patterns of these miRNAs at juvenile and adult stages of citrus, four independent precocious trifoliate orange RNA samples (March, June, December and April next year) were hybridized with miRNA microarray, respectively. The expression of miRNA was analyzed with the SAM software.
