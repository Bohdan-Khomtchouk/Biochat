TITLE
Identification and functional characterization of long noncoding RNAs in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have integrated RNA-seq data from subcellular fractionated RNA (i.e., cytoplasm, nucleoplasm, and chromatin-associated) with GRO-seq data using a novel bioinformatics pipeline. This has yielded a comprehensive catalog of polyadenylated lncRNAs in MCF-7 cells, about half of which have not been annotated previously and about a quarter of which are estrogen-regulated. Knockdown of selected lncRNAs, such as lncRNA152 and lncRNA67 followed by RNA-seq suggest that these lncRNAs regulate the expression of cell cycle genes.

DESIGN
