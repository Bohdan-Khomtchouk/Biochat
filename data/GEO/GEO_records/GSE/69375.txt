TITLE
Comparative genomics provides insight into the diversity of the attaching and effacing Escherichia coli (AEEC) virulence plasmids

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O127:H6 str. E2348/69

SUMMARY
Global transcriptional analysis of the EPEC prototype strain E2348/69 and its plasmid mutants containing a deletion of perABC, or missing the entire EAF plasmid (strain JPN15).

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was performed on the EPEC prototype strain E2348/69 and its plasmid mutants, strain Î”perABC and strain JPN15, during growth in laboratory media and conditions that have been previously demonstrated to induce expression of EPEC virulence factors.
