TITLE
Time course of the mRNA expression in wild-type Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain grown on a synthetic medium

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of wild-type Thermus thermophilus HB8 strain grown in a synthetic medium at 70°C.  Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Wild-type T. thermophilus HB8 strains were pre-cultured at 70°C for 16 h in 3 ml of synthetic medium. The cells (2 ml) were inoculated into 1 liter of the same medium and then cultivated at 70°C. Cells were collected after 360, 480, 600, 720, 840, 960, 1080, 1200, 1320 and 1440 min, and then crude RNA was extracted. The expression of each mRNA at each time point was analyzed on a GeneChip as described under 'Description' field of each Sample.
