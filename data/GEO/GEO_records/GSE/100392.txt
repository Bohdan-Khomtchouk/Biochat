TITLE
Altered gene expression by C1orf106 in papillary thyroid cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosome 1 open reading frame 106 (C1orf106) has been shown to be elevated in lung adenocarcinoma. However, its expression and function in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) are totally unknown. To explore the role of C1orf106 in PTC, we analyzed the gene expression in TPC1 cells with or without C1orf106 overexpression.

DESIGN
The mRNA profiles of TPC1-Vector and TPC1-C1orf106 cells were generated by sequencing, in duplicate, using an Illumina HiSeq 4000.

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
