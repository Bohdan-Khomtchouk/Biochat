TITLE
Profiling skin from Carrageenan (CGN) rat model for inflammation pain

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This program aims at identifying a skin gene signature associated with inflammation pain in rat CGN model

DESIGN
The profiling data was analyzed by identifying genes that were up- and down-regulated at selected p value and fold change in the skin of rats treated with CGN (to induce pain) compared to the corresponding non-treated controls.
