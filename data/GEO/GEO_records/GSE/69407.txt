TITLE
Transcriptomic characters of different pregnancy outcomes in CpG-induced nonobese diabetic mice and wild-type controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
rna-seq was performed to reveal the profiles of differentially expressed genes in the maternal-fetal interface of wild-type and nod mice with or without CpG-induced intrauterine infection

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of wild type (WT) and NOD mice were generated by deep sequencing without replicate
