TITLE
Small and large RNA sequencing of a Kras G12D mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice bearing a G12D activating mutation in Kras consistently develop lung adenocarcinomas in a manner analogous to humans.  By performing small and large RNA sequencing on KrasG12D tumors from F1 hybrid mice we were able to identify genes and microRNAs differentially expressed in these tumor samples.  Quantification of reads that cover single nucleotide polymorphisms that distinguish between the parental mouse strains enabled an analysis of allele specific expression and imprinting status in these tumors.

DESIGN
mRNA and small RNA fractions of mouse lungs and lung adenocarcinomas were deep sequenced in triplicate
