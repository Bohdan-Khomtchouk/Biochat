TITLE
Characterization of polysome enriched mRNAs following insulin treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterize RNA distribution on total and polysomal fractions of hepatocytes, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify differentially abundant mRNAs on polysomes.

DESIGN
Insulin induced gene expression in Aml12 hepatocytes were measured at 1 hours after treatment (100 mM). Four replicate experiments were performed.

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
