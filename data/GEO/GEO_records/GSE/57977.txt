TITLE
MMSET Induces Global and Focal Changes in Histone Methylation in Myeloma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated genome wide distribution of H3K36me2, H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 in the presence and absence of MMSET protein. MMSET overexpression in t(4;14)+ myeloma leads to global loss redistribution of H3K36me2 and genome-wide loss of  H3K27 methylation. Despite the gloal decrease in H3K27me3, specific regions of the genome show enhanced H3K27me3 enrichment through increased recruitment of EZH2 methyltransferase

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for H3K36me2, H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 in two cell types

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
