TITLE
Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
OsNRAMP5 is involved in iron, manganese and cadmium transport. Goal was to determine the effects of knocking down OsNRAMP5 on global rice gene expression.

DESIGN
Two experiments: Control condition experiment: root or shoot of WT vs. OsNRAMP5 RNAi plants. WT Cd treatment experiment: 4 weeks old WT plants grown under 0 or 10uM Cd for two weeks

PLATFORM
GPL8852 Agilent-015241 Rice Gene Expression 4x44K Microarray (Probe name version)
