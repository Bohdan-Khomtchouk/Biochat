TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of cellobiose-positive isolates of L. lactis MG1363

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris

SUMMARY
Transcriptomes of L. lactis MG1363ΔcelBΔptcCΔ0963 containing either an IS905 or a gfp integrated into llmg_1239 (pseudo_39) were compared to that of MG1363 with a Pcel (llmg_0186)up-mutation An integration of IS905 into a gene coding for a transcriptional repressor led to activation of the repressed gene cluster coding for a plant sugar utilization pathway. The strain is further characterized using DNA MicroArrays.

DESIGN
Cellobiose-positive derivatives of L. lactis MG1363ΔcelBΔptcCΔ0963 grown in M17-cel to mid-exponential phase. Two strains with either IS905 or gfp integration in llmg_1239 were compared to the original strain.

PLATFORM
GPL23996 Agilent-072274 MG1363_ncRNA [ACCESSION_STRING version]
