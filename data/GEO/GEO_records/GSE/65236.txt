TITLE
Plasma profiling of miRNAs in mouse model of osteosarcoma.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the primary bone tumor in children and young adults.  Currently, there are no reliable, non-invasive biological markers to detect the presence or progression of disease, assess therapy response, or provide upfront prognostic insights. Using a qPCR-based platform that analyzes more than 750 miRNAs, we analyzed control and diseased-associated plasma from a genetically engineered mouse model of OS to identify a profile of four plasma miRNAs.

DESIGN
Plasma from mice with OS were profiled for miRNAs and compared with the profile of plasma from disease-free mice
