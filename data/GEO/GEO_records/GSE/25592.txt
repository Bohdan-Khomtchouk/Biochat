TITLE
Effect of polyglutamine expanded TBP on microRNA expression in Neuro2A cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study was carried out to identify changes in expression of microRNAs in Neuro2A cells transfected with TATA binding protein (TBP) containing a polyglutamine expansion (59 glutamine-59Q) compared to normal TBP.

DESIGN
Neuro2A cells were transfected in triplicate with either 16Q-TBP-GFP fusion or 59Q TBP-GFP Fusion and total RNA collected at 24 hours, 36 hours and 60 hours post-transfection.  Each sample was subjected to microRNA microarray analysis as per manufacturer's (Agilent) instructions.
