TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression profiles in colorectal cancer cells treated with boswellic acids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of boswellic acids-mediated gene regulation. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that boswellic acids up-regulate some subset of genes in part thorough demethylation of those promotor regions. Results provide important information on boswellic acids-mediated anti-cancer effects in human colon cancer.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from the human colorectal cancer SW48 cells treated with DMSO alone or acetyl-11-keto-Î²-boswellic acid (AKBA).
