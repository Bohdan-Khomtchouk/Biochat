TITLE
Npas4-regulated genes in mouse hippocampal neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we performed a  DNA microarray experiment to identify activity-regulated genes that are misregulated in the absence of Npas4. Keywords: Primary neuron culture, depolarization, activity-dependent, Npas4

DESIGN
We infected mouse hippocampal neurons with lentivirus expressing Npas4-RNAi or control-RNAi @ 3 DIV and depolarized the neurons @ 8 DIV with 50 mM of KCl for 0, 1, 3 or 6 hours. Neurons were lysed, mRNA isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays. Data were collected from 3 independent experiments.
