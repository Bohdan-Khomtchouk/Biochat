TITLE
Differentiational potency of induced pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells with the low potency (strain 20D17) compared to control iPS cells with the normal potency (strain 38C2).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: iPS cells strain 20D17 vs. control iPS cells strain 38C2. Biological replicates: 2 strain 20D17, 2 strain 38C2, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
