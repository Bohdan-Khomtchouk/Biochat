TITLE
4sU metabolic labeled transcripts in 65 YRI LCLs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Noncoding variants play a central role in the genetics of complex traits, but we still lack a full description of the main molecular pathways through which they act. Here we used molecular data to quantify the contribution of cis-acting genetic effects at each major stage of gene regulation from chromatin to proteins, within a population sample of Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). We performed 4sU metabolic labeled transcripts in 65 YRI LCLs to identify genetic variants that affect transcription rates. As expected, we found an important contribution of genetic variation via chromatin, contributing âˆ¼65% of eQTLs (expression Quantitative Trait Loci). The remaining eQTLs, which are not asso- ciated with chromatin-level variation, are highly enriched in transcribed regions, and hence may affect expression through co- or post-transcriptional processes.

DESIGN
International HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria); We adapted the 4sU labelling method from (PMID 21516085). Briefly, cell cultures were grown to log phase in volumes sufficient to yield about 300 ng of 4sU-labeled RNA. Cells were incubated with 4sU for the required length of time (0, 30, or 60 minutes), then washed, pelleted, and frozen. Total RNA was extracted, and 4sU-labeled RNA was separated from total RNA using a bead-based biotin-streptavidin purification protocol. We sequenced metabolic labeled transcripts in 65 YRI LCLs 30 minutes and 60 minutes after incubation.
