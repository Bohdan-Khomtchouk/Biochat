TITLE
Transcriptional program induced by SCL/TAL1 in the megakaryopoietic differentiation from hESCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To deepen the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate megakaryocytic differentiation mediated by SCL, We performed gene expression profiling (GEP) using oligonucleotide microarrays of control (EV) and SCL-overexpressing cells that were undifferentiated or at day 14 of EB differentiation.

DESIGN
We studied the SCL-overexpression-associated transcriptomic changes during megakaryocytic differentiation from hESCs at 14 days.  Two independent experiments were performed.
