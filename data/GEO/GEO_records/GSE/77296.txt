TITLE
Gene expression-based, etiology analysis for Hirschsprung's Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several microRNAs which assosiate with Hirschsprung's disease were screened from 271 differentially expressed microRNAs between pathological changed colon segments of Hirschsprung's Disease and normal colon.These identified miRNAs could be used as diagnostic markers of HSCR segments.

DESIGN
Using microarray technology, we screened colon tissue to detect miRNAs whose expression profiles were altered in HSCR and 271 differentially expressed microRNAs. Several of these differetially expressed microRNAs were found assosited with the etiology of Hirschsprung's Disease which could be used as new diagnostic markers of HSCR segments.
