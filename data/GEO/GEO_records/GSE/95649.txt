TITLE
Mir-132/212 shapes age-dependent transcriptome and is required for binocular matching of orientation preference and depth perception.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNA sequencing and smallRNA sequencing experiments on visual cortex tissues from three groups of animals: wildtype mice postnatal day 10 (P10-WT), wildtype mice postnatal day 28 (P28-WT), and miR-132/212 null mice postnatal day 28 (P28-KO).

DESIGN
The objective of this study was to examine the role of Mir-132/212 in age-dependent transcriptome and binocular matching of orientation preference and depth perception.

PLATFORM
