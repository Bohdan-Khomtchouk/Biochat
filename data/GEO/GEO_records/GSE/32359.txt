TITLE
Transcriptional study of the response of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages to TLR4 stimulation with LPS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of lipid-loaded macrophages in the arterial wall. Intimal macrophages internalize modified lipoproteins such as oxidized LDL (oxLDL) through scavenger receptors, leading to storage of excess cholesteryl esters in lipid bodies and a " foam cell " phenotype. In addition, stimulation of macrophage Toll-like receptors (TLRs) has been shown to promote lipid body proliferation. We investigated the possibility that there are transcriptional regulators that are common to both pathways for stimulating foam cell formation (modified lipoproteins and TLR stimulation), and identified the transcription factor ATF3 as a candidate regulator. In this specific microarray experiment, we studied the transcriptional response of murine macrophages to stimulation with the TLR4 agonist, LPS. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from C57BL/6J mice were incubated in the presence or absence of LPS for 4 h, and then transcriptionally profiled using the Affymetrix Mouse Exon Array 1.0 ST. The goal was to study the pattern of transcript-level differential expression between the unstimulated and LPS-stimulated cells.

DESIGN
Three female mice (strain C57BL/6J) were sacrificed at 8-12 weeks of age, and macrophages were derived from the femoral bone marrow using rhM-CSF. On day six, macrophages were divided into two treatment groups per animal, for a total of six samples. LPS was introduced into the medium for three samples (one from each animal) at 10 ng/mL on day seven, and after 4 h of incubation, RNA was isolated using Trizol. Labeled cRNA derived from the RNA samples was hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Exon Array 1.0 ST GeneChips.  Microarray data were processed using transcript-level probesets, and are in log2 scale.
