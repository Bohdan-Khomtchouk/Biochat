TITLE
Gene expression in CD4 memory T cell responses with age

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
With increasing age, the ability of the immune system to protect against recurring infections or to control chronic infections erodes. The objective of the current  study was to identify gene expression signatures in elderly CD4 T cell responses

DESIGN
VÎ²2+ CD4 memory T cells from four 20-35 and four 70-75 year-old individuals were stimulated with toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) presented by myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) derived from young adults. Gene expression was examined at 16, 40 and 72 h after stimulation using Affymetrix arrays.
