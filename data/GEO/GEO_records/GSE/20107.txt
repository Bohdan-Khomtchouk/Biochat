TITLE
Phenotypic plasticity in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum: miRNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Acyrthosiphon pisum

SUMMARY
Bioinformatic prediction, deep sequencing of microRNA and expression analysis during phenotypic plasticity in the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum We developed high throughput Solexa sequencing and bioinformatic analyses of the genome of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum in order to identify the first miRNAs from a hemipteran insect. By combining these methods we identified 155 miRNAs including 56 conserved and 99 new miRNAs. Moreover, we investigated the regulation of these miRNAs in different alternative morphs of the pea aphid by analysing the expression of miRNAs across the switch of reproduction mode.

DESIGN
deep sequencing of small RNAs from parthenogenetic Acyrthosiphon pisum
