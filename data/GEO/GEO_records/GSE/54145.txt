TITLE
Deep sequencing identifies small molecule modulated microRNAs in the J1 mESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Many small molecular compounds reported were involved in improving reprogramming efficiency during inducing pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or maintain a blastocyst-like state in embryonic stem cells (ESC), including BIO, CHIR99021 (CHIR), and vitamin C et al. However, the knowledge about these small molecules regulating miRNAs in ESC was limited. To understand the role of miRNAs during small molecules induced ESC maintenance and gain an insight how these small molecules regulates miRNAs expression; we performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 under the compounds treatment. Retinoic acid (RA), a stimulus molecule for cellular differentiation, is set as negative control. The data show the miRNAs regulated by BIO, CHIR, vitamin C and RA.

DESIGN
J1 mESCs maintained in medium containing 1000 U/mL LIF and supplemented with BIO, CHIR99021, vitamin C or RA for 24 hours, J1 treated with DMSO or ddH2O were set as control of BIO, CHIR99021, RA and vitamin C respectively. Then total RNA was extracted for analysis.
