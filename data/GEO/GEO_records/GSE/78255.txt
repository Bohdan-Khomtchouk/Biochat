TITLE
Gene expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and mutator (Δ mutS) evolved for 940 generations in LB with and without sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (0.05µg/ml)

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Gene expression of P. aerruginosa changes after short-term exposure to ciprofloxacin at sub-inhibitory concentrations but the effect of long-term exposure which select for the most fitted subpopulations is not known. We used microarrays to investigate the changes in gene expression of P.aeruginosa PAO1 and mutator (Δ mutS) after long-term evolution (94 daily passages) in LB in the presence and absence of ciprofloxacin

DESIGN
Three different colonies from the ancestral populations of PAO1 and mutator (Δ mutS) as well as from the evolved populations (day 94) of each of the three lineages (A;B;C) in the presence or absence of ciprofloxacin at a concentration of 0.05 µg/ml were used for overnight cultures in LB and total RNA was extracted at OD600nm=1 and hybridized on P. aeruginosa Affymetrix chip.
