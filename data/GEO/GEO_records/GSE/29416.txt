TITLE
Modulation of growth and angiogenesis of OSCC cells with Sal B

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we used in vitro approaches to investigate whether it has any inhibitory properties on OSCC cells. We also tried to understand the possible mechanisms of Sal B on this type of malignancy with respect to angiogenesis.

DESIGN
2 OSCC cell lines were treated with 100ug/ml Sal B for 48hours. cDNAmicroarray was used to evaluated the expressions of 96 genes known to be involving in modulating the biological process of angiogenesis.
