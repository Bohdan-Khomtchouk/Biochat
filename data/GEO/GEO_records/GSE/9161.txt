TITLE
Expression profiling of cyclin D1 splice variants cyclin D1a and D1b in mouse 3T3 cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cyclin D1 is an important cell cycle regulator but in cancer its overexpression also increases cellular migration mediated by p27KIP1 stabilization and RhoA inhibition. Recently, a common polymorphism at the exon 4-intron 4 boundary of the human cyclin D1 gene within a splice donor region was associated with an altered risk of developing cancer. Altered RNA splicing caused by this polymorphism gives rise to a variant cyclin D1 isoform termed cyclin D1b, which has the same N-terminus as the canonical cyclin D1a isoform but a distinct C-terminus. Analysis was performed of mouse cyclin D1 knockout 3T3 cells infected with splice variants of cyclin D1. 3T3 cells transduced with retroviral vectors expressing each cyclin D1 isoform were processed for expression analysis. Keywords: Cancer associated risk factor

DESIGN
Three Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts cell lines obtained from littermate cyclin D1 knockout E14 embyos were serial passaged to obtain cyclin D1 knockout (D1KO) 3T3 cells. Each of the D1KO 3T3 cell lines were infected using the Murine Stem Cell Virus (MSCV) expressing splice variants of cyclin D1; cyclin D1a/ cyclin D1b or GFP control to give triplicate sample sets.  7 days post infection total RNA from each sample was extracted using Trizol and further purified using Qiagenâ€™s RNeasy Kit. Preparation of biotinylated cRNA and hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix mouse genome genechip 430 2.0) were performed in conjuction with Pestell lab and the Nucleic Acid Core Facility at Thomas Jefferson University. Mouse 430 2.0 genechip contains 39,000 transcripts. Gene chips were scanned and analyzed using Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithm.
