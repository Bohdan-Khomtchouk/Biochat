TITLE
Expression profiling of cyclin D1 splice variants cyclin D1a and D1b in mouse 3T3 cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cyclin D1 is an important cell cycle regulator but in cancer its overexpression also increases cellular migration mediated by p27KIP1 stabilization and RhoA inhibition. Recently, a common polymorphism at the exon 4-intron 4 boundary of the human cyclin D1 gene within a splice donor region was associated with an altered risk of developing cancer. Altered RNA splicing caused by this polymorphism gives rise to a variant cyclin D1 isoform termed cyclin D1b, which has the same N-terminus as the canonical cyclin D1a isoform but a distinct C-terminus. Analysis was performed of mouse cyclin D1 knockout 3T3 cells infected with splice variants of cyclin D1. 3T3 cells transduced with retroviral vectors expressing each cyclin D1 isoform were processed for expression analysis.
