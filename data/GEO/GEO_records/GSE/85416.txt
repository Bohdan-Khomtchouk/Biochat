TITLE
Systematic identification and characterization of long non-coding RNAs in zebrafish through RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from embryonic heart of zebrafish larvae 4 days post fertilization, adult heart of 6-month-old WIK fish, and adult muscle of adult fish consisting of both fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA and long noncoding RNA levels in embryonic heart, adult heart, and adult muscle tissues
