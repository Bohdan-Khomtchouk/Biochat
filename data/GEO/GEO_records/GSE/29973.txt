TITLE
Transcriptional responses of Fusarium graminearum to plant cell wall substrates

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
We report a complete transcriptomic study of Fusarium graminearum in response to glucose, cellulose, xylan and cell wall fragments with a whole genome microarray from febit.

DESIGN
Fusarium graminearum was cultured at 25 Â°C on minimal M3 medium with glucose, birch wood xylan, carboxy methyl cellulose or hop cell wall as sole carbon source at a concentration of 10 g/L. Microarray experiments were achieved with a Geniom device (febit biomed, Germany).  Each of the four tested condition was tested with two biological and two technical replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL13721 Fusarium graminearum febit in situ oligonucleotide array
