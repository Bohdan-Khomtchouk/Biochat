TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Day 30 embryos from diet-restricted sows

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In our previous sow study, two subpopulations of feed-restricted sows (60% of anticipated feed intake) were identified: ‘Restrict (Risk)’ that mobilized higher levels of body tissue stores ( > 40MJ ME day-1) compared to ‘Restrict (Non-Risk)’ sows (Patterson et al. Reprod. Fert. Deveopl., 2011, 23, 889-898) and although Risk sows maintain higher litter growth in the weaned litter, this was at the expense of lower embryonic weight in their subsequent litter compared with Non-Risk sows. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms involved, we investigated the gene expression profiles of embryos from Risk and Non-Risk litters in this experiment.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Risk vs Non Risk. Biological replicates: 20 risk, 20non-risk, independently compared to reference (all the 80 samples pooled from ch 1).

PLATFORM
GPL18148 Agilent-031068 EmbryoGene Porcine Array V.1 (EMPV1; Probe Name version)
