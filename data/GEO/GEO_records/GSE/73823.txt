Genetic code expansion in stable cell lines enables encoded chromatin modification

SUMMARY
Genetically encoded unnatural amino acids provide powerful strategies for  modulating the molecular functions of proteins in mammalian cells. However this  approach has not been coupled to genome-wide measurements, because efficient  unnatural amino acid incorporation is limited to readily transfectable cells and  leads to very heterogeneous expression. We demonstrate that rapid piggybac  integration of the orthogonal pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylS)/tRNAPyl  CUA pair  (and its derivatives) into the mammalian genome enables efficient, homogeneous  unnatural amino acid incorporation into target proteins in diverse cells, and we  reveal the distinct transcriptional responses of ES cells and MEFs to amber  suppression. Genetically encoding NÎµ-acetyl-lysine in place of six lysine residues in  histone H3, that are known to be post-translationally acetylated, enables deposition  of pre-acetylated histones into cellular chromatin, via a synthetic pathway that is  orthogonal to enzymatic modification, allowing us to determine the consequences of  acetylation at specific amino acids in histones on gene expression.
