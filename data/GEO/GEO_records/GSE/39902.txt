TITLE
Role of TAZ as mediator of Wnt signaling (MII)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of TAZ downstream of APC and beta-catenin in mammary epithelial cells cells, we compared the expression profiles of MCF10-T1k (MII) cells transfected with siControl, siAPC, siAPC+siTAZ, sibeta-catenin, or sibeta-catenin+siTAZ. Keywords: expression profiling by array

DESIGN
We collected RNA from MII cells transfected with siControl, siAPC, siAPC+siTAZ, sibeta-catenin, or sibeta-catenin+siTAZ. Cells were left untreated in normal culturing conditions before harvesting. Samples were then processed for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Four biological replicas (A, B, C, D) were used for each of the 5 conditions (1: siControl, control cells; 2: siAPC cells; 3: siAPC+siTAZ cells; 4: sibeta-catenin (sibcat) cells; 5: sibeta-catenin+siTAZ) for a total of 20 samples.
