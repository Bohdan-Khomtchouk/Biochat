TITLE
Mapping Nucleosome positions in WT and delta isw2 cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To map nucleosome positions in WT and delta isw2 cells Keywords: Nucleosomal DNA hybridization

DESIGN
All samples are biological replicates. Nucleosome positions were defined by comparing the hybridization signal of full length (FL) nucleosomal DNA to that of fragmented (Frag) nucleosomal DNA.
