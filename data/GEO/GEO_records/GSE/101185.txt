TITLE
VTA and NAC labeled ribosome from mPFC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Projection-dependent ribosome profling from mouse mPFC. Ribosome from NAC- and VTA- projecting mPFC cells were immunoprecipited using GFP-trap (Chromotech). Translating mRNA was isolated and analyzed

DESIGN
Cre-dependent ribosome TRAP mice were injected with CAV2-Cre in NAC and VTA. Projection-dependent ribosome labeling was enabled by isolating mPFC. Ribosome was genetically tagged with GFP in the activated cells and could be immunologically purified.
