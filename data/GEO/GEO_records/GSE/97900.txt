TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of grapevine (Vitis vinifera cv Cabernet Sauvignon) woody stems and asymptomatic leaves during a time course of infection by Neofusicoccum parvum

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing determined the genome-wide patterns of expression of grape and N. parvum genes in stem (local) and leaf (distal) tissues during an extensive interaction time course.

DESIGN
Potted V. vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon clone FPS 19 plants were inoculated with N. parvum UCD646So mycelia (ATCC number: MYA-3706). Stems and leaves were collected at seven time points: 0 hour post-inoculation (hpi), 3 hpi, 24 hpi, 2 weeks post-inoculation (wpi), 6 wpi, 8 wpi, and 12 wpi. Three biological replicates, corresponding to a pool of leaves from four plants for the distal sampling and to individual stems (-1 cm) in the case of the local sampling, were used for RNA extraction.
