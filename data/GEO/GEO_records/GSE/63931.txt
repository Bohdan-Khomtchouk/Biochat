TITLE
Transcription profiling of cutaneous lesions caused by Leishmania braziliensis and normal skin.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was carried out to evaluate the changes that occur in the skin after the development of cutaneous leishmaniasis, aiming at a comprehensive understanding of immune pathways and biological functions activated in lesions caused by L. braziliensis.

DESIGN
This analysis was conducted on 8 skin ulcers from patients infected with L. braziliensis. The patients selected for the gene expression analysis had recent L. braziliensis infection that had not yet been treated. 8 controls samples are skin biopsies from healthy donors (non-infected).
