TITLE
The effect on gene expression by shRNA-58335

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To evaluate the effect on gene expression by shRNA-58335, we evaluated gene expression by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in Huh-7 cells stably expressing shRNA-58335 or control shRNA after infection with adenovirus expressing p53 (Ad-p53) or LacZ (Ad-LacZ).
