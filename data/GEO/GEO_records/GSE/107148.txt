TITLE
DNA methylation state is associated with the formation of loops and links in hematopoietic stem cells [HiC]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present the high resolution HiC study of genome folding in primary cells, specifically hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We investigated the relationship of chromosomal contacts with other epigenetic marks, particularly DNA methylation and histone modifications which is known to be important for appropriate stem cell differentiation.

DESIGN
We used in situ Hi-C to probe relationship of chromosomal contacts and epigenetic modification.
