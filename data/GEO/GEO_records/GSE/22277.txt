TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia [Col-0]: incubated with E. coli vs. Control

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To explore mechanisms involved in the plant-microbe interactions, we proceeded with genome-wide transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis roots incubated with E. coli Bl21 for 24 hours. Control plants did not receive E. coli.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, E. coli vs. Control. Biological replicates: 3 E. coli replicates, 3 control replicates

PLATFORM
GPL12621 Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Probe Name version)
