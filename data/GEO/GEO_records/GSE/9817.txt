TITLE
Global transcriptional profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae treated with dictamnine

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We employed CapitalBio Corporation to investigate the global transcriptional profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  treated with dictamnine. Keywords: response to dictamnine

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae strain L1190 was incubated in a rotary shaker. Subsequently, dictamnine was added to the culture  and DMSO to the control. Then, the yeast cells were further incubated for a certain time and total RNA was extracted by a hot acidic phenol method. The experimental sample and control sample were incorporated and dissolved in  hybridization solution after labelled. Arrays hybridization was preformed in a CapitalBio BioMixerTM II Hybridization Station overnight and washed with two consecutive solutions. Arrays were scanned with a confocal LuxScanTM scanner and the images obtained were then analyzed using LuxScanTM 3.0 software. A space- and intensity-dependent normalization based on a LOWESS program was employed.
