TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of effect of knockdown of GATA2 on AR binding sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study are to compare AR binding activity in LNCaP cells with and without knockdown of GATA2. Methods: LNCaP cells between passage number 32-34 were used for assay. Cells are transfected with GATA2 specific or nonspecific siRNA and ChIP was performed, the ChIP producted was further used to generate library with illumina ChIP-seq kit. Hi-seq 2500 was used for sequencing and the data was analyzed by MACs for peaks. Results: GATA2 knockdown lead to changes of AR binding activity , in most AR binding sites, AR shows decreased bindig activity. Only small percent sites show increased binding. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of the relationship between GATA2 and AR binding in whole genomic DNA.These results demostrate GATA2 play a critical role in AR activity in prostate cancer.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells was used as cell model were treated with specific GATA2 siRNA.Library was sequenced using Illumina HI-seq 2500.
