TITLE
DNA methylation profiles in the retina of AMD patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness in the western world. While genetic studies  have linked both common and rare variants in genes involved in regulation of the complement system to increased risk  of development of AMD, environmental factors, such as smoking and nutrition, can also significantly affect the risk of  developing the disease and the rate of disease progression. Since epigenetics has been implicated in mediating, in part,  the disease risk associated with some environmental factors, we investigated a possible epigenetic contribution to  AMD. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of blood from AMD patients and controls. No differential  methylation site reached genome-wide significance; however, when epigenetic changes in and around known GWASdefined  AMD risk loci were explored, we found small but significant DNA methylation differences in the blood of  neovascular AMD patients near age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2), a top-ranked GWAS locus preferentially  associated with neovascular AMD. The methylation level of one of the CpG sites significantly correlated with the  genotype of the risk SNP rs10490924, suggesting a possible epigenetic mechanism of risk. Integrating genome-wide  DNA methylation analysis of retina samples with and without AMD together with blood samples, we further identified a  consistent, replicable change in DNA methylation in the promoter region of protease serine 50 (PRSS50). These  methylation changes may identify sites in novel genes that are susceptible to non-genetic factors known to contribute  to AMD development and progression.
