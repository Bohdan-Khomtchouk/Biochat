TITLE
Whole genome gene expression profiling in Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL) cells and in Normal CD4+ T-cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HTLV-1 infected individuals stay as carriers for their lifetimes, while the rest of 5% are killed by ATL. ATL leukemogenesis is a complex process involving accumulation of multiple genetic abnormalities in HTLV-1 infected cells. To clarify genetic events underlying ATL leukemogenesis, we conducted comprehensive gene expression profiling in 52 ATL patients  and in 21 healthy volunteers.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples from PBMC of ATL patients (mostly HTLV-1 inefcted CD4+ T-cells) and from CD4+ T-cells from healthy donors were subjected to Cy-3 labeling followed by human whole genome gene expression microarray analyses.
