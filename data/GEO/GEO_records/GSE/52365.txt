TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression profiles in PBHA-treated THP-1 cells after LPS stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using microarray analysis, 219 differentially expressed genes were isolated between the LPS group and LPS/PBHA treatment-group (fold change > or < 1.5). These genes were analyzed by KEGG system to reveal the important issues. The analyses of gene ontology were shown that the genes of the specific classes “Chemokine signaling pathway”, ”Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction”, ”RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway”, ”Leukocyte transendothelial migration”, and “MAPK signaling pathway” showed markedly different patterns between both groups by KEGG analysis system.

DESIGN
In this study presented here, human THP-1 cells were pretreated with only vehicle (resting group), vehicle and LPS  (50 ng/ml), or PBHA (10 μM) and LPS (50 ng/ml). After stimulation, the total cellular RNAs were manipulated for analyses of gene expression.
