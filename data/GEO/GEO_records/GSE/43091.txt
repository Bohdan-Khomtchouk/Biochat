TITLE
Genome-scale methylome profiling of hepatocellular adenomas.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-scale DNA methylation was analyzed in a cohort of 50 hepatocellular adenomas and 4 normal liver tissues. We performed consensus clustering to identify homogeneous tumor clusters, and we characterized DNA methylation changes in tumor subgroups.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from 50 fresh frozen hepatocellular adenomas and 4 normal liver samples were hybridized to Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
