TITLE
IRF4 and Myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using RNA interference to identify IRF4 target genes. Keywords: time series design

DESIGN
Gene expression was analyzed using Lymphochip cDNA spotted arrays. Myeloma cell lines were infected with control (shluc, Cy3) or shIRF4 (Cy5) constructs, and changes in gene expression were monitored over time after induction of the shRNA with doxycyclin.
