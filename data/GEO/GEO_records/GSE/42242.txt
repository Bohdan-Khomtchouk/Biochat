TITLE
SMAD4 regulated through HDAC4 is associated with chemoresistance in MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HDACs play crucial role in epigenetic modulation through deacetylation of histone and non-histone substrates in critical process of normal development and cancer. Moreover, HDAC inhibitors have been considered as new agent by effects such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, anti-angiogenic effects and autophagy and utilized in clinical applications for chemotherapy. we previously reported that HDAC 1, 4, 6 and 8 were higly expressed in MDA-MB-231 than MCF-7 cells and HDAC1, 6 and 8 excepting HDAC4 were associated with invasion that is very important factor in cancer progression. However, HDAC4 did not affect in invasion. To investigate interaction between chemoresistance and HDAC4 expression, we establish stable cells overexpressing HDAC4 in MCF-7 cells. Cells overexpressed HDAC4 were increased cytotoxicity about 5-FU and identified 356 differentially expressed genes using Ilumina array. Based on array result, we selected SMAD4 as a candidate gene related with chemoresistance because SMAD4 was previously reported evaluation of chemoresistance to 5-FU. We purpose that HDAC4 regulated with SMAD4 expression through acetylation in SMAD4 promoter region.  HDAC4 directly bound a part of SMAD4 promoter.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from cells overexpressed HDAC4 cDNA in MCF-7 compared to control cells.
