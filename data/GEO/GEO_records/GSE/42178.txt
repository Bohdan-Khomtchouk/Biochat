TITLE
Affect of liver transcriptome by acute acetaminophen exposure [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the global changes of liver transcriptome after acetaminophen overdose.

DESIGN
To study the global changes of transcriptome in the liver after acetaminophen overdose.  Eight week old female C57BL/6 mice were fasted for 24 hours prior to a single intraperitoneal injection of 350mg/kg of acetaminophen in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (treatment group) or PBS (control group). The mice were euthanized at different time points post exposure; plasma and tissue samples were collected for pathological examination and biochemical analyses.
