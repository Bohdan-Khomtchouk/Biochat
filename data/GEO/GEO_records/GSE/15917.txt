TITLE
Sox9 deficiency effect on mouse mammary gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA from MMTV-Cre;Sox9flox/flox mouse mammary glands were compared to RNA from MMTV-Cre;Sox9+/flox glands. Results indicate that Sox9 regulates several genes that impact ductal morphogenesis in the mammary gland.

DESIGN
The portion of the fourth mammary gland that is proximal to the intra-mammary gland lymph nodes was dissected from four 5-week-old MMTV-Cre;Sox9flox/flox females and four MMTV-Cre;Sox9+/flox females of the same age. Total RNA from each gland was extracted and hybridized to separate Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST chips.
