SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of  hPTTG1-/- HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells comparing hPTTG1-/- HCT116 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1, and with hPTTG1-/- HCT116 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-hPTTG1 plasmid.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, pchyg vs. 7-2 and 18-2 cells. 1 control, 2 different transfected cells.

PLATFORM
