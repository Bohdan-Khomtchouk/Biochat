TITLE
transcriptomic analysis of wild type vs mpk3 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au09-01_mpk mpk Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are key regulators of cell proliferation, differentiation and stress effectors. The core of the MAP kinase signal transduction cascade is composed of a three-kinase module consisting of a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), and a MAP kinase (MAPK). The signaling pathway is activated upon stimulation by a phosphorylation cascade.

DESIGN
2 dye-swap - wild type vs mutants
