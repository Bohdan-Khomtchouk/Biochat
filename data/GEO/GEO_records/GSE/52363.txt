TITLE
Expression data from glioblastoma cells after ZFHX4 or CHD4 suppression.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ZFHX4 and CHD4 suppression independently shift tumor initiating cells out of a stem like state and toward a differentiated morphology. After gene suppression via transduction of a lentivirally mediated shRNA construct, RNA was extracted 3 and 5 days later and was hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted 3 and 5 days after shRNA transduction of 0308 TICs, for 3 (for CHD4) or 5 (ZFHX4) independent experiments. Complementary RNA synthesis and hybridization/scanning of U133 plus 2.0 microarrays using GeneChip products (Affymetrix) was done as described in the GeneChip manual.
