TITLE
Transcriptome of 4 developmental stages of Colletotrichum higginsianum during infection of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Colletotrichum higginsianum

SUMMARY
Transcriptome of 4 developmental stages of Colletotrichum higginsianum during infection of Arabidopsis thaliana

DESIGN
3 biological replicates per stage. The four stages are : in vitro apressoria (VA), penetrating apressoria (AP), Biotrophic hyphea from the biotrophic phase (BH) and the switch from biotrophic hyphea to necrotrophic phase(SW). Each biological replicate of the last three stages, the in planta stages, was two fold deeper due to plant contamination (Arabidopsis thaliana)
