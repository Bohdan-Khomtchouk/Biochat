TITLE
Changes in expression of small non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, in response to stress in C. elegans

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
To investigate the contribution of small non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, to stress response in C. elegans, we examined their expression changes using Illumina deep-sequencing technology. Stress conditions we examined include heat shock, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA-14) and L1 arrest. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
