TITLE
Time-course leaf expression data from Populus deltoides

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
We conducted micro-array analysis to quantify the global transcriptome variations in leaves through the course of the year allowing for identification of changing developmental signals. We used RNA samples from pre-formed and mature leaves in the upper crown of a sexually mature Populus deltoides tree 2 hours after sunrise.
