TITLE
Time-course leaf expression data from Populus deltoides

ORGANISM
Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
We conducted micro-array analysis to quantify the global transcriptome variations in leaves through the course of the year allowing for identification of changing developmental signals. We used RNA samples from pre-formed and mature leaves in the upper crown of a sexually mature Populus deltoides tree 2 hours after sunrise.

DESIGN
Three independent samples of leaf/pre-formed leaf tissues were collected from the upper crown of a single sexually mature tree. RNA was extracted from tissues and hybridized on Affymetrix Genechip Poplar Genome Array. Tissues represented two batches (batch 1 from 2005 and batch 2 from 2006).  Therefore, March samples were used to normalize the other month samples within the same batch.
