TITLE
Early depletion of primordial germ cells in zebrafish promotes testis formation

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The requirement for primordial germ cells (PGCs) during sexual differentiation is variable among vertebrates. It has been shown that in zebrafish complete loss of PGCs in the embryos causes exclusive male development. Further, transplantation of a single PGC into a germline deficient zebrafish embryos generates male exclusively, suggesting PGC number might be important for the ovarian fate.To explore how PGC number might regulate sexual development in zebrafish, we experimentally manipulated its number by injecting dnd MO into embryos to generate fish containing a spectrum of PGC number. The experiment was designed to compare transcriptomes between the developing trunk regions of wild type and dnd morphants at different developmental stages.

DESIGN
The dnd MO was microinjected into one cell stage embryos to generate zebrafish with a range of PGC numbers. Transcriptomes of developing trunk regions of wild type and dnd morphants at 14 dpf and 22 dpf were analyzed.
