TITLE
Gene expression analysis in renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumors express varying gene profiles, dependent on VHL and HIF status, as well as other events. Here we analyzed a series of RCC tumors for HIF-alpha expression and VHL genotype, in relation to overal gene expression profiles. Keywords: Patient sample study

DESIGN
RNA from 12 RCC tumors was hybridized against the Perou lab RNA standard for gene expression analysis. DNA was genotyped for VHL mutation status, and tumor sections were stained for HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha expression.
