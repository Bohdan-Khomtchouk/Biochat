TITLE
RNA profiling in lungs of WT, IFN-g-/- and IL-4-/- mice before and after Mycoplasma pulmonis infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Full title: Mouse Inflammatory Cytokines and Receptors Microarray-RNA profiling in lungs of WT, IFN-g-/- and IL-4-/- mice before and after Mycoplasma pulmonis infection RNA profiling of inflammatory chemokines, cytokines and receptors in lungs of 4-6 week old wild-type, IFN-g-/- and IL-4-/- BALB/cJ mice before and after 14-day Mycoplasma pulmonis infection

DESIGN
RNA pooled from lungs of each group- Uninfected and Infected; Experiment performed twice. With 3 mice in each of the uninfected and infected groups in the first experiment and 4 mice in each group in the second experiment; comparison Mycoplasma infected  vs. uninfected mice within each strain of mice
