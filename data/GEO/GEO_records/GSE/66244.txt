TITLE
Identification of expresion patterns after treatment with GC/RA and combination with AZA/SAHA in MYC amplified and BRG1 mutant lung cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To development our gene expression approach , we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes potentialy regulated by the treatment with glucocorticoids (GC) and retinoic acid (RA) alone and combined with AZA/SAHA and the relationship of these features with the status of BRG1 and MYC in lung cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
MYC amplified cell lines and BRG1 mutant cell lines were treated with glucocorticoids (GC) and retinoic acid (RA) alone and combined with AZA/SAHA and their expression was then measured
