TITLE
Genes regulated after transient knock-down of Pirin in WM-266 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pirin (PIR) is a putative transcriptional regulator abundantly expressed in melanocytes and in a subset of primary and metastatic melanomas. Ablation of PIR in the melanoma cell lines results in induction of a senescence-like phenotype. Keywords: Transcriptional regulation, knock-down using siRNA

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression profiles of WM-266.4 metastatic melanoma cells after knock-down of PIR, which was achieved using a pool of four PIR-siRNA duplexes (siPIR). A pool of four non-targeting siRNA duplexes was used as control of off-target transcriptional effects (siCTR). Cells that underwent transfection with no oligonucleotides (oligofectamine only) were also included to measure all non-specific effects (NO cells). For each sample, an RNA pool was obtained by mixing equal quantities of total RNA from each of three independent RNA extractions. Each biotin-labeled target was hybridized to two GeneChip HG-U133 Plus v.2 arrays.
