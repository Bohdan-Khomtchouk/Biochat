TITLE
Expression analysis of liver tissues from LPS or LPS/GalN treated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in the liver tissue from LPS/GalN treated mice, compared to LPS treated mice Treatment of mice with LPS and the liver-specific transcriptional inhibitor D-(+)-galactosamine (GalN) induces fatal hepatitis, which is mediated by TNFα and characterized by massive hepatic apoptosis. Previous studies suggest that GalN increases the sensitivity to LPS/TNFα probably by blocking the transcription of protective factors, but the identity of most of these factors is still unclear. This analysis is performed to indentify these protective factors.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA extracted from liver tissues of three separate LPS treated mice and three separate LPS/GalN treated mice. Each chip measures the expression level of 44,170 genes from C57 BL/6 mice with three 60-mer probe pairs per gene.
