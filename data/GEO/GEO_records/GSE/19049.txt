TITLE
Gene expression profiles after infection of zebrafish with viral haemorrhagic septicemia rhabdovirus (VHSV)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We describe for the first time transcripts induced after infection of zebrafish with viral haemorrhagic septicemia rhabdovirus (VHSV). Two days after infection, differentially expressed transcript levels from selected immune-related zebrafish genes were studied in both fins and internal organs (pooled spleen, head kidney and liver).

DESIGN
VHSV-induced gene expression in zebrafish fins and organs was measured at 2 days after infection.  Four independent experiments were performed for each treatment and their corresponding controls.
