TITLE
Gene Expression-Based High Throughput Screening: HL-60 Cell Treatment with Candidate Compounds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a general approach to small molecule library screening called GE-HTS (Gene Expression-Based High Throughput Screening) in which a gene expression signature is used as a surrogate for cellular states and applied it to the identification of compounds inducing the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. In screening 1,739 compounds, we prioritized 15 candidate compounds (2 were already confirmed in the literature). We next evaluated the 13 remaining compounds.  Eight reliably induced the differentiation signature, and furthermore yielded functional evidence of bona fide differentiation. This data set contains HL-60 cells treated in replicates of 3 with the original 13 selected candidates. It also contains 6 untreated, 6 DMSO treated, 3 ATRA treated, 3 PMA treated, and 3 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treated HL-60 controls. In addition, it contains 3 neutrophil and 3 monocyte samples from distinct normal human donors and 9 primary patient AML samples. This data set was used to evaluate the whole genome effects of the candidate compounds on HL-60 cells.
