TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of estradiol-inducible overexpression of transcription factor WRKY75 in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Sequence-specific transcription factor WRKY75 is highly responsive to reactive oxygen species on transcriptional level in the rosettes of Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, it acts in developmental responses, acquisition of nutrients, and in stress responses. In the root, WRKY75 is a repressor of root hair formation, it regulates the phosphate starvation response, and the response to certain pathogens. In order to find the target genes of WRKY75, the effects of estradiol-inducible overexpression of WRKY75 on transcriptome was studied using RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Two independent inducible WRKY75 overexpressor lines (N2102362 and N2102363) were treated with estradiol for 3 hours and four biological replicates, five plant per replicate, were used for RNA-seq. As a control, wild type Col-0 was treated with estradiol or water for 3 hours and three biological replicates, five plant per replicate, were used for RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
