TITLE
Identification of genes involved in the establishment of plant-microorganism interactions

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
affy_pathogen_medicago - In compatible interaction between plants and biotrophic microorganisms, neoformation of organs occurs to ensure an efficient relationship between both partners. During the interaction between Medicago truncatula and Sinorhizobium meliloti, bacteria induce the development of root nodule with a permanent meristem, and chronically infect plant cells from zone II before differentiating into atmospheric nitrogen fixing bacteroids. M. truncatula is also plant host for root-knot nematodes, such as Meloidogyne incognita. During this compatible pathogenic interaction, root-knot nematodes induce redifferenciation of root cells from the vascular cylinder into specialized feeding cells called “giant cells”. Hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the surrounding cells lead to the formation of typical root galls. This phenomenon invokes host pathways in common with those necessary for nitrogen-nodule formation, suggesting that nematode and rhizobia exploit a relative common strategy of plant cell infection at the cellular and molecular levels. In order to highlight key genes involved in gall and nodule developments, parallel laser microdissection of giant cells from galls and cells from zone II of nodules, followed by transcriptomic analysis, were performed. The RNA pools were extracted from these cells, amplified and used for transcriptomic studies with M. truncatula Affymetrix DNA chips. Keywords: organ comparison
