TITLE
Novel functional microRNAs from virus-free and infected Vitis vinifera plants under water stress.

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Size fractionated small RNA from total RNA extracts of Vitis vinifera leaves  were ligated to adapters, purified again and reverse transcribed. After PCR amplification the sample was subjected to Illumina high throughput pyrosequencing. The kit used is TrueSeq Small RNA kit Please see www.illumina.com for details of the sequencing technology.

DESIGN
Short RNA fractionation and characterization

PLATFORM
GPL18580 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Vitis vinifera)
