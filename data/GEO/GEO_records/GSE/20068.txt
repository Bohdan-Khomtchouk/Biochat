TITLE
p27 binds to promoters of multiple genes leading to their repression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of the cyclin-cdk inhibitor p27 in tumorigenesis is still a controversial matter. We demonstrate here that p27 negatively regulates transcription of a number of genes (p27-target genes) involved in key cellular functions as RNA processing, translation, respiration and cell proliferation.

DESIGN
Crosslinked chromatin from quiescent NIH3T3 cells was sonicated, incubated overnight with the rabbit anti-p27 and IgG antibodies as control
