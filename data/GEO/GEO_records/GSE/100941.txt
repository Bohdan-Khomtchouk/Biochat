TITLE
Cerebellar granule cell replenishment postinjury by adaptive reprogramming of Nestin+ progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of RNA-sequencing for high-throughput profiling of gene expression in Nestin expressing cells of P5 mouse cerebellum Non-Irradiated or Irradiated at P1. By using the Nes-CFP reporter mouse line, we isolated Nes-CFP positive cells of P5 cerebellum to compare the transcriptomes between Nes-CFP positive cells from Non-irradiated cerebellum and cerebellum irradiated at P1.

DESIGN
The mRNA profiles of Nestin expressing cells in P5 Non-Irradiated mouse cerebellum and P5 Irradiated mouse cerebellum were generated by RNA-sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500.

PLATFORM
