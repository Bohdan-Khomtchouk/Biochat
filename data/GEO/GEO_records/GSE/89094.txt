TITLE
Effect of lipopolysachharide (LPS) on the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the mouse oviduct

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our objective was to determine the effect of intraperitoneal (IP) administration of E. Coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the acute expression of miRNAs in the mouse oviduct

DESIGN
On the day of estrus, 6-8 week old CD1 mice were treated IP with 0 (control), 2 µg (low dose) or 10 µg (high dose) of LPS from E. Coli serotype 055:B5 in 100 μL PBS.  Mice were killed 24 h later and the oviducts collected for determination of the effect of treatment on miRNAs (n=4/treatment) using the nCounter Mouse v.1.5 miRNA Expression Assay (Nanostring Technologies).  The effect of LPS on the expression of miRNAs was evaluated by one-way ANOVA and treatment means of differentially expressed miRNA (P < 0.05) were separated using a post-hoc LSD test.
