TITLE
RNA-sequencing of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 wildtype and fur perR mutant

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
We report the use of RNA-seq analysis for the determination of RPKM transcript levels in wildtype and fur perR mutant of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168. This allows for comparison of gene expression levels.

DESIGN
Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 wildtype and fur perR mutant were grown to late log phase, RNA was purified and used for RNA-sequencing by Illumina HiSeq sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL17549 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Campylobacter jejuni)
