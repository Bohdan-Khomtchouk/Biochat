ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Frequent deletion of the CDKN2A locus in chordoma: analysis of chromosomal imbalances using array comparative genomic hybridization DNA copy number analysis of 21 fresh frozen chordoma biopsies, and the respective relapse in four of them, using 32k and 1Mb array CGH. All cases showed copy number alterations and primarily deletions of chromosomal regions were found. Particularly, the CDKN2A and CDKN2B loci in 9p21 were homo- or heterozygously lost in 70% of the tumors. Keywords: chordoma, array comparative genomic hybridization
