TITLE
Comparison of the genomic structures and transcription between S. cerevisiae strains ZTW1 and ZGR3

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To determine how does genomic structural variation changed the phenotypes of yeast. aCGH and RNA-Seq were performed to reveal the differeces in the genomic structures and transcription of ZTW1 and ZGR3. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
In the aCGH experiment, strain BYZ1 (S288c background) was used as the control. In the RNA-Seq experiment, the total RNA from three independent cultured cells of each yeast strain was extracted. Three cDNA libraries of one sample were mixed before sequencing.
