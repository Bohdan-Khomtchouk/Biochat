TITLE
Expression profile after stable HIF-1a inhibition in gastric cancer cells under normoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Based on the results of numerous clinical and preclinical analyses, the transcription factor HIF-1a has been identified as an important tumor-promoting factor and is considered to be an attractive target for cancer therapy. To further deconstruct the molecular nature of HIF-1a’s role in tumorigenesis, we have applied lentiviral shRNA transduction to establish HIF-1a-deficient gastric cancer cells. Interestingly, functional analyses failed to show a significant growth defect of HIF-1a-deficient gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. These observations led us to propose that stable inactivation of HIF-1a resulted in efficient compensation enabling cell growth and, ultimately, tumor progression in a HIF-1a-independent manner. To better understand the mechanisms that control this compensation, we performed transcriptomics of control (“scrambled” (SCR)) and HIF-1a-deficient (HIF) gastric cancer cells. Analysis of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1a)-deficient gastric cancer cells under normoxia. The transcription factor HIF-1a is a key regulator of oxygen homeostasis and has been identified as an important tumor-promoting factor. Results provide insight into the role of HIF-1a in gastric carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
Gastric cancer AGS cells were lentiviral and stably transduced with a small hairpin RNA targeting human HIF-1a or a control shRNA. RNA was extracted from control and HIF-1a-deficient cells. Each cell line was analyzed in triplicate for a total of six samples.
