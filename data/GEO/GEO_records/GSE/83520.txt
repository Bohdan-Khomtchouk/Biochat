TITLE
Genome-wide expression screening discloses long noncoding RNAs involved in thyroid carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Context: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate pathological processes, yet their potential roles in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) are poorly understood. Objective: To profile transcriptionally dysregulated lncRNAs in PTC and identify lncRNAs associated with clinicopathological characteristics.

DESIGN
We performed RNA sequencing of 12 paired PTC tumors and matched noncancerous tissues and correlated the expression of lncRNAs with clinical parameters.
