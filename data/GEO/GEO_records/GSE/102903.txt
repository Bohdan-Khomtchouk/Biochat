TITLE
Neuronal EphB1 induces STAT3 activation in astrocytes, which is impaired in ALS models [Mm]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Astrocyte  responses to neuronal injury may be beneficial or detrimental to neuronal recovery, but the mechanism that determines these different responses are poorly understood. Transcriptional analysis showed that EphB1 induces a protective inflammatory signature in astrocytes, which is distinct from the response evoked by interleukin (IL)-6, which is known to have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. We demonstrate that this beneficial EphB1 induced signaling pathway is disrupted in astrocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles of purified  murine wildtype astrocyte cultures (untreated and treated with IL-6 or EphB1).
