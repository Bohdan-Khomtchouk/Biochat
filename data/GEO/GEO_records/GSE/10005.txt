TITLE
Circadian regulation of a limited set of microRNAs in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used a microarray platform to survey the daily levels of 78 D. melanogaster miRNAs in adult heads of wildtype control flies and the arrhythmic clock mutant cyc01.  At least 2 miRNAs were identified that showed robust daily abundance changes in control flies but not the cyc01 mutant. Keywords: microRNA, Circadian regulation
