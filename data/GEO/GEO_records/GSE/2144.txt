TITLE
Gene induction by low pH in oesophageal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression analysis of oesophageal cells stimulated with a low pH environment. Study designed to identify pathways involved in progression of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease through Barrett's oesophagus to adenocarcinoma. Identified many subsets of genes with involvement in pathogenesis. Keywords = GORD Keywords = Barrett's Oesophagus Keywords = Oesopageal Adenocarcinoma. Keywords: time-course
