TITLE
Dynamic gene regulatory networks of human myeloid differentiation [ATAC-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We utilize gene expression and open chromatin footprinting data to build a gene regulatory network of key transcription factors that capture the cell and time-specific regulatory programs specified during human myeloid differentiation.

DESIGN
ATAC-seq profiling of undifferentiated HL-60, differentiating macrophage, neutrophil, monocyte, and monocyte-derived macrophage cells.

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
