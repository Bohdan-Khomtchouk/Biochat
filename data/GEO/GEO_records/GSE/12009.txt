TITLE
Transcript profiling in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae after adherence to, or planktonic growth over, SJPL cells.

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

SUMMARY
Host-pathogen interactions are of great importance in understanding the pathogenesis of infectious microorganisms. We developed in vitro models to study porcine respiratory tract pathogens using an immortalized epithelial cell line, the St. Jude Porcine Lung (SJPL) cell line.  In conditions where cytotoxicity was absent or low, the transcriptomic profile of A. pleuropneumoniae after contact with the porcine lung epithelial cells was determined using DNA microarrays. Genes such as tadB, rcpA, members of a putative adhesion locus, and a gene with high homology to the Hsf autotransporter adhesin of Haemophilus influenzae were upregulated as well as genes pgaBC involved in biofilm biosynthesis, while capsular polysaccharide-associated genes were downregulated.
