TITLE
Comparative gene expression analysis of chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum using RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum is an important public health burden since it reverses the malaria control achieved so far. Understanding the mechanism of drug resistance will help us to develop novel drug/vaccine targets for malaria treatment. In the present study, we have used the whole transcriptome sequencing to characterize the transcriptional difference between chloroquine sensitive and resistant P. falciparum strains (3D7 and Dd2). The differential gene expression between these strains was analyzed to understand their phenotypic properties like drug sensitivity, immune evasion and pathways involved.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains of P. falciparum, grown in the presence and absence of CQ, using Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL21078 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Plasmodium falciparum)
