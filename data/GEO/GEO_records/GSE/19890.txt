TITLE
miRNA expression after moderate Spinal Cord Injury in Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Identification of temporal variations in miRNA expression after spinal cord injury caused by thoracic (T8) moderate (200 Kdynes) contusion. Expression changes were analyzed 1, 3 and 7 days after injury and compared to expression of control (untreated) and sham (laminectony but no contusion) individuals.

DESIGN
Included groups: control (untreated), 1 day after lesion, 3 days after lesion, 7 days after lesion, 1 days after SHAM cirugy, 3 days after SHAM cirugy, and 7 days after SHAM cirugy. Each of these 7 groups included 5 biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL9908 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, v.11.0 - hsa, mmu & rno [full array]
