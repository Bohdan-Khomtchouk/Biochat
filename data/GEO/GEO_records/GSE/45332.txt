TITLE
Genome-wide total RNA and MBD-sequencing in HCT116 and DKO cells as a global re-expression model [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide view of the interplay between methylation and RNA expression in this colorectal cancer model was obtained.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of HCT116 cell line, the DNMT1 and DNMT3B double knock-out HCT116 cell line (DKO), and 7 additional colorectal cell lines.
