TITLE
Expression data from early Drosophila embryo

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Translational control is critical for early Drosophila embryogenesis and is exerted mainly at the gene-specific level. To understand the post-transcriptional regulation during Drosophila early embryonic development, we used the sucrose polysomal gradient analyses and GeneChip analysis to illustrate the translation profile of individual mRNAs. A paper was published in Genome Biology 2007 under the tile " Global analyses of mRNA translational control during early Drosophila embryogenesis " . Keywords: time course, fractionation
