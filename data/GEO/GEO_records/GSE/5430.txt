TITLE
Expression data from early Drosophila embryo

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Translational control is critical for early Drosophila embryogenesis and is exerted mainly at the gene-specific level. To understand the post-transcriptional regulation during Drosophila early embryonic development, we used the sucrose polysomal gradient analyses and GeneChip analysis to illustrate the translation profile of individual mRNAs. A paper was published in Genome Biology 2007 under the tile " Global analyses of mRNA translational control during early Drosophila embryogenesis " . Keywords: time course, fractionation

DESIGN
In this study, we have fractionated embryo extracts from a series of early stages by sedimentation on sucrose density gradients and analyzed the RNA components of these fractions. Our analysis has focused on analyzing ribosomal density, generally and for individual transcripts, global translational activity during the first 10 hours after egg laying and coordination between transcription and translation regulation.
