TITLE
The AIN-centered DCN of delayed-type eyeblink conditioned mice: 7-d paired and 7-d unpaired training groups

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN) is a proposed site of memory formation of eyeblink conditioning. A large part of the underlying molecular events, however, remains unknown. To elucidate molecular mechanisms, we examined transcriptional changes in the AIN of mice trained with delayed-type eyeblink conditioning Keywords: 7-d paired training, 7-d unpaired training, delayed-type eyeblink conditioning of mice, anterior interpositus nucleus-centered deep cerebellar nuclei

DESIGN
7-d paired training group: Mice received a surgery for implanting four Teflon-coated stainless-steel wires in their left eyelid and a headstage on their head. After 3daysâ€™ recovery, they were trained with paired paradigm of conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US) for 7 days: A 352-ms tone CS (1kHz, 83~85dB) was delivered first and a 100ms periorbital shock US (100kHz square pluses) were delivered with 252ms after the onset of CS, and they co-terminated. In case of 7-d unpaired training group, A CS and a US were delivered in an explicitly unpaired, pseudorandomized manner for 7 days. After the last trial was given, anterior interpositus was immediately sampled in 10 to 30 min from the sacrifice.
