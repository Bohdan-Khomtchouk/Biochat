TITLE
A Smooth Muscle-Like Origin for Beige Adipocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comparison of the translating RNAs in UCP1-positive cells from the classical BAT, the inguinal WAT, and the perigonadal WAT. We find genes common to all UCP1-positive cells independent of anatomical location, as well as genes specifically enriched in one group versus the others. Results provide a portrait of gene expression in UCP1-positive cells in vivo.

DESIGN
Translating RNAs in UCP1-positive cells were purified from 6 week old female UCP1-TRAP mice after 2 weeks at 4 degC. N=3 for iWAT, N=2 for pgWAT, and N=3 for BAT.
