TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling Separates Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma from Oncocytoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aims to compare gene expression profiles of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and benign oncocytoma, aiming at identifying differentially expressed genes.

DESIGN
Nine cases each of chromophobe RCC and oncocytoma were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray.  Candidate genes that showed consistent differential expression were validated by RT-PCR using 25 fresh-frozen and 15 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples.  Immunohistochemical analysis was also performed for two selected gene products, Claudin 8 and MAL2.
