TITLE
Human Embryo Single Cell Transcriptome Analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sorted 2PN stage human embryos by predicted viability using a noninvasive measurement we previously developed. We then performed RNA-seq on each embryo (which was a single cell) and looked for differences in expression between viable and nonviable embryos.

DESIGN
We sequenced the transcriptomes of 22 human zygotes (2PN stage) embryos, of which 11 were predicted nonviable and 11 were predicted viable. We excluded 5 which had no siblings in this data set. From the remaining 17 embryos, we analyzed the set of genes that was differentially expressed between those predicted viable and those predicted nonviable.
