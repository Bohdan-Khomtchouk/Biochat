TITLE
Analysis of Gene Expression in Ginger Tissues at Different Developmental Stages

ORGANISM
Zingiber officinale

SUMMARY
Rhizome, root and leaf of Yellow ginger were compared in this study. Rhizomes from 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 month old plants (after planting) were compared to each other and to root from 2 and 7 month plants and leaves from 2 and 7 month old plants.  Plants were grown under controlled conditions in the greenhouse.

DESIGN
We used an interwoven loop design for hybridizations. There are two interwoven loops included in this experiment: one for rhizome developmental stages (2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 months old), the other one for all tissues of 2 and 7 month old plants. These interwoven designs are connected at the 2 month old and 7 month old rhizome samples.
