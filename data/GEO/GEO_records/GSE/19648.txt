TITLE
Murine Histone Methyltransferase Mll5, is involved in Male Gametogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Male mice but not female Mll5 -/- mice are infertile. This study showed that post-meiotic spermatogenic maturation is impaired in Mll5 -/- mice. In order to investigate the role of Mll5 in spermatogenesis, a transcriptome analysis of whole testes from Mll5 knock out and wildtype mice was performed. Affymetrix Mouse Exon chips were hybridized with testes material from three individual male mice from each wild-type or Mll5 -/- genotype, in order to identify gene regulation differences attributed to the loss of Mll5.

DESIGN
One-way ANOVA: wildtype vs. Mll5-/-

PLATFORM
GPL6193 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
