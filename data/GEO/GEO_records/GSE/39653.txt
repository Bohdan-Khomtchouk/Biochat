TITLE
Differential Gene Expression in Patients with Mood Disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 24 adult healthy controls, 8 adult patients with bipolar disorder, and 21 adult patients with major depressive disorder to analyze gene expression patterns that identify biomarkers of disease and that may be correlated with fMRI data.

DESIGN
Following reduction of globin transcripts, RNA from PBMC was labeled and hybridized to Illumina HT-12 v4 microarrays. Samples are designated with a unique number that is preceded by HC for healthy controls, BD for bipolar disorder, or MDD for major depressive disorder.
