TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis wild type and ibr1 ibr3 ibr10 triple mutant seedlings root tip segments treated with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The root cap-specific conversion of the auxin precursor indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) into the main auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) generates a local auxin source which subsequently modulates both the periodicity and intensity of auxin response oscillations in the root tip of Arabidopsis, and consequently fine-tunes the spatiotemporal patterning of lateral roots. To explore downstream components of this signaling process, we investigated the early transcriptional regulations happening in the root tip during IBA-to-IAA conversion in Col-0 and ibr1 ibr3 ibr10 triple mutant after 6 hours of IBA treatment.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana (L). Heynh., Col-0 and ibr1ibr3ibr10 seeds were germinated vertically on solid medium derived from standard Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. Three days after germination, Col-0 and ibr1ibr3ibr10 seedlings were transferred to a fresh MS medium supplemented with or without 10 Î¼M indole-3-buytric acid (IBA) for 6 hours. Then, root tip segments (~4mm) were dissected from the primary root and harvested for further RNA extraction. For each treatment, at least 120 individual Col-0 or ibr1ibr3ibr10 mutant root tip segments were sampled and three independent biological replicates were performed. Hormone and DMSO solution were filer-sterilized before being added to the medium.
