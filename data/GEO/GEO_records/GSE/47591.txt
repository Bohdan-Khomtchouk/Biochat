TITLE
Increased endoplasmic reticulum stress response is involved in clopidogrel-induced apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clopidogrel is associated with a series of gastrointestinal side effects, such as bleeding complications and recurrent gastric ulcer; however, their mechanisms are largely unclear.  In this study, human gene expression microarray and gene ontology analysis were utilized to evaluate the effects of clopidogrel on gene expression in human gastric epithelial cells (GES-1) Keywords: Clopidogrel; Gastric injury; GES-1 cell line

DESIGN
The Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray was measured at 24 hours after GES-1 cells were exposure to clopidogrel ( 1.5mmol/l). The experimental set up the control group and the clopidogrel group. Three chips were performed on each group.
