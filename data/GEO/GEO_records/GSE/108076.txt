TITLE
Expression data of human epidermal tissue with knockdown of the SMRT-2 lncRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify lncRNAs and novel transcripts that are differentially regulated in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using RNA sequencing In this dataset, we include expression data from human skin tissue regenerated in the presence or absence of the putative lncRNA SMRT-2, which we have identified as a new regulator of differentiation.

DESIGN
4 samples total were analyzed. CTRL_1 and CTRL_2 are duplicate human epidermal tissues regenerated with a control siRNA. SMRT2i_1 and SMRT2i_2 are human epidermal tissues regenerated with 2 independent siRNA sequences targeting the SMRT-2 lncRNA
