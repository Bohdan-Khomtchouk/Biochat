TITLE
Expression data from canine osteosarcoma stem cells

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumours of dogs. Canine osteosarcoma contains a sub-population of cancer stem cells. Here we used canine-specific microarrays to compare the global gene expression profiles of osteosarcoma stem cells to adherent cancer cells and canine mesenchymal stem cells.

DESIGN
Canine osteosarcoma spheres were isolated by their ability to form tumourspheres. Spheres, adherent cells and mesenchymal stem cells were harvested and used for RNA extraction and hybridisation on Affymetrix microarrays (Canine 2.0). Four biological replicates of each sample were included.
