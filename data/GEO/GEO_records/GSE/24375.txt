TITLE
Gene expression changes in patient-matched gastric normal mucosa, adenomas, and carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
sequential changes in gene expression profiles in the gastric adenoma-carcinoma sequence by analyzing eight patient-matched gastric normal mucosa, adenomas and carcinomas.

DESIGN
We examined gene expression changes during the gastric adenoma-carcinoma sequence in 26 snap-frozen samples (normal mucosa, adenoma, and carcinoma samples from eight patients and two additional carcinomas) by oligonucleotide microarray
