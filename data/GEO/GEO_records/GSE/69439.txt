TITLE
Regulatory landscape fusion in rhabdomyosarcoma by interactions between the PAX3 promoter and FOXO1 regulatory elements

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Results: Using a combination of 4C-seq datasets, we were able to model the three-dimensional organisation of the translocated chromosome in a PAX3:FOXO1 fusion-positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. We show that PAX3 and FOXO1 regulatory landscapes fuse into a novel TAD, allowing the PAX3 promoter to interact ectopically with FOXO1 sequences with potential enhancer function. The borders of this novel TAD correspond to the original 5'- and 3'- borders of the PAX3 and FOXO1 TADs, respectively, suggesting that TAD organisation precedes the formation of regulatory long-range interactions. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the chromosomal translocation that leads to ARMS development generates a novel TAD that favours ectopic PAX3:FOXO1 oncogene activation in non-PAX3 territories, which may be an essential step in the tumorigenic process, as expression in a particular cell type, the often elusive cell-of-origin, may be required for disease development.

DESIGN
4C-seq samples for FoxO1 and Pax3 gene promoters in E9.5 whole mouse embryos, as well as for the PAX3 promoter and several ECRs and CTCF binding sites present at the PAX3:FOXO1 locus in the patient-derived alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) cell line RMS.
