TITLE
Cachexia-inducible Transforming growth factor-beta1 stimulated Clone-22 D4 controls acute hepatic lipid homeostasis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular basis for TSC22D4 function in hepatic lipid homeostasis in vivo TSC22D4 was knocked down in the mouse liver using adenovirus and performed genome wide expression analysis.

DESIGN
1x10^9 plaque-forming units (pfu) per recombinant virus were administered via tail vein injection. Mice (C57Bl/6) were sacrificed 7 days after infection. Hepatic RNA was isolated and used for whole genome expression analysis.
