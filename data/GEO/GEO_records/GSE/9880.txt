TITLE
Babesia Infected/Control LongSAGE libraries for Boophilus microplus ovary tissue

ORGANISM
Rhipicephalus microplus

SUMMARY
Babesia infected (and control) ovary tissue was used to construct LongSAGE libraries.   The intent was to find differential gene expression in both libraries. Details: The extraction was done using Ambion's ToTALLY RNA kit, and the concatemers where constructed using Invitrogen's I-SAGE Long kit.   The concatmer files (multiple fasta sequence files) were processed using in-house perl scripts to extract the 17bp LongSAGE tags. **Note: contact person:   Felix D.

DESIGN
1 control and 1 treatment library was constructed.  Besides the ovary, gut was also looked at but the data was un-analyzable. **************  Analysis Results  ********** Ovary Infected: Project tags: 				8750 Project files(concatemers/sequences): 	703 Project Duplicate Dimers(ditags):	1612 Unique tags				5315 Total tags inc. ditags			11974 % of tags in duplicate ditags		36% Ovary Control: Project tags: 				6764 Project files(concatemers/sequences): 	368 Project Duplicate Dimers(ditags):	846 Unique tags				3937 Total tags inc. ditags			8456 % of tags in duplicate ditags		25%
