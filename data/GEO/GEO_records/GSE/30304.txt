TITLE
Gene expression profiling of prostate epithelial cells in response to tissue contextual changes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To conduct comparative transcriptomic analyses on normal or malignant prostate epithelial cells in response to tissue contextual changes, we cultured immortalized prostate epithelial cells or prostate cancer cells as cell monolayers or three-dimensional organoids and profiled their transcriptomes in respective culture contexts.

DESIGN
RWPE-1 (immortalized prostate epithelial cells) and LNCaP cells (prostate cancer cells) were seeded on reconstituted basement membrane (rBM)-coated culture plastics or cultured within three-dimensional (3D) rBM gels. Total RNA samples were collected from cell monolayers or 3D cell clusters (formed at day 2) or acini or spheroids (formed at day 6) in the rBM culture, followed by global gene expression profiling.
