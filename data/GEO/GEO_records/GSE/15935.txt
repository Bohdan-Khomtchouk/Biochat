TITLE
Expression data from 'na√Øve' and HVC-replicon containing Huh7 cells (Clone A cells)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cyclophilin binding drugs, NIM811 and cyclosporin A (CsA), inhibit the replication of HCV replicon. We investigated the mode of action of these drugs and identified host factors essential for HCV replication in a subgenomic replicon model.

DESIGN
Cultured Huh7 cell were treated with CsA or NIM811 at different concentrations. Cells were harvested after 12, 24 or 48 hours.  The extracted mRNA were hybridized on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 microarrays.
