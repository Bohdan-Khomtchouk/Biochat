TITLE
Towards epigenetic understanding and therapy of insulin resistance by intranuclear insulin [DNA methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is evidence indicating the involvement of DNA methylation memory in maintaining gene expression patterns associated with insulin resistance. Although the exact mechanism remains unknown, it has been proved that insulin resistance is correlated to low heat shock protein (HSP) expression. We reveal that intranuclear insulin can reduce HSP DNA methylation level to up-regulate HSP protein expression and result in long term cure of hyperglycemia.

DESIGN
Insulin resistance HepG2 cell were selected in our experiments.Two conditions were compared with three replicates each. These are:(1) Insulin resistance HepG2(R-HepG2) and (2) Biomineralized insulin treated HepG2 (BI).
