TITLE
Camparision of gene expression among CL, INT, and CH flowers of C. kokaiensis in ATH1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The annual cleistogamous herb Cardamine kokaiensis is an endemic plant along the Kokai River in Japan. We examined the differences in gene expression patterns among cleistogamous (CL), intermediate (INT), and chasmogamous (CH) flower by cross-species microarray analysis using an Arabidopsis thaliana Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide microarray (GeneChip ATH1). We then discuss the molecular basis of the evolution of cleistogamy. Our results help to clarify the molecular basis of the evolution of plant mating systems that depend on environmental conditions. Keywords: flower type comparison
