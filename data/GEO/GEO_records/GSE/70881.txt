TITLE
Expression analysis of draculin (drl) expressing cells in embryonic zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
drl expression initiates during gastrulation and condenses as a band of cells at the prospective lateral embryo margin. In late epiboly, drl:EGFP is detectable as a band of scattered EGFP-fluorescent cells; after gastrulation, drl:EGFP-positive cells coalesce at the embryo margin that then in somitogenesis break down into the anterior and posterior lateral plate with subsequent cell migrations that form the posterior vascular/hematopoietic stripes and the anterior cardiovascular and myeloid precursors. Data is as published in Mosimann & Panakova et al (Nature Communications, 2015)

DESIGN
The same pool of homozygous drl:EGFP transgenic zebrafish were mass-mated 3 times and embryos collected at 2ss. Embryos were de-chorionated, homogenized, and sorted, then subject to mRNA isolation and expression analysis.
