TITLE
Vibrio vulnificus: normal intracellular c-di-GMP level vs. high intracellular c-di-GMP level

ORGANISM
Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6

SUMMARY
The profiles of transcripts from the V. vulnificus grown under normal and high c-di-GMP conditions were compared by using a V. vulnificus whole-genome microarray

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment,  normal c-di-GMP condition vs. high c-di-GMP condition. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 experimental, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array. For transcriptome analysis, the V. vulnificus whole genome TwinChip, manufactured and kindly provided by the 21C Frontier Microbial Genomics and Applications Center (Daejeon, South Korea), was used.

PLATFORM
GPL17798 Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6 whole genome TwinChip
