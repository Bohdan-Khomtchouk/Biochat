TITLE
Expression Analysis Upon PARP-1 or PARG Knockdown in MCF-7 Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) are enzymes that modify target proteins in the nucleus by the addition and removal, respectively, of ADP-ribose polymers.  Although a role for PARP-1 in gene regulation has been well established, the role of PARG is less clear.  To investigate how PARP-1 and PARG coordinately regulate global patterns of gene expression, we used short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to stably knockdown PARP-1 or PARG in MCF-7 cells, followed by expression microarray analyses.
