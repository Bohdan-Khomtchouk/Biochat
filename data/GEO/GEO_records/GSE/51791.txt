TITLE
Generation of functional cholangiocytes from human pluripotent stem cells and HepaRG cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile analysis allowed to identify a panel of genes and pathways characteristic of hESC-and HepaRG-derived cholangiocytes.

DESIGN
Microarrays were conducted at day 23 and day 10 of differentiation for hESC-Chol and HepaRG-Chol respectively and compared to hESC-HB and HepaRG-HB.  Five, four or three independent experiments were performed depending the experimental sample
