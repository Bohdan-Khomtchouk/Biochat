TITLE
Transcriptomics analysis of the Bordetella holmesii response to human serum exposure

ORGANISM
Bordetella holmesii

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-Seq transcriptomics analyses of the Bordetella holmesii type strain ATCC 51541T under in vitro growth conditions that mimic exposure to the human bloodstream. We sequenced 3 biological replicates of each of the following conditions of exposure to heat-inactivated human serum: 5% serum, 0.5% serum, and a no serum control.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was performed on the Bordetella holmesii type strain ATCC 51541T grown under three conditions: 5% heat-inactivated human serum, 0.5% heat-inactivated human serum, and a no serum control.

PLATFORM
