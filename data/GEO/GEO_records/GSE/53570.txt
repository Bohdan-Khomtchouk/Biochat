TITLE
Detection of juvenile hormone-like function of diofenolan in Daphnia magna using in vivo short-term screening assay, TG211 Annex 7 reproduction test and microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Daphnia magna

SUMMARY
Juvenile hormone (JH) and JH agonists have been reported to induce male offspring production in various daphnids including Daphnia magna. We have recently established a short-term in vivo screening method to detect chemicals having JH activity, induction of male offspring, using adult D. magna. Diofenolan has been developed to be a JH agonist in insects, but no male induction in daphniids has been studied. In this study, we found the male offspring induction by diofenolan with a short-term in vivo screening method, and the most potent male offspring production activity among JH analogs studied using the OECD TG211 Annex 7. Transcriptome analysis of diofenolan-exposed D. magna showed up-regulation of JH-responsive genes. These results clearly demonstrated that diofenolan has JH activities in D. magna using the short-term in vivo screening assay, OECD TG211 Annex 7 and microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Juvenile hormone agonists induced gene expression in daphnids neonates was measured at 48 hours after exposure to diofenolan (10 ng/L) and DMF as a control.  Four independent experiments were performed at each chemicals.
