TITLE
Genes differentially expressed between Bmi1-overexpressing and empty vector control neural stem/progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neural stem/progenitor cells were isolated from the lateral ventricle wall of 4-6 week-old CD1 mice and grown as neurospheres under low density culture conditions. Test cells were transduced with bicistronic retroviral constructs for the over-expression of Bmi1 together with eGFP, and control cells were transduced with an empty vector construct expressing eGFP only. To identify genes, which are regulated by BMI1 in neural stem/progenitor cells, the gene expression profiles of neurosphere cells over-expressing Bmi1 were compared empty vector control cells using Affymetrix Gene mouse ST1.0 arrays

DESIGN
3 independent Bmi1-overexpressing neurosphere cultures (test samples) were compared to 3 independent empty vector neurosphere cultures (control samples).
