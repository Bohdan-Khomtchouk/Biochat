TITLE
Analysis of copy number profiles of several tumor samples of same patient reveals the successive steps in tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We present the first computational approach to reconstruct the sequence of copy number alterations driving carcinogenesis from the analysis of several tumor samples of a same patient. Applied to BAC array-CGH and SNP array data from bladder and breast cancers, this method proved highly valuable to establish the clonal relationships between primary tumors and recurrences and to identify the chromosome aberrations at the initiation of tumorigenesis.
