TITLE
C.elegans gene expression study for single, double or triple genetic perturbations of regulators in AMPK, Insulin and TOR pathway

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We use genetic manipulations of regulators representing different pathways to examine whether transcriptomes progressively resemble dietary restriction when multiple regulators are perturbed.

DESIGN
Worms under 10 different treatments with 2 replicates each were collected on adult day (AD) 4, fed by HT1115 bacteria under ad libitum (AL) with concentration of 1x10^10 bacteria/ml.

PLATFORM
GPL200 [Celegans] Affymetrix C. elegans Genome Array
