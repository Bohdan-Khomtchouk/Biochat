TITLE
Integrated stress response regulation by the MITF/TFE3 transcription factor family

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To reestablish homeostasis and mitigate stress, cells must activate a series of adaptive intracellular signaling pathways. To understand the activation of the MITF/TFE transcription factors in response to ER stress we exposed mouse embryonic fibroblasts to starvation and tunicamycin (used to induce ER stress).

DESIGN
4 samples were analyzed: Background Control, Control, Starvation, Tunicamycin
