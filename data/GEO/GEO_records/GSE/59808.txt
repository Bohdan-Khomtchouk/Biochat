TITLE
Expression data from AML cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Post-chemotherapy relapse presents a major unmet medical need in AML where treatment options are limited. We used gene expression profile from 32 AML cell lines to characterize expression difference between responder and non-responders to PIM inhibitors. Our results highlight the importance of STAT5 and MYC in rendering cancer cells sensitive to PIM inhibitors.

DESIGN
All AML cell lines were purchased from either ATCC or DSMZ and cultured accordingly to vendorsâ€™ protocols. Gene expression were measured from the cell lines using Affymetrix microarrays. Response to PIM inhibitors (IC50) was recorded for each cell line, and association between drug response and gene expression were analyzed.
