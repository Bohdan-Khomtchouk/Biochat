TITLE
Differential Gene Expression in Uterine Endometrium during Implantation in Pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
This study provide an opportunity to elucidate the genetic control of fetal implantation and improve our understanding of fetal implantation and gestation maintenance, thus make further improvement for litter size of pigs.

DESIGN
Nine pregnant sows were slaughtered by electrical on day 13, day 18 and day 24 after insemination (the pregnant group, three sows every period). The non-pregnant sows were slaughtered on day 13 after inseminated (n=3).In pregnant sows, samples of the endometrium attachment sites and inter-sites were taken. Samples from the endometrium of the non-pregnant sows were taken from comparable locations.
