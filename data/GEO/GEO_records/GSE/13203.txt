TITLE
Global transcriptional profiling of Staphylococcus aureus treated with cryptotanshinone

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is an important human and animal pathogen, multiply resistant strains are increasingly widespread, new agents are needed for the treatment of S. aureus. Cryptotanshinone, a natural plant product, has potent antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. We employed Affymetrix Staphylococcus aureus GeneChipsTM arrays to investigate the global transcriptional profiling of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 treated with cryptotanshinone. Keywords: gene expression array-based, count

DESIGN
Staphylococcus aureus cells were exposed for 45 minutes to cryptotanshinone at concentration of 2 µg/ml (1/2× MIC), 6 samples including 3 control samples are analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL1339 [S_aureus] Affymetrix S. aureus Genome Array
