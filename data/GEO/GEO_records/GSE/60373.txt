SUMMARY
Comparative RNA-seq profiling of mouse and anole lizard developing limbs and external genitalia, to assess evolutionary and develomental relationships, between the two tissue types based on transcriptomic data

DESIGN
RNA-seq profiling of embryonic limb and external genitalia tissue at different stages of development, in mouse and anole lizard, in duplicates, using Illumina HiSeq
