TITLE
PKCz-mediated Gaq stimulation of the ERK5 pathway is involved in cardiac hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: Gq-coupled G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) mediate the actions of a variety of messengers that are key regulators of cardiovascular function. Enhanced Gaq-mediated signaling plays an important role in cardiac hypertrophy and in the transition to heart failure. We have recently described that Gaq acts as an adaptor protein that facilitates PKCz-mediated activation of ERK5 in epithelial cells.  Since the ERK5 cascade is known to be involved in cardiac hypertrophy, we have investigated the potential relevance of this pathway in Gq-dependent  signaling in cardiac cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have explored the mechanisms involved in Gq-coupled GPCR-mediated stimulation of the ERK5 pathway and its functional consequences in cardiac hypertrophy using both cultured cardiac cells and an animal model of angiotensin- dependent induction of cardiac hypertrophy in wild-type and PKCz knockout mice. We find that PKCζ is required for the activation of the ERK5 pathway by Gq-coupled GPCR in cardiomyocytes and in cardiac fibroblasts. Stimulation of ERK5 by angiotensin II is blocked upon pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated silencing of PKCz in primary cultures of cardiac cells and in cardiomyocytes isolated from PKCz-deficient mice. Moreover, these mice do not develop cardiac hypertrophy upon chronic challenge with angiotensin II, as assessed by morphological, biomarker, electrocardiographic and global gene expression pattern analysis. Conclusion/Significance: Our data put forward that PKCζ is essential for Gq- dependent ERK5 activation in cardiac cells and indicate a key cardiac physiological role for this recently described Gaq/PKCz/MEK5 signaling axis.

DESIGN
Littermate wild-type and PKCz -/- male mice (32 weeks of age) were subjected to continuous infusion of angiotensin II (or PBS as a control) for 14 days, a well established model for the induction of cardiac hypertrohy
