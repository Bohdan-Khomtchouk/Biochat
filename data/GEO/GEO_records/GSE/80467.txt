TITLE
Identification of mRNAs with reduced ribosomal loading upon knock-down of translation factor DAP5 from hESCs.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have generated stable human ESCs (H9) expressing control or DAP5-targeting shRNA. Polysome profiles reveal no major changes in overall translation. PolyA+ RNA and RNA accociated with heavy polysomal fractions were purified in biological duplicates and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument. We identified 122 potential mRNA targets of DAP5 translation that display reduced ribosomal loading, and hence reduced translation, in the absence of DAP5.

DESIGN
Total mRNA and heavy polylsomal fractions from shNT and shDAP5 expressing hESCs, each in duplicate, was deep sequenced.
