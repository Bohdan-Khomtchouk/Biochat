TITLE
HPV16 E7 expression effect on expression profile mediated by tumor necrosis factor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acute expression of E7 oncogene from HPV-16 or HPV-18 is sufficient to overcome tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF) cytostatic effect on primary human keratinocytes. In the present study we investigated the molecular basis of E7-induced TNF resistance through a comparative analysis of the effect of this cytokine on the proliferation and global gene expression of organotypic cultures of normal and E7(wild type or mutant)-expressing keratinocytes.

DESIGN
In order to determine the effects of E7 expression on TNF response, we performed 3 independent experiment for each cell line. Organotypic cultures of normal and E7(wild type or mutant)-expressing keratinocytes were treated with 2 nM TNF for 72 hours, or left untreated.
