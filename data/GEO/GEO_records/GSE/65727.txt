TITLE
High throughput sequencing of the small RNAs from banana cv. Grand Naine (AAA group)

ORGANISM
Musa acuminata AAA Group

SUMMARY
Small RNAs especially small inhibiting RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential role in the regulation of gene expression in plants. These non coding RNAs are processed by the DICER like proteins into 21-24 nucleotides single stranded molecules that guide the activity of RNA induced silencing complex. This complex along with the processed small RNA identifies the cognate mRNA and brings about sequence specific mRNA degradation thereby silencing the gene expression. The small RNA profile is unique for each plant tissue at a given point of time. High throughput sequencing method allows the study of differential expression of these small RNAs. Deep sequencing of small RNAs derived from the leaves of an elite cultivar of banana cv. Grand Naine (‘Cavendish’ subgroup with AAA genotype) was carried out.

DESIGN
Generation of complete small RNA profile of banana cv. Grand Naine for comparison with similar databases
