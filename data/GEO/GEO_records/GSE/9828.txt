TITLE
Characterization of Calprotectin treated medium

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus str. Newman

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to correlate the transcriptional response of S. aureus cells grown in Calprotectin treated medium with that of cells grown in Mn or Zn depletion conditions. Keywords: RNA sample

DESIGN
Staphylcoccus aureus strain Newman was grown to mid-log phase in Calprotectin treated medium or medium lacking either Zn or Mn.  RNA was isolated, labeled and hybridized to an S. aureus Affymetrix GeneChip.  Biological replicates are indicated as A, B, or C.
