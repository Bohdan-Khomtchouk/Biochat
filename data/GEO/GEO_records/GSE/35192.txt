TITLE
Hepatic gene expression in C57BL/6 mice intratracheally instilled with Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated hepatic mRNA profiles of female mice exposed to 0.162 mg Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles by single intra-tracheal instillation. We examined responses to this dose 1, 3 and 28 days after exposure, alongside respective controls. We show that genes part of the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase pathway to be up-regulated by exposure to Printex 90.

DESIGN
individual total RNA (200 ng) from 6 mice per treatment group (control and 0.162mg) and universal reference total RNA (Stratagene, Mississauga, ON, Canada) was used to synthesize double stranded cDNA.
