TITLE
Gene expression within the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in a developing model of high and low anixety and depression-like behavior in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Individual differences in human temperament can increase the risk of psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety. Our laboratory utilized a rat model of temperamental differences to assess neurodevelopmental factors underlying emotional behavior differences. Rats selectively bred for low novelty exploration (Low Responders, LR) display high levels of anxiety- and depression-like behavior compared to High Novelty Responder (HR) rats. Using transcriptome profiling, the present study uncovered vast gene expression differences in the early postnatal HR versus LR limbic brain, including changes in genes involved in cellular metabolism. These data led us to hypothesize that rats prone to high (versus low) anxiety/depression-like behavior exhibit distinct patterns of brain metabolism during the first weeks of life, which may reflect disparate patterns of synaptogenesis and brain circuit development. All samples were generated from Sprague-Dawley male rats selectively bred for high novelty response (HRs) or low novelty response (LRs).

DESIGN
Within each age and brain regions, the sample size of either HR or LR is 5 samples.
