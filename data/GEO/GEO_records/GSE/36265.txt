TITLE
Gene expression analysis for Oregon R embryos at different developmental stages.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The transcription profiles of newly mapped Drosophila heterochromatic sequences during early embryonic stages were investigated by microarray.

DESIGN
cDNA were prepared from manually staged wild type Oregon R embryos at various developmental stages (0-1 hr, 2-2.5 hr/cycle 13-early cycle 14, 2.5-3 hr/mid- to late cycle 14, 3-4 hr, 4-5 hr, 19-22 hr) and analyzed by microarray. cDNA prepared from Oregon R embryos with mixed developmental stages (0-16 hrs) were used as reference for hybridization. Each stage has two biological repeats. 100-150 embryos were collected for each experiment. All embryos were collected at room temperature.
