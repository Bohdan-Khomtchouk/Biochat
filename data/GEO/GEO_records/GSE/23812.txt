ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SUBMITTER_CITATION: Dub√© E and Cyr DG, The Blood-Epididymis and Human Male Fertility. In: Biology and Regulation of Blood-Tissue Barriers, Cheng CY Editor. 2010, Landes Bioscience. The epididymis can be subdivided into three regions, the caput, corpus and cauda epididymidis, that have different characteristics and functions. Goal was to determine the differential pattern of gene expression along the regions of the human epididymis.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, region 1 vs region 2. Replicates: 4 biological replicates from each epididymal region.

PLATFORM
GPL7264 Agilent-012097 Human 1A Microarray (V2) G4110B (Probe Name version)
