TITLE
MMP-14 deficient vs wild-type E14 Dlk+ cells and MMP-14 deficient vs wild-type P1 liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of E14 Dlk+ cells derived from Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-14 deficient (KO) mice comparing those from littermate wild-type (WT) mice. RNA samples were extrated from FACS-sorted Dlk+CD45-CD71-Ter119- cells derived from E14.5 livers. Transcriptional profiling of postnatal day (P)1 livers derived from MMP-14 deficient (KO) mice comparing those from littermate wild-type (WT) mice. RNA samples were extrated from whole livers derived from P1 mice.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MMP-14 KO vs WT E14 Dlk+ cells and MMP-14KO vs. WT whole livers. Total RNA samples in MMP-14 KO vs WT E14 Dlk+ cells were extracted from FACS-sorted Dlk+CD45-CD71-Ter119- cells derived from E14.5 livers.  MMP-14 KO and WT E14 Dlk+ cells samples were RNA solutions extracted from 100000 cells derived from three MMP-14 KO livers and three WT livers, respectively. Total RNA samples in MMP-14KO vs. WT whole livers were extracted from E18.5 whole livers.  MMP-14KO and WT whole livers samples were mixture of RNA solutions derived from two MMP-14 KO livers and two WT livers, respectively.
