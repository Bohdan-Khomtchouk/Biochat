TITLE
Leo1 is a Global Regulator of Heterochromatin Cis-spreading

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Domains of heterochromatin play important roles in the maintenance and regulation of eukaryotic genomes. However, the repressive nature of heterochromatin combined with its propensity to self-propagate necessitates the existence of robust mechanisms that limit heterochromatin spreading and thereby avoid silencing of expressed genes. A number of specific sequence elements have been found to serve as barriers to heterochromatin spreading; however, the mechanisms by which spreading is curtailed are generally not well understood. Here we uncover a role for PAF complex component Leo1 in regulating heterochromatin cis-spreading. A genetic screen revealed that loss of Leo1 results in spreading of heterochromatin across a centromeric (IRC) boundary element in fission yeast. Similar heterochromatin spreading was seen upon deletion of other components of the PAF complex, but not other factors involved in transcription-coupled chromatin modification, indicating a specific role for the PAF complex in heterochromatin regulation. Loss of Leo1 is associated with reduced levels of H4K16 acetylation at the boundary, while tethering of the H4K16 acetyltransferase Mst1 to boundary chromatin suppresses heterochromatin spreading in leo1Δ cells, suggesting that Leo1 antagonises heterochromatin spreading by facilitating H4K16 acetylation. Interestingly, Leo1 also regulates heterochromatin spreading independently of boundaries, and loss of Leo1 causes redistribution of heterochromatin, in particular resulting in substantial expansion of telomeric heterochromatin domains. The PAF complex is known to be an important regulator of transcription-related chromatin modifications; our findings reveal a previously undescribed role for this complex in global regulation of heterochromatin spreading in cis.
