TITLE
Expression data from J147-treated HT22 cells compared to untreated HT22 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Neurotrophic Compound J147 Reverses Cognitive Impairment In Aged Alzheimer's Disease We used GeneChipÂ® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays to probe global gene expression changes when adding J147 compound to HT22 cells and compared to untreated cells. The hippocampal cell line HT22 were treated with the J147 compound for 1 hour and compared to HT22 treated only with vehicle (DMSO) for 1 hour.

DESIGN
The gene expression profile from the J147-treated HT22 cells (1 hour exposure) was compared to HT22 cells treated with vehicle only (DMSO) for 1 hour.  The DMSO/vehicle treated cells serve as the control and are referred to as untreated with drug.
