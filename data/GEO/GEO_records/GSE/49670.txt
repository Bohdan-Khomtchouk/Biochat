TITLE
Expression data from laser capture microdissected human atherosclerotic plaque, rich or void of plasmacytoid dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are scarcely present in the inflamed human atherosclerotic plaque, where they are presumed to exert pro-inflammatory functions through release of type I interferons. However, the precise role of pDCs in human atherosclerosis yet remains to be established. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
We investigated the impact of human plaque pDCs on its local context, applying state of the art transcriptomics analysis on Laser Capture Microdissected fractions of human atherosclerotic plaques, distinctively enriched in pDCs, or pDCs-void.
