TITLE
Gene expression of cytosolic glutamine synthetase 1;1 knock-out mutant rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice grown in paddy fields prefers to use ammonium ions as a major source of inorganic nitrogen. Glutamine synthetase (GS) catalyzes the conversion of ammonium ions to glutamine. In three cytosolic GS in rice, OsGS1;1 has the critical role for normal growth and grain filling. To understand a role of GS1;1, we performed transcriptional profiling of wild type Nipponbare and GS1;1 mutant plants in seedling using the Agilent Rice Oligo Microarray.

DESIGN
organisms: Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare mutant: GS1;1 mutant rice (Tos17 insertion NC2373) growth substrates: The germinated seedlings were grown hydroponically in one-fourth concentration of the hydroponic culture solution with 1.0 mM NH4Cl as nitrogen source. The culture solution was replaced as new one every morning at 10:00 am. age: 18 days after sowing tissue: 4th leaf blade derived from 4 plants tissue: 4th leaf sheath derived from 4 plants tissue: roots derived from a plant WT vs. GS1;1 mutant rice hybridization : two dye method hybridization: Dye-swap experiment

PLATFORM
GPL892 Agilent-012106 Rice Oligo Microarray G4138A (Feature Number version)
