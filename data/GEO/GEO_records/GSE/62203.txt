TITLE
Effect of glucose, endothelin-1 and cortisol on human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes exposed to glucose, endothelin-1 and cortisol in vitro. Treatment produces a surrogate diabetic cardiomyopathic phenotype. Results provide insight into the pathways regulated by the treatment in the cardiomyocyte.

DESIGN
The RNA for each vehicle-control treated and glucose endothelin cortisol treated iPS derived cardiomyocytes from 4 replicate samples, were extracted and hybridized to 8 individual human HG-U133 Plus2.0 Affymetrix microarray gene chips, whereby each chip represented the expression profile for one cell culture at 2 days.
