TITLE
Gene Expression During the First 28 Days of Axolotl Limb Regeneration

ORGANISM
Ambystoma mexicanum

SUMMARY
Here we report the results of a robust microarray experiment that examined the first 28 days of axolotl forelimb regeneration. At each of 20 post-amputation time points, we estimated gene expression for 10 replicate RNA samples that were isolated from 1m of heterogeneous tissue collected from the distal limb tip.

DESIGN
The distal 1.0mm of heterogeneous tissue from regenerating limb tip were removed and used for RNA extraction.  10 samples were collected for each of 20 time points.
