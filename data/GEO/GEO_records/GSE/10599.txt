SMA mouse tissue exon array analysis

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix exon arrays to identify potential changes in alternative splicing between mice affect with spinal muscular atropy (SMA) and their unaffected littermates. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from spinal cord, brain and kidney of three SMA and three control mice on postnatal day 11
