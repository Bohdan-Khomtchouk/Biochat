TITLE
Examination of the MAPK pathway gene expression in patient samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of total RNA isolated from samples of circulating tumor cells from 7 patients before romidepsin infusion (0 hours), at 4 h after initiation of the infusion (4 hours) and 24 h after initiation of the infusion (24 hours).

DESIGN
MAPK pathway related genes were selected to see differences between patient blood samples after roomidepsin treatment at 0 hour, 4 hour and 24 hour.
