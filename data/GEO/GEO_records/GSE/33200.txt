TITLE
A mouse model of the most aggressive subgroup of human medulloblastoma [HT_MG-430_PM]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A series of mouse models designed to mimic pediatric medulloblastoma types in humans were tested by microarray and compared to published human medulloblastoma data

DESIGN
Myc-type tumors [dka201-203] were generated by orthotopic injection of Myc-infected cerebellar cells from Cdkn2c-/-, Trp53-/-, Atoh1-GFP mice into the cerebral cortex of immunocompromised nude mice. For Shh-type medulloblastomas [dka204-206], spontaneous medulloblastomas from [Cdkn2c-/-; Trp53Fl/Fl; Nestin-Cre] (Uziel et al.,2005 Genes Dev) were used.  FACS-sorted GFP-positive [dka220-222] and GFP-negative [dka211, 212 and 219] populations were obtained from postnatal day 6 Cdkn2c-/-, Trp53-/-, Atoh1-GFP cerebella.  Myc-type secondary tumors [dka223-225] were generated by orthotopic transplantation of cultured sphere cells from Myc-type primary tumors.
