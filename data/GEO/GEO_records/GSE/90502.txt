TITLE
miRNA-seq in MKN45 cells after stable knockdown of CUL4B expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As miRNAs are increasingly shown to be vital regulators of cellular behavior as well as diseases including cancer, it is highly important to identify and characterize miRNAs that are regulated by CUL4B. Here, 106 miRNAs were identified upregulated in MKN45-4BI cells compared with NS cells.

DESIGN
Using Illumina HiSeq 2000, we analyzed the miRNA expression levels in MKN45 cells that were stable transfected with contol(NS)or shCUL4B(4BI).
