TITLE
Differentially expressed genes in xenografts and organoids derived from human cholangiocarcinoma [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established xenografts and organoids derived from human cholangiocarcinoma. To investigate the signature of cancer stem cells, gene expression profiles were analyzed in cholangiocarcinoma xenografts and organoids (passage 7 and 32).

DESIGN
Microarray analyses were conducted in cholangiocarcioma xenografts and organoids (passage 7 and 32).
