TITLE
Genome-wide molecular profiles of HCV-induced dysplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of 75 tissue samples were analyzed representing the stepwise carcinogenic process from pre-neoplastic lesions (cirrhosis and dysplasia) to HCC, including four neoplastic stages (very early HCC to metastatic tumors) from patients with HCV infection. Gene signatures that accurately reflect the pathological progression of disease at each stage were identified and potential molecular markers for early diagnosis uncovered. Pathway analysis revealed dysregulation of the Notch and Toll-like receptor pathways in cirrhosis, followed by deregulation of several components of the Jak/STAT pathway in early carcinogenesis, then up-regulation of genes involved in DNA replication and repair and cell cycle in late cancerous stages. Keywords: 8 pathological stages of HCV-induced HCC
