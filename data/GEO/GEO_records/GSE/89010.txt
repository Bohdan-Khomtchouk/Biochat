TITLE
Haploinsufficiency of Ehmt1 or Ehmt2 is associated with an unexpected increase in H3k9 methylation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Kleefstra syndrome is human intellectual disability (ID) syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of the gene Ehmt1. The core features of this disease include severe mental retardation, autistic-like behavioral problems, developmental delay, childhood hypotonia and craniofacial abnormalities. Here, we profiled the epigenome of wild-type, Ehmt1+/- and Ehmt2+/- adult hippocampus, the main control hub for learning and memory, according to the IHEC (international human epigenome consortium) reference standards. As a result, comparative analysis of Ehmt1+/- and Ehmt2+/- epigenomes led us to hypothesize that kleefstra syndrome could belong to a novel, larger class of developmental ID disorders caused by aberrant repression of protocadherins.

DESIGN
Total of 199 sequenced samples. RNA-seq for wild type and Ehmt1+/- in multiple brain regions and developmental stages. H3k4me3 and H3k9me3 ChIP-seq for wild type and Ehmt1+/- in multiple brain regions and developmental stages. H3k36me3, H3k4me1, H3k27ac, H3k27me3, H3k9me2 for adult (P30) wild types, Ehmt1+/- and Ehmt2+/- hippocampus. DNA whole-genome bisulfate sequence for adult (P30) wild types, Ehmt1+/- and Ehmt2+/- hippocampus.

PLATFORM
