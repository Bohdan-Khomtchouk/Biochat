TITLE
Ecdysone- and stress-induced expression profile in Kc167 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Kc167 cells were mock-treated/treated with combinations of steroid hormone ecdysone and gamma-irradiation, and harvested.  The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Drosophila Genechip 1 arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes with ecdysone- and/or radiation-responsive expression patterns. Keywords: response to hormone, stress response

DESIGN
1 set of control, ecdysone, gamma-irradiated, ecdysone + irradiated samples was analyzed.
