TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryonic stem cells lacking the Alkbh1 gene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
AlkB homolog 1 (ALKBH1) is one of nine members of the AlkB homologs in mammals. Most Alkbh1-deficient mice die during embryonic development, and survivors have severe defects in tissues originating from the ectodermal lineage. We hypothesized the phenotype to rely upon aberrant epigenetic regulation and provided evidence for ALKBH1 to be a histone H2A demethylase. We used a whole genome expression microarray to detail differentially expressed genes in embryonic stem cells lacking the Alkbh1 gene and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Wild type and Alkbh-/- embryonic stem cells were established to identify differentially expressed genes at day 0, undifferentiated cells. We sought to obtain a subset of genes possibly explaining the observed phenotype. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChips. 3 parallels were analyzed from each of the two genotypes.
