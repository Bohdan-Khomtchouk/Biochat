TITLE
Regulartory effect of HNRNPL and LARP on RNA expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of RNA expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells treated with different siRNAs to define the regulatory effect of HNRNPL and LARP on RNA expression.

DESIGN
LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with the control siRNA oligos and the siRNA oligos that knockdown the expression of HNRNPL and LARP. The polyA-RNA expression difference upon different siRNA oligo treatment was evaluted.
