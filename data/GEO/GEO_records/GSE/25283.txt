TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of somatic tissues from normal and trisomic fetuses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The DNA methylation profiles in normal and abnormal fetal development were investigated using Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I. DNA methylation status of 1505 CpG dinucleotides located in the regulatory regions of 807 genes was measured in 5 somatic tissues (brain, kidney, lung, muscle and skin) from second-trimester elective terminations of eight normal, five trisomy 21 and four trisomy 18 fetuses.

DESIGN
Bisulfite-converted DNA from 60 samples were hybridized to the Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I array.
