TITLE
Expression profiling of BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines upon RAF inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray expression analysis to identify global changes in transcription in response to RAF inhibition. Genes under RAF control were identified in a panel of BRAFV600E tumor cells, following the short-term inhibition of RAF using a pan-RAF kinase inhibitor, PLX4032 (Plexxikon). For comparison with changes in gene expression in response to MEK inhibition using PD0325901 (Pfizer), the following array data was referenced: ( (accession no. GSE10086)).

DESIGN
Cell lines growing in culture (n=5) were treated with the RAF inhibitor PLX4032 (250nM or 1000nM) or vehicle alone (0.1% DMSO) as control, for eight hours.
