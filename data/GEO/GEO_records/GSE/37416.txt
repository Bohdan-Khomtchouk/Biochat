TITLE
Gene expression data from F. tularensis-exposed neutrophils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We demonstrated recently that both constitutive and FAS-triggered apoptosis of human neutrophils are profoundly impaired by Francisella tularensis, but how this is achieved is largely unknown.   To test the hypothesis that changes in neutrophil gene expression contribute to this phenotype, we used human oligonucleotide microarrays to identify differentially regulated genes in cells infected with F. tularensis strain LVS compared with uninfected controls. In order to examine the effect of F. tularensis on the neutrophil transcriptome, we performed microarray expression analysis on human neutrophils treated with F. tularensis subsp. holarctica live vaccine strain (LVS).

DESIGN
Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were isolated from the blood of healthy donors.  Control and F. tularensis-exposed PMNs were incubated at 37C for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours.
