TITLE
RNA-seq Analysis of Mineralizing IDG-SW3 Cultures with Mature Osteocyte Characteristics

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We differentiated the murine IDG-SW3 cell line for 28 days until the cells displayed a mature osteocyte-like phenotype. Triplicate cultures of the IDG-SW3 cells were then treated with 50nM PTH (1-34) or vehicle control (PBS) for 24 hours. RNA was harvested from the cultures and used to perform RNA Seq analysis. We found that many genes previously shown to be markers of the osteocyte phenotype were strongly downregulated in response to PTH treatment. Furthermore, we found that genes known to inhibit cell motility were downregulated in response to PTH, whereas genes promoting motility were upregulated. This corresponds to the increased cell motility observed in PTH-treated IDG-SW3 cell cultures. Therefore, PTH induces a switch in mature IDG-SW3 cells from a osteocyte-like cell to a more motile phenotype.

DESIGN
RNA expression profiles of control and PTH-treated 28 day differentiated IDG-SW3 cells.
