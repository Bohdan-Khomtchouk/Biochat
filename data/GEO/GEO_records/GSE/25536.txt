TITLE
Expression profiling in primary embryonic fibroblasts deficient for the lats2 locus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously reported LATS2 null mice (Yabuta et al., 2007). LATS2 known as a tumor suppressor protein. However, the LATS2 mediated transcriptional regulation remains largely unknown. To investigate potential signaling pathways, we performed the expression profiling by using primary MEFs derived from wild type and LATS2 null mice.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from MEFs derived from LATS2+/+ and LATS2-/- C57BL/6J mice using miRNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen). A Dye-swapped experiment was performed by hybridizing complimentary RNA (cRNA) labeled with either Cyanine (Cy) -3 or Cy-5 (Perkin-Elmer) onto Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray (G4122F; Agilent Technologies).
