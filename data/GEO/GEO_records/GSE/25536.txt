TITLE
Expression profiling in primary embryonic fibroblasts deficient for the lats2 locus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously reported LATS2 null mice (Yabuta et al., 2007). LATS2 known as a tumor suppressor protein. However, the LATS2 mediated transcriptional regulation remains largely unknown. To investigate potential signaling pathways, we performed the expression profiling by using primary MEFs derived from wild type and LATS2 null mice.
