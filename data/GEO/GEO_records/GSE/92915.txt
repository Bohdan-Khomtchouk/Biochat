TITLE
HCT116 cells N-BLR shRNA vs. empty vector control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HCT116 cells transfected with lentiviral vectors expressing two different N-BLR shRNAs (clones #3-1 and #4-7) and empty vector control

DESIGN
Two HCT116 stable clones expressing N-BLR shRNAs (named clones #3-1 and #4-7) compared to empty vector control. Biological replicate: two stable clones vs empty vector controls

PLATFORM
