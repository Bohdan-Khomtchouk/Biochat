TITLE
Poplar tissue types 2

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa ; Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
Global gene expression pattern of phloem and xylem tissue were determined using a Nimblegen microarray based on JGI v1.1 gene models. Xylem tissue from both Populus trichocarpa Nisqually-1 and Populus tremula X Populus alba hybrid were used in the study.

DESIGN
Xylem tissue: Three biological replicates were hybridized to three arrays Phloem tissue: Two biological replicates were hybridized to two arrays
