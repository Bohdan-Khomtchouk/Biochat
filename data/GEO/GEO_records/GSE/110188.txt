TITLE
Neuro-glial crosstalk regulates microglia activation and control of viral encephalitis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study it was possible to compare the behaviour of different myeloid cell populations upon VSV infection.

DESIGN
Non-activated microglia (Ly6G-CD45lowCD11b+Tomato+ cells) and activated microglia (Ly6G-CD45highCD11b+Tomato+ cells) from olfactory bulb and infiltrating monocytes (Ly6G-CD45highCD11bhigh-Tomato-) were FACS-sorted from Cx3cr1CreER:R26-Tomato mice in which all resident macrophages express the endogenous tomato signal while peripheral immune cells do not. The mRNA from the different populations was extracted and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq RNA-Seq. Three replicates per condition were used. As a control (reference samples) were used three replicates from non-activated microglia from non-infected mice (CCE9701-CCE9703). All the other samples are coming from VSV-infected mice.
