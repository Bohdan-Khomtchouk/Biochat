TITLE
Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays interrogated to detect allele-specific DNA modification in the brain

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It has long been hypothesized that knowledge of allele-specific modification (ASM; " modification " is used to denote various types of epigenetic cytosine marks, not only methylation) can supplement and inform GWAS of complex diseases and traits. To explore the relationship between GWAS subthreshold SNPs and ASM, we identified brain ASM-SNPs from Caucasian control individuals (n=76) and Caucasian patients affected by schizophrenia (n=65) or bipolar (n=67) using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarray, one of the most common GWAS platforms which has also been thoroughlyt validated for ASM mapping.

DESIGN
The brain samples (N=230, all ethnicities) were interrogated twice on Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarrays. First, regular SNP genotyping was performed following the manufacturer's protocol. Second, we investigated allelic differences in DNA methylation by enriching the unmodified DNA fraction using DNA methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes.
