TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in response to leptin and IL-1β in gingival fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of response to leptin and IL-1β in gingival fibroblasts at the gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that leptin and IL-1β synergistically effect the phenotype of gingival fibroblasts. Results provide important information regarding the response of gingival fibroblasts to leptin and IL-1β, such as specific inflammatory genes that were up- or down-regulated.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from gingival fibroblasts extracted from 3 human donors, stimulated in vitro for 24 h with leptin, IL-1β, leptin+IL-1β, or unstimulated as a control.
