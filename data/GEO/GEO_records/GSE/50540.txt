The microRNA bantam regulates a developmental transition in epithelial cells that restricts sensory dendrite growth

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Microarray profiling of GFP-marked epithelial cells isolated by FACS from 1st and 3rd instar wild type and mutant Drosophila larvae.

DESIGN
Multiple independent replicates collected for each population/timepoint combination.  RNA isolated and amplified from FACS-sorted populations.  Hybridized as two-color experiment against a common pooled reference.
