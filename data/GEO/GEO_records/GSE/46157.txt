TITLE
Placental gene-expression profiles of Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA microarray was applied to characterize the whole-genome expression profiles of placentas during ICP development.

DESIGN
Pregnant women were categorized evenly into three groups: healthy group; mild ICP, with serum bile-acid concentration ranging from 10â€“40 uM; and severe ICP, with bile-acid concentration > 40 uM.

PLATFORM
GPL10332 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
