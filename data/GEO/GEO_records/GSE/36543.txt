TITLE
Role and function of Sox4 in BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the function of Sox4 in ALL, we isolated bone marrow cells from Sox4 fl/fl mice and transformed them with BCR-ABL1. In a second transduction the BCR-ABL1 driven pre-B cells were transformed either with CRE-ERT2 or empty vector control (ERT2) and subjected to gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
24h after induction of deletion with 4OHT, total RNA of cells was extracted and subjected to gene expression analysis.
