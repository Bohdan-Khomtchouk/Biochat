TITLE
Identification of promoters and enhancers induced by carbon nanotube exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) applied on carbon nanotubes exposed lung tissue to identify alternative promoter and enhancer usage after 24 hr of exposure in order to investigate the nature of the response observed in these mice.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice was exposed to vehicle or multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) by intratracheal installation. 5 mice was exposed to 162 ug of MWCNTs ( XNRI-7;  lot05072001K28, Hadoga Chemical industry (formerly known as Mitsui) disolved in 0.9% NaCl  and 10% v/v cellfree cellular broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid collected from C57BL/6 mice. 6 mice was exposed to the previously decribed saline/BAL solution but without carbon nanotubes.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
