TITLE
Probing Hemogenic Precursors with Endoglin Regulatory Elements uncovers LRP2 as a Regulator of Hematopoiesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Different combinations of Endoglin tissue specific enhancers define hemangioblast and hemogenic endothelium cell fractions

DESIGN
We generated a series of embryonic stem cell lines, each targeted with reporter constructs driven by tissue specific promoter/enhancer combinations of Endoglin (ENG). The Eng promoter (P) when combined with the -8/+7/+9kb enhancers targeted cells in FLK1 mesoderm that were enriched for blast colony forming potential, whereas the P/-8kb enhancer targeted TIE2+/c-KIT+/CD41- HE cells that were enriched for hematopoietic potential. These cell fractions were isolated and their transcriptomes profiled by RNA-seq.
