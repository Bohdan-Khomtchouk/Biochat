TITLE
Rapid Genome-Scale Mapping of Chromatin Accessibility in Tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we introduce a novel technique that specifically identifies Tissue Accessible Chromatin (TACh). The TACh method uses pulverized frozen tissue as starting material and employs one of the two robust endonucleases, Benzonase or Cyansase, which are fully active under a range of stringent conditions such as high levels of detergent and DTT. As a proof of principle we applied TACh to frozen mouse liver tissue. Combined with massive parallel sequencing TACh identifies accessible regions that are associated with euchromatic features and accessibility at transcriptional start sites correlates positively with levels of gene transcription.

DESIGN
Idetification of accessible chromatin in forzen adult mouse liver tissue

PLATFORM
