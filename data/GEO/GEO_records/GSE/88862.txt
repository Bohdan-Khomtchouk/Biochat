TITLE
Examine the expression profiles of lncRNAs in early stage lung squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further understand the expression pattern of long non-coding RNAs in early stage lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we have employed the Arraystar Human LncRNA Microarray V3.0 profiling as a discovery platform to identify lncRNAs which are differentially expressed in early stage lung SCC. Three pairs of tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues of early stage lung SCC patients are used for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Three pairs of tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues of early stage lung SCC patients are used for microarray analysis.
