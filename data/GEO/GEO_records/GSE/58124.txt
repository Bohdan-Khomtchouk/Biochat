TITLE
Evaluation of MicroRNA Expression Profiles for Form-Deprivation Myopia in Mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study aim was to determine microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of ocular tissues in form-deprivation induced myopia (FDM) mice. Form-deprivation myopia was induced in C57BL/6Jmice over the right eye; the contralateral left eyes were used as controls. Whole genome microRNA expression profiles in myopic whole eye, retina, and sclera were determined using the Agilent mouse miRNA microarray. The normalized microarray data were performed ANOVA test to identify differences in miRNA expression between myopic and control eyes. The differential expression for selected miRNAs was validated by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR).

DESIGN
Fifteen C57BL/6J mice were used in this study.  Form-deprivation myopia was induced over the right eyes; the contralateral left eyes were used as controls. Total RNA was isolated from the whole eye (6 mice), retina (9 mice), and sclera (9 mice) and was used for miRNA expression profiling with the Agilent Mouse miRNA v.15 Microarray.
