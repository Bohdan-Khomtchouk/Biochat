TITLE
Transcriptome Profiles in Normal Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells after Exposure to Î³-rays and different HZE particles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Distinct transcriptome profiles in response to low-LET and high-LET, and different radiation qualities of HZE particles.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HBEC3KT cells after 1, 4, 12 and 24 hours of radiation. Mock-irradiated samples at each time point and control samples before radiation (0 hour) were also collected.
