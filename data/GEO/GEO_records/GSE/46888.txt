TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression by human Umblical Cord (UCB)-CD34+ Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) and human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived CD34+ Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (HPCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are a rare, self-renewing bone marrow resident population capable of giving rise to all circulating hematopoietic cells. They can be used therapuetically for reconstituting defective or ablated hematopoietic systems following chemotherapy, and for inducing tolerance toward allografts of the same haplotype as the HSC donor. There are several sources for HSCs, such as the adult bone marrow, or umblical cord blood, which is more replete with such HSCs. However, HSCs obtained from such sources may be immunogenic, especially if isolated from adult bone marrow. To overcome this issue, our lab has establsihed human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived HPCs with the hope of creating a nonimmunogenic, readily available and unlimited source of HSCs to use for therapy. The goal of this study was to compare the gene expression profiles of naturally found HSCs (UCB-CD34+ HSCs) and HPCs differentiated from 4 different human iPS cell lines (iPS-HPCs), so as to determine the variation between the four iPS-HPCs and whether there were any differences between these HPCs and naturally found HSCs.

DESIGN
We utilized 4 iPS cells for this study (detailed descriptions are provided below). iPS cells were differentiated into hematopoietic progenitor cells by coculture on OP9 stromal cells, followed by enrichment of CD34+ cells through immunomagnetic bead separation. The UCB-CD34+ cells were isolated from frozen cord samples through immunomagnetic bead separation. Total RNA was isolated and human gene  Affymetrix ST 1.0 arrays performed at the University of Iowa DNA core facility. Data was analyzed, normalized and plotted on BRB Array Tools.
