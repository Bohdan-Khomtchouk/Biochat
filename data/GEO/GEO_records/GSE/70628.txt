TITLE
Transcriptional respose at 18hrs in Interferon treated lungs from C57BL/6 wt mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to analyse the global programme of gene expression in response to intranasal interferon treatment (IFNa4 and IFNl2) in lungs from C57BL/6 wt mice

DESIGN
IFNa4, IFNl2 or Vehcile Control treated lungs from C57BL/6 mice taken at 18hr post treatment (intranasal). Whole lungs collected and processed for expression profiling
