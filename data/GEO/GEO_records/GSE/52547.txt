TITLE
Medullary Thymic Epitherlial Cell (mTEC) Gene Expression in MBD1 WT and KO Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore global gene expression using microarray analysis in mTEC's isolated from MBD1 WT and MBD1 KO mice

DESIGN
mTECs were sorted by flow cytometry from 30 day old MBD1 WT and KO Mice.  4 biological replicates were performed for both MBD1 WT and KO mice (1 replicate of each failed quality control and wasd removed from the analysis).

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
