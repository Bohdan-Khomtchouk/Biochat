TITLE
SPROUTY2 target genes in human colon carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of SPROUTY2 (SPRY2) in human colon cancer is controversial. Our data support a tumorigenic action of SPRY2. We use microarrays to identify SPRY2 target genes in human SW480 ADH colon carcinoma cell line.

DESIGN
RNA was obtained from SW480 ADH cells, Mock transfected or transfected with WT or two differents SPRY2 genes mutants. Hybridization was performed on Affymetrix microarrays. We performed three independent experiments.  Each experiment was conducted in triplicate.
