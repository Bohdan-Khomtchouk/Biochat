TITLE
Analysis of gene expression during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of rat primary thymocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Glucocorticoids induce rapid apoptosis of rat primary thymocytes through mechanisms requiring altered gene expression. The determination of genes regulating glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes has received considerable attention. However, the role of specific non-coding microRNAs in the regulation of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes is poorly   defined. Using deep sequencing analysis, we have identified microRNAs differentially expressed during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of rat primary thymocytes. We have also identified numerous loci that harbor probable novel microRNAs. Furthermore, we have validated the glucocorticoid-responsive expression of 2 novel microRNAs in the apoptotic rat primary thymocyte. These 2 novel microRNAs are predicted to target numerous messenger RNAs throughout the genome. Using whole genome expression analysis, we now seek to correlate the altered expression of these novel microRNAs with the expression of their predicted target mRNAs during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of rat primary thymocyes (3 biological replicates) were measured after 6 hours of 100nM dexamethasone treatment in-vitro.
