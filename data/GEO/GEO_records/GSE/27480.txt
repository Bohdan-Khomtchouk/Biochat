TITLE
Gene-expression analysis of Oncostatin-M (OSM) signalling in cervical squamous cell carcinomas over-expressing the Oncostatin-M receptor (OSMR)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The type II Oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) serves as the main binding site for the pleiotropic cytokine OSM. We have previously demonstrated a positive correlation between copy number driven OSMR over-expression and adverse clinical outcome in cervical tumours and have also established enhanced angiogenic, migratory and invasive potential as major consequences of OSMR over-expression using cell-line models of cervical cancer. By analysis of gene expression patterns in cell lines and tumours, this study now systematically defines cohorts of genes that are implicated for the phenotypes observed. Importantly, we have identified 15 OSM induced genes that are involved in at least one of these key functions and are up-regulated in both OSMR over-expressing cell-lines and tumours. These genes can serve as markers of OSM signalling in OSMR over-expressing SCCs and represent suitable targets for functional characterisation.

DESIGN
Gene expression of 4 cervical SCC cell lines analysed (2 with and 2 without OSMR overexpression) at 6 different time-points,  with 3 replicates at each time-point.
