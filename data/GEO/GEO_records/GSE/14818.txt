TITLE
Gene expression analysis of glioblastoma spheroid cultures I

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based gene expression analysis identified genes differentially expressed in 10 glioblastoma spheroid cultures compared to normal brain.

DESIGN
In this study, a set of 10 glioblastoma spheroid cultures was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 16 441  transcripts, leading to the identification of differentially expressed genes compared to normal brain by Significance Analysis of Microarray dada.
