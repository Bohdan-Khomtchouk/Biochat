TITLE
CREB3L1 Target Genes in Response to Hepatitis C Replicon Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Membrane-bound transcription factor CREB3L1 undergoes Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP) in response to Hepatitis C infection.  RIP activates CREB3L1 so that it can prevent the growth of HCV infected cells through the action of downstream genes.  We over-expressed a truncated form of CREB3L1 that does not require RIP to enter the nucleus.  Cells over-expressing this truncated form were isolated by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). We used microarray to determine the downstream genes of CREB3L1 in comparison to a flow sorted empty vector control.

DESIGN
HCV Replicon-containing cells were transfected with a CREB3L1Î”381-519 to determine the downstream genes.
