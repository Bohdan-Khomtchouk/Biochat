TITLE
Hs 294T Cells Treated with Elesclomol Alone or in Combination with NAC Compared to DMSO Treated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail gene expression changes in Hs 294T human melanoma cells after treatment with elesclomol alone, or in combination with NAC, to aide in identifing the mechnism of action of elesclomol. Keywords: treatment

DESIGN
Hs 294T human melanoma cells were grown in vitro.  They were seeded at a low density and were left untreated, treated with the vehicle, treated with elesclomol, treated with NAC, or treated in combination with both elesclomol and NAC.  The cells treated with NAC were given the NAC 30 minutes prior to additional treatments.  They were incubated for 6 hours before harvesting.
