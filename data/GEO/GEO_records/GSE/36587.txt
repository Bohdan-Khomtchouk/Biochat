TITLE
Transcriptional events during lung recovery from MRSA infection: a mouse pneumonia model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is an emerging threat to human health throughout the world. Rodent MRSA pneumonia models mainly focus on the early innate immune responses to MRSA infection. However, the molecular pattern and mechanisms of recovery from MRSA lung infection are largely unknown. In this study, a nonlethal mouse MRSA pneumonia model was employed to investigate events during lung recovery from MRSA infection. We compared lung bacterial clearance, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) characterization, lung histology, and gene expression profiling between Day 1 and Day 3 post-MRSA infection. Compared to Day 1 post-infection, bacterial colony counts and both BALF total cell number and protein concentration significantly decreased at Day 3 post-infection. Lung cDNA microarray analysis identified 47 significantly up-regulated and 35 down-regulated genes (p < 0.01, 1.5-fold change [up and down]). Changes in eight genes were confirmed by real-time PCR. The pattern of gene expression suggests lung recovery is characterized by enhanced cell division, vascularization, and wound healing and by adjustment in host adaptive immune responses. Collectively, this data helps elucidate the molecular mechanisms of lung recovery after MRSA infection.

DESIGN
RNA expression analysis was performed using the Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA), which provides coverage of approximately 25,700 genes and expressed sequence tags. Four independent mouse lung tissue samples at Day 1 and Day 3 post-MRSA infection were used in this study.
