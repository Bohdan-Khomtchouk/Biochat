TITLE
Transcriptional response to MnSOD over-expression in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Profiled the transcriptional response to over-expression Manganese-SOD (MnSOD) in adult Drosophila.  A doxycycline-regulated system was employed to induce MnSOD over-expression,  resulting in mean and maximal lifespan increases of ~ 20%. Examination of the genome-wide response to this lifespan intervention provided key insights into the molecular basis of aging. Keywords: genetic modification; MnSOD over-expression

DESIGN
20 Affymetrix DrosGenome1 arrays were employed with four replicates for each of five conditions. Cohorts of treated and untreated MnSOD transgenic flies were sampled at the same chronological age (~50% survival of -DOX flies, day 73) as well as, at the same physiological age (~50% survival for +DOX and -DOX flies, day 83 and day 73, respectively). The effect of DOX was controlled for by sampling control flies treated with or without DOX at the same chronological age (~50% survival of -DOX flies, day 78).
