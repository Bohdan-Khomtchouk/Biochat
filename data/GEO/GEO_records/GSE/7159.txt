TITLE
Transcriptional response to MnSOD over-expression in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Profiled the transcriptional response to over-expression Manganese-SOD (MnSOD) in adult Drosophila.  A doxycycline-regulated system was employed to induce MnSOD over-expression,  resulting in mean and maximal lifespan increases of ~ 20%. Examination of the genome-wide response to this lifespan intervention provided key insights into the molecular basis of aging. Keywords: genetic modification; MnSOD over-expression
