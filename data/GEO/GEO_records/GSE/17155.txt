TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling of male breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test the hypothesis that there is a specific miRNA expression signature which characterizes male breast cancers, we performed miRNA microarray analysis in a series of male breast cancers and compared them to cases of male gynecomastia and female breast cancers

DESIGN
miRNA microarray analysis was performed in a series of 23 male breast cancers, 5 cases of gynecomastia and 10 female ductal breast carcinomas
