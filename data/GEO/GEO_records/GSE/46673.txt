TITLE
Candidatus pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062 requires 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine, an abundant thiamine precursor in the sea

ORGANISM
Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062

SUMMARY
Thiamine is often undetectable in ocean surface waters where Pelagibacter cells are numerically abundant.  Despite this, Pelagibacter cells are missing de novo thiamine synthesis pathways.  We show that an eogenous source of the thiamine precursor HMP is required for thiamine synthesis in Pelagibacter and that this precursor is abundant in the Sargasso sea.

DESIGN
Batch cultures of P. ubique were grown in a defined arificial seawater media. Three cultures were given no thiamine amendment, and three other cultures received an excess concentration of thiamine. Cultures were harvested for microarray analyses just prior to and after thiamine limitation for the purpose of observing differences in gene expression related to thiamine limitation.
