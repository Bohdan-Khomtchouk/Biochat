TITLE
Candidatus pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062 requires 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine, an abundant thiamine precursor in the sea

ORGANISM
Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1002

SUMMARY
Thiamine is often undetectable in ocean surface waters where Pelagibacter cells are numerically abundant.  Despite this, Pelagibacter cells are missing de novo thiamine synthesis pathways.  We show that an eogenous source of the thiamine precursor HMP is required for thiamine synthesis in Pelagibacter and that this precursor is abundant in the Sargasso sea.
