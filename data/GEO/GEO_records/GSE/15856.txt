TITLE
Electric stimulation of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Study on changes in gene expression in primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes to electric stimulation. Through comparing non-stimulated, stimulated and blebbistatin supplemented and stimulated cultures we set out to identify the genes that are specifically activated by electric pulsing separate from cardiomyocyte contractions.

DESIGN
After initial recovery phase, primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were cultured for 3 days without pulsing, with electric pulsing or with electric pulsing combined with blebbistatin. Per treatment: 3 arrays, with samples obtained from 3 separate series of cardiomyocyte isolation and culturing. Per array: sample prepared from pooled (1:1) RNA from duplicate experiments.
