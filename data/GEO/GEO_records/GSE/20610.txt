TITLE
Liver transcriptome profiling of liver specific miR-122 knockout and control male mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Liver transcriptome profiling of liver specific miR-122 knockout (miR-122loxP/loxP Alb-Cre) and control (miR-122loxP/loxP) male mice. Expression profile of several hundred mRNAs that include miR-122 targets were altered in miR-122 KO livers. Loss of miR-122 in the germ line resulted in significant changes in hepatic gene expression profile.  Among the upregulated genes many are direct targets of miR-122

DESIGN
GSM517838-GSM517847: Liver transcriptome profiling of liver specific miR-122 knockout and control male mice. Total liver RNA from 8 week old five control and five liver-specific miR-122 knock out male mice (C57/BL6J background) GSM791601-GSM791604: Liver transcriptome profiling of germ-line miR-122 knockout and control male mice. Liver RNA from 5 week old control (floxed) and miR-122KO mice were analyzed by mouse whole transcriptome profiling.
