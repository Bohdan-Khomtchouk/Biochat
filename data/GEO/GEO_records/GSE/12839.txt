TITLE
Expression data from human PBMC samples exposed to IL-12 and paired controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) is known to play a central role in adaptive and innate immunity. We employed microarray analysis of IL-12 induced gene expression to provide further insights into its effects on immune response. Keywords: Paired study of expression levels: Treated vs. Control

DESIGN
PBMC's were isolated from 7 healthy NIH blood bank donors.  For each donor, expression levels were measured for PBMCs stimulated with IL-12 and for unstimulated controls, using the Affymetrix Human Genome HG-U133A and HG-U133B GeneChips.
