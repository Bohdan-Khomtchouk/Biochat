TITLE
Transcription Profiling of Malaria-Naïve and Semi-Immune Colombian Volunteers in a Plasmodium vivax Sporozoite Challenge [RT-PCR]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole blood gene expression was monitored in 85 samples using a Fluidigm nanoscale RT-qPCR array targeting 96 genes that we refer to as “blood informative transcripts” (BIT). There was no evidence for transcriptional changes prior to the appearance of blood stage parasite at day 12 or 13, at which time there was a strong interferon response and, unexpectedly, down-regulation of transcripts related to inflammation and innate immunity. This samples are related with the samples with accession number GSE67184

DESIGN
Reverse Transcription followed by quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using Fluidigm 96×96 nanofluidic arrays targeting a set of 96 transcripts that are broadly informative of the major axes of variation for peripheral blood gene expression from Preininger et al. (2013) at six time-points (Pre-challenge, day 5, day 7, day 9, Diagnosis (Dx) and month 4).
