TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of adult adrenocortical cells gene expression after 48 h ACTH treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of ACTH-regulation on adrenocortical cells at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that ACTH increases chronic cell growth and steroidogenesis in adrenal glands by changing the gene expression profile. Results provide important information of the response of adrenocortical cells gene expression to chronic ACTH treatment.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from primary cultured adult adrenal cells subjected to 48 hours in vitro treatment of ACTH compared to untreated control cell.
