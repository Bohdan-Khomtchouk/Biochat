TITLE
Expression data of LPS-stimulated macrophages in wild-type and LysM-Cre+;Akirin2fl/fl mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Akirin2 is an evolutionally conserved nuclear protein involved in the regulation of a set of inflammatory gene expression in various cell types. We used microarrays to examine the effect of Akirin2 deficiency in LPS-inducible gene expression in macrophages

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from wild-type and LysM-Cre+;Akirin2fl/fl mice were stimulated with LPS for 0, 2 and 4 hours, followed by RNA extraction and microarray analysis.
