TITLE
Murine hepatocellular carcinoma of MCL1-/- transgenic mice and age matched alb cre mice - 12 months old.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
aCGH analysis of murine transgenic liver tissues affected with HCC, hybridized with age (12 months) and sex matched alb cre mice. Keywords: Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis (aCGH).

DESIGN
Independent HCC of MCL1-/- mice were hybridized with pooled wt mice. Mclâ€‘1flox/flox mice (C57BL/6 background) were obtained from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA (Opferman JT et al., Nature 2003) and bred to heterozygous Albumin-Cre mice (C57BL/6 background) which led to hepatocyte-specific deletion of Mcl-1. The mice develop severe chronic liver damage (Vick B et al., Hepatology, 2009).
