TITLE
Murine Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, PPE Model - In Vivo Modulation of miRNA-24 (Day 7)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of infrarenal aortic tissue from Male 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice after AAA-induction with porcine pancreatic elastase, compared with sham-operated saline-injected mice. One day after AAA-induction, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with either lentiviral packaged miR-24 antagomir (anti-miR-24) or miR-24 mimic (pre-miR-24), or a scrambled microRNA control (scr-miR). Aortic samples were obtained 7 days after operation. The goal was to examine gene expression in developing AAA in this model, and to compare the effects of scr-miR, anti-miR-24 and pre-miR-24.

DESIGN
Four condition experiment, one infrarenal aorta per array. Sham vs. scr-miR-PPE vs. anti-miR-24-PPE vs. pre-miR-24-PPE, all harvested at Day 7 post-operatively. After QC, the final analysis group (uploaded here) consisted of 18 arrays: Sham-Saline-treated (4 arrays), scr-miR-PPE-treated (5 arrays); pre-miR-24-PPE-treated (3 arrays); and anti-miR-24-PPE-treated (6 arrays).
