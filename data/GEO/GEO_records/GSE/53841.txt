TITLE
Whole blood DNA methylation samples from HIV positive men [2012 study]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiles of whole blood from HIV positive men. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 480,000 CpGs. Dataset included 24 subjects from the USA. This data set was used as validation set for studying the effect of HIV viral load on host DNA methylation levels.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 24 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip. Subjects had different levels of HIV viral load. This dataset reports DNA methylation data set on 24 subjects that were generated in 2012 (while the other data set of 120 subjects reports DNA meth data generated in 2013). Details on what each sample characteristics and their values represent are provided in the 'characteristics_readme.txt' file.
