TITLE
Expression of Human naïve B cell priming for plasma cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore events that govern the differentiation of human naïve B cells (NBCs) into memory B cells and plasma cells (PCs), we designed an in vitro 2-step culture model leading non-switched NBC precursors to differentiate into two cell compartments: CD20loCD38hi and CD20+CD38+. Both populations are characterized by distinct cell fates, the former one corresponding to plasmablasts that undergo PC terminal differentiation, with intermingled relationship between cell division and bona fide differentiation two events that are usually viewed as mutually exclusive. Postulating that extracellular cues mediated by distinct receptor-ligand interactions are likely involved in this phenomenon we explored one by one factors used in our model and found that T-cell-produced IL-2 was critical for the PC’s commitment. Interestingly, this IL-2 effect operates independently of proliferation and survival functions and required an ERK signaling. Based on our study we proposed to complete previous scheme of PRDM1/Blimp-1 controlling PC differentiation by adding the T-cell-delivered IL-2 effect, which sustains indirectly the mitogenic-induced Blimp-1 expression by downregulating IRF8 and BACH2 via an ERK signal This study highlight early events that could take place when cognate B and T cells meet and interact before seeding follicle, where crucial inputs may condition final GC B destiny.

DESIGN
GEP was performed on the RNA of purified B cells from 3 healthy blood donors, stimulated at Day 0 and with addition or not of IL-2. Four time points were assessed Day 0, Day 0+16h, Day 0+22h and Day 4.
