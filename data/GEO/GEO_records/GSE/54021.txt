TITLE
Circadian behavior is light-reprogrammed by plastic DNA methylation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The timing of daily “circadian” behavior can be highly variable among different individuals, and twin studies suggest that about half of this variability is environmentally controlled.  Similar plasticity can be seen in mice exposed to an altered lighting environment – for example, 22-hour days instead of 24-hour ones – which stably alters the genetically determined period of circadian behavior for months.  The mechanisms mediating these environmental influences are unknown.  Here, we show that transient exposure of mice to such lighting stably alters global transcription in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (the SCN, the “master clock” tissue determining circadian behavior in mammals). We have also showed that, these changes in transcription are due to change in DNA methylation in the SCN. Indeed, genome-wide methylation profiling revealed global alterations in promoter DNA methylation in the SCN.  Importantly, infusion of a methyltransferase inhibitor to the SCN during 22-hour days suppressed period changes.  We also found that these behavioral and DNA methylation changes are reversible upon entrainment to 24-hours days. We conclude that the SCN utilizes DNA methylation as a mechanism to drive circadian clock plasticity. MeDIP array of profiling,  demonstrated that genomicDNA methylation changes in mice entrained to short-T cycle.
