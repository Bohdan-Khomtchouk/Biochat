TITLE
Gene expression in rice roots in response to inoculation with rice blast fungus

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice roots grown in hydroponic culture were inoculated with rice blast fungus and gene expression profiles were analyzed by microarray

DESIGN
Roots of two isogenic lines of rice cv Nipponbare (blast-resistance gene: Pia or pia) were inoculated with rice blast fungus, P91-15B, carrying avirulence gene, AvrPia.  Total RNA was isolated from crown roots, labeled with cy3, and probed with agilent rice oligoarray (4x44).
