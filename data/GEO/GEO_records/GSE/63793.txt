TITLE
Rb family triple knock out liver progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This serie was performed on liver progenitor isolated based on their expression of the Sca1 surface marker. It contains two independent samples from Rb family deficient liver and three independent samples from control liver, all isolated 2 weeks after Tamoxifen-induced Rb family ablation. Hematopoietic (CD45, Ter119) and endothelial (CD31) markers were used as negative selection markers to exclude blood or endothelial cells from the isolated fraction.

DESIGN
Each liver was digested to obtain single cell suspension. Cells were positively enriched on column for Sca1 expression and further stained with antibodies against CD45, Ter119 and Cd31. Each sample represents 20-30K cells isolated by flow cytometry and sorted directly into Trizol
