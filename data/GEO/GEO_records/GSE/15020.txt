TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of bovine mammary gland tissue treated with E. coli for 24 hours

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
By comparison of the transcriptome profiles of infected and healthy udder tissue we analyse gene expression in the late stage of infection with E. coli 1303. Differentially expressed genes and transcription factors regulating coexpressed genes identified by SOTA clustering were used to identify key genes that define late stage of infection with E. coli 1303.

DESIGN
10 samples, two conditions: E. coli treated for 24h vs healthy control * five replicates

PLATFORM
