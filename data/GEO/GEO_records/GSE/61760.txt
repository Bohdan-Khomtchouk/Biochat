TITLE
DNA methylation dynamics during cotton ovule and fiber development [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is essential for plant and animal development. In plants, methylation occurs at CG, CHG, and CHH (H = A, C or T) sites. CHH methylation is established by the small RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. Cotton is an allotetraploid consisting of two progenitor genomes, and each cotton fiber is a rapidly-elongating cell from the ovule epidermis. Here we show that inhibiting DNA methylation impairs fiber development. Genome-wide bisulfite -, mRNA-, and small RNA-sequencing analyses reveal that CHH hypermethyaltion through RdDM in euchromatin is associated with expression changes of nearby genes in ovules. The ovule-derived fiber cells not only maintain euchromatic CHH hypermethylation, but also generate additional heterochromatic CHH hypermethylation independent of RdDM. Moreover, CHG and CHH methylation in promoter and transcribed regions contribute to the expression bias of homoeologous genes in the allotetraploid cotton. This epigenetic and expression dynamics of developmental regulation could provide a molecular basis for natural selection and domestication of plants and animals.

DESIGN
Libraries for MethylC-seq with two replicates, small RNA-seq with three replicates and mRNA-seq with two replicates were constructed using leaves, ovules at 0 DPA and 14 DPA, fibers at 14 DPA of Gossypium hirsutum cv. TM-1. These libraries were sequenced using Hiseq 2500.
