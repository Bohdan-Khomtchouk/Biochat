TITLE
DPYS as a potential diagnostic biomarker in hereditary and sporadic PRCC2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Papillary renal cell carcinoma type 2 (PRCC2) is known to be very aggressive type of tumor without effictive therapy. Hereditary form of PRCC2 is caused by Fumarate Hydratase (FH) gene mutation that accompanied Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Carcinoma (HLRCC) disorder. In sporadic form of PRCC2 the mutation of FH gene has not been reported. Both forms of tumors have the similar histopathological characteristics with poor survival prognosis. In this study, we profiled the gene expression of renal tumors and normal tissue from PRCC2 (hereditary and sporadic) patients in order to better understand commonalities and differences in the transcriptional landscape of PRCC2.

DESIGN
Microarray gene expression profiling was performed on eight normal kidney tissue samples, five hereditary PRCC2 tumor tissue samples and 19 sporadic PRCC2 tumor tissue samples. Hereditary PRCC2 (HPRCC2) patients were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the FH gene.
