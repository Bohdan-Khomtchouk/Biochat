TITLE
Widespread and tissue specific age-related DNA methylation changes in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
genomic DNA is isolated from C57BL/6 mice intestine at 3.1 months old females and 35.2 months old male.  We used MCAM to identify genes that have age-related methylation changes.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, old vs. young mice intestine.
