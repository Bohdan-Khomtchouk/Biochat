TITLE
Early Response Genes in Osteoblasts Exposed to Dynamic Fluid Flow

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cyclic mechanical loads applied to the skeleton increase bone formation. Dynamic fluid flow is a potent anabolic stimulus for cultured osteoblasts. In this study, gene profiles involved in mediating the anabolic response of MC3T3 osteoblasts to dynamic fluid flow are investigated.

DESIGN
MC3T3 osteoblast RNA was harvested 30-minutes and 1-hour post-stimulation respectively as experimental samples for comparison to the control group without dynamic fluid flow.
