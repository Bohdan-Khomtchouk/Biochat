TITLE
RNA-seq expression data from EB-HSPCs after HOXA7 overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HOXA7 regulates FL-HSPC self-renewal in vitro and in vivo. We profiled  EB-HSPCs after HOXA7 overexpression (EB-HOXA7), or with a control vector (EB-CTR), to assess the gene expression programs regulated by HOXA7.

DESIGN
CD34+CD38-CD43+CD90+ HSPCs were infected with lentiviral FUGW vector either empty (FUGW-GFP) or encoding HOXA7(FUGW-GFP-HOXA7) protein. Cells were expanded on op9 for 15 days and than sorted for GFP HSPC immunophenotype.
