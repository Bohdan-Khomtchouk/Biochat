TITLE
ChIP-on-chip from murine myeloid cell line M1 and virus-induced myeloid leukemia cell lines for H3K4me3, H3K9/14ac, H3K4me1, H3K27me3, H3K9me3 and CTCF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Histone modifcations and CTCF binding at the c-myb locus were compared in cell lines with c-myb expressing, which are myeloblatic M1 cells and leukemia cells with virus integration, VS. M1 cells without c-myb expression induced by IL-6. Distribution of active histone marks at the c-myb gene and the upstream regions are associated with active c-myb transcription. The enrichment of all of these active histone marks decreased with differentiation-induced down-regulation of c-myb, but increased and spread in tumor cells.
