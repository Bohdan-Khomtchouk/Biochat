TITLE
Pathway analysis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (PCNSL) is a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) confined to the CNS. A genome-wide gene expression comparison between PCNSL and non-CNS DLBCL was performed, the latter consisting of both nodal and extranodal DLBCL (nDLBCL and enDLBCL), to identify a “CNS signature.” Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: PCNSL vs. nDLBCL and enDLBCL. Biological replicates: 13 PCNSL, 19 enDLBCL, 11 nDLBCL. Common reference on all arrays. No dye-swaps. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL6848 Agilent-012391 Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray G4112A (Probe Name version)
