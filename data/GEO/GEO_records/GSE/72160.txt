TITLE
Small RNAs in rice cultivar Kasalath (Oryza sativa L.) induced by high temperatures during germination

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The impact of global warming on weather patterns raises concerns for agriculture management. Using NGS technologies, we identified the miRNA profile that is expressed in rice cultivar grown at two different temperatures. We observed 118 and 100 miRNAs uniquely expressed at 35째C and 25째C respectively. Potential targets of these miRNAs have been identified. An interesting example, would be mir1863b which targets Os07g46670.3; a homologue of the ERD15 gene in Arabidopsis which is involved in dehydration stress response.

DESIGN
miRNA profiles were generated using the Illumina Miseq sequencer for rice cultivar biological triplicate samples grown under temperature conditions of 35째C and 25째C respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL20819 Illumina MiSeq (Oryza sativa)
