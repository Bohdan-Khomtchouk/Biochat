TITLE
Analysis of microRNA expression profile in malignant glioma tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Malignant gliomas represent the most devastating group of brain tumors in adults, among which glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) exhibits the highest malignancy rate. Despite combined modality treatment, GBM recurs and is invariably fatal. A further insight into molecular background of gliomagenesis is required to improve patient outcome. The first aim of this study was to gain broad information on miRNA expression pattern in malignant gliomas, mainly GBM. We investigated the global miRNA profile of malignant glioma tissues by means of miRNA microarrays, deep sequencing and meta-analysis. We selected miRNAs the most frequently deregulated in glioblastoma tissues as well as peritumoral brain areas in comparison to normal human brain. We found candidate miRNAs contributing to progression from gliomas grade III to gliomas grade IV. The meta-analysis of miRNA profiling studies in GBM tissues summarizes the past and recent advances in an investigation of miRNA signature in GBM versus noncancerous human brain and provides a comprehensive overview. We proposed a set of 35 miRNAs which expression is the most frequently deregulated in GBM patients and 30 miRNA candidates recognized as novel GBM biomarkers.
