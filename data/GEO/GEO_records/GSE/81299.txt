TITLE
Identification of Kdm4a and c target genes in MLL-AF9 transformed mouse GMPs (L-GMP) [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we identify genes, that are bound by Kdm4a and Kdm4c in L-GMP cells.

DESIGN
MLL-AF9 transformed L-GMP cell lines conditional knockout for Kdm4a, b and c, were derived from leukemic mice.  The cells were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen and chromatin was prepared from untreated cells (Ctrl) and cells treated for 96hr.
