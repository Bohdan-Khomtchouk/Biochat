TITLE
Gene expression analysis of mice liver tumors isolated from β2SP+/-; SMAD3+/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out in two liver tumors and one normal liver isolated from β2SP+/-; SMAD3+/- mice, and one normal liver isolated from wild type mouse. Whole-transcriptome sequencing of these 4 liver tissues.

DESIGN
Whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing of the 4 different samples

PLATFORM
