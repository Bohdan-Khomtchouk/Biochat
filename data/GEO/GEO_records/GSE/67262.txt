TITLE
Analysis of genes expressed differentially along the AP and ML axis of chick optic tectum

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcription profiles on anterior tectum and posterior tectum at HH35 an HH37, and that of medial and lateral tectum at HH30 and HH35. The goal was to obtain summary of genes expressed differentially across the AP and DV axis.

DESIGN
60 samples pooled together to normalize for biological variations. No biological replicates taken for experiments. No technical replicates or dye swaps.
