TITLE
In vitro gene expression profile of TGFbeta-regulated genes in MCF10A-based xenograft model of breast cancer progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGF-betas have complex roles in tumorigenesis, with context-dependent effects that can either suppress or promote tumor progression. Our goal was to use integrated genomic approaches in a model of human breast cancer progression to identify core TGF-beta-regulated genes that specifically reflect the tumor suppressor activity of TGF-beta. The model consisted of the non-tumorigenic MCF10A (“M1”), the premalignant MCF10AT1k.cl2 (“M2”), the early malignant MCF10Ca1h (“M3”) and the highly malignant, metastatic MCF10Ca1a.cl1 (“M4”) cell lines.  We have previously shown that tumor suppressor activity of TGF-beta is lost in the highly malignant M4 cells. To determine how the spectrum of TGF-beta-regulated genes changes with cancer progression, we performed gene expression array analysis on  four cell lines of the MCF10A-based model of breast cancer progression (M1-M4) cultured in vitro under serum-free conditions and treated with TGF-beta (5ng/ml plus condition) or vehicle (minus condition) for 1h or 6h.

DESIGN
The cell lines used consisted of the non-tumorigenic MCF10A (“M1”), the premalignant MCF10AT1k.cl2 (“M2”), the early malignant MCF10Ca1h (“M3”) and the highly malignant, metastatic MCF10Ca1a.cl1 (“M4”). M1-M4 cells were treated in vitro with 5ng/ml of TGF-b1 or vehicle for 1hour and 6 hour.  RNA was isolated for gene expression analysis. Three biological replicates for each condition were analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human ST1.0 array (total of 48 CEL.files).
