TITLE
miRNA expression-based, individualized outcome prediction for SDT treatment in melanoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Individualized outcome prediction classifiers were successfully constructed through expression profiling of a total of 3100 capture probes, covering all human, mouse and rat microRNAs annotated in miRBase 18.0, in 8 melanoma samples divided into 4 groups (Control, ALA, US, and SDT group).

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a consecutively operated, well-defined cohort of 8 melanoma cases was used to acquire miRNA expression profiles with Exiqon arrays based on miRBase 18.0.
