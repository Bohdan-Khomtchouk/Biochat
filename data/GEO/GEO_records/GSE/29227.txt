TITLE
aCGH profiling of prostate tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment was an aCGH study on 86 prostate tumors samples. The samples were profiled on Agilent Human Genome 44karrays to identify recurrent regions of deletion and amplification, thus revealing potential new tumor suppressor genes and/or oncogenes involved in prostate cancer. The CGH profile on the 44k arrays revealed a deletion at 5q21 in 17% of samples.

DESIGN
CGH analysis of 86 prostate tumor samples.
