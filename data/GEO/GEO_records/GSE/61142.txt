TITLE
Effects of the insulin degrading enzyme silencing on the transcriptome of HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) is a major enzyme responsible for insulin degradation in the liver. The modulation of insulin degrading enzyme activity is hypothesized to be a link between T2DM and liver cancer. Results provide insight into role of IDE in proliferation and other cell functions.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were transfected with 96nM siRNA for IDE or AllStars Negative Control siRNA (Qiagen) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 16 h after transfection, cells were treated with 10 nM insulin (Sigma Aldrich) or vehicle for 24 h in serum starvation condition. Total RNA was extracted. For each of the 4 conditions, 3 biological replicates were included.
