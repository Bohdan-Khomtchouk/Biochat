TITLE
CTCF/CP190 and ISWI dependent regulation of nucleosome occupancy [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
H3-ChIP-seq was performed in order to analyze changes in nucleosomal occupancy after depletion of CTCF/P190 and ISWI from Drosophila S2 cells

DESIGN
Histone H3 ChIP-seq from Drosophila S2 cells after CTCF/CP190 or ISWI-specific RNAi treatment

PLATFORM
