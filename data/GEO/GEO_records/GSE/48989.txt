TITLE
Cyclin D1 determines estrogen dependent signaling in human breast cancer cell line MCF7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The CCND1 gene, which is frequently overexpressed in cancers, encodes the regulatory subunit of a holoenzyme that phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). It is known that cyclin D1 regulates ERÎ± transactivation using heterologous reporter systems, the significance of this observation to E2 dependent gene activation is unknow. E2 stimulated MCF7 cells treated with cyclin D1 siRNA in order to analyze the genes regulated by estradiol in a cyclin D1 dependent manner. Hormone deprived MCF7 cells were treated with cyclin D1 siRNA or control siRNA and stimulated with E2 or vehicle

DESIGN
Four separate 10cm plates of MCF7 cells treated with control siRNA were compared to four 10cm plates of MCF7 cells treated with cyclin D1 siRNA. 2 plates in each group treated with vehicle and two plates treated with E2.
