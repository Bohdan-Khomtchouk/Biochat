TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of iPSCs during cellular reprogramming using RNA FACS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were derived from embryonic fibroblasts by overexpressing the Yamanaka factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc for 32 consecutive days. iPSCs were isolated by RNA FACS (for endogenous Sox2) from a heterogeneous reprogramming culture and transcriptionally compared with (1) iPSCs stabilized in 2i medium (iPS-2i) and (2) iPSCs stabilized in co-culture with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iPS-MEF)

DESIGN
n = 2 replicates for each sample/condition
