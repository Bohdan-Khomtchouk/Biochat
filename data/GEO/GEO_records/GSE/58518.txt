TITLE
Expression data from 10-day old Arabidopsis seedlings treated with protease IV from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Immune responses in plants are triggered in part by conserved microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) molecules such as bacterial flagellin. Upon MAMP perception, plants rapidly turn on the induction of numerous defense-related genes. We have identified a novel type of plant innate immunity elicitor, protease IV from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Genome-wide transcriptomic profiles obtained with Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChipsÂ® of 10-day old Arabidopsis seedlings treated with 20 nM purified protease IV for 1 hour were compared to published bacterial flagellin- and oligogalacturonide-triggered responses. We used microarrays to characterize the global transcriptomic changes in Arabidopsis seedlings upon protease IV treatment.

DESIGN
Ten-day old Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with mock control or 20 nM purified protease IV from Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 1 hour for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
