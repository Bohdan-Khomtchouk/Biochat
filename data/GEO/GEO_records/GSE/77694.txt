TITLE
Iron deficiency anemia in mice involves alterations in mitophagy and gene expression in erythroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Since iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is one of the most common diseases in worldwide, it is an essential issue to prevent and to treat the IDA in public healthcare system. However, the precise adaptive responses and their mechanisms of the hematopoietic system induced by iron deficient state are not fully understood. In this study, low iron diet conditions which induce sever iron deficiency anemia in mice were established. Transcriptome analyses in erythroblasts under normal or iron deficient states were performed to describe the pathological details of IDA. Under iron deficient state, extensive gene expression changes and mitophagy disorder were induced during the terminal maturation of erythroblasts. These findings provide a new insight into pathophysiology and molecular biology of IDA and the function of iron as a coordinator of gene expression networks in erythrocyte maturation.

DESIGN
Subset II erythroblasts sorted from bone marrow of WT under normal diet or low iron diet after weaning for three weeks or seven weeks. Three biological replication was performed.
