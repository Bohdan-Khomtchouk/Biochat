TITLE
Effects of glucose on gene expression in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hyperglycemia can contribute to the detrimental effects of diabetes in the vasculature. To better understand the role of glucose for the effects on vascular smooth muscle cells we investigated gene expression in high and low glucose conditions

DESIGN
Mouse aortic smooth muscle cells in passage 3-4 were cultured for 14 days in DMEM 10%FCS supplemented with 1.7mM or 25 mM glucose. RNA was isolated using Qiagen mRNeasy according to standard protocol
