TITLE
Mouse cardiac tissue, polysomes and monosomes: Vehicle treated control vs. 25mg/kg DMNQ

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Translational profiling of mouse cardiac tissue treated with 25mg/kg DMNQ in 10 ml/kg arachis oil over an acute time course (0.5-120 hours) compared to time matched control animals treated with 10ml/kg saline

DESIGN
Two colour microarrays with time matched controls vs 25mg/kg DMNQ cardiac tissue. Before microarray analysis RNA separated on a sucrose density gradient into those mRNAs activitly undergoing translation (polysomes) and those not (monosomes) with control monosomes and treated monosomes on one set of arrays, and polysome control and polysome treated on another set of microarrays. The normalized Log2 of the monosomes was subtracted from the respective Log2 of the polysomes (on Series record). Time points studied were 0.5, 1, 2, 12, 24 and 120 hours following dosing, biological replicates n=3 independent animals at each time point, technical replicates (reverse labelling) n < 1. One array printed onto two slides (A and B), one replicate per array.
