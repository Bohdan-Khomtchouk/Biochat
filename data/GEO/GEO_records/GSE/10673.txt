TITLE
wt/myb77-Functional characterization of AtMYB77 transcription factor.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au07-03_myb77 - wt/myb77 - Transcriptome analysis of Myb77 knock out mutant line or of Myb77fragment overxpressing transgenic line. - Plants were grown in vitro on 1/2 MS medium, 3% sucrose, 0.8% agar for 21 days under balance day cycle (12 hours daylight at 22°C; 12 hours dark at 20°C) in climate chamber. The whole plants were collected for RNAs extraction. Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic),gene knock out
