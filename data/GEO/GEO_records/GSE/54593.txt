Expression data from Arabidopsis leaves

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Flavonols are a class of flavonoids. Unlike other classes of flavonoids, flavonols strongly accumulate in guard cells, but the role of their accumulation in guard cells is still unclear so far.The overexpression of TaFLS1, a flavonol synthase gene from wheat, improves flavonol content in guard cells of Arabidopsis, while the mutant fls1-3 of Arabidopsis AtFLS1 reduces the content. Both the increase of flavonols by TaFLS1 overexpression and the decrease in fls1-3 change stomatal apeture, showing the association between flavonols and stomatal movements. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying both the increase and decrease of flavonol content and identified possible mechanism of flavonols-mediated stomatal movement.

DESIGN
Arabidipsis Col-0, TaFLS1 overexpression lines, and fls1-3 were used for analysis. Leaves of six-week old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in soils under the regime of a 16 h photoperiod at 22Â°C and 60% relative humidity were sampled, and RNA was extracted for microarray analysis. Each of Arabidopsis lines has three replicates.
