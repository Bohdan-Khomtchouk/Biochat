TITLE
Expression data from mNSc after 48 hour of treatment with CD95L-T4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In neural stem cells, stimulation of the “death receptor” CD95 does not trigger apoptosis but resulted in increased stem cell survival and neuronal specification via activation of the Src /PI3K /AKT/mTOR signalling pathway. To further characterize CD95-dependent neural stem cell survival and differentiation we used conventional gene expression profiling combined with translation state array analysis. Mouse neural stem cells grown in neurosphere cultures were stimulated with a trimerized CD95L construct (CD95L-T4) and total as well as polysomal bound RNA was isolated 48 hours after stimulation and analysed by microarrays. CD95L-T4 treatment induced a global increase in ribosome-bound mRNA and protein translation as well as changes on genes involved in neurogenesis, protein synthesis and transcription factors.

DESIGN
Mouse neural stem cells grown in neurosphere cultures were stimulated with a trimerized CD95L construct (CD95L-T4) and total as well as polysomal bound RNA was isolated 48 hours after stimulation and hybridized on affymetrix microarrays.
