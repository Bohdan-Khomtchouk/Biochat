TITLE
Determine changes of lncRNAs expression in malignant hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a hybridization-based microarray analysis for lncRNA expression to understand the involvement of lncRNAs in HCC and to investigate differentially expressed lncRNAs in HCC, thereby characterizing their potential roles in tumor growth.

DESIGN
The expression profiles of SMMC7721 HepG2 and Huh7 human HCC cell lines and the HL-7702 human immortalized normal hepatocyte cells were performed by the lncRNA microassay. SMMC7721, HepG2 and Huh7 human HCC cell lines were defined as the experimental group and HL-7702 cell line was used as the control.
