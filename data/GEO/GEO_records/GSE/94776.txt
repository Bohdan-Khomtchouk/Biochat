TITLE
mRNA expression levels in splenic human CD4-positive T cells of mock-infected, HIV-1-infected and pegIFN-treated humanized mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Through RNA sequencing and reactome analyses, we report that type I interferon response is elicited in the spleen of HIV-1-infected humanized mice when compared to mock-infected humanized mice.

DESIGN
mRNA expression profiles in the splenic human CD4-positive T cells of HIV-1-infected humanized mice at 6 weeks post-infection (n=2), mock-infected humanized mice (n=2) and pegIFN-treated humanized mice (n=2) were generated by RNA sequencing. RNA was extracted using QIAamp RNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA sequencing was conducted in Medical & Biological Laboratories, co (Nagoya, Japan).
