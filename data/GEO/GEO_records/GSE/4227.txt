TITLE
GSTM3 single nucleotide polymorphism (rs7483) associated with peripheral BMC expression in Alzheimer disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparisons between the sample groups (normal elderly control (NEC) and Alzheimer disease (AD)) allowed the identification of genes with disease expression patterns associated with the glutathione S-transferase M3 single nucleotide polymorphism rs7483. Keywords: biological repeat
