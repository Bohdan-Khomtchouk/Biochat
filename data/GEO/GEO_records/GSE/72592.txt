TITLE
The effect of in vitro cultivation on the transcriptome of adult Brugia malayi

ORGANISM
Brugia malayi

SUMMARY
We examined the global transcriptomic profile of B. malayi females at four different time points (6 biological replicates per time point) over 5 days in culture. Focusing on genes that are differentially expressed at various time points, we observed a general perturbation of the expression profile between dissection from the host and receipt after shipment.  The expression of a few genes remained changed at the end of the experiment, after 5 days under controlled conditions; in particular, genes encoding cuticle collagens were prominently represented and strongly overexpressed.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic changes over 4 different timepoints: upon jird extraction, upon arrival, 48 hours in culture, 5 days in culture (6 biological replicates per time point).
