TITLE
Analysis of changes in gene expression in skin epidermis upon conditional knockout of PRC2-subunit Eed

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes in gene expression in skin epidermis upon conditional knockout of the essential Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) subunit Eed. Loss of Eed in skin epithelium leads to de-repression of key Merkel-differentiation genes, which are known PRC2 targets, and results in ectopic formation of Merkel cells that are associated with all hair types.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis: To determine the  changes in gene expression in skin epidermis upon conditional knockout of Eed, total RNA was isolated from skin epidermis in four biologic replicates from cells in different conditions and hybridized to SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8X60K microarrays (Agilent).

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
