TITLE
Gene expression profile of osteogenically differentiated human adipose-derived stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adipose tissue harbours a significant number of multipotent adult stem cells of mesenchymal origin known as adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). Broad differentiation potential and convenient accessibility of ADSCs make them an attractive source of adult mesenchymal stem cell for regenerative medicine and cell developmental plasticity research. Genome-wide microarray expression profiling was performed to identify genes deregulated during osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs to evaluate developmental plasticity of these cells. Dynamics of epigenetic modifications were analyzed in parallel and associated with the gene expression profile.

DESIGN
Gene expression profile was analyzed in adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) differentiated into osteogenic lineage from 3 donors and compared to undifferentiated cells from the same donors.
