TITLE
Gene expression profile associated with PTB-mediated transdifferentiation of human fibroblast cells into neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fibroblasts can be directly converted into neurons in vitro by depletion of nPTB, the reprogramming process induces neuronal gene expression while inhibits fibroblast gene expression. Human fibroblasts lacking CSB can not be converted into neurons, unless CSB gene was introduced. This study characterizes the CSB-dependent gene expression alterations during reprogramming. Using Nimblegen microarray we identified differentially expressed genes in induced neurons from wild type CSB reconstituted fibroblasts, and we proved that the difference in gene expression after reprogramming was not observed in CS1AN cells.

DESIGN
The Nimblegen human 12 x 135K gene expression array was used to define gene expression profiles in PTB-depleted human fibroblasts lacking CSB or expressing reconstituted CSB.
