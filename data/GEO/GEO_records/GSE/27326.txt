TITLE
Comparative Genomic Hybridization of E. coli and Shigella species to determine the relatedness of isolates from Neobladders

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Using comparative genomic hybridization we examined the genome content of 30 isolates of E. coli and Shigella to determine the relative location of E. coli isolates from the human neobladder
