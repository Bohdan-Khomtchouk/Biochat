TITLE
Expression data (U133 Plus 2.0) from fibroblast like synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA-FLS) stimulated by DcR3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, competitively binds and inhibits members of the TNF family, including Fas ligand (FasL), LIGHT, and TL1A. DcR3 was recently reported not only to act as a decoy receptor for these TNFRs but also to play a role as a ligand for the pathogenesis of RA. We hypothesized that DcR3 regulates the gene expression in RA-FLS. We used to search for genes in which expression in RA-FLS is regulated by the ligation of DcR3.

DESIGN
RA-FLS were obtained from 4 RA patients (sample1-4). Each sample was incubated with control IgG1 or human DcR3-Fc. Gene expression in RA-FLS stimulated by DcR3-Fc was compared with that of their respective unstimulated controls.
