TITLE
Transgenic mice carrying the human PLN gene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These mice have been genetically modified so that the mouse PLN gene has been replace with the human PLN gene. Phopspholamban (PLN), the reversible inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a), is a key regulator of myocyte Ca2+-cycling with a significant role in heart failure. We previously showed that the single amino acid difference between human and mouse PLN results in increased inhibition of Ca2+-cycling, cardiac remodeling and attenuated stress responses, in transgenic mice expressing the human PLN in the null background (hPLN). This set of microarray experiments aimed at deciphering the molecular mechanisms implicated in this process.

DESIGN
6 wild type, 6 transgenic mice. All at 11 weeks of age. FVB/N background. Whole hearts isolated, snap frozen and used for total RNA extraction.
