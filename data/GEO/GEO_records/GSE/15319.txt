TITLE
Conditioning of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to nitrosative stress

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
While in transit within and between hosts, uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) encounter multiple stresses, including substantial levels of nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen intermediates.  Strains of UPEC become conditioned to high concentrations of acidified sodium nitrite (ASN), a model system used to generate nitrosative stress. We used microarrays to define the expression profile of UPEC that have been conditioned for growth in ASN.
