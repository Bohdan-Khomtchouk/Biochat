TITLE
Domain ChIRP reveals the modularity of long noncoding RNA architecture, function, and target genes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here we identify RNA-RNA, RNA-protein, and RNA-chromatin interactions of the roX1 lncRNA involved in dosage compensation in Drosophila.

DESIGN
Identification of lncRNA-occupied genomic sites by Domain ChIRP in chromatin prepared from Clone 8 cells (D. melanogaster, male cell line).

PLATFORM
