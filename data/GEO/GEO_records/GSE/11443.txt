TITLE
Choroid plexus function in B10.pl WT mice versus B10.PL RAG-/- mice (carri-affy-mouse-302760)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previous work has led us to examine the differences in the choroid plexus function in B10.pl WT mice versus B10.PL RAG-/- mice. We believe that there is a difference between those that are normal functioning and those that are lymphocyte deficient. To determine the gene expression profile of the choroid plexus in wild type mice as compared to those that are lymphocyte deficient. We hypothesize that there is altered expression in the genes that mediate cellular adhesion in choroid plexus from wild type mice as compared to those that are lymphocyte deficient. 8-10 week old animals (age and sex matched) were injected with Evan's blue post anesthetization. After waiting an hour the animals were euthanized and their brains were extracted and placed in RNALater for 24 hours. The brains were then sliced sagitally Keywords: RAG mutant, choroid plexus
