TITLE
Genomic alterations activating KLF5 [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used ChIP-seq to map the binding sites of wild-type and mutant KLF5. In addition, by performing H3K27ac ChIP-seq, we mapped the enhancer regions in cell lines of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, esophageal carcinomas, and stomach adenocarcinomas.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of H3K27ac in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (BHY, BICR6, BICR16, BICR31, CAL33, Detroit562, HSC4, YD8), esophagel carcinoma cell lines (TE6, TE10, TT) and stomach adenocarcinoma cell lines (AGS, GSU, KATOIII). ChIP-seq of KLF5 and p300 in BICR31 cells. ChIP-seq of V5 in HEK293T cells over-expressing, V5-Empty, V5-KLF5-WT and V5-KLF5-mutants. ChIP-seq of V5 and H3K27ac in HCC95 cells over-expressing V5-Empty, V5-KLF5-WT and V5-KLF5-E419Q.

PLATFORM
GPL15520 Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens)
