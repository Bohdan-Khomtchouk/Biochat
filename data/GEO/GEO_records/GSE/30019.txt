TITLE
Down-regulation of NDRG1 promotes migration of cancer cells during reoxygenation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the transcriptional response of tumor adaptation to reoxygenation, breast cancer cells MCF-7 was cultured under 0.5% of hypoxia for 24h followed by 24h of reoxygenation in normoxia. Cells were harvested respectively at 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24h during reoxygenation.Â 

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were collected respectively at 0, 1, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after reoxygenation.
