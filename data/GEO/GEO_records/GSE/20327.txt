TITLE
Analysis of small RNAs in piRNA pathway mutant mouse testes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Piwi-interacting RNAs are 25-32 nt small RNAs bound to Piwi proteins. To know the steps where factors involved in the piRNA biogenesis (MILI, MIWI2, ZUC (MitoPLD), MVH) work, we sequenced small RNAs from  mutant mouse testes and analyzed piRNAs.

DESIGN
Examination of small RNAs in testes of mutant mouse

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
