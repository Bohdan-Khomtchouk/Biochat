TITLE
Dose-dependent gene expression analysis of cardiomyocytes treated with DEHP (1-50 ug/mL)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to expression profile cardiomyocytes from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats treated with 1 to 50 ug/mL DEHP and control (0.1% DMSO) to identify changes in gene expression related to connexin-43 expression, calcium handling, arrhythmogenesis and mechanical motion.

DESIGN
Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were treated with 1 ug/ml, 10 ug/ml, or 50 ug/ml DEHP (diluted in 0.1% DMSO) for 3 days, control samples were treated with 0.1% DMSO. Cardiomyocytes used in the experiments were from the same litter. Samples within a treatment group (control, DEHP) are biological replicates.
