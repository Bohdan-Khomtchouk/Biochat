TITLE
Changes in gene expression following ADNP knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The putative transcription factor, activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is a zinc finger and homeodomain - like profile containing protein. ADNP knockout mice die at day 9 of gestation. To reveal ADNP-associated pathways, a 22,690- Affymetrix probe array was used on ADNP knockout and control embryos.

DESIGN
To identify downstream target genes of ADNP, we examined global gene expression profiles of whole E9 knockout embryos (KO - ADNP -l-), their wild-type (WT - ADNP +l+ ) and their heterozygous (H - ADNP â€“l+ ) littermates, using the Affymetrix  Murine Genome 430A oligonucleotide microarrays.  Gestation day 9 was chosen as it is the period at which embryos lacking ADNP exhibit distinct morphological and developmental changes prior to degeneration and in uterus absorption.  Total RNA was extracted from four ADNP knockout embryos, four normal embryos and six heterozygous embryos. A pool of two genotype identical littermates was used on seven different arrays (pooling of two embryos was necessary to obtain enough RNA on each of the gene microarrays).
