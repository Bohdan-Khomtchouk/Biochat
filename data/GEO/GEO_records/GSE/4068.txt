Changes in gene expression following ADNP knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The putative transcription factor, activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is a zinc finger and homeodomain - like profile containing protein. ADNP knockout mice die at day 9 of gestation. To reveal ADNP-associated pathways, a 22,690- Affymetrix probe array was used on ADNP knockout and control embryos.
