TITLE
Comprehensive Serial Analysis of Gene Expression of the Cervical Epithelium Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we sequenced 691,390 SAGE tags from four libraries.  Cervical L-SAGE libraries N1, N2, C1, and C2 were sequenced to 165,624, 181,224, 173,534, and 171,008 tags, respectively.  Duplicate ditags were eliminated from analysis resulting in 136,276, 139,656, 154,828 and 136,386 useful tags respectively and a total of 24 058 unique tags. 15,438 of the unique tags mapped to annotated UniGene identifiers.  We characterized the transcriptome of normal cervical tissue and evaluated the highly expressed genes in terms of tissue specificity, conserved expression among the normal libraries and their altered expression in CIN III lesions.
