TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of whole blood in patients with auto-inflammatory disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HOIL1 deficient disease is a new early onset fatal autosomal recessive human disorder charaterized by chronic auto-inflammation, recurrent invasive bacterial infections and progressive muscular amylopectinosis. We studied the transcriptional profiles of whole blood from one HOIL dificient patient and other auto-inflammatory patients, including CINCA, Muckle-Wells syndrome and MVK deficiency.

DESIGN
Whole blood was collected in Tempus tubes from 41 healthy children and patients with CINCA (2), MWS (5),  MVK deficiency (2) and  HOIL deficiency (1) diseases. RNA was extracted and globin reduced. Labeled cRNA was hybridized to Illumina Human HT-12 Beadchips.
