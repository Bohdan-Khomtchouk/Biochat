TITLE
Sono-Seq analysis of contextual fear conditioning

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This dataset constitutes the first Sono-Seq study of chromatin accessibility following contextual fear conditioning in the mouse hippocampus.

DESIGN
8 total samples were analyzed, including 4 animals trained in a contexual conditioning paradigm (FC) and 4 controls. After 3 days of daily handling, tissue was collected at 30 minutes after FC.  Animals that were handled but not FC were dissected at the same time of day to control for variations in gene expression due to circadian rhythms (HC). The protocol was repeated over the course of 4 days to obtain 4 animals (2 hippocampi) per group, so that 4 independent FC experiments were represented in each time point and all animals for each group were dissected at exactly the same time of day. Testing of additional control animals was performed at 24 hours after training over a 5-minute interval, to confirm the effectiveness of the FC protocol.
