TITLE
The expression profiles of extracellular matrix-related genes in the presence or absence of IL-12, IL-23 or IL-27 as measured with PCR array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a PCR array of 84 ECM-related genes using RNA obtained from dermal fibroblasts stimulated presence or absence of IL-12, IL-23 or IL-27. The effects of IL-12, -23 or -27 on COL1A2 mRNA expression were less than 2-fold, as compared with untreated cells.

DESIGN
In this study, we examined the involvement of the IL-12, IL-23 or IL-27 in the expression of the extracellular matrix.
