TITLE
WRKY transcription factors in early MAMP-triggered immunity (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We determined on a genome-wide scale the flg22-induced in vivo DNA-binding dynamics of three of the most prominent WRKY factors, WRKY18, WRKY40 and WRKY33. The three WRKY factors each bound to more than 1000 gene loci predominantly at W-box elements, the known WRKY binding motif. Transcriptional analysis also revealed that WRKY18 and WRKY40 function redundantly as negative regulators of flg22-induced genes.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were analysed, each consisting of 12 samples: WT and three mutant genotypes, each at 0 h (untreated), 1 h and 2 h flg22 treatment.

PLATFORM
