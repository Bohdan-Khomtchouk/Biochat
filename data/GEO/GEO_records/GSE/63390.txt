TITLE
Gene expression array analysis of tumor-propagating cell populations in human osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of side population cells (SP) and CD146+ cells from primary human osteosarcoma.  We aimed to identify genes that differentially regulated between the tumor propagating cells and the bulk tumor cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from SP, Non-SP(NSP), CD146+ and CD146- cells.  The RNA is converted to cDNA using Nugen Ovation Kit (Nugen, CA, USA) and subjected to Illumina HT-12 array.

PLATFORM
