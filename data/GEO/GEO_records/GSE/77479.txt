TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gonadotropin-dependent gene expression and crosstalk of the regulatory pathways in the female ovaries

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Effects of lack of functional LH receptor and/or a constitutively active FSH receptor on gene expression in the ovaries of female mice were studied. The results suggest that transgenic expression of the mouse Fshr in granulosa cells leads to abnormal ovarian structure/function and infertility. This finding indicates that gain-of-function mutations of the Fshr in female mice bring about distinct and clear changes in ovarian function.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from ovaries of 12 weeks old mice of different genotypes and extracted using Trizol followed by clean up with Qiage RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
