TITLE
Genome-wide expression data from hippocampus of control and Noonan syndrom (Ptpn11D61Y) mice in response to neuronal stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to identify the differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus of control and Noonan syndrom mice at basal state and in response to 4AP-Bic stimulation (10 min). Functional analysis was performed to determine the biological significance of the data.

DESIGN
Mice heterozygote for a conditional allele Ptpn11floxedD61Y/WT (Chan et al, 2009) and for Emx1IREScre allele (Gorski et al, 2002) were used as model of Noonan syndrom  (NS) in this study. Control mice had same conditional allele but no Emx1IREScre allele.  Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from both control and Ptpn11D61Y mice and treated with DMSO (basal) or 4AP-Bic for 10 min (4AP-2.5 mM and Bicuculline-50 ÂµM in DMSO). After stimulation slices were incubated in ACSF without drugs for other 3 hrs.  Then total RNA was extracted and used for hybridization on arrays. Three biological replicates (independent treatments of slices from 3 control and 3 Ptpn11D61Y mice) were analysed.
