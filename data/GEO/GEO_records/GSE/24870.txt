TITLE
Gene expression profiling of CD34+ subsets in Multiple Myeloma and healthy individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell disorder frequently accompanied by hematopoietic impairment. Genomic profiling of distinct HSPC subsets revealed a consistent deregulation of signaling cascades, including TGF beta signaling, p38MAPK signaling and pathways involved in cytoskeletal organization, migration, adhesion and cell cycle regulation in MM patients.

DESIGN
CD34+ subsets of 7 patients with Multiple Myeloma and 5 healthy volunteers were analysed by means of gene expression profiling with the Affymetrix HU-133A 2.0 array

PLATFORM
GPL571 [HG-U133A_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array
