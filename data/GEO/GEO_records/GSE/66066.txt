TITLE
mRNA sequencing of the global effect of SET1A on gene expression in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling reveals that SET1A regulates gene expression, metabolism and development programs in mouse ES Cells

DESIGN
To analyze the global effect of SET1A on gene expression in ES cells, we compared the gene expression profiles in CGR8 cells treated with control and Set1A siRNA by RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
