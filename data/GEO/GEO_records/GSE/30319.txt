TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Childhood T-cell malignancies include T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL).  T-ALL and  T-LBL share common morphologic and immunophenotypic features and are treated with similar therapeutic approaches. Nonetheless, they show distinct clinical presentations suggesting that they may represent two different biological entities. In order to investigate the common and unique genetic aberrations of T-LBL and T-ALL, copy number alteration (CNA) analysis was performed on a subset of the samples analyzed by GEP

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from diagnostic bone marrow aspirates or tumor tissue samples. Copy number analysis of Affymetrix 100K SNP arrays was performed for 9 T-ALL and 9 T-LBL pediatric samples. The samples from leukemia/lymphoma remission were used as references for copy number inference.
