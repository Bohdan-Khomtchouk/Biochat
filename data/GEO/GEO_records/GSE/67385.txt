TITLE
Genome-wide copy number analyses reveal genomic abnormalities involved in transformation of follicular lymphoma [SNP arrays]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied 277 lymphoma samples (198 FL and 79 transformed FL [tFL]) using a single-nucleotide polymorphism array to identify the secondary chromosomal abnormalities that drive the development of FL and its transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

DESIGN
Affymetrix 250K NspI SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from frozen follicular lymphoma or transformed follicular lymphoma tumor specimens
