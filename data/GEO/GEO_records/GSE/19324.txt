TITLE
Human primary subcutaneous preadipocytes: Control vs PBMC co-culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human preadipocytes comparing preadipocytes cultured in control media vs co-culture with PBMC's after 3 days.  Goal was to elucidate novel expression patterns in preadipocytes during exposure to human immune cells.

DESIGN
2-condition experiment, Preadipocytes+Media vs Preadipocytes+PBMC.  Biological replicates: 4 experimental replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
