TITLE
Evaluation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells and their 1 Differentiated Fibroblastic Progenies as Cellular Models for In Vitro Genotoxicity Screening

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study evaluated human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and their differentiated fibroblastic progenies as cellular models for genotoxicity screening. The DNA damage response of hESCs and their differentiated fibroblastic progenies were compared to a fibroblastic cell line (HEPM, CRL1486) and primary cultures of peripheralblood lymphocytes (PBL), upon exposure to gamma irradiation.

DESIGN
Radiation exposure was carried out with Gamma Â® 40 extractor with the central dose rate of 1.16 Gy/minute. Radiation dose 1 Gy was used in this study. Cells were harvested 30 minutes following radiation exposure. ESCs, H1F, HEPM and PBLs with and without 1 Gy radiation exposure were used for this purpose.
