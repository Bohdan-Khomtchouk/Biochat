TITLE
Expression data from E11.5 mouse embryonic forelimbs - various mutant conditions or dissected limb domains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signals via Gli transcription factors to direct digit number and identity in the vertebrate limb. We have characterized the Gli-dependent cis-regulatory network through a combination of whole genome ChIP-on-chip and transcriptional profiling of the developing mouse limb. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from dissected mouse forelimbs using a variety of gain- and loss-of-function hedgehog pathway mutants, as well as limbs dissected into responsive (posterior 2/3ds) and non-responsive (anterior 1/3d) Hh tissues. These data are used to obtain 753 genes that are differentially expressed in response to Shh signaling. Keywords: Comparison of genetic samples

DESIGN
28 Total samples were analyzed. We generated the following pairwise comparisons using PowerExpress: Shh < WT; SmoM2 > WT; Gli3 < WT; Gli3 > WT; Ant < Post; Ant > Post. Genes with an FDR≤10% and a fold-change ≥2 were selected. We did not generate pairwise comparisons for a certain combinations with SmoGli3 and Gli3 mutants because data from these arrays contained significant variability.  To identify additional genes that were Shh-responsive, we performed the following multiple sample comparisons using an FDR≤10% and a posterior probability cutoff of ≤25%: 1.) Ant < Post and Shh < WT < SmoM2, 2.) Ant < Post and Shh < WT < SmoM2 and Gli3 > SmoGli3, 3.) Ant < Post and Shh < WT < SmoM2 and WT > SmoGli3
