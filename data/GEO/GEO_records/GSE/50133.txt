TITLE
Expression data from stable clones of BE(2)M17 cell line expressing miR-142 or miR-null

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MiR-142 is upregulated in neurons in HIV and SIV encephalitis. We have created stable clones of the BE(2)M17 human neuroblastoma cell line overexpressing miR-142. Gene expression in these miR-142-expressing clones was compared to stable clones transfected with control miR-null in order to identify miR-142 targets relevant to neuronal dysfunction in HIV encephalitis.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 3 independent  miR-142-expressing clones (6B, 6C, 6G) and 3 independent miR-null expressing clones (1A, 2A, 2B) for expression analysis. Partek genomics suite was used for data analysis. Genes that had fold change > -2.5 and p < 0.001 were chosen for validation by RT-PCR

PLATFORM
