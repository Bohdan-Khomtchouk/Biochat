TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression comparison (primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) vs normal lymph node)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A genome-wide gene expression comparison between primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and normal lymph node was performed to identify a differential exprssion and specific pathway.

DESIGN
Experiment design: 7 PCNSL and 7 normal lymph node tissues were used for comparison.
