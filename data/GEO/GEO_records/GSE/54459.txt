TITLE
Evoking potent RNAi response in cancer using novel 2â€™-OMe-phosphorodithioated modified siRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Use of MePS2-modified siRNAs to target GRAM Domain Containing 1B (GRAMD1B), a novel protein in taxane resistance.

DESIGN
Two groups of samples are included: 1. siControl treated HeyA8-MDR and 2. siGRAMD1B treated HeyA8-MDR. Gene expression profiles of siGRAMD1B-HeyA8-MDR cells were compared to that of siControl-HeyA8MDR cells.
