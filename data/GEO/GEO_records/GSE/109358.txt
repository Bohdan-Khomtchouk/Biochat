TITLE
Integrative genomic analysis in HCC samples [MYH]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We integrated the copy number data with gene expression data from the same HCC samples, and identified fifteen putative driver genes with recurrently genomic aberrations and their associated modules in HCC. We further confirmed empirically that three putative driver genes (MYH10, CEP104 and RRS1) play significant roles in tumor initiation and progression of HCC. Notably, we demonstrated that RRS1 regulates the MDM2-P53 pathway and promotes tumor progression by retaining RPL11 in the nucleolus in HCC. Altogether, these data provide insights into novel cancer driver genes and suggested molecular targets for treatment for HCC.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from the human HepG2 cells with MYH10 shRNAs or HepG2 with control shRNA. Three biological replicates each.
