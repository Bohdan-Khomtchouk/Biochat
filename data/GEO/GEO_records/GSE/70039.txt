TITLE
Cell cycle regulatory mechanisms in skeletal muscle cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome wide gene expression analysis in G9a knockdown myoblasts

DESIGN
Illumina WG-6 v2.0 arrays were hybridized with RNA from scrambled control and siG9a myoblasts to determine the gene expression profile murine skeletal myoblasts. All hybridizations were done in biological duplicates
