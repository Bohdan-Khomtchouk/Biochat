TITLE
Identification of genetic loci involved in iron metabolism by Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003

SUMMARY
Phenotypic screening of a random mutant library combined with microarray analysis of the transcriptional response of B. breve UCC2003 to iron limitation, allowed the identification of a number of genes implicated in the survival of Bifidbacterium breve UCC2003 under iron-limiting conditions. Of the identified genes, two putative iron-uptake systems, were further characterised: (i) a presumed ferrous iron uptake system, designated here as bfeUO, and (ii) a predicted ferric iron/siderophore uptake system, designated sifABCDE. In silico analysis also illustrated that these two clusters are highly conserved across members of the genus Bifidobacterium and are invariably co-located. Murine colonization studies demonstrated that B. breve UCC2003-bfeU and B. breve UCC2003-sifA insertion mutants are able to colonize a healthy murine gut as efficiently as the wild type B. breve strain, indicating that these genes are not crucial for gut survival or colonization in a healthy host.

DESIGN
DNA-microarrays containing oligonucleotide primers representing each of the 1864 annotated genes on the genome of B. breve UCC2003 (O'Connell Motherway et al., 2011) were designed by and obtained from Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, Ca., USA). Methods for cell disruption, RNA isolation, RNA quality control, complementary DNA synthesis and labeling were performed as described previously (Pokusaeva et al., 2009). Labeled cDNA was hybridized using the Agilent Gene Expression hybridization kit (part number 5188-5242) as described in the Agilent Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis v4.0 manual (G4140-90050). Following hybridization, microarrays were washed in accordance with Agilentâ€™s standard procedures and scanned using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner (model G2565A). Generated scans were converted to data files with Agilent's Feature Extraction software (Version 9.5). DNA-microarray data were processed as previously described (Garcia De La Nava et al., 2003). Differential expression tests were performed with the Cyber-T implementation of a variant of the t-test (Long et al., 2001). A gene was considered differentially expressed when p < 0.001 and an expression ratio of > 3 or < 0.33 relative to the control.
