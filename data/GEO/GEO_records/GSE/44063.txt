TITLE
KRAB/KAP1-microRNA cascade regulates erythropoiesis through the stage-specific control of mitophagy [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A multilayered transcription regulatory system is unveiled, where protein- and RNA-based repressors are super-imposed in combinatorial fashion to govern the timely triggering of an essential step of erythropoiesis

DESIGN
Analyses of transcriptional profiles and chromatin state in KAP1 WT and KO cells
