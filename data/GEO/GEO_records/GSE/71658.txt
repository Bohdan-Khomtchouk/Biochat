TITLE
Regional centromeres in Candida lusitaniae lack pericentromeric heterochromatin (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Clavispora lusitaniae

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from wild type and Hst1 knock out strains of Candida lusitaniae to generate the gene expression profiles and studied the differentially expressed genes between the two conditions.

DESIGN
RNA profiles of wild type (WT) and Hst1 knockout of Candida lusitaniae were generated by deep sequencing
