TITLE
Gene expression changes in primary GBM neurosphere cultures after 24 hours of CDK7 inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CDK7 controlls both global gene transcription and cell cycle progression. To see what global gene changes were occuring after application of THZ1 to GBM cells, we conducted the following microarray analyses.

DESIGN
Two distinct GBM neurosphere cell lines were treated in quadruplicate with DMSO vehicle or 200 nM of the irreversible CDK7 inhibitor THZ1. After 24 hours, total RNA was harvested from the samples and hybridised to the arrays.
