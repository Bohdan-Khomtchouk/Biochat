TITLE
Identification of microRNA profile specific to Cancer Stem-Like Cells directly isolated from Human Larynx Cancer Specimens (Agilent-053955)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our results showed that certain miRNAs in CD133high cells could be used as cancer stem cell markers. Based on these results, we propose that this panel of miRNAs might carry crucial roles in LCa initiation, progression, metastasis, chemoresistance and recurrence through regulating stem cell properties of tumor cells.

DESIGN
In this study, we investigated genome-wide miRNA expression profile of laryngeal CSLCs enriched for CD133 surface marker to identify a CSLCs specific miRNA signature. Two group comparison.
