TITLE
Analysis of DNA polymerase ν function in meiotic recombination, immunoglobulin class-switching, and DNA damage tolerance

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole genome transcriptome analysis by RNAseq was performed to determine whether Poln disruption influences gene expression in testis from PolnΔEx2/ΔEx2 mice.

DESIGN
Testis mRNA profiles of 68-day old wild type (WT) and Poln∆Ex2/∆Ex2 (Poln) mice were generated by Illumina HiSeq 2000.
