TITLE
Differential gene expression profiling of cultured neu-transformed versus spontaneously-transformed rat cholangiocytes and of corresponding cholangiocarcinomas

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Characterization of preclinical models of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progression that reliably recapitulate altered molecular features of the human disease. Here, we performed comprehensive gene expression profiling of cholangiocarcinoma tumors arising from bile duct inoculation of different grade malignant rat cholangiocytes.

DESIGN
Tumors arising from bile duct inoculation of spontaneously-transformed low grade malignant rat BDE1 cholangiocytes (BDEsp cells) compared to tumors arising from the inoculation of high grade malignant erbB-2/neu- transformed BDE1 cholangiocytes (BDEneu cells) into the livers of syngeneic rats.
