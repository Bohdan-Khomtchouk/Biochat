TITLE
Genome-wide maps of KDM5 binding in drosophila adults

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To determine which genes affected by loss of KDM5 in adults were direct targets, we carried out KDM5 ChIP-seq analyses. To valide  this data, we utilized a previously generated fly strain in which the sole source of KDM5 is from a transgene expressing an HA tagged form of KDM5 expressed under the control of its endogenous promoter. Comparing genome-wide gene expression and KDM5  binding analyses in Drosophila adults, we demonstrate the primary function of KDM5 in adults is to activate gene expression KDM5. To investigate the link between KDM5 and H3K4me3, we carried out anti-H3K4me3 ChIP-seq from wildtype adults . Genome-wide, KDM5 and H3K4me3 peaks showed a similar distribution, with both peaking at the transcription start site (TSS) showed a striking overlap with the presence of H3K4me3.
