TITLE
Expression data of age-specific ovaries in rhesus monkey

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
The biological function of human ovaries declines with increasing age. Moreover, disorders that cause reproductive failure, such as premature ovarian failure (POF), seriously affect the female health and may be related to abnormal gene expression in the ovaries. The objective of this study was to generate the gene expression proÔ¨Åles of ovaries in rhesus monkeys of different ages, so as to identify age-related changes in the ovaries and understand their significance in various human reproductive problems.

DESIGN
Ovaries were obtained from young (Y, 3 to 4 years), middle-age (M, 7 to 8 years) and old (O, 18 to 19 years) monkeys, and each group had 3 monkey replications. Half of ovary from each monkey was isolated mRNA for whole genome gene expression microarray analysis to detect differentially expressed genes, and followed by the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses by using a free web-based Molecular Annotation System 3.0 (MAS 3.0).
