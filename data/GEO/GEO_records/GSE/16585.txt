TITLE
Expression profiling of P14 and P28 mouse retina from 4 genotypes: +/+, Rorb-/- , +/+;CrxpNrl and Rorb-/-;CrxpNrl

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rorb is essential for rod photoreceptor development in the mouse retina. Using Affymetrix mouse GeneChips, we have generated expression profiles of the +/+, Rorb-/- , +/+;CrxpNrl and Rorb-/-;CrxpNrl retina at P14 and P28. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from retina of wt and mutants. These data are used to obtain 1189 genes that are differentially expressed in Rorb-/- vs wt.

DESIGN
31 total samples were analyzed
