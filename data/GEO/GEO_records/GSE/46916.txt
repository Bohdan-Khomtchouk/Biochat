TITLE
RNA-seq of Danio rerio and Mus musculus skin for three different age groups

ORGANISM
Danio rerio ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: Comparison of temporal gene expression profiles. The RNA-seq data comprises 3 age groups: 2, 15 and 30 months for mouse skin; 5, 24 and 42 months for zebrafish skin. Illumina 50bp single-stranded single-read RNA sequencing Jena Centre for Systems Biology of Ageing - JenAge (www.jenage.de)

DESIGN
15 samples for mouse: 5 biological replicates for 2 months, 6 biological replicates for 15 months and 4 biological replicates for 30 months; 20 samples for zebrafish: 9 biological replicates for 5 months, 6 biological replicates for 24 months and 5 biological replicates for 42 months
