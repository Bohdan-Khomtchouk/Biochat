TITLE
The hemogenic competence of endothelial progenitors is restricted by Runx1 silencing during embryonic development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has now been well established that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells originate from a specialised subset of endothelium termed hemogenic endothelium (HE) via an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. However, the molecular mechanisms determining which endothelial progenitors possess or not this hemogenic potential is currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the changes in hemogenic potential in endothelial progenitors at the early stages of embryonic development. We use a microarray approach to profile the genes regulated between E7.5 and E8.5 embryonic day in the ETV2+FLK1+CD41- compartment.

DESIGN
Cells were sorted based on ETV2::GFP+/FLK1+/CD41- immunophenotype from ETV2::GFP embryos at E7.5 and E8.5 developmental stage in triplicates

PLATFORM
