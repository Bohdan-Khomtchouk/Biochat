TITLE
ChIP-sequencing in stage 10.5 Xenopus laevis embryos

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Epigenomic profiling (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, p300 and RNA Polymerase II) of Xenopus laevis stage 10.5 embryos.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, p300 and RNA Polymerase II in duplicate. BAM processed data files (a format not accepted by GEO) were generated for H3K4me1, H3K36me3, RNAPII samples.
