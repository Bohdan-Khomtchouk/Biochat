TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of tumor-associated blood vessels in invasive bladder cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor-associated blood vessels differ from normal vessels at the morphological and molecular level. Proteins that are only present on tumor vessels may serve as biomarkers and as therapeutic targets for inhibition of angiogenesis in cancer. Comparing the transcriptional profiles of blood vascular endothelium from human invasive bladder cancer and from normal bladder tissue, we found several markers that could serve as novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from laser capture microdissected (LCM) vessels isolated from tumor and bladder normal tissue.

DESIGN
10 samples were analyzed. We compared expression of tumor associated blood vessels with expression of vessels in the normal bladder tissue using Genespring GX 12.
