TITLE
Role of 3' UTR in spreading of siRNAs

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We use small RNA sequencing to look for spreading of secondary and tertiary siRNAs along transcripts targeted by ectopic hairpin-derived primary siRNAs. We find that signals within the 3' UTR inhibit siRNA spreading.

DESIGN
sequencing of 20-30nt sRNAs from Argonaute immunoprecipitation

PLATFORM
GPL15167 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Schizosaccharomyces pombe)
