TITLE
Abundance of isoforms of adenovirus 5-encoded miRNAs.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified the abundance of isoforms of miRNAs encoded by human adenovirus 5 in total cytoplasmic RNA fractions of infected cells as well as in fractions containing the purified RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).

DESIGN
Human A549 cells were infected with human adenovirus 5 at an MOI of 30 TCID50/cell or were mock-infected. Total RNA was isolated at 30h post-infection. In addition, RNA incorporated in RISC which was isolated by immunoprecipitation using an antibody recognizing all human Argonaute proteins was conducted as well. Purified RNAs were used to generate sRNA libraries with were subjected to RNA sequencing.
