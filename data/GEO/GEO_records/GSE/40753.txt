TITLE
Additional Routes to Staphylococcus aureus Daptomycin Resistance as Revealed by Comparative Genome Sequencing, Transcriptional Profiling, and Phenotypic Studies

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Daptomycin is an extensively used anti-staphylococcal agent due to the rise in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, both laboratory-derived and clinical decreased susceptibility isolates have been described, but the mechanism(s) of resistance is poorly understood. To further understand daptomycin resistance, comparative genome sequencing, transcriptomics, ultrastructure ,and cell envelope studies were carried out on two relatively higher level (4 and 8 ug/ml-1) laboratory-derived daptomycin-resistant strains (strains CB1541 and CB1540 respectively) compared to their methicillin-resistant parent strain (CB1118;MW2). Genes altered in their expression common to both transcriptomes included some involved in glycine betaine accumulation, mscL, ure genes, femH, spa and smpB. However, the CB1541 transcriptome was further characterized by upregulation of various heat shock chaperone and protease genes, consistent with a mutation in clpP, and lytM and sceD. Both strains showed slow growth, and strongly decreased autolytic activity that appeared to be mainly due to decreased autolysin production. In contrast to previous common findings, we did not find any mutations in phospholipid biosynthesis genes, and it appears there are multiple pathways to and factors in daptomycin resistance.

DESIGN
MHB cultures (biological replicates: N=3) were then grown to exponential phase (OD600=0.4). Dye-swapping was performed between samples.

PLATFORM
GPL5881 JCVI PFGRC Staphylococcus aureus 22K v6 array designed primarily based on strain MW2
