TITLE
Gene expression in epigonadal white adipose tissue of LDKO and LTKO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared RNA expression profiles of eWAT obtained from Cntr- and LDKO-mice, and Cntr3- and LTKO-mice. Compared against the controls, the expression of 82 genes decreased, and 83 genes increased more than 2-fold in eWAT of LDKO-mice, most of which returned to normal expression in eWAT of LTKO-mice

DESIGN
Four month old LDKO and LTKO mice were fasted and epigonadal white adipose tissue were collected.
