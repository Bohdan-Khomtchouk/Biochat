TITLE
Foxo1/3-deficient Treg cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of Foxos target genes in Treg cells. Foxo1and Foxo3 are transcription factors of Foxo family. CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells isolated from wild-type and Foxo1/3-deficient mice were analyzed by global gene expression profiling. Results indicate Foxos regulate expression of a subset of Treg cell signature genes and genes in control of T cell homeostasis, signaling and metabolism.

DESIGN
2 sets wild-type and Foxo1/3-deficient CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells
