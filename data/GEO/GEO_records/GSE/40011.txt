TITLE
Expression analysis of Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578 and capsule deletion mutant

ORGANISM
Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae MGH 78578

SUMMARY
To investigate the whole-genome gene expression difference between the wild-type and capsule deletion mutant in Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578. The mutants analyzed in this study are further described in Huang T.W., Stapleton J.C., Chang H.Y., Tsai S.F., Palsson B.O., Charusanti P. Capsule removal via lambda-Red knockout system perturbs biofilm formation and fimbriae extression in Klesiella pneumoniae MGH 78578 (manuscript submission)

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures and three separate cultures of a capsule deltion mutant of Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578. The capsule gene cluster (KPN_02493 to KPN_02515) was entirely removed in the capsule deletion mutant. Each chip measures the expression level of 5,305 genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578 and the associated five plasmids (pKPN3, pKPN4, pKPN5, pKPN6 and pKPN7) with 50-mer oligo tiling array with 30-mer spacer.
