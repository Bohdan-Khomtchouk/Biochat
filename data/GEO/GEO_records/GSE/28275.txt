TITLE
Microarray hybridization data from the root tips of 5-day-old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown on tilted, hard agar surfaces

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The growth behavior of plant roots on tilted, hard agar surfaces is determined by many basic cellular processes, including microtubule dynamics and cell wall expansion.  Among Arabidopsis thaliana accessions there is natural variation for these behaviors, including one known as skewing or slanting.  The root skewing pattern on hard, tilted agar surfaces may be a clue to adaptations of an accession to its environment. Here, we compare expression profiles of two accessions with diverse skewing behavior grown on the wave assay, which consists of seedlings growing two days vertically and 3 days tilted on hard agar plates.  Cvi has a strong skew on tilted, hard agar sufaces, and Ler-2 has a weaker one.  We also include a near isogenic line, 170G-55-16 a.k.a HGI2.1, that is mostly Ler-2 in background but has a segment of Cvi introgressed into chromosome 2.  This line has an intermediate skew between its two parents.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of each of 3 genotypes (Cvi, Ler-2, and 170G-55-16/HGI2.1) were subjected to the wave assay.  After the assay, approximately 600 root tips from each biological replicate were pooled for RNA extraction and hybridization on the Affymetrix ATH1 microarray.
