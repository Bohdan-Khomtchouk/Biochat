TITLE
MiRNA signatures in cell cycle sorted cells [HeLa_H295R_miRNA_seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For the further examination of cell cycle dependent miRNA expression profile, DNA content based fluorescence activated cell sorting (cell cycle sort) was performed on human transformed cancer cell lines. Phase-dependent miRNA expression profiling was performed on G1, S and G2 phases. Results were validated by quantitative real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Phase-dependent miRNA expression profiling was performed on sorted human cancer (cervical - HeLa, adrenocortical - NCI-H295R) cells). G1, S and G2 phases were successfully sorted and analyzed.
