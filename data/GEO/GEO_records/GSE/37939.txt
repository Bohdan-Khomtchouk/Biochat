TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression after stable transfection of Lin-28B or Ago2 in H1299 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression as a result of long-term Lin-28B or Ago2 overexpression in H1299 cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the exponentially growing, stable cell lines, labeled, and hybridized to Illumina human HT-12 Beadchips.
