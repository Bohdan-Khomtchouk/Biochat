TITLE
Stress, heritability, tissue type and human methylome variation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomewide methylation profiles from three tissues (cord blood, placenta, venous blood) derived from 24 mother-child dyads. Data was assayed with the Illumina HumanMethylation 450K Beacdchip and processed with Illumina's GenomeStudio V2011.1 Methylation Module v1.9.0

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from three tissues derived from 24 dyads, totalling 72 samples, were hybridized to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips following the manufacturer√ïs specifications.

PLATFORM
