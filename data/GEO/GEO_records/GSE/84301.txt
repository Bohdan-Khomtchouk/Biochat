TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of hypothalamuses from pubertal and prepubertal goats

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
We applied RNA sequencing analysis to 6 hypothalamuses from pubertal and prepubertal goats. The significant differential expression transcripts were screened out. In order to validate the RNA-seq data, the expression patterns in the samples of lncRNAs and mRNA genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR. This research provides an expression profile of lncRNAs to further research on puberty.

DESIGN
LncRNA profiles of pubertal and prepubertal goats were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate for each group, using Illumina.
