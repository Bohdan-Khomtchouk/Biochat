TITLE
Gene expression data in the brain of tadpoles [Rana pirica] exposed by larvae salamander.

ORGANISM
Rana pirica

SUMMARY
Tadpoles of the anuran species Rana pirica can undergo predator-specific morphological responses. Exposure to a predation threat by larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus results in formation of a bulgy body (bulgy morph) with a higher tail. The objective of the present study was to use Affymetrix Xenopus Genechip to profile gene expression in the tail tissue by different predation threat.

DESIGN
Tadpoles of Rana pirica treated with larvae salamander for 8days (brainS1, brainS2, brainS3) were analyzed with triplicate.  Controls were cultured for 8days without larvae salamander (brainC1,brainC2,brainC3,brainC4,brainC5,brainC6).  Brains from tadpoles after 8days of each treatment were dissected for RNA extraction and gene expression analysis using Affymetrix Xenopus Genechip arrays.
