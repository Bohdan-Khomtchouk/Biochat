TITLE
Epigenome analysis of placenta samples from newborns

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of placenta samples from 48 newborns. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 48 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
