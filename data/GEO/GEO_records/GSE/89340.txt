TITLE
Expression data of mouse transplantation for a novel standardized fold change (SFC) method

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used mouse transplantation data to evaluate the power of SFC method.Three case samples in the fifth day for cardiac transplantation were obtained. Three case samples in the fifth day and another three in the eighth day for liver transplantation were also obtained. We also designed control groups of three normal cardiac tissues and three hepatic tissues, respectively.Agilent Product Number: G4122F; Design ID: 014868.

DESIGN
The cardiac transplantation was performed on the sex-matched B10 donor to the CBA recipient by microsurgical techniques. Three case samples in the fifth day were obtained. For orthotopic liver transplantation, grafts were harvested at POD5 or POD8 after transplantation and were submerged in RNAlaterÂ® stabilization solution (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for freezing. Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue samples using ISOGEN (NipponGene, Tokyo, Japan). We also designed control groups of three normal cardiac tissues and three hepatic tissues, respectively.
