TITLE
Lost miRNA surveillance of NOTCH, IGFR pathway-road to sarcomagenesis [Exiqon]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was comparative analysis of differentially expressed miRNA and their targets in human chondrosarcoma JJ012 and chondrocytes C28 cell line (control) to elucidate the major signal transduction pathways deregulation in sarcomagenesis. Total RNA extraction was followed by the analysis of RNA quality and integrity, Exiqon human miRNA panel of 743 unique miRNA assays,  Illumina microarray HT12 platform and qRT-PCR verification of targets were performed. 189 downregulated and 147 upregulated miRNAs were detected when comparing chondrosarcoma cell line to control C 28 chondrocytes cell line using human Exiqon arrays with biological triplicates. 3045 target genes in total were detected with 587 common and 2458 unique target genes between up and downregulated miRNAs.The upregulated miRNAs were linked to the promotion of aggressive phenotype and the majority of the downregulated miRNAs were oncosuppressors. Among upregulated targtes for upregulated miRNAS were the cluster of cancer testis antigen (CTA) genes, located on X chromosome the major signal transduction pathways leading to sarcomagenesis.
