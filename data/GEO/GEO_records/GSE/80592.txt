TITLE
Genome-wide H3K4me3 after MK2206/DMSO treatment of T47D cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We perfomed ChIP-seq using H3K4me3 antibodies in T47D cells after 24 hour treatment with the AKT inhibitor MK2206 or DMSO. We demonstrate that at a selected group of loci H3K4me3 is affected by AKT inhibition.

DESIGN
Comparison of genome-wide H3K4me3 binding after AKT inhibition vs vehicle
