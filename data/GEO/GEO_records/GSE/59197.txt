TITLE
Affymetrix expression profile array data of miR-206 affected genes in left superior fat pads in canines

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Mongrel dogs of either sex were randomly divided into 2 groups: 1) infection with control lentiviruses group (lenti-control, n = 6), in which control lentiviruses were injected into left superior fat pads;2) only infection with miR-206 overexpressed lentiviruses group (lenti-miR-206, n = 6), in which miR-206 lentiviruses were injected into left superior fat pads. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of mRNA expression underlying miR-206 overexpression and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Microarray-based mRNA expression profiling was performed of miR-206 overexpressed group and control group using the Affymetrix Array (CA, USA). Equal quantities of RNAs from 3 dogs were mixed to generate one sample for each experimental group.
