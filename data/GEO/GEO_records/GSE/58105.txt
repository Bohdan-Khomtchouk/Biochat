TITLE
Prefrontal cortex microRNA expression profiling in major depression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the potential role of miRNA in major depressive disorder, in this study we assessed global expression of miRNAs in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) of depressed individuals in comparison to psychiatrically healthy controls. Our screening pointed to miR-1202, a miRNA specific to primates and enriched in the human brain. We validated our findings using quantitative real-time PCR and identified target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs using bioinformatics analysis. MiR-1202 interacts with and regulates the expression of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (GRM4) gene, and it responds to antidepressant treatment. These results suggest that miR-1202 is associated with the pathophysiology of depression, and is a potential target for novel antidepressant treatments.

DESIGN
We assessed the global expression pattern of miRNAs in the ventrolateral PFC of depressed individuals (n = 14) in comparison with psychiatrically healthy controls (n = 11) using the Agilent human miRNA microarrays. Statistical analysis after multiple test correction identified miR-1202 as the most significantly dysregulated miRNA, with levels down-regulated in depressed brains. We validated the microarray miR-1202 findings by qRT-PCR using TaqMan probes, and found consistent results across the two expression analysis methods.
