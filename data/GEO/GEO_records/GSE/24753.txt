TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the effect of cryopreservation on peripheral blood mononuclear cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of cryopreservation effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that cryopreservation has an influence on the transcriptome profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results indicated remarkable changes in expression patterns upon cryopreservation of PBMCs, with a strong loss of signal intensities to background levels for several transcripts.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy human subjects eihter cryopreserved in liqiud nitrogen (frozen) or direclty lysed  in Trizol after isolation (fresh).
