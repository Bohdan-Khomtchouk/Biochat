TITLE
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) 72hpf, WT control vs. MO-Prpf31 injected

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling performed from total eye RNA extracts of wildtype control fishes versus Prpf31 morpholino injected larvae (at ~72hpf)

DESIGN
two-condition experiment: wildtype zebrafish versus MO-Prpf31 injected zebrafish eye RNA; 6 replicates each (extraction from 6 pools (~200 eyes each) of controls and 6 pools MO-Prpf31 (~200 eyes each))

PLATFORM
GPL10074 GIS Zebrafish 22K oligonucleotide array
