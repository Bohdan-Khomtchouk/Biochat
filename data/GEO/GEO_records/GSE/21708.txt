TITLE
Regulation of Human Dendritic Cell Apoptosis and IL-12 Production by MiR-221and MiR-155 through targeting of p27kip1, KPC1 and SOCS1

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We systematically analyzed miRNA profiling from human monocyte, immature DCs (imDCs) and mature DCs(mDCs) using miRNA microarray . miR-155 and miR-221 expression correlated with p27kip1 accumulation in DCs.
