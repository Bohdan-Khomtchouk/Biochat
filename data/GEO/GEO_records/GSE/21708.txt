TITLE
Regulation of Human Dendritic Cell Apoptosis and IL-12 Production by MiR-221and MiR-155 through targeting of p27kip1, KPC1 and SOCS1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We systematically analyzed miRNA profiling from human monocyte, immature DCs (imDCs) and mature DCs(mDCs) using miRNA microarray . miR-155 and miR-221 expression correlated with p27kip1 accumulation in DCs.

DESIGN
2 replicates for each of 3 cell types (monocyte, imDCs, DCs)

PLATFORM
GPL9517 Multi-species 1.1K miRNA array
