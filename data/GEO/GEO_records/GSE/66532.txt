TITLE
Molecular profiling of peripheral blood is associated with circulating tumor cells content and poor survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood correlates with clinical outcome in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We analyzed the molecular profiling of peripheral blood from 43 metastatic CRPC patients with known CTC content in order to identify genes that may be related to prostate cancer progression. Global gene expression analysis identified the differential expression of 282 genes between samples with â‰¥5 CTCs vs < 5 CTCs, 58.6% of which were previously described as over-expressed in prostate cancer (18.9% in primary tumors and 56.1% in metastasis). Those genes were involved in survival functions such as metabolism, signal transduction, gene expression, and cell growth, death, and movement. The expression of selected genes was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. This analysis revealed a two-gene model (SELENBP1 and MMP9) with a high significant prognostic ability (HR 6; 95% CI 2.61 - 13.79; P < 0.0001). The combination of the two-gene signature plus the CTCs count showed a higher prognostic ability than neither CTCs enumeration nor gene expression alone (P < 0.05). This study shows a gene expression profile in PBMNC is associated with CTCs count and clinical outcome in metastatic CRPC, describing genes and pathways potentially associated with CRPC progression.

DESIGN
The complete database comprised the expression measurements of 43 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) samples and their asociation with the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Twenty of them have a  number circulating tumor cells (CTCs) greater than 5.
