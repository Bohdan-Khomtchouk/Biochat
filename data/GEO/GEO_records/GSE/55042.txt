TITLE
Oncogene-like induction of cellular invasion from centrosome amplification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Centrosome amplification has long been recognized as a feature of human tumors, however its role in tumorigenesis remains unclear. Centrosome amplification is poorly tolerated by non-transformed cells, and, in the absence of selection, extra centrosomes are spontaneously lost. Thus, the high frequency of centrosome amplification, particularly in more aggressive tumors, raises the possibility that extra centrosomes could, in some contexts, confer advantageous characteristics that promote tumor progression. Using a three-dimensional model system and other approaches to culture human mammary epithelial cells, we find that centrosome amplification triggers cell invasion. This invasive behavior is similar to that induced by overexpression of the breast cancer oncogene ErbB2 and indeed enhances invasiveness triggered by ErbB2.  We show that, through increased centrosomal microtubule nucleation, centrosome amplification increases Rac1 activity, which disrupts normal cell-cell adhesion and promotes invasion. These findings demonstrate that centrosome amplification, a structural alteration of the cytoskeleton, can promote features of malignant transformation.

DESIGN
genome-wide human SNP 6.0 arrays from Affymetrix was used to determine the copy number changes of MCF10A cells with extra centrosomes or depleted of MCAK after grown 4 days in 3-D cultures
