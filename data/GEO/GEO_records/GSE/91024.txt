TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of uhrf1 mutant zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare gene expression levels in uhrf1 mutants with global DNA hypomethylation to WT siblings

DESIGN
10 whole embryos were pooled per sample of either 5 dpf old uhrf1 mutants or phenotypically WT siblings and RNA was extracted. Libraries were prepared according to Illumina Truseq RNA sample prep kit, version 2, followed by Ribo-Zero Gold treatment

PLATFORM
GPL14875 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Danio rerio)
