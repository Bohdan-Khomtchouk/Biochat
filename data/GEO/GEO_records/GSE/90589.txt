TITLE
Murine NIH3T3 Cells: Wild vs. BRAFV600E Transfected

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse NIH3T3 cells comparing control NIH3T3 cells transfected with a pEFm6-BRAF with cells transfected with pEFm6-BRAFV600E. Goal was to determine the effects of BRAFV600E gene transfection on global mouse NIH3T3 cells gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Wild vs. BRAFV600E TransfectedNIH3T3 cells.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
