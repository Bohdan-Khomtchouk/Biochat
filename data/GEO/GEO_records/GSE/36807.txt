TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis biopsy samples.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression patterns of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) colonic specimens were analyzed using whole-genome microarrays. Healthy control samples were included in order to detect gene expression changes associated with CD or UC. CD and UC samples were also compared in order to identify the molecular mechanisms that distinguish both fenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from intestinal biopsies were analyzed using whole-genome microarrays.
