TITLE
cMyb and vMyb in MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptional activities of c-Myb and its oncogenic variant v-Myb were compared by expressing them in human MCF7 cells using recombinant adenovirus vectors. A hybrid construct, 3Mutc, which is a variant of c-Myb harboring three v-Myb-derived DNA binding domain mutations was also analyzed.  All the samples were compared to cells infected with a control adenovirus.  The results showed that v-Myb, which differs from c-Myb only by N- and C-terminal deletions and eleven amino acid substitutions, has a qualitatively different transcriptional activity. Keywords: repeat
