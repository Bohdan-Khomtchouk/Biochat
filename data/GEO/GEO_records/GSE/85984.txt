TITLE
RNA sequencing of skeletal muscle of myotonic dystrophic (DM1) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Introduction: Myotonic dystrophy of type 1 (DM1), the most common dystrophy in adults, is an autosomal dominant inherited disease, affecting around 1 in 8000 person. Patients suffering from DM1 develop essentially muscle disorders such as myotonia, muscle weakness, muscle loss and atrophy. The disease is caused by the mutation of the DMPK " Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase " gene. The mutation correspond to an abnormally large expansion of CTG tri-nucleotides repeats located in the 3'-untranslated region of this gene. Expanded CTG repeats are normally transcribed, but accumulates in RNA aggregates that sequester RNA-binding proteins such as the splicing regulator MBNL1. Consequently, due to MBNL1 sequestration, DM1 is characterized by aberrant splicing of a wide number of mRNA, which are themselves responsible for the symptoms observed in the disease. Purpose: To determine as much as possible novel splicing misregulations taking place in DM1 skeletal muscle, we performed a paired-end RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using muscles samples of normal individuals (CTRL, n=3) versus muscles of DM1 patients (DM1, n=3). The data was analyzed by a bioinformatical software, called MISO, in order to map the alternative splicing changes between normal and DM1 muscle. The aim of this study was to get a broad and precise view of the splicing changes occurring in DM1 muscle.

DESIGN
PolyA RNA extracted from skeletal muscle biopsies originating from normal individuals (CTRL, n=3) or patients suffering of myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1, n=3), were analyzed by massive paired-end RNA sequencing.
