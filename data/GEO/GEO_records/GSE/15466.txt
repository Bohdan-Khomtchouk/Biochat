TITLE
Transcriptional response of Drosophila cells to FHV infection (infection experiment)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Virus infections induce cellular gene up and down regulation, and these changes often provide clues to cellular pathways utilized by viruses. We used microarrays to examine the transcriptional responses of cultured Drosophila S2 cells to infection with Flock House virus (FHV).

DESIGN
Cultured S2 cells were infected with FHV at an MOI of 10 and we measured global transcript levels at 12 h after infection compared to control mock infected cells using Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 1.0 microarray chips.
