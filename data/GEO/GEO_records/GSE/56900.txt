TITLE
RUNX3 Facilitates Growth of Ewing Sarcoma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric small round cell tumor that predominantly occurs in bone.  Approximately 85% of Ewing sarcomas harbor the EWS/FLI fusion protein, which arises from a chromosomal translocation, t(11:22)(q24:q12). EWS/FLI interacts with numerous lineage-essential transcription factors to maintain mesenchymal progenitors in an undifferentiated state. We previously showed that EWS/FLI binds the osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2 and prevents osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we investigated the role of another Runt-domain protein, RUNX3, in Ewing sarcoma.  RUNX3 participates in mesenchymal-derived bone formation and is a context dependent tumor suppressor and oncogene.  RUNX3 was detected in all Ewing sarcoma cells examined, whereas RUNX2 was detected in only 73% of specimens. Like RUNX2, RUNX3 binds to EWS/FLI via its Runt domain. EWS/FLI prevented RUNX3 from activating the transcription of a RUNX-responsive reporter, p6OSE2.  Stable suppression of RUNX3 expression in the Ewing sarcoma cell line A673 delayed colony growth in anchorage independent soft agar assays and reversed expression of EWS/FLI-responsive genes.  These results demonstrate an important role for RUNX3 in Ewing sarcoma.
