TITLE
mRNA expression profile in IL-4-treated macrophages transfected with miR-142-5p ASO or miR-130a-3p mimics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify target genes of miR-142-5p and miR-130a-3p that are involved in M2 polarization, we examined the mRNA expression profile changes after altering miR-142-5p or miR-130a-3p expression in IL-4-treated macrophages.

DESIGN
Macrophages were transfected with control ASO, miR-142-5p ASO, control mimics or miR-130-3p mimics using lentiviral vectors.Each treatment contained 3 replicates. After 24 hr, the cells were treated with IL-4 for 24h.mRNA was purified from total RNA after removal of rRNA (mRNA-ONLY Eukaryotic mRNA Isolation Kit, Epicentre). Then, each sample was amplified, transcribed into fluorescent cRNA along the entire length of the transcripts without 3' bias utilizing a random priming method and labeled by Agilent Gene Expression Hybridization Kit (Agilent p/n 5188-5242). The labeled cRNAs were hybridized onto the Agilent_Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2. After having washed the slides, the arrays were scanned by the Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent p/n G2565BA).
