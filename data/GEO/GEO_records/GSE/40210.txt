TITLE
Genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) profiling of copy number variations (CNVs) in various dog breeds in comparison to a reference sample

ORGANISM
Canis lupus ; Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
This study used the NimbleGen dog whole genome CGH 2.1M tiling array to assay copy number variants in the dog genome in multiple breeds and wolf.

DESIGN
53 samples of genomic DNA were hybridized to a reference sample. The dataset comprises 2 samples from each of 15 dog breeds, 10 samples from each of 2 dog breeds and 3 samples from gray wolf.
