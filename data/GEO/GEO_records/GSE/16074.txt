TITLE
Thyroid Hormone (TH) Controls The Remodeling Of The Pancreas And The Liver, Part A

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Thyroid hormone (TH) controls the remodeling of the pancreas and the liver.  TH-induces dedifferentiation of the exocrine pancreas to a progenitor state (Proc. Nat. Acad Sci. 105, 8962-8967 (2008)) and it remodels the endocrine pancreas (Dev. Biol. 328, 384-391 (2009)). The redifferentiated frog pancreas resembles closely the pancreas of other typical vertebrates. Two pancreas arrays were carried out. The first one studied gene expression changes at different developmental stages of Xenopus laevis during metamorphosis. The second array studies gene expression changes at varying times after the addition of TH to premetamorphic tadpoles.

DESIGN
Thyroid hormone (TH) controls remodeling of the pancreas. The micro array was carried out to identify changes in gene expression between the tadpole and frog pancreas. This is part 1, done on the 44K Xenopus platform. This dataset was used only for one pancreas experiment with several data points (control, 12h, 24h, 48h and frog). Each was made in triplicate. Samples in all 3 parts of the study received the same thyroid hormone levels.
