SUMMARY
Several MYST-family histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes associate with specific ING tumor suppressor proteins. ING complexes containing the HBO1 HAT protein are the major source of histone H4 acetylation in vivo and have been shown to play critical roles in gene regulation and DNA replication. Here, we present a molecular dissection of HBO1/ING HAT complexes that unravels the protein domains required for complex assembly and function. A distinctive characteristic of ING HAT complexes is the presence of multiple PHD finger domains in different subunits. Biochemical and functional analysis of these domains indicate that they interact with histone H3 N-terminal tail region but with different specificity towards the methylation status of lysine 4. They play essential and intricate role in regulating binding to chromatin and substrate specificity. This is achieved in part through expression of subunit isoforms controlling which PHD fingers are present in the complex. Importantly, localization analysis on the human genome indicate that HBO1 complexes are enriched throughout the coding region of genes, supporting a role in transcription elongation. These results also underline the importance and versatility of PHD finger domains in regulating chromatin association and trans-histone acetylation specificity within a single protein complex.
