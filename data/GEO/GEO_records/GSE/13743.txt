TITLE
Comparison of naïve, postmitotic (CD44-lo/CD62L-hi) and effector (CD44-hi/CD62L-lo) CD8+ Tcells during BMT in GVHD mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Naïve CD44-lo/CD62L-hi/CD8+ T cells from C3H.SW mice were compared to CD44-hi/CD82L-lo/CD8+ effector memory T cells and CD44-lo/CD62L-hi/CD8+ postmitotic T cells, using 3 biological replicates of each type of sample.  The later two cells types were highly purified at day 14 after transplantation from GVHD B6/SJL mice receiving donor C3H.SW mouse-derived naive CD44-lo/CD62L-hi/CD8+ T cells and T cell-depleted bone marrow. Recipient mice had first been lethally irradiated at a dose of 10Gy in two fractions. This is a MHC-identical minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched mouse GVHD model of human allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Naive T cell samples were from pools of 2 mice each, while effector memory and postmitotic T cell samples were purified from pools of T cells from 4 mice each.  After RNA  extraction and cleanup, biotin labeled cRNA was prepared from 600 ng total RNA, using two rounds of in vitro transcription, and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 arrays using standard techniques. Keywords: Cell type comparison
