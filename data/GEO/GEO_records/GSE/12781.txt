TITLE
PolII transcription factor in Human HeLa S3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation following by high-thoughput tag sequencing (ChIP-Seq) using the GA II platform from Illumina for the human transcription factor PolII in HeLa S3 cells. The PolII ChIP was performed according to the same protocol as used for the STAT1 samples except that the cells were not stimulated using gamma-interferon prior to formaldehyde fixation.

DESIGN
Examination of the PolII transcription factor in Human HeLa S3.

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
