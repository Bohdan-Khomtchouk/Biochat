TITLE
The effect of whole-glucan particles on the gene expression of polarized M2 bone-derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone-marrow macrophages polarized to M2 phenotype are immunosuppressive. Interestingly, treatment with whole-glucan particles converts M2 macrophages to M1 phenotype with an anti-tumor phenotype. In this study, the effect of WGP treatment for 6 hours on the gene expression of M2 macrophages was assessed.

DESIGN
Polarized M2 bone-marrow derived macrophages were incubated for 6 hours in media with or without WGP, followed by RNA extraction.
