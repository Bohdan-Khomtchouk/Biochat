TITLE
Growth signals employ CGGBP1 to suppress transcription of Alu-SINEs [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alu SINEs are the most numerous frequently occurring transcription units in our genome and possess sequence competence for transcription by RNA Pol III. However, through poorly understood mechanisms, the Alu RNA levels are maintained at very low levels in normal somatic cells with obvious benefits of low rates of Alu retrotransposition and energy-economical deployment of RNA Pol III to the tRNA genes which share promoter structure and polymerase requirements with Alu SINEs. Using comparative ChIP sequencing, we unveil that a repeat binding protein, CGGBP1, binds to the transcriptional regulatory regions of Alu SINEs thereby impeding Alu transcription by inhibiting RNA Pol III recruitment. We show that this Alu-silencing depends on growth factor stimulation of cells and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of CGGBP1. Importantly, CGGBP1 ensures a sequence-specific discriminative inhibition of RNA Pol III activity at Alu promoters, while sparing the structurally similar tRNA promoters. Our data suggest that CGGBP1 contributes to growth-related transcription by preventing the hijacking of RNA Pol III by Alu SINEs. This study was used to find out the effect of CGGBP1 on serum-induced changes in gene expression and effect of serum on gene expression regulation by CGGBP1.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of normal human fibroblasts under 4 different experimental perturbations: serum starvation or serum stimulation and CGGBP1 depletion or normal CGGBP1 levels.
