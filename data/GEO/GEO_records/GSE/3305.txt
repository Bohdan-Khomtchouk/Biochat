Age alters the gene expression profiles of rat oculomotor nucleus and spinal cord

SUMMARY
Some of the most common neurodegenerative disorders have a strong association with aging. Curiously, these conditions tend to involve specific areas of the central and peripheral nervous system, at least initially. For example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis preferentially targets spinal motor neurons and spares oculomotor neurons. This suggests that aging has divergent effects on brain stem and spinal cord, a factor that may explain differential susceptibility to certain neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, for this study we asked whether aging induces a change in the evolution of the transcriptome of oculomotor nucleus (OMN) throughout the lifespan which would be different than that of the spinal cord aging.  Age induced a transcriptome shift to a pattern consistent with inflammation/immune response in both OMN and spinal cord. However, the response was more dramatic in the spinal cord. On the other hand, age repressed genes coding ion channels and transporters in OMN and cytoskeletal proteins in the spinal cord. The results indicate that OMN and spinal cord transcriptomes change differently with age. The results give an initial glimpse of how tissue-specific gene expression patterns may underlie the differential susceptibility to age-related neuromuscular dysfunction.
