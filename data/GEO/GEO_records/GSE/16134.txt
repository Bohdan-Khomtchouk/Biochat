TITLE
Bacterial Correlates of Gingival Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the association between subgingival bacterial profiles and gene expression patterns in gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis.

DESIGN
A total of 120 patients undergoing periodontal surgery contributed with a minimum of two interproximal gingival papillae (range 2-4) from a maxillary posterior. Prior to tissue harvesting, subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesial and distal aspects of each papilla. Gingival tissue RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, labeled, and hybridized with whole-genome microarrays (310 in total)
