TITLE
mRNA expression levels in splenic human mononuclear cells of mock- and HIV-1-infected humanized mice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through RNA sequencing and gene ontology analyses, we report that immune activation is elicited in the spleen of 4 HIV-1-infected humanized mice when compared to 4 mock-infected humanized mice.

DESIGN
mRNA expression profiles in the splenic human mononuclear cells of HIV-1-infected humanized mice at 6 weeks post-infection (n=4) and mock-infected humanized mice (n=4) were generated by RNA sequencing. RNA was extracted using QIAamp RNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA sequencing was conducted in Medical & Biological Laboratories, co (Nagoya, Japan).
