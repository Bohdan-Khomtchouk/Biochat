TITLE
PHO4 target expression for yeast S. cerevisiae under phosphate perturbation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study, we determined the expression profiles of Pho4 and Cbf1 targeted genes in phosphate perturbation.

DESIGN
Yeast S. cerevisiae in log phase was grown in PNB medium with no phosphate for 3 hours and then shift to various phosphate concentration (from 0 to 10 mM) for 80 minutes.
