TITLE
Chromatin maps of human ASXL1, FOXK1 and O-GlcNAc

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are major determinants of gene silencing and epigenetic memory in higher eukaryotes. Acting in multimeric protein complexes, these factors control structure and function of chromatin. We used a robust affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) approach to systematically map the PcG protein interactome in a single human cell line. Importantly, we uncovered the topology map of the human PR-DUB de-ubiquitination complexes, which comprise the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase OGT1 and a number of transcription factors.  Here we provide genome-wide chromatin maps of identified PR-DUB1 subunits ASXL1, FOXK1 and the OGT1 catalyzed modification O-GlcNAc based on ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
Our data set comprises 3 ChIP-seq samples plus 2 input control samples using chromatin from Flp-In HEK293 T-REx cells  cells which was immunoprecipitated using antibodies against ASXL1, FOXK1 and O-GlcNAc.
