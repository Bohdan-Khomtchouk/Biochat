TITLE
microRNA-146b improves intestinal injury in mouse colitis by activating NF-kB and improving epithelial barrier function

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aim: The precise role of microRNAs in inflammatory disease has been less clear. The present study investigated the effect of microRNA (miR-146b) on improving intestinal inflammation. Methods: The microRNA profile in IL-10-deficient mice was examined using microRNA arrays and miR-146b was selected for the following experiments. The expression vectors containing either the whole sequence of miR-146b or its siRNA were intraperitoneally administered to the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse. Results: The overexpression of miR-146b activated the NF-kB pathway, improved the epithelial barrier function, relieved intestinal inflammation in the DSS-induced colitis mice, and improved the survival rate of mice with lethal colitis. Furthermore, this amelioration of the intestinal inflammation by miR-146b was negated by the inhibitor for NF-kB pathway. Conclusion: The modulation of miR-146b expression is a potentially useful therapy for the treatment of intestinal inflammation through the activation of the NF-kB pathway.
