TITLE
Regulation of mRNA expression of monocytic cells by stimulation with pro- abd anti-inflammatory eicosanoids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eicosanoids are potent regulators of gene expression of inflammatory cells. Pro- (leukotrienes B4 and C4) and anti-indflammatory (lipoxins A4 and B4) eicosanoids have been described in the literature but the detailed impact of these lipid mediators on the gene expression pattern of monocytic cells has not been studied in detail. We cultured the permanent monocytic cell line MonoMac 6 for 12 h in the absence (solvent control) and presence of these eicosanoids and quantified the differential gene expression patterns using the microarray technology. Keywords: comparative expression studies after eicosanoid stimulation
