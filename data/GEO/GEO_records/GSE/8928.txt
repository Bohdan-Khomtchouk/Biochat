TITLE
Regulation of mRNA expression of monocytic cells by stimulation with pro- abd anti-inflammatory eicosanoids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Eicosanoids are potent regulators of gene expression of inflammatory cells. Pro- (leukotrienes B4 and C4) and anti-indflammatory (lipoxins A4 and B4) eicosanoids have been described in the literature but the detailed impact of these lipid mediators on the gene expression pattern of monocytic cells has not been studied in detail. We cultured the permanent monocytic cell line MonoMac 6 for 12 h in the absence (solvent control) and presence of these eicosanoids and quantified the differential gene expression patterns using the microarray technology. Keywords: comparative expression studies after eicosanoid stimulation

DESIGN
MonoMac6 cells were grown according to the recommendations of the German Tissue and Cell Culture Collection (Braunschweig) to near confluency. Then 100 nM of the eicosanoids (leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, lipoxin A4, lipoxin B4) were added to the culture medium as DMSO stock solution and the cells were further cultured for 12 h with the stimuli. Then the cells were harvested, washed and total RNA was extracted according to the Qiagen protocol. Total RNA was used for microarray hybridization.
