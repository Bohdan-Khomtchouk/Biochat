TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of virulence factors in Vibrio vulnificus FORC_036, isolated from a surf clam

ORGANISM
Vibrio vulnificus

SUMMARY
Small octopus is one of the major source for V. vulnificus outbreak among aquatic products in Northeast Asian due to improperly cooking and wound infection by mishandling. However, there is no report on whole genome sequence of V. vulnificus isolated from contaminated surf clam, thus no information is available for major virulence factors about V. vulnificus obtained from small octopus. Therefore, the analysis of transcriptome of isolated V. vulnificus from  products are necessary to investigate potential risk of foodborne illness by contaminated products.

DESIGN
The washed small octopus added to FORC_036 inoculated minimal medium, and incubated for 1 h, 4 h/Control group  (FORC_036 inoculated minimal medium, and incubated for 1 h, 4 h), in biological duplication, using Illumina HiSeq 2500.

PLATFORM
GPL23679 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Vibrio vulnificus)
