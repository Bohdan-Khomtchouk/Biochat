TITLE
Leaf gene expression profile of rice during sunset

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
A continuous gene expression profiling of leaves was performed at regular interval during the sunset period to understand the changes of transcriptional program in the rice plant grown under natural field conditions in response to solar radiation.

DESIGN
At 78 days after transplanting, leaf samples corresponding to the uppermost fully expanded leaves were collected at 10-min intervals from 5:00 PM until 8:00 PM. All samples were obtained from rice plants grown in the field during the 2008 cultivation season.
