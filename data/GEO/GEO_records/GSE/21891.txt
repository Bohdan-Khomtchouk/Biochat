TITLE
Expression data from insulin-treated human primary fibroblasts and effects of U0126 on insulin-induced gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We carried out a high throughput analysis of insulin-induced kinase signaling pathways in primary fibroblasts from 35 unrelated individuals.  We found that extensive individual variation exists in induction of various signaling pathways.  ERK signaling displayed the greatest variation, which led to extensive variation in expression of downstream target genes. Our results suggest that phenotypic variation in kinase signaling mediates variation in downstream processes of insulin response.  Future study of such phenotypic variation is important to linking genetic variants to individual susceptibility to complex diseases such as diabetes.

DESIGN
Passage-matched primary fibroblasts from 35 unrelated newborns (foreskin) were treated with 100 nM insulin.   We measured gene expression levels in each of 35 individuals at baseline, and 1 hour and 6 hours after insulin treatment using expression arrays. In order to examine effects of ERK inhibition on insulin-induced gene expression, we treated fibroblasts from 4 individuals with DMSO or 10uM of U0126 for 1 hour, followed by insulin treatment for one hour and 6 hours.  We then harvested cells and measured gene expression in each sample using expression arrays.
