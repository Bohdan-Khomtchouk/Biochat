TITLE
Effect of ibuprofen on hippocampal gene expression in APP-PS1 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and prevent Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) at preclinical stages in cognitively normal aging populations.  We modeled NSAID prevention of memory impairment in AD model mice to identify novel targets of NSAID action. We found that the widely-used NSAID ibuprofen prevented early hippocampus-dependent memory deficits in APP-PS1 mice. We therefore analyzed gene expression in the hippocampus of these mice.

DESIGN
We treated male APPSwe-PS1deltaE9 mice (strain originally provided by Dr. David Borchelt and fully back-crossed to a C57BL/6J background) and their wild-type littermates with ibuprofen in chow from 3 to 6 months of age, after which we sacrificed the mice and dissected one hippocampus from each mouse for RNA isolation and microarray analysis. In each genotype-treatment group, we analyzed samples from 5 mice. Note: In our initial analysis, we found that sample GSM1644138, Hippocampus_WT_Con_rep5, was an outlier in overall gene expression. We therefore removed this sample before performing the analysis published in PMID 27190010.
