TITLE
Gene expression profiling of miR-22-expressing Rhabdomyosarcoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify genes regulated  by doxycycline-mediated induction (IND) of miR-22 expression (NpBI-22) in RD18 Rhabdomyosarcoma cells.

DESIGN
The experiment included 6 samples: two biological replicates of RD18 NpBI-22 cells either treated with doxycycline for 6 days (IND) or left untreated (NI). RD18 NpBI-206AS cells, both induced (IND) and non-induced (NI) were included as additional controls.
