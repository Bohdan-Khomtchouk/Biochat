TITLE
Expression Profiles of HepG2 cells treated with 22 compounds and solvent controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptomics changes induced in the human liver cell line HepG2 by 17 hepatotoxic compounds, 5 non-hepatotoxic compounds and solvent controls after treatment for 24h

DESIGN
The study investigated differential gene expression in HepG2 cell line mRNA following 24 hours of exposure to 17 hepatotoxic compounds, 5 non-hepatotoxic compounds and solvent controls. Three biological replicates per compound/solvent. In total 105 arrays .
