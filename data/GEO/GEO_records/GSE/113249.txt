TITLE
Gene expression signatures for murine stromal cells from tumor-draining lymph nodes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the influence of primary tumors on pre-metastatic lymph nodes, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify gene signatures of stromal cells from tumor-draining lymph nodes, compared with normal lymph nodes. We subcutaneously inoculated C57BL/6 mice with the 4T1 mammary carcinoma. Two weeks later, tumor-draining lymph nodes were dissociated and stromal cells (CD45-) were sorted. Lymph nodes stromal cells from normal mice without tumor bearing were set as controls.

DESIGN
Primary tumor induced gene expression in stromal cells from tumor-draining lymph nodes was measured at 2 weeks after tumor inoculation subcutaneously. Lymph nodes stromal cells from normal mice without tumor bearing were set as controls.
