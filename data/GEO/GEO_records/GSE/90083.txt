TITLE
RNA-seq of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings with T-DNA insertions in TCP14

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study evaluates the transcriptome of Arabidopsis seedlings with loss-of-function TCP14 alleles

DESIGN
Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown under short day conditions (9h of light at 21°C - 15h of dark at 18°C) for two weeks. Samples were harvested in the beginning of the light period and used for RNA extraction and Illumina sequencing. Lines Col-0 (3 replicates), tcp14-6 (3 replicates) and tcp14-7 (3 replicates) were used in the experiment. Each replicate corresponds to approximately 30 seedlings grown in the same pot.
