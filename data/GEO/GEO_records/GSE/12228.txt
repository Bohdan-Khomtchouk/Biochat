TITLE
Gene expression profiling among human embryonic stem cells, differerentiated EBs and adult cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem (hES) cells have unique features: self-renewal ability and pluripotency. They can be continuously cultured in undifferentiated state and give rise to cells and tissues of all three germ layers. Thus hES cells provide a resource not only for cell replacement therapy but also for studying human developmental biology. However, much work needs to be done to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of the undifferentiatiation state and the differentiation process of human embryonic stem cells. Keywords: cell type comparison design

DESIGN
We performed gene expression profiling on 3 separate passages from 3 different hES cell lines (WA09 (H9), TE06 (I6) and BG01v), EBs samples derived from WA09 cells at 3 different time points, and 5 types of adult cells (HUVEC, HMVEC, UASMC NHA, and LFB).
