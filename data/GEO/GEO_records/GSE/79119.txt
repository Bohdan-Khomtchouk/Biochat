TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 inflorescence small RNAs

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Small RNA sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 inflorescence tissues of three biological replicates. The data were analyzed to identify non-templated nucleotides in Arabidopsis small RNAs.

DESIGN
Inflorescence samples are collected from three biological replicates of Col-0 wild-type Arabidopsis plants.
