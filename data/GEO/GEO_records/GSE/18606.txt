TITLE
Transcript abundance patterns in Kawasaki disease patients IVIG-resistance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the abundance of gene transcripts of whole blood RNA between IVIG-resistant and â€“responsive KD patients to identify biomarkers that might differentiate between these two groups and to generate new targets for therapies in IVIG-resistant KD patients.

DESIGN
48 whole blood samples from 9 healthy age-appropriate controls, 8 IVIG non-responding and 12 IVIG-responding patients at acute and convalescent stages

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
