TITLE
Gene expression changes of bromodichloromethane-induced in renal cortex of rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study is to develop a short term and highly accurate prediction method of renal carcinogenicity based on gene expression profile of rats administrated by carcinogens. We conducted 28 days-repeated dose experiments in male SD rats with bromodichloromethane, and the gene expression profiles of renal cortex were analyzed using custom microarrays.

DESIGN
Experimental design is the two group (control group vs. bromodichloromethane treated group). Three biological replicates were performed for each group. Rats were humanely sacrified by bleeding under anesthesia with CO2-O2 (4:1) or isoflurane gas inhalation 24 hr after final administration.
