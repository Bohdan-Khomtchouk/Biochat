TITLE
Autoimmune peptide antigen reactivity in normal B6 mice Pepperchip 2.0

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori

SUMMARY
The aim of the array was to determine the B6 mouse sera IgG and IgM reactivity profile to linear peptide epitopes.  Pooled sera from three 6-9 month old B6 mice was diluted at 1:200 for IgG specific analysis or 1:1000 for IgM specific analysis and incubated on a PEPperPRINT peptide microarray platform printed with peptide autoantigens
