TITLE
Gene expression data from human subcutaneous adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Obesity is a heterogeneous conditions comprising obese individuals with metabolic disorders (termed metabolically unhealthy obese; MUO) and obese individuals who are metabolically healthy (termed metabolically healthy obese; MHO). We used microarrays to examine differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression from lean healthy (LH), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO) individuals.

DESIGN
Subcutaneous adipose tissue samples from the periumbilical region were obtained under local anesthesia and after an overnight fast. 50-100 mg of adipose tissue was homogenized and total RNA was extracted after homogenisation in TRIzol reagent using a tissue homogenizer.
