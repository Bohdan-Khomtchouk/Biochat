TITLE
Gain and loss of H4K16 acetylation during ES cell differentiation [Agilent arrays]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome wide gain and loss of H4K16ac upon differentiation correlated with changes in expression.

DESIGN
Gene expression in undifferentiated ES cells, and cells after 3 days of differentiation in retinoic acid.  3 biological replicates with two technical replicates were performed for each sample.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
