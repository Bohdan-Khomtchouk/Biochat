TITLE
Mouse lung tissue transcriptome response to a wild type infectious clone of H7N9 Influenza virus and mutant H7N9 viruses [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA, miRNA, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and histopathology analysis in mouse lung infected with WT A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9; 'AH1'), AH - NS1-103F/106M, and AH1 - 691 (ferret adapted virus).

DESIGN
Groups of 22-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected with the H7N9 Influenza WT A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9; 'AH1'), AH - NS1-103F/106M, and AH1 - 691 (ferret adapted virus). Infections were done at 10^4 PFU or time-matched mock infected. Time points were 1, 2, 4 and 7 d.p.i. There were 5 animals/dose/time point. Lung samples were collected for virus load, transcriptional and proteomics analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.

PLATFORM
