TITLE
HMVEC cells treated with vascular endothelial growth factor, anthrax edema toxin, and an Epac activator

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) treated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Antrhax Edema Toxin (ET), or the Epac activator, 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP (8CPT) Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) were treated with VEGF alone or VEGF in combination with either the the Epac-specific cAMP-mimetic, 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP (8CPT), or anthrax edema toxin (ET), an adenylyl cyclase.  ET or 8CPT can inhibit VEGF-mediated chemotaxis and angiogenesis.  The goal of the study was to identify genes regulated by cAMP production (ET) or by activation of Epac/Rap (8CPT) that may mitigate the effects of VEGF treatment.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured 4 hours after treatment with VEGF, VEGF + 8CPT, VEGF + ET or mock treatment.  Each sample contained one replicate.
