TITLE
Genome-wide epigenetic alteration in adult T-cell leukemia cells and HTLV-1-mediated immortalized cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-on-chip analysis of primary ATL patient cells, normal CD4+ T cells, and Tax-transduced cells to decipher the ATL-specific ‘epigenetic-code’ that was critical in ATL pathogenesis.

DESIGN
Comparison of histone H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 marks in normal, Tax-transduced, and ATL cells. Investigation of the biological effects of HTLV-1 Tax on the host epigenome in HTLV-1 infected cells.
