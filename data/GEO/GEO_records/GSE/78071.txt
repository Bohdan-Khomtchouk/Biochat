TITLE
Classification of fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
WG-DASL expression of breast fibroepithelial lesions Breast fibroepithelial lesions are biphasic tumors and include fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors. Fibroadenomas are clinically benign while phyllodes tumors are more unpredictable in biological behavior, with potential for recurrence. Differentiating the tumors may be challeneging when they have overlapping clinical and histological features especially on the core biopsies

DESIGN
The transcriptome of a training set of 48 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded fibraodenomas and phyllodes tumors. Differential gene expression between fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors was investigated
