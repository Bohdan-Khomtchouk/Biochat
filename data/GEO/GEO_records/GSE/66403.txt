TITLE
cGMP inducer effect on cell line Panc-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cGMP is well-known secound messanger involved in vascular homeostasis. However little is known the effect of cGMP inducer on mRNA expression in  cancer cells. We performed microarrays to revealed the transcriptional change of a human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDCA) cell line (Panc -1) to cGMP inducer Bay41-2272 in order to provide insight into impact of cGMP induction on Panc-1 cells.

DESIGN
Panc-1 Human PDCA cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 5 Î¼M Bay41-2272 for 48 h and total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol Reagent. The microarray analysis was conducted on the Panc-1 cells expressing by using Agilent Microarray.
