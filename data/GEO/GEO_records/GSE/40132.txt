TITLE
ALKBH5 is a New Mammalian RNA Demethylase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) in higher eukaryotes. Here we report ALKBH5 as a new mammalian demethylase that oxidatively removes the m6A modification in mRNA in vitro and inside cells. This demethylation activity of ALKBH5 significantly affects mRNA export and RNA metabolism as well as the assembly of mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles. Alkbh5-deficient male mice are characterized by impaired fertility resulting from apoptosis that affects meiotic metaphase-stage spermatocytes. In accordance with this defect, we have identified in mouse testes 1552 differentially expressed genes which cover broad functional categories and include spermatogenesis-related mRNAs involved in the p53 functional interaction network. We show that Alkbh5-deficiency impacts the expression levels of some of these mRNAs, supporting the observed phenotype. The discovery of this new RNA demethylase strongly suggests that the reversible m6A modification plays fundamental and broad functions in mammalian cells.
