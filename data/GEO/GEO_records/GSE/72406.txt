TITLE
Identification and targeting of long-term tumor propagating cells in small cell lung cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FACS sorted TPCs (CD24HighCD44LowEpCAMHigh) and non-TPCs (CD24Low, CD24HighCD44High, and CD24HighCD44LowEpCAMLow) from mouse primary SCLC tumors We used microarrays to identify genes that are differentially expressed in TPCs versus non-TPCs.

DESIGN
Tumors isolated and dissociated from the mouse SCLC pre-clinical model and single cell suspension stained with cell surface markers (CD24, CD44, and EpCAM)

PLATFORM
