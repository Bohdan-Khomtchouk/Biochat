TITLE
Expression profiling of blood from pulmonary tuberculosis patient and healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pulmonary tuberculosis is a multigene disease, and some of the genes affect the development of Pulmonary tuberculosis. The study wants to find different expression genes in blood from Pulmonary tuberculosis patient and normal people who have genetic relationship wtih each other. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in the blood between Pulmonary tuberculosis patient's and normal people's who have genetic relationship wtih each other.

DESIGN
Blood from  Pulmonary tuberculosis patient and normal people who have genetic relationship wtih each other were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL15207 [PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
