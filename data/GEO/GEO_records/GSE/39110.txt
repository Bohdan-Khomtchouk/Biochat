TITLE
Gene expression by antigen activated OT-I T cells in vivo in the presence and absence of IL-2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Much is known concerning the cellular and molecular basis for CD8+ T memory immune responses. Nevertheless, conditions that selectively support memory generation have remained elusive. Here we show that an immunization regimen that delivers TCR signals through a defined antigenic peptide, inflammatory signals through LPS, and growth and differentiation signals through the IL-2R initially favors antigen-specific CD8+ T cells to rapidly and substantially develop into tissue-residing T effector-memory cells by TCR transgenic OVA-specific OT-I CD8+ T cells. Amplified CD8+ T memory development depends upon a critical frequency of antigen-specific T cells and direct responsiveness to IL-2. A homologous prime-boost immunization protocol with transiently enhanced IL-2R signaling in normal mice led to persistent polyclonal antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that supported protective immunity to Listeria monocytogenes. These results identify a general approach for amplified T memory development that may be useful to optimize vaccines aimed at generating robust cell-mediated immunity. Gene expression analysis was performed for OT-I T cells on day 3 and day 5 after activation with ovalbumin and LPS in vivo with and without treatment with IL-2 using an agonists IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes (IL2/Jes-6.1)

DESIGN
OT-I T cells were purified and adoptively transferred into congenic syngenic mice. 24 hours later mice were immunization with ovalbumin and LPS. 24 hr later some mice received agonist IL2/anti-IL2. 3 and 5 days after immunization, the activated OT-I T cells were purifed by FACS and total RNA was isolated for genome wide expression analysis using Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST1.0 arrays
