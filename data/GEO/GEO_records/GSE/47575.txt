TITLE
Regulation of Gene Expression by Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) in Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA from bone marrow-derived MSCs stably expressing CTGF-specific shRNA (or empty vector control) was analyzed for differential gene expression. Significant differences were found in cell proliferation-related genes, especially genes related to the M phase of the cell cycle, which were down-regulated in CTGF-knockdown-MSCs compared to control MSCs.

DESIGN
Bone marrow-derived MSCs were stably transduced with lentivirus expressing CTGF-specific shRNA or an empty vector control. After antibiotic selection, total RNA was amplified and hybridized to Illumina HT12 version 3 human whole-genome arrays (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
