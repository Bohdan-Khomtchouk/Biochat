TITLE
Human cervical cells HELP-tagging cytosine methylation data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We pursued the hypothesis that epigenetic regulators of transcription are involved in both the development and the progression of HPV-associated CIN.  Using HELP-tagging, we performed the most comprehensive study to date of DNA methylation in HPV-associated cervical neoplasia, testing ~2 million loci throughout the human genome in biopsies from 78 HPV+ women, identifying changes starting in early CIN and maintained through carcinogenesis.  We identified loci at which DNA methylation is consistently altered, beginning early in the course of neoplastic disease and progressing with disease advancement.

DESIGN
DNA methylation profiles for cervical biopsies of 19 normals, 20 CIN1, 16 CIN2/3, and 23 cervical cancers.

PLATFORM
