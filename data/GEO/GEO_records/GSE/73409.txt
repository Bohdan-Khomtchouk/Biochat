TITLE
The Candida albicans Histone Acetyltransferase Hat1 Regulates Stress Resistance and Virulence via Distinct Chromatin Assembly Pathways

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of wild type, Hat1-deficient, Cac2-deficient and Rtt109-deficient Candida albicans cells prior to and after treatment with hydrogen was done to determine the transcriptional changes in these three mutatns in logarithmically growing cells as well as under oxidative stress conditions.

DESIGN
RNA Sequencing was performed of wild type, Hat1-deficient, Cac2-deficient and Rtt109-deficient Candida albicans strains prior to and after treatment with hydrogen peroxide. Cells were grown to the exponential phase in YPD at 30oC. Aliquots were harvested for RNA isolation and to the remaining culture hydrogen eproxide was added to a final concentration of 1.6 mM. After 30 min incubation at 30Â°C cells were harvested for RNA isolation. Five biological replicates were done for the wild type and Hat1-deficient cells and three biological replicates were done for Cac2-deficient and Rtt109-deficient strains.
