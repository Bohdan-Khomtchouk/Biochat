TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Linezolid resistance in various clinical Stapyloccoccus aureus strains.

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
The study aims to identify genes associated with Linezolid resistance. Linezolid resistant strains were compared to a Linezolid sensitive reference strain in the presence of linezolid and absence of linezolid (mock).

DESIGN
Samples were hybridized on aminosilane coated slides with 70-mer oligos. 63 samples were submitted (31 dye swap pairs and 1 unpaired hyb result). Reference sample for all hybridizations was Staphylococcus aureus strain 378 (a Linezolid sensitive strain) . Query strains were clinical isolates (Linezolid resistant strains) 3577, 5612, 6939, and 7210.  In some hybs both query and reference samples were exposed to Linezolid and in others both query and reference samples were exposed to a mock (control) treatment.  Samples were assayed 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes after inoculation to observe time dependent responses.  The query and reference samples were time matched, e.g. a 30 minute query sample was paired with a 30 minute reference sample.
