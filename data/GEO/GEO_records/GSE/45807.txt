TITLE
Phrenic neuronal determinants screen in M.Musculus [1]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression response after induction of putative phrenic neuronal determinants in ES cells was compared to a pre-determined list of genes over-expressed in FACS-sorted phrenic cells. Transcription factor Pou3f1 was identified as a major determinant of phrenic identity.

DESIGN
Cells type individually compared to the overall expression to identify differentially expressed genes patterns
