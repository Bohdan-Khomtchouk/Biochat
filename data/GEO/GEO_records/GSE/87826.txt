TITLE
Sugarcane transcriptome: Lxx inoculated (LxxI) vs. mocked inoculated (MI) plants

ORGANISM
Saccharum officinarum

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of sugarcane plants variety SP80-3280 inoculated with the pathogen Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli (Lxx) compared with mocked inoculated ones 30 and 60 days after inoculation (DAI). Goal was to determine the effects of the increase in Lxx title on global sugarcane gene expression.

DESIGN
Lxx inoculated vs. Mocked inoculated plants. Time point analysis: 30 and 60 days after inoculation. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 Lxx inoculated replicates, in each time.

PLATFORM
GPL14862 SUCEST-FUN Sugarcane 44k v1.0
