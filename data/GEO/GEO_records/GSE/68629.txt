TITLE
Analysis of Gene Expression of Human Renal Cell Carcinoma by DNA Microaray in Patients treated with Sunitinib. An Exploratory Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene Evaluation of DNA expression from snap-frozen renal cell cancer tissue from 5 patients with locally advanced non-metastatic tumors, submitted to nephrectomy after being treated with 2 cycles of neoadjuvant Sunitinib were compared to match controls comprising of 6 patients with no neoadjuvant intervension using microarray platform Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 containing 54675 probes. Validation followed using qRT-PCR

DESIGN
Exploratory, prospective evaluation of gene expression in renal cell tumor snap frozen tissue after neoadjuvant Sunitinib compared to a control group with no neoadjuvant treatment

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
