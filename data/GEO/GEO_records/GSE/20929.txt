TITLE
Gene expression in human endothelial cell with innate immunity stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is an investigation of whole genome gene expression level in human coronary endothelial cells (HCAEC) and human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPAEC) stimulated by FK565 or LipidA. We show that parenteral administration of a pure synthetic Nod1 ligand, FK565, induces site-specific vascular inflammation in mice, which is prominent in and aortic root including aortic valves, slight in aorta and absent in other arteries. The in vitro production of proinflammatory chemokine/cytokine by FK565 is higher in HCAEC than in HPAEC, suggesting that site-specific vascular inflammation is at least in part ascribed to an intrinsic nature of the vascular cell itself.

DESIGN
A six chip study using total RNA recovered from HCAEC and HPAEC which were stimulated by LipidA or FK565 in vitro. HCAEC and HPAEC were stimulated with FK565 (10Âµg/mL) or LipidA (100ng/mL) for 24 hours in 12-well plates (10,000 cells/cm2). Total RNA was extracted and subjected to RNA microarray analysis.
