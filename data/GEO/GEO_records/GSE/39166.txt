TITLE
Strand-specific ChIP-seq profiling of Rad52 localization

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We report the development of a novel strand-specific ChIP-seq strategy and application of this strategy in studying genome instability events

DESIGN
We examined vulnerable genomic sites by applying strand-specific ChIP-seq of Rad52 to S. pombe haploid mutants showing elevated level of genome instability.

PLATFORM
