TITLE
Gene expression analysis in Eight Homo sapiens Cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles for ~20,000 genes using Illumina Homo sapiensRef-8 v2

DESIGN
Cell lines were picked to match cell lines that were assayed in a complimentary set of transient transfection promoter activity assays.  Gene identifiers on the BeadArrays were matched to promoter predictions from SwitchGear Genomics (www.switchdb.com; score > 20) for transcripts that were not associated with alternative promoters. The eight cell lines are:  Ags, HeLa, HepG2, HT1080, HCT116, T98G, U87MG, and G402.
