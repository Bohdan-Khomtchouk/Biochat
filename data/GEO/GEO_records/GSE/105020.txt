TITLE
Expression analysis of breast cancer cell lines SKBR-3 and ZR-75-1 upon treatment of LMO2 overexpression or knocking-down

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in ZR-75-1 cells with knocking-down of LMO2, and in SKBR-3 cells with overexpression of LMO2, compared to their relative control cells.

DESIGN
A total of 4 microarray assays were performed with total RNA from ZR-75-1_ctrl, ZR-75-1_sh-LMO2, SKBR-3_LMO2 and SKBR-3_ctrl cells. Samples were compared between each treatment and control in each cell lines.
