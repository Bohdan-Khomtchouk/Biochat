TITLE
Gene expression profiles in isolated proximal tubules and whole kidneys of rats after cisplatin-administration

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To clarify the effects of cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II, CDDP) on the gene expression profiles in renal proximal tubules, microarray analyses were carried out using total RNA samples isolated from microdissected proximal tubules and whole kidneys.  The molecular events underlying acute kidney injury (AKI) in the proximal tubules of rats with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity were successfully clarified with 17,000 transcripts.

DESIGN
Renal proximal tubules were isolated under microscopy, and transcriptome data were collected with Rat Genome Survey MicroarrayÂ® (Applied Biosystems)

PLATFORM
