TITLE
Caenorhabditis elegans infected with Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Young adult fer-15;fem-1 Caenorhabditis elegans were infected with Staphylococcus aureus for 8 h to determine the transcriptional host response to Staphylococcus aureus. Analysis of differential gene expression in C. elegans young adults exposed to two different bacteria: E. coli strain OP50 (control), wild-type Staphylococcus aureus RN6390. Samples were analyzed at 8 hours after exposure to the different bacteria. These studies identified C. elegans genes induced by pathogen infection. Keywords: response to pathogen infection, innate immunity, host-pathogen interactions

DESIGN
There are 6 samples total: 3 biological replicates of Staphylococcus aureus-infected animals, and 3 biological replicates of E. coli-fed controls. Three independent biological replicates were isolated for each treatment. All treatments were performed in parallel.
