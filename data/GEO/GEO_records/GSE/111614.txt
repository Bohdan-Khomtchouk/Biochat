TITLE
miRNA Expression in 4 mouse Hepatocellular Carcinoma cells with different lymphatic metastasis potentials

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to screen for microRNAs related to  lymphatic metastasis in mouse Hepatocellular Carcinoma cells, named H22, Hepa1-6, Hca-P, and Hca-F. The lymphatic metastasis abilities of the cell lines are different.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen life technologies) from Hepa1-6 and Hca-F cells. RNA samples were analyzed by Exiqon A/S using miRCURYTM Array Power Labeling kit and the miRCURYTM Array. Hybridization signals were scanned and analyzed by Genepix 4000B microarray scanner.

PLATFORM
GPL24714 The miRCURYTM Array
