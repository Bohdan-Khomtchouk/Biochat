Human esophageal adenocarcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The incidence of esophageal and junctional adenocarcinoma has increased 6 fold in the last 30 years and 5 year survival remains less than 14%. Most patients present with advanced disease and current staging is limited in its ability to predict survival. We aimed to generate and validate a molecular prognostic signature for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Gene expression profiling was performed and the resulting signatures correlated with clinical features for 91 snap frozen esophageal and junctional resection specimens. Gene expression profiles were obtained from 76/91 of the samples (82%). 119 genes were  significantly associated with survival and 270 genes with the number of involved lymph nodes. Three genes were prognostic at the protein level in the external validation dataset. This three gene signature outperformed all the pathological features at predicting survival in this independent cohort (p < 0.001).
