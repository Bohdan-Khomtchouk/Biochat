TITLE
Cardiac Effects of Rosiglitazone in Male Wistar Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg) agonist of the thiazolidinedione class, is a major insulin-sensitizing drug widely used to treat type-2 diabetes.  Rosiglitazone causes myocardial hypertrophy in rodents and increases the risk of cardiac events in man.  To better characterize its cardiac effects, male Wistar rats were orally administered 0, 10 or 80 mg/kg/day rosiglitazone.

DESIGN
Male Wistar rats were orally administered 0, 10 or 80 mg/kg/day rosiglitazone once per day for 14 days.  Samples were obtained 6, 24, 168 or 336 hours after the final treatment.
