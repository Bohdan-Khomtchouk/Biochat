TITLE
Cellular and Molecular Immune Profiles in Renal Transplant Recipients after Conversion from Tacrolimus to Sirolimus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tacrolimus and Sirolimus are commonly used to maintain immunosuppression in kidney transplantation.  However, their effects on immune cells and allograft molecular profiles have not been elucidated. Here we characterized the effects of Tacrolimus to Sirolimus conversion on frequency and function of T cells, and on graft molecular profiles.

DESIGN
Samples from 30 renal transplant recipients in a randomized trial of late Sirolimus conversion (n=18) vs. Tacrolimus maintenance (n=12) were utilized.  Peripheral blood was collected at 0- 6- 12 and 24-months post-randomization.  This dataset only contains the 18 arrays corresponding to patients treated with Sirolimus.
