TITLE
A highly clonogenic subset of adult mouse biliary duct cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our goal is to find the heterogeneity of mouse liver ductal cells in the wild type mouse liver. We separated the MIC1-1C3+ mouse liver ductal cells into two populations with the cell surface marker: ST14. We found that ST14hi1C3+ cells have higher colonal geneity comparing to the ST14lo1C3+ population.

DESIGN
Mouse liver NPCs were sorted by flowcytometry. The MIC1-1C3+CD26- non blood cells are seperated into two parts: ST14high and ST14low. Fresh sorted cells are put into TRIzol for RNA. RNA seq libraries were made with illumina TruSeq kit under the manufacture's protocol.

PLATFORM
