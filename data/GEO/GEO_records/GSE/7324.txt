TITLE
Structural basis for recognition of SMRT/N-CoR by the MYND domain and its contribution to AML1/ETO's activity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the effects of disrupting the AML1/ETO MYND-SMRT interaction with the W692A substitution on AML1/ETO function, the global gene expression profile of mouse bone marrow LSK cells transduced with GFP was compared to that of cells transduced with either wild-type AML1/ETO or AML1/ETO harboring the W692A substitution in the MYND domain.  Three independent biological replicates were assessed for both the control (GFP/MigR1) and AML1/ETO (intact MYND-SMRT interaction) conditions, whereas four independent biological replicates were assessed for the W692A (disrupted MYND-SMRT interaction) condition.  The three GFP replicates were used to establish a baseline signal for comparison to both the AML1/ETO and W692A samples. Keywords: genetic modification
