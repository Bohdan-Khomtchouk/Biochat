TITLE
Gene expression profiling of hepatitis development and hepatocarcinogenesis initiation in LEC rats.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
LEC rats are considered as interesting model for studying hepatitis and development of hepatocarcinogenesis related to copper accumulation and oxidative stress. LEC rats have a mutation in a gene related to liver copper excretion, the Atp7b gene. As a consequence, this rat strain shows an abnormal copper accumulation in the liver. This is believed to be the origin of the acute hepatitis and the subsequent  hepatocellular carcinoma that spontaneously develop in these rats. Here, we present the gene expression profiles of LEC rats at different disease stages. LEC rats were classified as normal 6 weeks old (6w), normal 9 weeks old (9w), slight jaundice and jaundice according to age and disease state. D-penicillamine, a copper chelator agent, blocks both hepatitis and tumor development. D-penicillamine-trated LEC rats were used as control rats for gene expression comparison as they showed neither hepatitis development nor tumor marker expression. Gene expression differences in protein metabolism and tumor marker proteins add to the known oxidative stress and inflammation characterization of the hepatitis process, leading to new insights concerning hepatitis and hepatocarcinogenesis development. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
6 weeks old LEC rats, 6 rats per group, were sacrified at different hepatitis stages. Biochemical and histological analyses were performed in order to classify the rats into normal, slight jaundice or jaundice groups. D-penicillamine-treated LEC rats (100 mg/kg/day p.o.) were used as control rats since they behave as normal rats. Microarray analysis was performed on liver samples, one replicate per rat, using dyes swap.
