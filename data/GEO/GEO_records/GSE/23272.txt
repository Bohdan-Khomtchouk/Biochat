SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_486 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Robert Waterston. For full list of modENCODE projects, see Project Goal: Our experiments are designed to detect all C. elegans transcripts by hybridizing RNA to commercially available genome tiling arrays. To understand how bacterial pathogens taken up by C. elegans may affect transcription, we grew young adult worms on various pathogenic bacterial strains for either 24 or 48 hours and measured transcription levels.  Simultaneously, young adult worms were also grown on non-pathogenic bacteria (OP50) as controls. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and Keywords: Transcript tiling array analysis
