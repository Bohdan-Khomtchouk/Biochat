TITLE
Gene is expression in 2 mutant alleles of the freezing-sensitive mutant sfr6 subjected to cold.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The sfr6-1 mutant of Arabidopsis has been shown to be defective in freezing tolerance and fails to express a number of cold-regulated genes to normal wild type levels. The aim of this experiment was to test whether two other mutant alleles, sfr6-2 and sfr6-3 showed similar defects in cold-inducible gene expression.

DESIGN
Two experiments were performed. In each, one sfr6 mutant was cold-treated alongside its corresponding wild type.
