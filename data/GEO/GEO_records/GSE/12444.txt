TITLE
FOXF2-regulated genes in human primary prostate stromal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the genes and pathways regulated by FOXF2, we investigated potential FOXF2 gene targets by microarray analyses of primary prostate stromal cells (PrSC) in which FOXF2 was knocked down by siRNA. 190 differentially expressed genes were selected, of which 104 genes were more highly expressed in PrSC cells treated with FOXF2 siRNA and 86 were more highly expressed in PRSC cells treated with negative control siRNA.

DESIGN
In each experiment, we compared gene expression of PrSC cells treated with FOXF2 siRNA versus PrSC cells treated with negative control siRNA, in a total of 6 affymetrix arrays. 190 differentially expressed genes were selected (ratio negative control siRNA/siRNA â‰¥ 2log |0.8| as average in all arrays).
