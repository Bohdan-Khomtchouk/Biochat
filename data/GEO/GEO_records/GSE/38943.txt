TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotype b strains of JP2 and non-JP2 genotypes using a pan-genome microarray

ORGANISM
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans

SUMMARY
To characterize the differences in pattern of gene expression between JP2 and non-JP2 genotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Transcriptome analysis of 3 strains of JP2 and 2 strains of non-JP2 genotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans was performed

DESIGN
Transcripome of three strains of JP2 genotype (HK1651, D28S-1 and D41S-1) and two strains of non-JP2 genotype (SCC1398 and ANH9381) were examined where two biological duplicates were carried out for each strain.
