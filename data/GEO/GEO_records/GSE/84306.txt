TITLE
Comprehensive microRNA-sequencing of small extracellular vesicles derived from head and neck carcinoma cells reveals common secretion profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exosomes are nano-sized (40-150 nm), membrane encapsulated vesicles that are released by cells into the extracellular space and function as intercellular signaling vectors through the horizontal transfer of biologic molecules, including microRNA (miRNA). Although secreted by both normal and malignant cells, there is evidence that cancer-derived exosomes enable the tumor to manipulate its microenvironment, contributing to the capacity of the tumor for immune evasion, growth, invasion, and metastatic spread.

DESIGN
The purpose of this study was to apply miRNA-sequencing to exosomes isolated from conditioned culture media to comprehensively characterize miRNA secreted in exosomes from 4 distinct head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines and normal oral epithelial cells.
