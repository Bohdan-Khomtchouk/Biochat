TITLE
Xenopus laevis embryos and animal caps: Control vs PouV morpholino

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Xenopus laevis embryos and ectoderm (animal caps) comparing embryos injected with control morpholino with embryos injected with the morpholino mixture PVD2, which knocks down all three Xenopus PouV proteins. Whole embryos (WE) or animal caps (AC) were collected at late blastula (9) or early gastrula (10) stages from Control and PVD2 morphants.

DESIGN
Two conditions: Control vs. PouV morpholino; Two tissues: whole embryos, animal caps .Two timepoints: stage 9 and 10.  Biological replicates: 2 control replicates at stage 9  and 10 for whole embryos, 2 control replicates at stage 9 and 10  for animal caps, 2 PVD2 morpholino replicates  at stage 9 and 10 for whole embryos, 2 control replicates at stage 9 and 10 for animal caps
