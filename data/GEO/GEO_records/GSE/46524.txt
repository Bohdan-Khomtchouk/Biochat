TITLE
Expression data in Arabidopsis Col-0 with acetic acid treatment and subsequent drought treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the role of acetic acids in drought tolerance, we have employed transcriptional profiling of plants treated with (or without) acetic acid and subsequent drought treatments. Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) were used.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis Col-0 were grown in soil for 2 weeks (16 hours light / 8 hours dark). 10mM acetic acid was supplied for 9 days. For drought-treated samples, the plants were subjected to drought by withholding water supply for indicated days. Then total RNA was prepared from the aboveground tissue and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each array were carried out using the independent biological samples.
