TITLE
Gene expression analysis of hESC-derived-MESP1 expressing progenitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A hESC MESP1-MCHERRY reporter line was used to isolate and study the molecular character of MESP1 expressing pre-cardiac progenitors, derived from hESC. MESP1 is a key-transcription factor for pre-cardiac mesoderm and is marking the progenitor for almost all cells of the heart. This reporter line was used to study cardiac differentiation and the derivation of early cardiac progenitors in vitro.

DESIGN
hESCs were differentiated towards the cardiac lineage, expressing MESP1-mCherry at day 3 of differentiation. Total RNA obtained from isolated MESP1-mCherry expressing progenitors was compared to that of non-MESP1-expressing progenitors and undifferentiated hESCs in order to characterize MESP1-specific transcription factors and proteins.
