TITLE
FOXA1 potentiates lineage-specific enhancer activation through modulating TET1 expression and function

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FOXA1 is a FKHD family protein that translates epigenetic signatures at target enhancers to lineage-specific transcription and differentiation. Through genome-wide location analyses, here we show that FOXA1 expression and occupancy are, in turn, required for the maintenance of this epigenetic signature, namely DNA hypomethylation and histone 3 lysine 4 methylation. Mechanistically, this involves TET1, a 5-methylcytosine dioxygenase. We found that FOXA1 induces TET1 expression via direct binding at its cis-regulatory elements. Further, FOXA1 physically interacts with the TET1 protein through its CXXC domain. TET1 thus co-occupies FOXA1-dependent enhancers and mediates local DNA demethylation and concomitant histone 3 lysine 4 methylation, further potentiating FOXA1 recruitment. FOXA1 binding events were markedly reduced following TET1 depletion. Together, our results support that FOXA1 is not only a reader, but also a writer, of the epigenetic signatures at lineage-specific enhancers and that TET1 and FOXA1 form a feed-forward regulatory loop for enhancer activation.
