TITLE
Characterization of a P-REX1 gene signature in breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Rac nucleotide Exchange Factor (Rac-GEF) P-Rex1 is highly expressed in breast cancer, specifically in the luminal subtype, and is an essential mediator of actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell migratory responses induced by ErbB and other tyrosine-kinase receptors. Heregulin, a growth factor highly expressed in mammary tumors, causes the activation of P-Rex1 and Rac1 in breast cancer cells via ErbB3, leading to a motile response. Since there is limited information about P-Rex1 downstream effectors, we carried out a microarray analysis to identify genes regulated by P-Rex1 in the context of HRG stimulation. In T-47D breast cancer cells, HRG treatment caused major changes in gene expression, including genes associated with motility, adhesion, invasiveness and metastasis. Silencing P-Rex1 expression from T-47D cells using RNAi altered the induction and repression of a subset of HRG-regulated genes, among them genes associated with extracellular matrix organization, migration, and chemotaxis. HRG induction of MMP10, a gene encoding for metalloproteinase-10, was found to be highly sensitive both to P-Rex1 depletion as well as inhibition of Rac1 function by the GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) ÔÅ¢2-chimaerin, suggesting the dependence of the P-Rex1/Rac1 pathway for the induction of genes critical for breast cancer invasiveness. Notably, there is a significant association in the expression of P-Rex1 and MMP10 in human luminal breast cancer, and their co-expression is indicative of poor prognosis.

DESIGN
T-47D cells were serum starved and then stimulated with HRG (20 ng/ml) or vehicle (PBS) for 6 h in 60-mm plates. Three biological replicates for each experimental condition were used. For the analysis of P-Rex1-regulated genes, T-47D parental, NTC, P-Rex1#1 and P-Rex1#2 cells, with and without HRG treatment, were used (24 samples)
