TITLE
Drosophila ROW RNAi gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Heterochromatin-protein 1 (HP1) is a functionally diverse family of proteins. In particular, Drosophila dHP1c forms a complex with the transcription factors WOC and ROW (dHP1EU) that localizes at euchromatin and regulates gene expression. We used microarrays to analyse the changes in gene expression after row depletion by RNAi.

DESIGN
For expression profiling analyses, total RNAs were prepared from control S2 cells and upon RNAi-mediated depletion of ROW, converted to cDNA and hybridized to Drosophila Genome 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix).
