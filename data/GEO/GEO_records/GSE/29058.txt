TITLE
Novel Targets of the Transcription Factor Sox9 in Neonatal Mouse Limb

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sox9 is an SRY-related transcription factor required for expression of cartilaginous matrix genes in the developing skeletal system and heart valve structures. In contrast to positively regulating formation of cartilaginous matrix, Sox9 has also been shown to negatively regulate matrix mineralization associated with bone formation. While the transcriptional activation of Sox9 target genes during chondrogenesis has been well studied, the mechanisms by which Sox9 represses osteogenic processs are not so clear. To address this, we performed a genome-wide Sox9 ChIP-on-chip approach using neonatal mouse lim tissue.

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with pooled Sox9 antibodies and normal rabbit IgG as control using neonatal mouse limb tissue. Samples include Sox9 IP and IgG IP.
