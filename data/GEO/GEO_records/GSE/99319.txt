TITLE
An NF-kB-dependent, lineage specific transcriptional program regulates Treg identity and function [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NF-kB p65 ChIPseq revealed differential binding of p65 in Treg vs Tconv upon TCR stimulation

DESIGN
Duplicate of ChIPseq. One input and four samples for each dataset. Samples include conventional T cells (Tconv) with our without CD3/CD28 stimulation and regulatory T cells with or without CD3/CD28 stimulation.

PLATFORM
GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
