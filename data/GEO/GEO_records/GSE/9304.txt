TITLE
Organ-specific Profiles of Genetic Alterations in Liver, Stomach and Lung Cancers caused by AID Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze the organ-specific genetic changes in the tumor-related genes commonly triggerd by the AID-mediated mutagenesis, we compared the gene expression profiles among epitherial tumors developed in AID Tg mouse. Keywords: genetic alteration
