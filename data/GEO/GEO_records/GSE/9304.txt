TITLE
Organ-specific Profiles of Genetic Alterations in Liver, Stomach and Lung Cancers caused by AID Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze the organ-specific genetic changes in the tumor-related genes commonly triggerd by the AID-mediated mutagenesis, we compared the gene expression profiles among epitherial tumors developed in AID Tg mouse. Keywords: genetic alteration

DESIGN
We analyzed the up or down regulated genes in tumor tissues compared with nontumor tissues in AID Tg mouse (see Supplementary table at the foot of the record). We compared each gene expression profile among three epitherial tumors in AID Tg mouse.
