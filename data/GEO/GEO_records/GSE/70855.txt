TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for chicken LMH cells infected with infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV)

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular events in LMH cells upon infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) infection, transcriptional profiling of LMH cells infected with ILTV was compared with uninfected control cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression in LMH cells with or without virus infection was measured at two day post infection. Four independent experiments were performed.

PLATFORM
