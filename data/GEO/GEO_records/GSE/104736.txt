TITLE
Non-synchronized cell cycle transcriptomics in U2OS and HeLa cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sorting U2OS and HeLa cells genetically modified with the Fucci System allowed us to separate cells according to cell cycle progression followed by RNA Sequencing to characterize the oscillating transcriptome in cells without the need for chemical synchronization.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were sorted at three timepoints, while U2OS cells were sorted at two timepoints. Each time into three groups, categorized as " G1 " , " S " , and " G2 " .

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
