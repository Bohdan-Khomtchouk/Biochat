TITLE
Differential requirement for functional telomeres in neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAseq was perfomed in control and TRF2-DCVX-cre mice to evaluate the effect of telomere dysfunction in gene expression in neurons

DESIGN
Hippocampus and Contex of 3 months old mice were isolated to perform RNAseq. Two cohorts were used: WT and TRF2-DCX-cre
