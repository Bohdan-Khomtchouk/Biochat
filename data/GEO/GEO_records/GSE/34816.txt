TITLE
Clinically significant copy number alterations and complex rearrangements of MYB and NFIB in adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using high-resolution, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), we explored genomic alterations in 40 fresh-frozen ACC samples, the largest cohort to date, with the aims to: (1) identify recurrent CNAs in ACC; (2) identify novel candidate target genes; and (3) correlate recurrent CNAs with tumour grade and other clinical parameters to identify potential clinically useful biomarkers.

DESIGN
High-resolution aCGH on fresh frozen tissue from 40 ACCs.
