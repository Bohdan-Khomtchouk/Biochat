TITLE
RNA-Seq experiment to identify genes regulated by ATF4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) is a transcription factor induced by the integrated stress response (ISR). This experiment is a genome-wide profiling of ATF4-dependent RNA expression in human HAP-1 cells. HAP-1 is a near-haploid human cell line that was derived from KBM-7 cells isolated from a patient with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia. We analyzed WT and ATF4 KO cells. We induced ATF4 expression by mimicking amino acid starvation with the drug histidinol.

DESIGN
RNA expression profiles were generated for WT and ATF4 KO HAP1 cells. ATF4 genes were mutated using Cas9 genome editing technology. Amino acid starvation was mimicked by treating WT and ATF4 KO cells with 2 mM histidinol for 24 hours, which increases ATF4 expression.
