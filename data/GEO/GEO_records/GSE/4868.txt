TITLE
Auratus goldfish genome project: Gene expression profiling in the brain of male goldfish exposed to 17Î±-EE2

ORGANISM
Carassius auratus

SUMMARY
A goldfish brain enriched cDNA combined with a carp microarray (Gracey et al., 2004). Experiment exposed adult male goldfish to 17-alpha ethinylestradiol for two weeks (two doses - 30 ng/L and 300 ng/L) Keywords: estrogenic exposure, dose response,

DESIGN
4 arrays per group 30 ng/L = slide 3, 15, 31, 41 (n=4) 300 ng/L = slide 13, 18, 32, 49 (n=3) -slides 13 and 18 are dye swaps
