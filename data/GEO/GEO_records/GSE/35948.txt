TITLE
Restoration of miR-214 expression reduces cell growth of myeloma cells through a positive regulation of P53 and inhibition of DNA replication

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs have been demonstrated to be deregulated in multiple myeloma (MM). We have previously reported the downregulation of miR-214 in MM compared to normal plasma cells. In the present study, we have explored the functional role of miR-214 in myeloma pathogenesis. Ectopic expression of miR-214 reduced cell growth and induced apoptosis of myeloma cells. In order to identify the potential direct target genes of miR-214 which could be involved in the biological pathways regulated by this miRNA, gene expression profiling of H929 myeloma cell line transfected with precursor miR-214 was carried out. Functional analysis revealed significant enrichment for DNA replication, cell cycle phase and DNA binding. We show that miR-214 directly down-regulates the expression of PSMD10, which encodes the oncoprotein gankyrin, and ASF1B, a histone chaperone required for DNA replication, by binding to their 3'-UTR. In addition, gankyrin inhibition induced an increase of P53 mRNA levels and subsequent up-regulation in CDKN1A (p21Waf1/Cip1) and BAX transcripts, which are direct transcriptional targets of p53. In conclusion, we demonstrate that miR-214 function as a tumor suppressor in myeloma by a positive regulation of p53 and inhibition of DNA replication.

DESIGN
H929 cell line was transfected with Pre-miR™ miRNA precursors pre-miR-214 or pre-miR™ miRNA negative, non-targeting control#1 (Ambion) at 50 nM concentration, using the nucleofector II system with C-16 program (Amaxa). The experiments were performed in triplicates.
