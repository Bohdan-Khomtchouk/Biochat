TITLE
Control of oxidative stress by miRNA and impact on ovarian tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of high-grade human ovarian adenocarcinomas. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that two reciprocal pathways, namely oxidative stress response and fibrosis, enable to build a hierarchical cluster of ovarian patients.

DESIGN
Ovarian human tumor samples from Institut Curie were analysed on human genome U133 plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix). Microarray analysis was performed using Partek Genomic Suite software and transcriptomic data were normalized using GCRMA algorithm. Probes from oxidative stress response and fibrosis defined by Ingenuity software  were used to build a hierarchical cluster of ovarian patients.
