TITLE
Genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) profiling of endothelial progenitor cells, and their comparison to tumor plasma cells, in multiple myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In multiple myeloma (MM), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) regulate tumor angiogenesis and disease progression. EPCs from 16 newly diagnosed patients with advanced MM were examined for genomic instability by aCGH to assess chromosomal gains and losses. Data were compared to aCGH results from corresponding CD138+ tumor plasma cells from these patients.

DESIGN
EPCs and tumor cells were derived from single-cell suspensions of bone marrow (BM) aspirates from newly diagnosed MM patients, and total genomic DNA was extracted for aCGH. DNA from healthy male peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; Promega, Madison, WI) was used as the normal control DNA.
