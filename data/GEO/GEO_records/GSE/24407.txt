TITLE
Microarray analysis of V. cholerae genes differentially expressed in 8h rabbit ileal loop fluid.

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of wild-type V. cholerae isolated from the rabbit ileal loop was performed by quickly pelleting bacteria from the fluid accumulated in the ileal loops after 8 h of infection. The bacteria were then resuspended in Trizol reagent and frozen on dry ice. The wild-type bacteria from three independent experiments in three different rabbits were analyzed. RNA was isolated from the Trizol agent, treated with DNaseI (Ambion, Austin, Texas, United States), and cleaned by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States).
