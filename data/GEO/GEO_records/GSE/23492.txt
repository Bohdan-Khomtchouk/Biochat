TITLE
Expression data from articular and growth plate cartilage

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The aim of the current study was to identify molecular markers for articular cartilage that can be used for the quality control of tissue engineered cartilage. Therefore a genom-wide expression analysis was performed using RNA isolated from articular and growth plate cartilage, both extracted from the knee joints of minipigs. Keywords: Native material or primary cells isolated from articular cartilage and growth plate cartilage

DESIGN
Articular and growth plate cartilage were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Furthermore chondrocytes from each type of cartilage were isolated and cell culture was started and terminated at day 10 or day 20. Total RNA from cultivated cells was extracted, and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays was performed.
