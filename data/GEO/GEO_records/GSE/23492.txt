TITLE
Expression data from articular and growth plate cartilage

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The aim of the current study was to identify molecular markers for articular cartilage that can be used for the quality control of tissue engineered cartilage. Therefore a genom-wide expression analysis was performed using RNA isolated from articular and growth plate cartilage, both extracted from the knee joints of minipigs. Keywords: Native material or primary cells isolated from articular cartilage and growth plate cartilage
