TITLE
Analysis of mature miRNA levels in the context of CHO cell proliferation

ORGANISM
Cricetulus griseus

SUMMARY
mature microRNA transcripts were analyzed in 5 CHO cell lines growing at different proliferation rates. The goal was to identify microRNAs that correlate positively or negatively with CHO proliferation rates.

DESIGN
A common reference design was chosen, where all samples were hybridized against a pool of all RNA samples.
