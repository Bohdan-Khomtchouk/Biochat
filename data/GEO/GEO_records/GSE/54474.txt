TITLE
Effect of PML/RARa on the transcriptome of maturing myeloid populations in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of murine cells at the GMP, Early promyelocyte (Early Pros) and Late promyelocyte (Late Pros) stages, isolated from Wt or MRP8-PML/RARa transgenics after 2 rounds of sorting.

DESIGN
Two-conditions experiment: Wt vs PML/RARa. 3 populations: GMP, Early Pros, Late Pros. 3-4 biological replicates/population (20 samples total)

PLATFORM
GPL18090 Agilent-019647 Kogan-custom-mouse1 014868 array (Probe Name version)
