TITLE
Expression profiling of mouse ILCreg cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of global gene expression levels of ILCreg cells

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling using sorted ILCreg cells from IL-10-GFP knockin mice in C57BL/6 background. Purity of cells was over 95% that was determined by post sorting analysis with flow cytometry. Total RNA was extracted from ILCregs using standard RNA extraction protocol, followed by DNase incubation to remove nuclear DNA. RNA quality was monitored by NanoDrop ND-1000 and RNA integrity was tested by agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA was amplified with Whole Transcript (WT) Pico Reagent Kit (Affymetrix). The sample preparation and microarray hybridization were performed based on the Affymetrixâ€™s standard protocols.
