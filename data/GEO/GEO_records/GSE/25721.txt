TITLE
Depletion of eIF4G from yeast cells narrows the range of translational efficiencies genome-wide

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Investigation of the effects of genetically depleting eIF4G from yeast cells on global translational efficiencies, using gene expresssion microarrays to measure the abundance of mRNA in polysomes relative to total mRNA for ~5900 genes

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were examined (designated projects I, II, and III), representing heavy polysomes (HP), light polysomes (LP), and total RNA (T) preparations from three independent pairs of WT and eIF4G degron mutant cultures. Cy3-labeled cDNAs were generated from the 3 HP, 3 LP, and 3 total RNA samples prepared for each strain and the resulting 18 sets of cDNAs were used to probe three (technical) replicate whole-genome microarrays, containing multiple 60-mer oligonucleotides for each gene. The “normalized gene expression summary values” were calculated for each gene from the data obtained from the three technical replicates and used to calculate the translational efficiency (TE) of each gene as the ratio of the intensity values for HP to total RNA (HP/T) or LP to total RNA (LP/T) for each project.
