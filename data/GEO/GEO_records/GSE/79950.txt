TITLE
UtpA and UtpB chaperone nascent pre-ribosomal RNA and the U3 snoRNP to initiate eukaryotic ribosome assembly

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Early eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis involves large multi-protein complexes, which co-transcriptionally associate with pre-ribosomal RNA to form the small subunit processome. The precise mechanisms by which two of the largest multi-protein complexes – UtpA and UtpB – interact with nascent pre-ribosomal RNA have so far been poorly understood. We have combined biochemical and structural biology approaches with ensembles of RNA-protein cross-linking to elucidate the essential function of both complexes. Here we show that UtpA contains a large composite RNA binding site and captures the 5´ end of pre-ribosomal RNA. UtpB forms an extended structure that binds early pre-ribosomal intermediates in close proximity to key architectural sites such as an RNA duplex formed by the 5´ ETS and U3 snoRNA as well as the 3´ boundary of 18S rRNA. Both complexes therefore act as vital RNA chaperones to initiate eukaryotic ribosome assembly.

DESIGN
21 samples were analyzed in total from strains carrying HTP-tagged proteins from UTP-A and UTP-B complexes. Duplicate experiments were carried out.
