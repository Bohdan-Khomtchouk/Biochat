TITLE
Sex-dependent and STAT5a-dependent Liver Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A series of dual-channel gene expression profiles obtained using Agilent Mouse TOE 75k microarrays was used to examine the sex-dependent and STAT5a-dependent differences in gene expression in adult mouse liver.  This series is comprised of 3 randomly chosen independent male and female wildtype mouse liver cDNA samples and 3 randomly chosen independent male and female STAT5a-deficient mouse liver cDNA samples, totalling 12 samples.  The samples were paired randomly to generate 4 comparisons of M-WT:F-WT, M-WT:M-KO, F-KO:F-WT, F-KO:M-KO.  Comparison of the set of sex-dependent genes with the set of genes responsive to the loss of STAT5a in females shows a small group of the sex-specific genes were also regulated by STAT5a in females.  These results indicate a role for STAT5a in female gene expression to a lesser degree than that shown for STAT5b in males. Keywords: genetic knockout and sex response
