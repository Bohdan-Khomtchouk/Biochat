TITLE
U2OS ad-HIC1 target identification

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The tumor suppressor gene HIC1 (Hypermethylated in Cancer 1) is essential for mammalian development and is epigenetically silenced in many human tumors. Functionally, HIC1 is involved in a complex pathway regulating P53 tumor-suppression activity. HIC1 encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor containing five Kr√ºppel-like C2H2 zinc fingers but only a few genes regulated by HIC1 have been reported, including SIRT1. Keywords: Time Series Design

DESIGN
We performed genome-wide expression profiling analyses to identify new HIC1 target genes, in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells infected with adenoviruses expressing either HIC1 or GFP as control.
