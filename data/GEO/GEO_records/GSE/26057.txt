TITLE
miRNA profiling of Macaca nemestrina plasma samples: before SIV infection and during acute infection

ORGANISM
Macaca nemestrina

SUMMARY
This study describes a circulating miRNA signature of acute retroviral infection, which may include candidate diagnostic or prognostic miRNAs for lentivirus-associated neurologic conditions.

DESIGN
Plasma samples were taken from six macaques prior to infection and at ten days post-infection. Three macaques each went on to develop no or severe encephalitis. miRNA profiles were generated for each animal before and 10 days after SIV infection.
