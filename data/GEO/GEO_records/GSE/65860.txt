TITLE
5-hydroxymethylcytosine dynamics during retinal maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) hydroxylases (Tet1-3) oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). In neurons increased 5hmC levels within gene bodies correlate positively with gene expression. Here, we studied 5hmC profiles (hMeDIP) during retinal maturation between postnatal week 2 and postnatal week 3 using HiSeq 2000 instrument.

DESIGN
Study of retinal 5hmC profile dynamics in 2-week old and 3-week old wild type (WT) mouse.
