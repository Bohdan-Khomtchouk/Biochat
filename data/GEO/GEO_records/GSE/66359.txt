TITLE
Analysis of the gene expression profile in normal human epidermal keratinocytes and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The incidence of keratinocyte-derived skin cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is increasing worldwide making it the second most common metastatic skin cancer. We used microarrays to characterize gene expression profile in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and cSCC cell lines.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from normal human epidermal keratinocytes (n=5) and cSCC cell lines (n=8) were extracted. The samples were processed for Affymetrix 3´ IVT Express Kit according to manufacture’s protocol.
