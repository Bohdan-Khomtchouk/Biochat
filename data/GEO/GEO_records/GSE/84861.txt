TITLE
Effects of the expression of a samble mutant of Kif1-Binding Protein (KBP) on the transcriptome of self-renewing ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse ES cells were stably transduced with a lentivirus expressing either wild-type KBP or the stable mutant KBP(KK/RR) and maintained in self-renewing growth conditions. RNA-seq was performed to assess mRNA expression differences caused by the stabilization of KBP.

DESIGN
6 samples [a triplicate set for ES cells expressing wild-type KBP and a triplicate set expressing KBP(KK/RR)] were analyzed.
