TITLE
Deep sequencing of small RNAs

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Recently, we demonstrated that RDRs had a general function to synthesize antisense RNAs from sense transcripts of protein-coding genes. In this study, we analyzed whether RDR-mediated antisense RNAs were processed into small RNAs by deep sequencing using SOLiD. Deep sequencing identified 1,645 RDR1/2/6-mediated smRNA loci in drought stress and control conditions.

DESIGN
Untreated and 2 hr-drought stress-treated 2 week-old rdr1/2/6 and wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana plants were used. smRNA libraries for SOLiD sequencing were constructed according to the protocol of SOLiD Total RNA-Seq Kit and subjected to SOLiD sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL14599 AB SOLiD 4 System (Arabidopsis thaliana)
