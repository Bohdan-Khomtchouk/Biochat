TITLE
expression data of miR-21 knockdown in MCF-7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-21 is overexpressed in breast cancer cells. Knock-down of miR-21 cause apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation. To identify miR-21 regulated cancer-pathways in MCF-7 cells, we knocked-down miR-21 and performed microarray.

DESIGN
RNA was harvested from MCF-7 cells 24 hours transfection of anti-control, anti-21, or untreated cells. RNA was processed and hybridized into Affymetrix whole human genome arrays in duplicates.
