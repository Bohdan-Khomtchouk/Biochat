TITLE
Methylome of Fetal and Maternal Monocytes and Macrophages at the Feto-Maternal Interface

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Maternal and fetal monocytes and tissue macrophages (decidual macrophages, Hofbauer cells) at the feto-maternal interface have different methylome.

DESIGN
Paired and balanced design.  We compared maternal blood monocytes (MB) vs. cord blood monocytes (CB), maternal blood monocytes (MB) vs. decidual macrophages (Deci), cord blood monocytes (CB) vs placental macrophages (villi) and decidual macrophages (Deci) vs. placental macrophages (villi).
