TITLE
Differential gene expression in A. thaliana seedlings depending on the introduction of a point mutation in FIT (FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR) under iron deficient conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au15-05_fit - differential gene expression in a.tha. depending on mutation in fit - Transcriptomical changes in transgenic plants that carry a point mutation in FIT. - Differential gene expression in A. thaliana seedlings depending on the introduction of a point mutation in FIT (FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR) under iron deficient conditions.

DESIGN
18 dye-swap - gene knock out,genotype comparaison,normal vs transgenic comparaison
