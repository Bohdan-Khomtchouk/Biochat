TITLE
Ste18p is a positive control element in the mating process of Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Disruption of STE18 gene which encodes a γ subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein in Candida albicans is shown to block pheromone-induced gene expression. Ectopic expression of either the Gα or the Gβ subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein is able to restore pheromone-induced gene expression.

DESIGN
The transcriptional response to pheromone treatment was measured in the wild type strain, in a strain deleted for STE18, and in STE18 deleted strains ectopic expressing either the Gα or the Gβ subunit of G protein in opaque forms under RT.
