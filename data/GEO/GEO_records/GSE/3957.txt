TITLE
IRES containing mRNAs and mitotic cell cycle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A cell synchronization protocol was established in which global and individual mRNA translational efficiencies could be examined. While global translational efficiency was reduced in mitotic cells, approximately 3% of mRNAs remained predominantly associated with large polysomes during mitosis, as determined by cDNA microarray analyses. The 5 noncoding regions of six mRNAs were shown to contain internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). However, not all known mRNAs that contain IRES elements were actively translated during mitosis, arguing that specific IRES sequences are differentially regulated during mitosis. A cell cycle design experiment design type is one that assays events that occurs in relation to the cell cycle, which is the period between the formation of a cell, by division of its mother cell and the time when the cell itself divides to form two daughter cells.
