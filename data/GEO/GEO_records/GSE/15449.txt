TITLE
Thrombopoietin (TPO) protects against heart damage induced by doxorubicin and infarction in rat models

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In order to examine the mechanism of TPO on cardiac protection against DOX damage, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to delineate the TPO cardioprotective mechanism against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy

DESIGN
Dox and TPO induced gene expressions in rat heart were measured at day 6. Two biological replicates were performed for each treatment group.

PLATFORM
GPL7294 Agilent-014879 Whole Rat Genome Microarray 4x44K G4131F (Probe Name version)
