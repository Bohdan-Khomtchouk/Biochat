TITLE
Gene expression of growth plate of mouse.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The growth plate is histomorphologically classified into four zones {resting zone (RZ), proliferating zone (PZ), maturing zone (MZ) and hypertrophic zone (HZ)}. Gene expression profile analyses of 4 zones were performed using microarrays.

DESIGN
We performed global analysis of gene expression in tibias from nine-day-old mice.  Chondrocytes layer was microdissected en-block from four anatomically distinct growth plate zones, and RNA expression was analyzed using microarrays.Chondrocytes from four anatomical zones were isolated from tibias of two mice.  The eight samples were named after the mouse (1 or 2) and the growth plate zone, such as resting zone of 1st mouse (RZ01), 2nd mouse (RZ02), proliferation zone (PZ01, PZ02), maturing zone (MZ01, MZ02) and hypertrophic zone (HZ01, HZ02).
