SUMMARY
affy_med_2011_06 - affy_med_2011_06 - Legume plants establish a symbiotic interaction with soil bacteria called rhizobia. A complex molecular dialogue between the two partners is necessary for the successful infection and organogenesis processes that will ultimately result in the formation of a nitrogen fixing nodule. During a M. truncatula Tnt1 mutant screen, a new class of symbiotic mutant called noot (nodule root) was identified. This original single recessive mutant develops a root in apical position of nodules that are colonized by bacteria and functional for nitrogen fixation. This conversion suggests that the legume nodule morphogenetic pathway may be derived from a root program. We cloned the NOOT gene and showed that it corresponds to Pisum sativum COCH (Ferguson and Reid, 2005, Plant Cell Physiol 46, 1583-1589). The goal of this project is to compare the transcriptomes from wild type nodules and roots to the noot nodule one. This will allow us to unravel the similarity and differences between the wild type and mutant nodule transcriptomes but also to know which developmental pathway is under the control of the NOOT gene. --Seeds of the WT and noot mutant lines (two mutant alleles: Tnk507 and NF2717) were surface sterilized and placed at 4Â°C for three days on a minimal BNM medium square plate (12cm X 12cm). Seeds were germinated at room temperature and 10 seeds were placed in a row on nitrogen poor (BNM) plate. Seedlings were inoculated using Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm41 for nodule production. Some WT plants were not infected by the bacteria in order to collect roots. Nodules and roots were harvested 18 to 21 days post inoculation. Each experimental repetition (3 WT nodules, 3 WT roots and 2 mutant nodules of each allele) was harvested at a separated day. RNA preparations were done using a Quiagen Kit.
