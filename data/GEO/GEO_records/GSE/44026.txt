TITLE
Tmem88a Mediates GATA-dependent Specification of Cardiomyocyte Progenitors by Restricting Canonical WNT Signaling

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from zebrafish wild-type embryos, gata5 morphants, gata6 morphants, and gata5/6 morphants at bud and 6-somite developmental stages to identify genes co-operatively regulated by gata5 and gata6 during cardiomyocyte progenitor specification.

DESIGN
Samples were collected in duplicate, with 40 embryos per sample. Single 36-base pair reads were sequenced on the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx
