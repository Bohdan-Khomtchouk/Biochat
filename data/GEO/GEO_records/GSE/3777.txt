TITLE
Gene Expression Profiles of Undifferentiated and Differentiated Mammospheres

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammary gland cells were isolated from 5-8 week old FVB mice and allowed to proliferate as undifferentiated mammospheres in the presence of growth factors (bFGF and EGF). Comparison of the gene expression profiles of undifferentiated mammospheres vs. mammospheres that were allowed to differentiate for 6 days by the removal of growth factors will help to identify genes that are implicated in the maintenance of the mammary gland stem cell compartment. Keywords: other

DESIGN
this experiment include 2 samples and 12 replicates
