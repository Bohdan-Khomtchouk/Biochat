TITLE
Human osteoblast treated with Melphalen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global expression profile of human osteoblast treated with melphalen, compared to human osteoblast cells treated with diluent control

DESIGN
Universal reference design with four biological replicates for the treated cells and four biological replicates for the untreated cells. Stratagene Universal Reference RNA was used as the common reference for all arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
