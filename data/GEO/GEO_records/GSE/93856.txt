TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of  transcriptomes of thymus derived tTreg cells and the exFoxp3 precursor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the phenotype of the precursor of exFoxp3 cells and find the signals that affect the stability of  tTreg cells, we analysis the  transcriptomes of epigenetic stable thymus derived tTreg cells and the exFoxp3 precursor cells.

DESIGN
Transcriptioanl profiles of  tTreg cells (Thy1.1+YFP+) and exFoxp3 precursor cells (Thy1.1+YFP+) cells isolated from Foxp3 Î”CNS1-Cre-R26-YFP transgenic mice were generated by RNA-sequencing.

PLATFORM
