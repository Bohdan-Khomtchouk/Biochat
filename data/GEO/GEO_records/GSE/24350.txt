TITLE
Expression data from peptidoglycan stimulated CD11b+ cells from NOD and NOD.Idd3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD11b+ CD11c- cells were isolated by cell sorting from the spleens of NOD and NOD.Idd3 mice.  Cells were then either unstimulated or stimulated with peptidoglycan (5ug/ml) for 4 hours at 37 degrees prior to RNA extraction. Peptidoglycan was chosen as a stimulus due to its know ability to stimulate CD11b+ cells through Toll-like receptor 2 and our previous data showing biological differences between NOD and NOD.Idd3-derived CD11b+CD11c- cells after stimulation with peptidoglycan.

DESIGN
CD11b+ cells from NOD and NOD.Idd3 were either unstimulated or stimulated with peptidoglycan(PGN) for 4 hours at 37 degerees prior to RNA extraction.
