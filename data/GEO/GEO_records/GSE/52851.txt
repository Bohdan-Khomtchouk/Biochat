ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of in vivo follicular cells from small (S), medium sized (M) and Large (L) follicles collected individually 36hrs post hCG in superstimulated women from fertility clinic. Samples are also characterized by their respective oocyte outcome following fertilization (transferable embryo (+) or not(-))

DESIGN
