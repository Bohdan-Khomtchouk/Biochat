TITLE
Profiling human naive and primed pluripotent states

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we analyse transcriptome profiles of naive, primed and intermediate populations of human pluripotent stem cells

DESIGN
Transcriptome (mRNA-Seq) from naive, primed, four day-10 flow-sorted populations (Nmin, N3+, N4+ and N4â€“), and N4+ sorted cells that were propagated for five and ten passages in naive conditions.

PLATFORM
