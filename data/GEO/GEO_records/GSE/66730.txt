TITLE
Disrupted iron homeostasis causes dopaminergic neurodegeneration in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Disruption of local iron homeostasis is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases. We focused on dopaminergic neurons, asking how iron transport proteins modulate iron homeostasis in vivo. Inactivation of the transmembrane iron exporter ferroportin had no apparent consequences. However, loss of the transferrin receptor 1, involved in iron uptake, caused profound, age-progressive neurodegeneration with features similar to Parkinsonâ€™s disease. There was gradual loss of dopaminergic projections in the striatum with subsequent death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. After depletion of 30% of the neurons the mice developed neurobehavioral parkinsonism, with evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitochondrial autophagy. Molecular analysis revealed strong signatures indicative of attempted axonal regeneration, a metabolic switch to glycolysis and the unfolded protein response. We speculate that cellular iron deficiency may contribute to neurodegeneration in human patients

DESIGN
Using Ribotag technology, from mouse ventral midbrain lysates, we isolated actively translated mRNA species from control and Transferrin receptor 1-null dopaminergic neurons.  Two mouse ages were used 3 wks (early neurodegeration) 10 wks (late neurodegeneration)
