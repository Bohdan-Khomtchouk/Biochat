TITLE
Genome-wide Regulation of Electro-acupuncture on the Neural Stat5-loss-induced Obese Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Acupuncture is reported to be effective in treating obesity related illnesses, but its mechanism is still unclear. To investigate this mechanism we applied electro-acupuncture (EA) in a mouse model of obesity and used RNA-seq to identify molecular consequences. Methods: Adult male mice (17w)  were divided into three groups: Stat5fl/fl, Stat5NKO, Stat5NKO+EA groups, hypothalamus and Epi-WAT mRNA profiles of  mice in each group were generated by deep sequencing,using Illumina Hiseq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 25 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (UCSC mm9) and identified transcripts in the Stat5fl/fl, Stat5NKO and Stat5NKO+EA mice  with TopHat and Cufflinks workflow respectively.  Genes with lower than one FPKM (average fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped) were filtered out. Up-regulation and down-regulation were defined as a relative transcription level above Log2 fold change (FC) ≥ |±1| and P value < 0.05. Conclusions: Our results provided, for the first time, insight into genomic networks of obesity and their modulation by electro-acupuncture, which in turn reveals potential mechanisms that explain acupuncture-induced weight-loss.

DESIGN
Hypothalamus and Epi-WAT mRNA profiles of  Stat5fl/fl, Stat5NKO and Stat5NKO+EA  mice were generated by Hiseq 2000, all groups included three samples.
