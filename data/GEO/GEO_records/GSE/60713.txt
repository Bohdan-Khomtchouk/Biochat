TITLE
The role of cancer exosomes in non-tumorigenic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to report that breast cancer associated exosomes contain microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with the RISC Loading Complex  (RLC) and display cell-independent capacity to process precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) into mature miRNAs. Pre-miRNAs, along with Dicer, AGO2, and TRBP, are present in exosomes of cancer cells. CD43 mediates the accumulation of Dicer specifically in cancer exosomes. Cancer exosomes mediate an efficient and rapid silencing of mRNAs to reprogram the target cell transcriptome. Exosomes derived from cells and sera of patients with breast cancer instigate non-tumorigenic epithelial cells to form tumors in a Dicer-dependent manner. These findings offer opportunities for the development of exosomes based biomarkers and therapies.

DESIGN
Exosomes from cancer cells were isolated using established ultracentrifugation methods. The global miRNA content of non-tumorigenic cells was investigated before and after exosomes treatment to study the role of microRNA biogenesis in exosomes for cancer progression and the transformation process of normal cells.
