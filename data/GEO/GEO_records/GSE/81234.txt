TITLE
Identification of candidate regulators of powdery mildew resistance in cucumber using comparative RNA-sequencing based transcriptome analysis

ORGANISM
Cucumis sativus

SUMMARY
To investigate the candidate genes governing Pm5.1 and their effects on powdery resistance, the RNA-sequencing based transcriptomes of the powdery mildew resistant segment substitution line SSL508-28 and recurrent parent D8 were compared 48 h after inoculation with the PM pathogen.

DESIGN
mRNA levels of the leaves of SSL508-28 and D8 after 48 h of powdery mildew inoculation, along with uninfected control leaves from each, was generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq2500

PLATFORM
GPL20825 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Cucumis sativus)
