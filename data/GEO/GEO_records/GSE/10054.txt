TITLE
Expression information of splicing factor OsSKIPa knock-down and overexpressed rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
OsSKIPa is an SNW/SKIP protein in rice, which homolog to SKIP(human) and PRP45(yeast). OsSKIPa can rescue the lethal of yeast prp45 mutants. OsSKIPa-suppressed plants (S59R) show decrease of cell viability. Overexpression of OsSKIPa (S58S) increase the osmotic stresses tolerance. OsSKIPa is an important regulator and interacting with a lot of proteins which have varient functions. In order to find the genes expression information when OsSKIPa changed. We use microarray to find changed genes in S59R and S58S plants in the normal condition. Keywords: gene expression array-based (RNA / in situ oligonucleotide)

DESIGN
Whole plants were collected from 1-month-old S58S (two replicates), S59R (three replicates) and wild type (three replicates).
