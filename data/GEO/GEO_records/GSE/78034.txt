TITLE
Analysis of embryonic development in the unsequenced axolotl: waves of transcriptional upheaval and stability

ORGANISM
Ambystoma mexicanum

SUMMARY
We performed whole transcriptome polyA+ RNA sequencing experiments on 17 stages of embryonic development

DESIGN
The RNA-seq data consisted of three biological replicate samples from each stage (with the exception of stages 1 and 11, which only had two replicates), for a total of 49 samples.  RNA-seq data were paired-end with a read length of 101 bases.
