TITLE
Identification of metabolic pathways in Daphnia magna exposed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors using transcriptomic, immunocytochemistry and physiological responses.

ORGANISM
Daphnia magna

SUMMARY
Assessing the risks of long-term exposure to low doses of pharmaceuticals is an identified research need, particularly for those that may act as neural disruptors in non-vertebrate species. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) act by blocking the re-uptake of serotonin in the nerve synapses, increasing the effective concentration of serotonin in the intra-synaptic space and therefore stimulating serotoninergic neurons. This effect is used worldwide to treat clinical depression in humans, with the consequence of their widespread release into the environment. SSRIs have been found to alter the reproductive physiology of D. magna and other invertebrates in a biphasic way. Low levels of fluoxetine stimulated offspring production in Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia dubia at 36 and 50 Âµg/l, respectively, but higher exposure levels inhibited reproduction in the same species.

DESIGN
In this study we explore the hypothesis that SSRI can affect D. magna juvenile developmental rates and offspring production disrupting serotonin activity that is known to regulate carbohydrate and oxidative metabolic pathways. The primary mode of action was tested using transcriptomic analyses of juveniles and adults exposed to SSRIs (fluoxetine 80 ppbs, fluovoxamine 30 ppbs) and serotonin-immunocytochemistry assays of D. magna brains.  Reproduction, respirometry and biochemical measurements allowed to related gene and immunological base effects to phenotypic responses.
