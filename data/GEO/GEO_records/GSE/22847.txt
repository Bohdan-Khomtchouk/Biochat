TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of AHLs signals add in experiment inYersinia pestis CO92 at 37°C

ORGANISM
Yersinia pestis

SUMMARY
Yersinia pestis, the etiological agent of plague, is able to sense cell density by quorum sensing. The function of quorum sensing in Y. pestis is not clear. Here, the process of AHL quorum sensing was investigated by comparing transcript profiles when two AHL quorum-sensing signals are added in. The strain ∆pgm (pigmentation-negative) mutant R88 was called wild type. The two AHLs signals are N-(3-Oxooctanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone and N-Hexanoyl-DL-homoserine lactone.The control consisted of cells grown and treated under the same conditions without added signals.

DESIGN
Six independent RNA samples from R88 cultures were paired with six independent RNA samples from two AHLs added cultures for hybridization to six two-color microarrays. A dye-swap design was used to remove the Cy5 and Cy3 dye bias.
