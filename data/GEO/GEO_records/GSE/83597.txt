TITLE
Identification of transcriptional changes upon genetic deletion of Vhl, Pbrm1 and double deletion of both Vhl and Pbrm1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine why double deficiency of Vhl and Pbrm1 but not single deficiency of either gene resulted in ccRCC, we performed gene expression profiling of RNA isolated from renal cortices of 3-month-old WT, VhlF/FKsp-Cre, Pbrm1F/FKsp-Cre, and VhlF/FPbrm1F/FKsp-Cre mice.

DESIGN
The transcripts from WT, VhlF/FKsp, Pbrm1F/FKsp, VhlF/FPbrm1F/FKsp-Cre 3 month old animals were compared to identify the initial transcriptional events that may be important in ccRCC tumor formation
