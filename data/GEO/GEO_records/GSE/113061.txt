SUMMARY
DNA methylation signatures of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension

DESIGN
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal  pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell lines (PASMCs) and PASMCs of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) patients. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip  was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs. Samples included 3 normal commercially human cell lines and  cultured PASMCs from the patient endarterectomy tissues of five patients with CTEPH. Bisulphite converted DNA from the 8 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
