TITLE
A Parallel Study of mRNA and MicroRNA Profiling of Peripheral Blood in Young Adult Women (MicroRNA Profiling)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify aging-related biomarkers to improve our understanding of complex physiological changes, thereby providing a means to investigate the mechanism by which aging influences various diseases.

DESIGN
Global microRNA expression patterns from peripheral blood of two groups of healthy young adult women, among which 13 were aged 22-25 and 9 were aged 36-39 years old, were compared to determine changes in microRNA expression that are associated with aging.
