TITLE
TAL1 complex in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RPMI-8402)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1/SCL is aberrantly overexpressed in over 40% of cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), emphasizing the importance of the TAL1-regulated transcriptional program in the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL. Here we identify regions occupied by TAL1 and its regulatory partners HEB, E2A, and GATA3 in a T-ALL cell line (RPMI-8402).

DESIGN
Human T-ALL cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 20 min. DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. A sample of whole cell extract (WCE) was sequenced and used as the background to determine enrichment. ChIP was performed using an antibody against total TAL1 (Santa Cruz SC-12984), TCF12/HEB (Santa Cruz SC-357),TCF3/E2A (Santa Cruz SC-349X), and GATA3 (Santa Cruz SC-22206).
