TITLE
RNA sequencing of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor and Gr1+/Mac1+ cells derived from Diap1 wild type, heterozygous, and knockout mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the experiment was to study the aberrant signalling pathways due to loss of or haploinsufficiency of Diap1 protein. We found that LPS receptor transcript is highly expressed in Diap1 deficient Gr1+/Mac1+ cells but not in Lin- cells, suggesting a role for Diap1 in determining the normal morphology of committed Gr1+/Mac1+ cells.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression profiles of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor and Gr1+/Mac1+ myeloid cells from Diap1 wild type, heterozygous, and knockout mice.

PLATFORM
GPL16790 AB 5500 Genetic Analyzer (Mus musculus)
