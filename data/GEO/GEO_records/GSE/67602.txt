TITLE
Single-cell RNA-seq of murine epidermis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal how heterogeneity and plasticity of keratinocytes is tuned at the transcriptional level

DESIGN
We isolated and analyzed totally 1422 epidermal cells from dorsal telogen skin of C57BL/6 mice aged 56 +/-4 days. Sca1-microbeads were used to increase HF cell numbers and Sca1- (HF) and Sca1+ (mainly IFE) cell fractions were captured in a ratio of  2:1 on a microfluidic Fluidigm C1 system.
