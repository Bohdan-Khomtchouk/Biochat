TITLE
Global gene expression profile of small intestine from wild-type and CFTR-knockout mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression levels between wild-type and CFTR-knockout small intestine.  CFTR-knockout mice (provided by Dr. Lane Clarke of the University of Missouri) were maintained on colyte. Keywords: gene expression comparison

DESIGN
Four wild-type and four CFTR-knockout small intestinal RNA samples were compared.  To facilitate statistical analysis and reduce affects of Cy3 and Cy5 labeling, comparison of two WT and two KO were repeated with a dye flip.
