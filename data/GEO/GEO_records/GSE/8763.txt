TITLE
Global gene expression profile of small intestine from wild-type and CFTR-knockout mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression levels between wild-type and CFTR-knockout small intestine.  CFTR-knockout mice (provided by Dr. Lane Clarke of the University of Missouri) were maintained on colyte. Keywords: gene expression comparison
