TITLE
SNP array of human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y, SH-EP and SK-N-SH

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TERT promoter muatations occur frequently in tumors of various origin. We here accessed the frequency of TERT pomoter mutations in 131 human primary neuroblastomas and 20 human neuroblastoma cell lines. No TERT promoter mutations were found in the 131 primary neuroblastomas. However, in the three cell lines SH-SY5Y, SH-EP and SK-N-SH  a TERT promoter mutation was detected. Sanger sequencing indicated a homozygous mutation. To confirm loss of heterozygosity (LOH) we performed Affymetrix CytoScanHD SNP arrays. Indeed LOH could be confirmed.

DESIGN
SNP arry experiments were performed according to the standard protocol for Affymetrix CytoScanHD arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara). Briefly, a 250 ng sample of genomic DNA was digested with NspI, ligated to adaptors, amplified by PCR, fragmented and biotin-labeled. The labeled samples were hybridized to Affymetrix CytoscanHD arrays, followed by washing, staining and scanning in the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000. Analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite v2.1.
