TITLE
cDNA microarray data after influenza A virus infection in nasal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comparative gene expression analysis was performed using cDNA microarray technology in passage-2 normal human nasal epithelial cells to identify the differentially expressed genes between influenza A virus infected and uninfected cells.

DESIGN
Two samples were analyzed. RNA was extracted from normal human nasal epithelial cells, which were further divided as H1N1 PI 0 day and H1N1 PI 2 day (influenza A virus infection for 48 hr).
