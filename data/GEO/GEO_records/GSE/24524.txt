TITLE
Identification of genes induced on nitrate, role of OxyR

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
The study aimed to identify role of OxyR during growth on different electron acceptors when E. coli are growing anaerobically.

DESIGN
Wt and OxyR null cells were grown on nitrate and fumarate medium anaerobically. Each condition was done in duplicate. RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy kit after stabilization of RNA with RNA protect bacteria reagent. Hybridization and further processing was done based on Affymetrix protocols on E. coli Genome 2.0 arrays.
