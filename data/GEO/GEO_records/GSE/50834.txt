TITLE
Gene expression analysis of PBMC from HIV and HIV/TB co-infected patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Diagnosis of TB, especially in the presence of an HIV co-infection, can be challenging when using conventional diagnostic methods.  In this study, we analyzed global gene expression data from PBMC of patients that were either mono-infected with HIV or co-infected with HIV and TB in order to identify a TB-specific gene signature.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from PBMC from a South African cohort.  Microarry analysis was performed to compare gene expression in patients either infected with HIV or co-infected with HIV/TB.
