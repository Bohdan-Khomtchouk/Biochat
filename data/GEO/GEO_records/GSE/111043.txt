TITLE
Comparison between steady-state fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in mouse lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This analysis aimed to identify significantly up-regulated genes in myofibroblasts, compared with steady-state fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Microarray comparison of mouse lung cells sorted by FACS, including steady-state fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and lung homogenates (as controls). Each group has two sets of 50000 cells.
