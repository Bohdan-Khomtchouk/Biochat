TITLE
Streptococcus mutans UA159 with or without 8.4% oxygen vs. nox mutant strain. pH7

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of the effects of oxygen concentraion in S. mutans

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 3 or 4 replicate samples of S. mutans UA159, UA159 grown in 8.4 % oxygen concentration and MU1020 (âˆ†nox) grown in continuous culture to steady-state pH values of 7.  RNA was labeled with Cy3.  For each replicate, labeled RNA was hybridized to slides along with Cy5-labeled reference RNA, extracted from S. mutans UA159 cultures grown to mid-log.

PLATFORM
GPL15711 JCVI PFGRC Streptococcus mutans 13K v3 array designed primarily based on strain UA159 [ORF version]
