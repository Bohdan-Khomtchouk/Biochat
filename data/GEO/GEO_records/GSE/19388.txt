TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for non-small cell lung cancer cell line samples, PC-9

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PC-9 cells were exposed in vitro to the reversible EGFR inhibitor ZD1839 (gefitinib) and resistant clones were isolated. One of these resistant clones (PC-9 GR4) was then exposed to the irreversible EGFR inhibitor PF00299804 and dual-resistant clones (PC-9 DRs), or those resistant to both ZD1839 and PF00299804, were isolated.  In order to compare global genomic changes between PC-9, PC-9 GR, and PC-9 DR cells, we performed a genome-wide SNP analysis.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from non-small cell lung cancer cell lines.  Each sample analyzed in single, with PC-9 serving as the reference sample.
