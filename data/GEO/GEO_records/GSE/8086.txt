TITLE
S. coelicolor Wild Type Time-course Study in R5- medium (Culture#2)

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
Antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces species is controlled by a complex genetic and biochemical network of global and pathway specific regulators.  Details of their precise interactions in mediating temporal and spatial expression of secondary metabolite genes remain poorly defined.  In this study, we employed whole-genome microarrays to investigate the temporal transcriptome profiles of S. coelicolor A3(2) M145 wild type and disruption mutants of regulatory genes (afsS and absA1) known to affect antibiotic biosynthesis. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
The time-course study involved analysis of 9 samples (10h, 13h, 16h, 19h, 22h, 25h, 31h, 35h, 37h). Of these, the 16h sample was analyzed on three arrays (3 technical replicates). All other samples were analyzed on duplicate arrays (2 technical replicates). Genomic DNA of S. coelicolor wild type (M145) was used as a reference for all the arrays. cDNA was labeled with Alexa647 and genomic DNA was labeled with Cy3.
