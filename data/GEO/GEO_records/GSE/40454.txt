TITLE
Mechanisms and rescue strategies of Calcineurin inhibitor mediated tolerance abrogation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To ensure safety tolerance induction protocols are accompanied by conventional immunosuppressive drugs IS. But IS such as calcineurin inhibitors CNI can interfere with tolerance induction. We investigated the effect of an additional CNI treatment on anti-CD4 mAb-induced tolerance induction upon rat kidney transplantation.   Additional CNI treatment induced deteriorated graft function and chronic rejection characterised by alloantibody production, intragraft plasma cells and C3d deposition. Microarray analysis revealed enhanced intragraft expression of the B cell chemokine CXCL13 upon additional CNI treatment. In contrast PNOC, a B cell-related gene highly expressed in operational tolerant kidney transplant recipients, was decreased in grafts of anti-CD4 mAb+CsA-treated recipients suggesting an altered balance of B regulatory genes.  Transient B cell depletion or transfer of Tregs three weeks after transplantation could inhibit intragraft B cell accumulation, alloantibody production and ameliorate chronic rejection.  These data represent unexpected findings and should be taken into consideration when designing new clinical trials. To safe the benefit of CNI in controlling memory T cell responses we need strategies for a therapeutic optimization. We show here that early B cell depletion or transfer of Tregs may be one approach to arrest B cell accumulation, activation and graft destruction.
