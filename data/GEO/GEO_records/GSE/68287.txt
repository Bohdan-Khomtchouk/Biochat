TITLE
Orf306, an esterase coded by the Organophosphate degradation (opd) island of Sphingobium fuliginis ATCC27551 induced gene expression profiling in E. coli MG1655

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Orf306 induces PNP utilization in E. coli MG1655, the gene expression studies were performed to obtain further details about proteins and pathways that are regulated under the influence of Orf306
