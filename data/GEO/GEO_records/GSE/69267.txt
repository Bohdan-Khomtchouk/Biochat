TITLE
Expression data from rat organotypic hippocampal slices lentivirally infected with shRNF10 or scramble construct

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
RNF10 is a synapse-to-nucleus protein messsenger regulating NMDAR-dependent gene trascription. We have charaterized the impact of the absence of RNF10 on structural synaptic plasticity. In this dataset we included expression data from homogenates of DIV14 rat organotypic hippocampal slices lentivirally infected with shRNF10 or scramble construct

DESIGN
8 total samples were analyzed (4 shRNF10 and 4 scramble).
