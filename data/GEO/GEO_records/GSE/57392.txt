TITLE
ChIP-seq profiling of H3K27 tri-methylation in Ezh2-deficient and control murine lung epithelium at day E16.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epithelial (CD31-CD45-EpCAM+) lung cells were derived by FACS from ShhCre;Ezh2fl/fl and control ShhCre;Ezh2fl/+ mouse embryos at day E16.5 (2 biological replicates per genotype). Chromatin from each of the replicates was immunoprecipitated with H3K27me3 antibody (Millipore #07-449) and subjected to NGS library preparation using TruSeq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). Completed libraries from different samples were sequenced on HiSeq 2500 TruSeq with SBS Kit v3 - HS reagents (Illumina) as 100 bp single end reads at the Australian Genome Research Facility.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq profiles of H3K27 tri-methylation from Ezh2 deficient and control lung epithelium (2 replicates per genotype).
