TITLE
Genome wide STAT3 RNAi expression profiling data from Thp,Th0 and Th17 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
STAT3 is an immidiate regulator of Th17 differentiation. STAT3 difieciency downmodulate Th17 specific genes and Th17 responses. Therefore, we intend to identify genome wide targets of STAT3. We used microarrays to profile gene expression of STAT3 regulated genes during Th17 polarization.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from non-targeting and STAT3 siRNA treated Thp, Th0 and Th17 cell samples from different time points. Total RNA subjected to poly-A selection and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
