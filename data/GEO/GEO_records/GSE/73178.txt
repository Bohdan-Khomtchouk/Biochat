TITLE
Detection of metastasis-specific miRNA for metastatic lesion of colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We carried out comprehensive analysis for the miRNA profiling of primary tumor and metastatic lesion which seems to be source of circulating miRNA. We picked up two patients who treated with primary tumor resection initially and received chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of liver metastasis. The total miRNA was isolated from frozen tissue specimens. SurePrint G3 Human miRNA microarray kit Rel.21.0 (Agilent Technologies) contains 2549 human microRNA probes.   As previously reported, hsa-miR200c revealed specifically high expression in metastatic sites at both two cases.

DESIGN
In two colorectal cancer patients, the frozen primary tumor, normal mucosa and liver-metastatic lesion were analyzed by microRNA microarray.
