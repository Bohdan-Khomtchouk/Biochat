TITLE
IM006B - Mouse infection with A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG3/2004 (H5N1)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG3/2004 (H5N1) is a PB1-F2 deletion in wild type A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1). The goal of this study was to determine the host response (C57BL/6 mouse model) to the PB1-F2 mutation at a 10^4 PFU dose.

DESIGN
Groups of 20-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were infected with A/Vietnam/1203-CIP048_RG3/2004 (H5N1). This is a PB1-F2 deletion in wild type A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1). Infections were with 10^4 PFU or time-matched mock infections. Time points were 1, 2, 4 and 7 d.p.i. There were 1-5 animals/dose/time point. Lung samples were collected for virus load, transcriptional analysis and proteomic analysis. Weight loss and animal survival were also monitored.
