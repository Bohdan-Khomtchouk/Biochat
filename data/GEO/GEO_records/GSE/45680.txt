TITLE
Expression data from citrus fruit (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck)

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
An antifungal aroma substance, 2-phenylethanol (PEA), was isolated from antagonistic yeast strain Kloeckera apiculata extract. Microarry were used to analyse its role citrus. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying Citrus were treated with 1.0x108 cells/ml K. apiculata (KA), PEA (0.15%), the extract (1000xdilute) and control (CK) for 24 h,

DESIGN
An antifungal aroma substance, 2-phenylethanol, was isolated from antagonistic yeast strain Kloeckera apiculata. To analyse its role in Citrus response,Citrus were treated with  K. apiculata , 2-phenylethano (0.15%), the extract (1000xdilute) and control (CK) for 24 h, respectively. The fresh epicarp of citrus was separated by knife and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
