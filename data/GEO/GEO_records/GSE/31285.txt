TITLE
Analysis of genes regulated by the transcription factor LUMAN identifies ApoA4 as a target gene in dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression upon overexpression of the active form of the transcription factor LUMAN in mouse dendritic cell line D2SC/1

DESIGN
retroviral overexpression of the active form of LUMAN, as a control GFP overexpression was used, two time points = 6h and 18h from the infection start point, time point zero=untreated D2SC/1 cells

PLATFORM
GPL6096 [MoEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
