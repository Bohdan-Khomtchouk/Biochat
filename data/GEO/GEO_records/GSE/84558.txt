TITLE
Discovery of Novel Determinants of Endothelial Lineage: Insights from Chimeric Heterokaryons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our study provides a systematic and mechanistic approach for identifying key regulators in directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to a variety of somatic cell lineages.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq data were generated for mouse ESC and human endothelial cells: separate, co-cultered and fused samples have been analyzed

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus) GPL16512 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens; Mus musculus)
