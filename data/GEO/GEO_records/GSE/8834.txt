TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression profile analysis of MCL1 over-expressing B-NHL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To get insight into the mechanisms of MCL1-induced survival and transformation, we screened 41,000 human genes in a genome-wide gene expression profile analysis of MCL1 over-expressing B-NHL cells. Keywords: MCL1-induced gene expression

DESIGN
Two-color (Cy5-CTP/ Cy3-CTP) microarray-based gene expression formats presenting high-density oligonucleotide probes printed on a single glass slide were used (Agilent technologies, Cat No# G4112A whole human genome 41K). Total RNAs from MCL1 over-expressing RAMOS RA-1 and Z-138 B-cells were labeled with Cy5-CTP, whereas RNAs from references (empty vector/ RAMOS RA-1 and empty vector/ Z-138 B-cells) were labeled with Cy3-CTP. After competitive hybridization [RNA-Cy5 from MCL1 over-expressing RAMOS RA-1 or MCL1 over-expressing Z-138 versus RNA-Cy3 from either empty vector/ RAMOS RA-1 or empty vector/ Z-138 respectively] gene expression data were pre-processed using Feature Extraction software and GEPAS tools ( http://gepas.bioinfo.cipf.es/ ).
