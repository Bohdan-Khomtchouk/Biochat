TITLE
TGF-beta1-Induced Gene Expression Changes in HepG2 Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We here compared gene expression profiles in HepG2 cells upon stimulation with 1 ng/ml TGF-beta1 for 20 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours with untreated control cells. Experiments were done in three independent replicates. The goal of this study was to determine genes regulated by TGF-beta1.HepG2 cells were obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) and cell identity confirmed by STR profiling using the AmpFlSTR Identfiler Direct PCR Amplification kit (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany). Gene expression profiles were compared at indicated time points after stimulation with TGF-beta (1 ng/ml) using the Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix). In total 18 hybridizations are included in this series.

DESIGN
18 samples were hybridized to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array
