TITLE
Effects of MDMA and Venlafaxine treatment in Dark Agouti rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to examine the hippocampus, frontal cortex and dorsal raphe of Dark Agouti rats with gene expression arrays (Illumina RatRef bead arrays) looking for possible mechanisms and new candidates contributing to the effects of a single dose of MDMA (15 mg/kg) 3 weeks earlier or venlafaxine (40 mg/kg) administration for 3 weeks continously. We also examined the possible interaction between the single dose MDMA treatment and the continous venlafaxine treatment described above.

DESIGN
With the present study we tried to evaluate the effects of a single, neurotoxic dose of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and/or 3 weeks long venlafaxine (VLX) treatment in the dorsal raphe, frontal cortical or hippocampal neurons in Dark Agouti rats. For the analysis of MDMA long-term effects rats were treated once with 15 mg/kg MDMA i.p. in a volume of 1 ml/kg 3 weeks prior to sacrificing the animals. In the case of VLX, the animals were administered 40 mg/kg of the drug for 3 weeks via Alzet 2001 minipumps inserted under the skin of the rats. In the third group rats received the mentioned treatment protocols simultaneously. Vehicle and sham-operated controls were used for comparison. For microarray analysis all groups consisted of 8 animals. Every two randomly selected samples from the same brain regions were pooled resulting in 4 pooled samples per region and treatment. From the total 48 pooled samples 2 were excluded because of quality control reasons. For RNA extraction Trizol reagent was used and microarray analysis was done by Service XS (Netherlands) according to Illumina protocols (San Diego, CA, USA). Results were validated with Fluidigm GEx (San Francisco, CA, USA) arrays using TaqMan Gene Expression (Carlsbad, CA, USA) assays. In this study no replicates were used.
