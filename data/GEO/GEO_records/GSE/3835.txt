TITLE
The expression profiles of promastigotes and axenic amastigotes in Leishmania donovani

ORGANISM
Leishmania donovani

SUMMARY
In this study, we examined the transcriptome of Leishmania donovani promastigotes and axenic amastigotes to identify differentially regulated mRNAs utilizing the serial analysis of gene expression Keywords: stage differentiation; axenic amastigotes

DESIGN
Our approach was to identify Leishmania genes developmentally expressed during the promastigote and amastigote stages. Our assumption was that genes which expressed a difference between the promastigote and amastigote stages were likely to be essential to the transformation and the survival of the parasite within its human host.
