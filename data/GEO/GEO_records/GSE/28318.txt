TITLE
Zebrafish 22 hpf embryos: WT vs. MO-grnA injected

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of zebrafish embryos comparing wild type untreated embryos with embryos injected with morpholino of zf-grna. This assay is used for the determination of expression profiling at 22 hpf under GRN-A deficiency.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: wild type vs. MO-grnA treated cells. 3 biological replicates: each group contains 200 embryos.

PLATFORM
GPL6457 Agilent-019161 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray (V2) G2519F (Feature Number version)
