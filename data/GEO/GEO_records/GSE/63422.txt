TITLE
Identification and profiling of microRNAs in goat endometrium during Embryo Implantation

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
Our data revealed the first miRNA profile related to the biology of the goat receptive endometrium during embryo implantation. The results suggested that a subset of miRNAs might play important roles in the formation of endometrial receptivity. Thus, elucidating the physiological roles of endometrial miRNAs will help us better understand the genetic control of implantation, which is the gateway to a successful pregnancy.

DESIGN
A total of 20 healthy 24-month-old multiparous dairy goats (Xinong Saanen) were induced to estrous synchronization for this study. The first day of mating was considered to be Day 0 of pregnancy. Gestational days 5 and 15 were important time points for the embryo implantation in goats [38]. The experimental goats were observed 3 times daily to ascertained estrous sign and mated naturally twice in estrus. And then the goats were euthanized when the goats lost consciousness caused by intravenous injection of barbiturate (30mg/kg) at gestational day 5 (pre-receptive endometrium) and gestational day 15 (receptive endometrium). Endometrium samples from 10 goats at gestational day 5 and 10 goats at gestational day 15 were obtained from the anterior wall of the uterine cavity.
