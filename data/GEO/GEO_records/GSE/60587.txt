TITLE
Impact of Tcf1 and Lef1 deficiency on HSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptome between control and Tcf1/Lef1-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).

DESIGN
Flt3-negative, lineage-negative, Sca1+ and cKit+ cells (Flt3-LSKs) were sorted from bone marrow cells from control mice or those are deficient for Tcf1 and Lef1 transcription factors. Both genes were conditionally deleted using Vav-Cre

PLATFORM
