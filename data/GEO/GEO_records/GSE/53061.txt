TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in wild-type and Sp4 hypomorphic mouse cerebellum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcription factor Sp4 controls dendritic patterning during development of cerebellar granule neurons in culture by limiting branch formation and promoting activity-dependent pruning (Ramos et al., 2007). Sp4 is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  In order to identify target genes of Sp4, we compared global gene expression in the cerebella of wild type and Sp4 hypomorph mice (Sp4neo-/-; Zhou et al, 2005).  The results identify candidate Sp4 target genes that may contribute to neuronal development and neuropsychiatric disorders.

DESIGN
Total RNA from postnatal Day 21 cerebella of 3 pairs of WT and Sp4 hypomorphic littermate mice were compared.
