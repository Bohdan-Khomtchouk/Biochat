Activation of the P-TEFb Complex by Lethal Prostate Cancer-Associated Enhancer RNAs [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a lethal disease1-4.  Aberrant activation of the androgen receptor (AR) becomes a central mechanism contributing to the resistance of endocrine therapies2,3.  Here we demonstrate that non-coding RNAs transcribed from the AR bound-enhancers RNAs (AR-eRNAs) are upregulated in human CRPC cells in vitro, xenografts in vivo and patient tissues.  Expression of a subset of genes with elevated AR-eRNAs, including TLE1 and HTR3A, is inversely correlated with biochemical recurrence-free survival of CRPC patients.  We identify aan HIV-1 TAR-like (TAR-L) motif in AR-eRNAs of AR target genes including KLK3 (or PSA) and TMPRSS2.  The TAR-L motif is important for these eRNAs to bind to CYCLIN T1 of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex.  Knockdown of PSA eRNA diminishes RNA polymerase II (Pol II) serine-2 (Ser-2) phosphorylation at the PSA promoter.  The TAR-L motif in KLK3 eRNA is crucial for effective transcription of PSA mRNA.  Together, wWe demonstrate a P-TEFb activation function of eRNA and reveal aberrant eRNA expression as a functional indicator of AR abnormality in CRPC.  Our results also suggest that eRNAs as amay be a potential target for CRPC therapy.
