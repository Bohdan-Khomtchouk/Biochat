TITLE
Functional Genomic Analyses of Hep-G2 Cell Line after FTO knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular mechanism underlying glucose regulation by hepatic FTO, we used the human hepatocyte Hep-G2 cell line as an experimental platform and analyzed transcriptome changes following FTO knock-down.

DESIGN
Examination of three Hep-G2 cell lines: FTO is knocked down more efficiently in sh7 and less efficiently in sh2. The control is the scramble.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
