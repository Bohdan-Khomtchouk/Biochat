TITLE
RNA hybridization from 16 cell lines on Chr21_22v2.0 arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA mapping on Human chromosomes 21/22. This hybridization was done using RNA samples from 16 different human cell lines. The data obtained is from analysis done on Human Genome hs.NCBIv36 or hg18 (UCSC) Keywords: RNA mapping experiments

DESIGN
Two technical replicates were hybridized for all experiments. A total of 16 different samples were used, majority of which were total RNA extracted from whole cells. However for 3 samples (GM06990, HepG2, Human fibroblasts) the RNA extracted was from Cytoplasm.
