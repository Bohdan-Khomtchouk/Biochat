Molecular Characterization of Breast Cancer Subtypes Derived from Joint Analysis of High Throughput miRNA and mRNA Data

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, single-stranded widely expressed noncoding RNAs that regulate the stability or translational efficiency of target messenger RNAs. Date derived from expression profiling of 489 miRNAs in 101 human primary breast tumor samples, along with genome-wide matched mRNA profiling and extensive clinical information were investigated in this study. miRNA and mRNA expression were analyzed using correlations and enrichments analyses. The results show that particular cellular processes such as proliferation, cell adhesion, and immune response are significantly enriched among genes with strong positive or negative correlation to individual or groups of miRNAs. Functional analyses were performed to validate the influence of miRNAs on proliferation. A group of miRNAs was identified that is associated to breast cancer disease free survival. This study provides a comprehensive dataset that can be used as groundwork for further studies of the involvement of miRNA in breast cancer.
