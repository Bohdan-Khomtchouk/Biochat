TITLE
human Nalm6 Cells: WT vs. OGFOD1 KO

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The 2-OG-Fe(II) dioxygenase family are critical for cellular adaptation to changes in oxygen concentration. We found that cells with OGFOD1 gene silencing in this family showed resistance to cell death under ischemia, and cDNA microarray analysis of OGFOD1 knockout human cells revealed downregulation of ATPAF1. Although reintroduction of the OGFOD1 wild-type gene to OGFOD1 KO cells restored ATPAF1 mRNA levels, the catalytically inactive OGFOD1 mutant did not.
