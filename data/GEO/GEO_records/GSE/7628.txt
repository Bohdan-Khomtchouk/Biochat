TITLE
Evaluation of expression quantitative trait loci within two interacting blood pressure quantitative trait loci

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Genetic dissection of the S rat genome has provided strong evidence for the presence of two interacting blood pressure (BP) quantitative trait loci (QTLs), termed QTL1 and QTL2, on rat chromosome 5. However, the identities of the underlying interacting genetic factors remain unknown. Further experiments targeted to identify the interacting genetic factors by the substitution mapping approach alone are difficult because of the interdependency of natural recombinations to occur at the two QTLs.  We hypothesized that the interacting genetic factors underlying these two QTLs may interact at the level of gene transcription and thereby represent expression QTLs (eQTLs).  To detect these interacting eQTLs, a custom QTL chip containing the annotated genes within QTL1 and QTL2 was developed and used to conduct a transcriptional profiling study of S and two congenic strains that retain either one or both the QTLs.  The results uncovered an interaction between two transcription factors, DMRTA2 and NFIA.  Further, the ‘biological  signature’ elicited by these two transcription factors was differential between the congenic strain that retained LEW alleles at both QTL1 and 2 compared to the congenic strain that retained LEW alleles at QTL1 alone.  A network of transcription factors potentially affecting BP could be traced, lending support to our hypothesis. Keywords: rat, hypertension, genetics, polygenic trait, microarray, gene expression
