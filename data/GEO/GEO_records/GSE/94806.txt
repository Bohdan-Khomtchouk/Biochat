TITLE
Gene expression profiling of supporting, interstitial/stromal, and germ cells during the formation of the testis cords

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to analyze the gene expression profile for three main cell lines (supporting, interstitial/stromal, and germ cells) isolated from developing gonads during the process of the testis cord and ovarian cyst formation (between TS13 and TS34).

DESIGN
Three cell lines (supporting, interstitial/stromal, and germ cells) were isolated from murine fetal XX and XY gonads at three time points (TS13, TS24, and TS34). Transgenic mouse strains with the expression of cell type specific fluorescent markers were used to isolate the cell lines. Cells were sorted using FACS method and then the RNA was extracted.
