TITLE
Effect of REST-003 downregulation on cancer invasiveness in MDA-MB-231 cells using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis .

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fifty six genes from DESeq were differentially expressed in the treated versus control samples.  More than 20% were related to immune, defense, wounding and inflammatory responses

DESIGN
Downregulation of  REST-003 using siRNAs in MDA-MB-231 cells; we used siRNA against REST-003, as REST-003 may control invasiveness.  We transfected si-Control (scramble) or si-REST-003 in MDA-MB-231:  duplicate of both (total 4 samples).
