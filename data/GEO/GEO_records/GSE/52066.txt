TITLE
14-3-3ζ promotes TGF-β-induced bone metastasis program in 231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the regulatory role of 14-3-3ζ in TGF-β induced bone metastasis program in 231 cells, we generated MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell sublines with 14-3-3ζ shRNA knockdown (231.ZKD-4 and 231.ZKD-5) and scrambled shRNA (231.Scr) We performed cDNA microarray analysis on these cells treated with vehicle or TGF-β (5ng/ml, 2 hours) respectively in vitro

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from 231.scr, 231.ZKD-4, 231.ZKD-5 cells treated with vehicle or TGF-β, and subjected to illumina Human HT-12 v4 arrays analysis
