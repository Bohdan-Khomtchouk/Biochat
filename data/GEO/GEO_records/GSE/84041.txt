TITLE
Age-Related Gene Expression in mouse liver tissues after exposure to Gamma-ray irradiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify age-related gene expression changes in infant (1-week-old) and adult (7-week-old) mouse liver tissues after Gamma-ray irradiation.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression in infant (1-week-old) and adult (7-week-old) mouse liver tissures were measured at 0, 24 and 48 hours after 4 Gy Gamma-ray irradiation. Two male and two female mice were used for each time point.
