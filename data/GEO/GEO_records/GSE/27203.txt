TITLE
Human testis-derived embryonic stem cell-like cells are not pluripotent, but possess potential of mesenchymal progenitors.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of whole genome gene expression profiles of human testis derived ES-like cells with pluripotent stem cells (human embryonic stem cell lines), adult human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells and human dermal fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Microarray study with total RNA of three testis derived ES-like cells clusters of one indivual (1) cultured in three different culture conditions A, B,C and embryoid bodies (EB) derived from them at 4, 7, 10, 14 and 18 days of suspension culture. Biological duplicates of  human ES cell lines (HUES-1, GFP-hES-3),human bone marrow derived MSC (BMMSC1 and 2) and human dermal fibroblasts (DFB1 and 2) (LONZA CC-2511) at different passages were used as comparison groups.
