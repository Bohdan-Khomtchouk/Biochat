TITLE
Array CGH in congenital heart disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most frequent birth defect and affects nearly 1% of newborns. The etiology of CHD is largely unknown and only a small percentage can be assigned to environmental risk factors such as maternal diseases or exposure to mutagenic agents during pregnancy. Chromosomal imbalances have been identified in many forms of syndromic CHD, but next to nothing is known about the impact of DNA copy number changes in non-syndromic CHD. Here we present a sub-megabase resolution array CGH screen of a cohort with CHD as the sole abnormality at the time of diagnosis. Keywords: array CGH

DESIGN
In this BAC array CGH study 104 patients with congenital heart disease and some of their parents were screened for DNA copy number changes at submegabase resolution. No dye swap was performed.
