TITLE
Ozone exposure of tolerant and sensitive F2 genotypes of Populus

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
Three tolerant and three sensitive genotypes of the inbred QTL mapping population Family 331 were exposed to either ambient air or an acute ozone exposure of 200 ppb for 9 hrs and ozone response was profiled for each genotype by hybridising control against ozone-exposed samples per genotype. Keywords: stress response, genotype comparrison, ozone exposure

DESIGN
Three replicates were grown per genotypes used and RNA was extracted from the fifth leaf below the first fully unfurled leaf. After RNA extraction, equal quantities of RNA from each replicate of a genotype per treatment were pooled to provide a single pool per treatment per genotype. Control and ozone-exposed sample per genotype were then hybridised. Hald of all arrays were hybridised with the control sample in the Cy3 channel and half with control in the Cy5 channel.
