TITLE
Ozone exposure of tolerant and sensitive F2 genotypes of Populus

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
Three tolerant and three sensitive genotypes of the inbred QTL mapping population Family 331 were exposed to either ambient air or an acute ozone exposure of 200 ppb for 9 hrs and ozone response was profiled for each genotype by hybridising control against ozone-exposed samples per genotype. Keywords: stress response, genotype comparrison, ozone exposure
