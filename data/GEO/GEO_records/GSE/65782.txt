TITLE
High throughput sequencing of small RNAs from black pepper (Piper nigrum L.)

ORGANISM
Piper nigrum

SUMMARY
In this study, we used the illumina high throughput sequencing approach (Sequencing-By-Synthesis, or SBS)Â to develop the sequence resource of black pepper. To identify micro RNAs functioning in stress response of the black pepper plant, small RNA libraries were prepared from the leaf and root of Phytophthora capsici infected plants, leaves from drought stressed and  control plants.

DESIGN
Stress responsive small RNAome profiling from black pepper
