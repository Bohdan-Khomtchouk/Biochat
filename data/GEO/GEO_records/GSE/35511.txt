TITLE
Gene-expression profiling of ZNF217-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To obtain an overview of the cellular functions regulated by ZNF217 signaling in breast-cancer cell lines, we performed global gene-expression profiling on MDA-MB-231-pcDNA6 and MDA-MB-231-ZNF217 cells

DESIGN
Two independent cell-culture replicates from the total population of MDA-MB-231-pcDNA6 and MDA-MB-231-ZNF217 stable transfectants were used to generate total RNA. Total RNA was extracted from cell culture using a Qiagen RNA extraction kit and RNA quality was assessed using the BioAnalyzer 2100™ (Agilent Technologies). Complex probes were produced from these RNA, then hybridized to Human genome U133 Plus 2.0 array according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Affymetrix).
