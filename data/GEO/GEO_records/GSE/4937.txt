TITLE
Molecular Profiling of Breast Cancer Cells after Gemcitabine exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human breast cancer cell lines were exposed to IC50 gemcitabine (Gemzar) for 24 and 48 hours. RNA was extracted, amplified and hibridized onto Oncochip microarray slides. Keywords: Time and Dose Response

DESIGN
Human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 were cultured in DMEM with Glutamax-1, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 0.4% fungizone. Cells were grown and passaged by trypsinization.
