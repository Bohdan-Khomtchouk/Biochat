TITLE
Gene expression profiles of subepithelial myofibroblasts from mouse ileum or colon, implanted together with human cancer cells in mouse xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We isolated myofibroblasts from C57BL6/J mouse ileum or colon and analyzed gene expression profiles from the cultured cells. We also isolated human colon cancer cells from xenografts interacting with mouse intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) and analyzed gene expression in sorted human cancer cells. We used Affymetrix microarrays to detail the global gene expression prolfiles in mouse fibroblasts and human colon cancer cells  and identified distinct biological processes of differentially expressed genes in mouse fibroblasts and interacting human colon cancer cells
