TITLE
Gene expression profiles of subepithelial myofibroblasts from mouse ileum or colon, implanted together with human cancer cells in mouse xenografts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We isolated myofibroblasts from C57BL6/J mouse ileum or colon and analyzed gene expression profiles from the cultured cells. We also isolated human colon cancer cells from xenografts interacting with mouse intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) and analyzed gene expression in sorted human cancer cells. We used Affymetrix microarrays to detail the global gene expression prolfiles in mouse fibroblasts and human colon cancer cells  and identified distinct biological processes of differentially expressed genes in mouse fibroblasts and interacting human colon cancer cells

DESIGN
For mouse SEMFs, we isolated fresh fibroblasts from mouse ileum and colon, confirmed their predicted immunophenotype (alpha SMA positive, vimentin positive, desmin negative), and expanded cells in culture before expression array analysis. We examined gene expression in human cancer cells following their interaction with murine ileal or colonic SEMFs, using flow cytometry to isolate DsRed-expressing Caco2 or T84 cells after 5 weeks of growth in NOD/SCID mice in the presence of GFP-expressing ileal or colonic SEMFs.
