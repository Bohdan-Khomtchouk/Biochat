TITLE
Acetylation enhances TET2 function in protecting against abnormal DNA methylation during oxidative stress [shTET2 - H2O2 - methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profilings (Bisulfite (BS), or oxidative bisulfite (oxBS)) were done for A2780 cells 1) infected with control virus, no H2O2 (Scr_mock) treatment, 2) infected with control virus with H2O2 treatment (30 min plus 2.5 h resting) (Scr_H2O2), and 3) infected with shTET2 virus, with H2O2 treatment  (30 min plus 2.5 h resting) (shTET2_H2O2). Each genomic DNA was splitted equally to two aliquots. One aliquote was subjected to oxidation (oxBS) and one to mock oxidation (BS) prior to bisulfite treatment (CEGX protocol). The Illuminaâ€™s Infinium Human Methylation450 Beadchip Kit (WG-314-1001) was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. 5hmC levels were calculated by subtracting oxBS values from BS values.
