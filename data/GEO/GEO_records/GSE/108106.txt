TITLE
RNA sequence on the fed and fasted state of kidneys in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We studied whether the accumulation of lipids in the fasted kidney are derived from lipoproteins or (non-esterified fatty acids) NEFAs. With overnight fasting, kidneys accumulated triglyceride, but had reduced levels of ceramide and glycosphingolipid species. Fasting led to a nearly 5-fold increase in kidney uptake of plasma [14C]oleic acid. Increasing circulating NEFAs using a Î² adrenergic receptor agonist caused a 15-fold greater accumulation of lipid in the kidney, while mice with reduced NEFAs due to adipose tissue deficiency of adipose triglyceride lipase had reduced triglycerides. Cluster of differentiation (Cd)36 mRNA increased 2-fold, and angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4), an LPL inhibitor, increased 10-fold. Fasting-induced kidney lipid accumulation was not affected by inhibition of LPL with poloxamer 407 or by use of mice with induced genetic LPL deletion. Despite the increase in CD36 expression with fasting, genetic loss of CD36 did not alter fatty acid uptake or triglyceride accumulation. Our data demonstrate that fasting-induced triglyceride accumulation in the kidney correlates with the plasma concentrations of NEFAs, but is not due to uptake of lipoprotein lipids and does not involve the fatty acid transporter, CD36.

DESIGN
Mice (n=4-5/group) were either fasted for 16 hours or fed ad libitum. Kidneys were removed and snap frozen. RNA was extracted for sequencing.
