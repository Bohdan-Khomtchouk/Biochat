TITLE
Expression data from young and senescent HCAECs treated with proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole and lansoprazole)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most frequently prescribed drugs, especially in older people. Although these drugs are usually considered safe, recent evidence suggests that high dose and/or long term use of PPIs may have several detrimental effects, including increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. The impact of PPI in the aging host environment still need to be characterized. Aged tissues, including vascular tissues, accumulate senescent cells that can communicate with their environment by secreting a myriad of cytokines and growth factors. Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) provide an excellent model system to study “in vitro” most aspects of cardiovascular function and disease related to cellular senescence. The purpose of this study is thus to investigate the in vitro effects of two well-known PPIs (Omeprazole and Lansoprazole) on endothelial gene expression in senescent e non-senescent HCAECs. We used a cDNA microarray method to compare gene expression profiles of young and senescent HCAECs treated with omeprazole and lansoprazole.

DESIGN
Young cells were cultured in medium supplemented with vehicle (CTRL) or 100μM PPIs (Omeprazole or Lansoprazole) and grown for subsequent passages until they evidenced senescence-associated phenotypes. Total mRNA was extracted and gene expression profiles were analyzed in senescent endothelial cells (P12) compared to the non-senescent cells (P6) in both untreated (CTRL) and PPI-treated groups by cDNA microarray. All experiments were performed in triplicate for each treatment group.
