TITLE
Expression profile of human lymphatic endothelial cells under static or oscillatory shear stress conditions in the presence or absence of FOXC2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lymphatic valves are specialized units regularly distributed along collecting vessels that allow unidirectional forward propulsion of the lymph, and its efficient transport from tissues to the bloodstream. Lymphatic endothelial cells that cover lymphatic valve sinuses are subjected to complex flow patterns, due to recirculation of the lymph during the collecting vessel pumping cycle. They also express high levels of FOXC2 transcription factor. We used microarrays to study the transcriptional networks controlled by FOXC2 in human lymphatic endothelial cells subjected to oscillatory shear stress or cultured under static conditions.

DESIGN
Human lymphatic endothelial cells were transfected with control or FOXC2 siRNAs and subjected to 24-hour oscillatory shear stress (1 dyn/cm2; 1/4 Hz) or kept under static conditions as a control. RNA were amplified and hybridized on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.  The experiment was run twice independently, using each time a different siRNA to knockdown FOXC2, as previously described (Sabine et al, 2012, Dev Cell).
