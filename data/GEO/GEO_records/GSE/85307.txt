TITLE
Early Pregnancy Gene Expression Profiling of Women with Preeclampsia: The “Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial” (VDAART) Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral whole blood transcriptome profiles of pregnant women with normal pregnancy and preeclampsia from 10-18 weeks of gestational age enrolled in the “Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial” (VDAART).

DESIGN
Comparing the whole blood (PAXgene) transcriptome from 10-18 weeks of gestational age of 110 mothers with normal pregnancies versus 47 mothers with preeclampsia. Whole blood transcriptome, disease state analysis
