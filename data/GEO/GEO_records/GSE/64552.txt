TITLE
Sequencing of reaction products from protospacer integration by Cas1-Cas2

ORGANISM
Cloning vector pUC19

SUMMARY
We report the sites of protospacer integration into plasmids by Cas1-Cas2. The goal of this study is to determine the role of sequence elements on protospacer integration.

DESIGN
Methods: Cas1-Cas2 integration products were fragmented, end-repaired, adapter ligated, PCR amplified, and analyzed by Illumina sequencing. Protospacer-containing reads were selected by Cutadapt and mapped to the plasmid with Bowtie.
