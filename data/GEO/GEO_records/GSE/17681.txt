TITLE
miRNA Profiling from total blood of lung cancer and control samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This project aims at the detection of specific patterns of miRNAs in peripheral blood samples of lung cancer patients. As controls, blood of donors without known affection have been tested. Using the miRNA patterns we hope to detect a diagnostic pattern for the non-invasive diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma.

DESIGN
In this study, we compared 17 lung cancer samples to 19 control samples using the sanger miRBAse 12.0 miRNA biochip manufactured by febit. Samples were analyzed with the Geniom Realtime Analyzer (GRTA, febit gmbh, Heidelberg, Germany) using the Geniom Biochip miRNA Homo sapiens. Each array contains 7 replicates of 866 miRNAs and miRNA star sequences as annotated in the Sanger miRBase 12.0. To benchmark the platform, we tested technical replicates using bought total RNA of brain and liver samples (ambion), achieving a correlation of 0.97.
