TITLE
mRNA-Seq reads aligned to HTT in hg38/GENCODEv21

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Despite 20 years since its discovery, the gene responsible for Huntington’s Disease, HTT, has still not had its function or transcriptional profile completely characterized. In response to a recent report by Ruzo et al. of several novel splice forms of HTT in human embryonic stem cell lines, we have analyzed a set of mRNA sequencing datasets from post mortem human brain from Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and neurologically normal control subjects to evaluate support for previously observed and to identify novel splice patterns. A custom analysis pipeline produced supporting evidence for some of the results reported by two previous studies of alternative isoforms as well as identifying previously unreported splice patterns. All of the alternative splice patterns were of relatively low abundance compared to the canonical splice form.

DESIGN
29 Huntington's Disease, 29 Parkinson's Disease, and 50 Neurologically normal control samples from human post-mortem prefrontal cortex
