TITLE
Gene expression in an EMT model using an immortalized bronchial epithelial cell line induced by TGF-β1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed to establish an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) model with an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line, M-BE, and to identify an EMT signature gene set. The TGF-β1-induced M-BE cells got spindle-shaped fibroblast-like morphology and lost the cell-cell contact, with down-regulated expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin and up-regulated expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and Vimentin. Examined by microarray, there were 2628 genes identified as significant EMT-related, including 1490 up-regulated genes (FC > 2, fdr < 0.01) and 1138 down-regulated genes (FC < 0.5, fdr < 0.01) in TGF-β1-induced M-BE cells.

DESIGN
M-BE cells were treated with human recombinant TGF-β1 (5ng/ml) for six days. M-BE cells cultured without TGF-β1 were considered the controls. Three replicates of each were carried out for this investigation. Agilent 4x44K Human Whole Genome expression microarray (G4112F) analysis was applied to the RNA samples of the TGF-β1-treated M-BE cells and the controls.
