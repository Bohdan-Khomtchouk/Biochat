TITLE
Escape from X-Inactivation Tumor Suppressor (EXITS) genes contribute to sex bias

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this manuscript, we described male-biased mutations in chrX genes in cancer. In this RNA-seq experiment we tested the transcriptional consequences of shRNA knockdown of one of those genes, CNKSR2

DESIGN
Murine NIH 3T3 cells were infected with and selected for expression of lentiviruses expressing shRNAs targeting Cnksr2 (2 independent shRNA sequences) or a control shRNA (targeting RFP, a gene not present in these cells). Each was performed in biological triplicate independent cultures for n=9 total samples
