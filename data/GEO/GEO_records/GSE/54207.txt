TITLE
Expression data from mouse limb tendon cells during development.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have undertaken a screen of mouse limb tendon cells in order to identify molecular pathways involved in tendon development. Mouse limb tendon cells were isolated based on Scleraxis (Scx) expression at different stages of development: E11.5, E12.5 and E14.5 Microarray comparisons were carried out between tendon progenitor and differentiated stages.

DESIGN
Forelimbs from E11.5, E12.5 and E14.5 Scx-GFP embryos were collected and dissociated with trypsin to obtain cell suspensions. Scx-positive tendon cells were isolated by FACS. RNA was extracted and Fragmented biotin-labelled cRNA samples were hybridized on Affymetrix Gene Chip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays.
