SUMMARY
The different clinical behavior of low and high grade gliomas and the chance to develop novel selective agents that specifically target tumor-associated proteins in gliomas stimulate the research of molecules playing a role in glioma progression. Gene expression profiling using microarrays allows the study at the same time of the expression patterns of thousands of genes in tumor cells. In the present study microarrays with about 20,000 genes have been employed to discover the gene expression profile in 39 glial neoplasias (28 glioblastomas (GBM) and 11 low grade gliomas, namely 4 oligodendrogliomas, 5 pilocytic astrocytomas (PA), 2 fibrillary astrocytomas (FA)). Unsupervised classification through hierarchical cluster analysis identified 2 groups of tumours: one group mainly composed of low grade malignant tumours (10 low grade gliomas and 3 GBM), the other one constituted by GBM, with the exception of one low grade case. The nearest shrunken centroid classification method was used to identify genes useful to classify and best characterize high and low grade gliomas. [Tibshirani et al. 2002] This procedure selected 9 genes as most informative for the classification task: Among them 7 genes were overexpressed in low grade gliomas, but underexpressed in GBM; on the contrary 2 genes were overexpressed in GBM, but underexpressed in low grade tumours Forty five tumors were immunostained for IGFBP-2 .  81,5% GBM resulted immunopositive. On the contrary only one low grade glioma was positive. Gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry suggest that IGFBP-2 may play a role in glioma progression. IGFBP-2 appears to be a novel immunohistochemical marker of  malignancy in glial tumours and probably is the basis for targeted chemotherapy.
