TITLE
Expression data from adipose tissue of WNIN/Ob lean and obese rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Obesity is characterised by increased adipocyte size and number. Analysis of altered gene expression gives better understading about the mechanisms involved/alterted in the development of obesity in this new obese rat model. We used Microarrays to delinate the alted gene expression in adipose tissue of WNIN/Ob obese rats

DESIGN
Retroperitioneal adipose tissue was collected from 4 month old WNIN/Ob lean and obese rats (n=2 per phenotype) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymatrix Rat gene 1ST arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL6247 [RaGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
