TITLE
ChIP-chip analyses of H3K9 methylation in alp13 deletion and clr6-1 mutant S.pombe cells.

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
ChIP-chip analyses of H3K9 methylation in alp13 deletion (Clr6-complex II) and clr6-1 mutant (complexes -I and -II) S.pombe cells. Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA recovered with antibody against methylated H3K9 from asynchronous growing fission yeast cells and whole cell extracts DNA were amplified by random priming and respectively labeled with Cy5 and Cy3. Labeled DNA samples were mixed and hybridized onto a custom Agilent 44K in situ 60mer DNA microarray that tiles the entire Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome every 300 bp alternately on both strands. Data were processed using Agilent scanner and Feature Extraction software.
