TITLE
TDP-43 regulates cancer-associated microRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in a wide range of cellular processes. Aberrant regulation of miRNA genes contributes to human diseases, including cancer. The TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a DNA/RNA binding protein associated with neurodegeneration, is involved in miRNA biogenesis. Here, we systematically examined miRNAs whose expression levels are regulated by TDP-43 using RNA-Seq coupled with siRNA-mediated knockdown approach. TDP-43 knocking down affected the expression of a number of miRNAs. Alterations in isomiR patterns and miRNA arm selection after TDP-43 knockdown suggest a role of TDP-43 in miRNA editing. We examined correlation of selected TDP-43 associated miRNAs and their candidate target genes in human cancers. Our data reveal highly complex roles of TDP-43 in regulating different miRNAs and their target genes. Our results suggest that TDP-43 may promote migration of lung cancer cells by regulating miR-423-3p expression. On the other hand, TDP-43 increases miR-500a-3p expression and binds to the mature miR-500a-3p sequence. Low expression of miR-500a-3p was associated with poor survival of lung cancer patients, suggesting that TDP-43 may have a suppressive role in cancer by regulating miR-500a-3p. Our experiments reveal that cancer-associated genes LIF and PAPPA may be targets of miR-500a-3p. Together with other studies, our work suggests that TDP-43-regulated miRNAs may play multi-facet roles in the pathogenesis of cancer.
