TITLE
Zebrafish 27hpf embryos: hdac1 mutant (hi1618) vs sibling

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of hdac1 mutant zebrafish in comparison to their sibling embryos.  Embryos resulting from a cross between heterozygous hdac1 mutant zebrafish (hi1618/+) where cultured together then mutants separated from the siblings one the basis of phenotype and RNA extracted from the two groups at 27hpf was compared in a two-colour hybridisation.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, hdac1 mutants vs. sibling. Biological replicates: 2 (separate mating) Technical replicates: 4 (2 of which are dye-swap)
