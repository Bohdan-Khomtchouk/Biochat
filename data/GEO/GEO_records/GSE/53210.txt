TITLE
CEBPA-mediated chromatin structure remodeling controls macrophage-specific differentiation and inflammatory gene expression program.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptional regulation by CEBPA at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that CEBPA regulate genes involved in macrophage differentiation and function. Results provide important information of the transcriptome profiling of HEK293 cells expressing ectopic CEBPA, such as specific CEBPA-responsive genes, up- or down-regulated specific cellular functions.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from uninfected HEK293 cells and compared to the HEK293 cells infected with the lentiviral vector containing CEBPA.
