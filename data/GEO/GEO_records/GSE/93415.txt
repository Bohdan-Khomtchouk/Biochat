TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine differences in microRNA expression profiles of gastric cancer and adjacent healthy gastric mucosa. Both types of tissue samples were collected during operative procedures of 20 patients. microRNA expression was determined by miRNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Twenty pairs of tissue samples collected from patients diagnosed with gastric cancer. Each pair included resected primary tumor and corresponding healthy gastric mucosa. There were no replicates. Comparative expression analysis was carried out to determine microRNAs up-regulated and down-regulated in cancer tissues compared to healthy mucosa. Please note that each sample was labeled with both Cy3 and Cy5, resulting in two raw data files per sample ('1_Exiqon_*_S01.txt' for Cy3; '0_Exiqon_*_S01.txt' is for Cy5 data).
