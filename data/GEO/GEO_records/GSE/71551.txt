TITLE
Characterization of t(15;21) translocations in myeloid disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report on two novel t(15;21) alterations [t(15;21)(q24;q22) and t(15;21)(q21;q22)], which led to concurrent disruption of RUNX1 and two translocation partner genes encoding for transcription factors (SIN3A, TCF12)

DESIGN
Examination of four different patients with myeloid disorders. 2 out of 4 have been analyzed by means RNAseq
