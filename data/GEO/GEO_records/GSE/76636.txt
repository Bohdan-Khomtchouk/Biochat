TITLE
Genome-wide investigation using sRNA-seq, degradome-seq and transcriptome-seq reveals regulatory networks of microRNAs and their target genes in soybean during Soybean mosaic virus infection

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
We profiled the global gene and miRNA expression in soybean following infections by three different Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) isolates, L (G2 strain), LRB (G2 strain) and G7 (G7 strain) by small RNA (sRNA)-seq, degradome-seq and as well as a genome-wide transcriptome analysis.

DESIGN
mRNA, miRNAs and degradome profiles of williams82 (susceptible) after 14 days post-inoculation (dpi) by three different Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) isolates, L (G2 strain), LRB (G2 strain) and G7 (G7 strain) and as well as Mock (control) were generated by deep sequencing, pooled from three biological replicates (5 plants in each replicate) for each treatment, using Illumina Miseq.

PLATFORM
GPL21309 Illumina MiSeq (Glycine max)
