TITLE
Application of SNP-array for the detection of genomic rearrangements responsible for sindromic mental retardation of unknown cause

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID)affects 2% of our population. However, mostpatients are often leftwithout aspecific diagnosis,with thecorresponding consequences for the patientsand their families.  The application of microarray technology in the study of patients with DD/ID allows whole-genome analysis with a high resolutionand performance. Here we present the results of  a case included in a series of 246 patients with DD/ID, as part of the screening of the genetic causes responsible for their phenotype.

DESIGN
SNP-array was performed on Genome-Wide Human SNP_6 (Affymetrix) as recommended by the manufacter. Analysis was performed with Affymetrix reference profile 'GenomeWideSNP_6.hapmap270.na31.r1.a5.ref'.

PLATFORM
