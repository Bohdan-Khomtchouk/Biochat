TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of conventional and ischemia-free liver transplantation Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study are to compare the transcriptomes of conventional liver transplantation liver allografts and ischemia-free liver transplantation livers by comparing samples of post-reperfusion and at the end of preservation.

DESIGN
Liver allograft mRNA profiles of the end of preservation and post-reperfusion were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx.

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
