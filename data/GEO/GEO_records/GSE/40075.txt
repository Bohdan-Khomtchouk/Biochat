TITLE
Short-term time course of the effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment on open chromatin regions in THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Open chromatin regions have been shown to associate with the location of transcriptiotal enhancers, i.e., the binding locations of DNA-binding transcription factors. To investigate the effects of short-term treatment by the nuclear hormone 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD), a specific ligand of the transcription factor vitamin D receptor, on chromatin accessibility, FAIRE-seq was utilized on the chromatin samples from THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells that were treated with 100 nM 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min, or with vehicle (0.1% (v/v) ethanol) for 20 and 100 min.

DESIGN
THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells were treated with 100 nM 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min or with vehicle (0.1% (v/v) ethanol) for 20 and 100 min. Chromatin sample from one biological replicate for each time point was subjected to the FAIRE-seq protocol and subsequent data analysis using an Input chromatin sample as control.
