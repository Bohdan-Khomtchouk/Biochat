TITLE
Gene expression profile of OECM1 overexpression let-7i

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of let-7i results in transcriptome alteractions in head and neck cancer cell line, OECM1.

DESIGN
To investigate the role of let-7i on OECM1 cells, we screened the differentially expressed genes of OECM1-mCherry (as control), OECM1-let-7i (as let-7i overexpression cell line).
