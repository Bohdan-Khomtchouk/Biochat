TITLE
Molecular Analysis of antigen-specific B cell responses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to better understand the factors that regulate B cell differentiation upon exposure to antigen, we compares global gene expression profiles from naive B cells with antigen-specific plasma, germinal center, and memory B cells after immunization with the T-dependent antigen, NP-CGG.  The memory B cell-enriched transcripts were then compared with memory T cell-enriched and hematopoietic stem cell-enriched transcripts in order to generate a transcriptional profile of self-renewal within the hematopoietic system. Keywords: Cell Type Comparison
