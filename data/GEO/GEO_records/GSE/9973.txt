TITLE
Half-life determination for human B-cells (BL41)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA was labeled in BL41 cells by culturing cells for 60 min in media containing 100µM 4sU. Tc-RNA was separated into nt- and p-RNA. All three RNA subsets were subjected to microarray analysis. Only probe sets providing present calls in all RNA samples/subsets were included into the analysis We used microarrays to determine half-lives of mRNAs expressed in BL41 cells Keywords: Determination of mRNA half-life in human B-cells

DESIGN
RNA was labeled in BL41 cells by culturing cells for 60 min in media containing 100µM 4sU. Tc-RNA was separated into nt- and p-RNA. All three RNA subsets were subjected to microarray analysis.
