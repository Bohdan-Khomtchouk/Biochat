TITLE
Gene expression profiling in thoracic aortas of 8 week and 16 week ApoE knockout mice on a western type diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of novel pathways in the development of atherosclerosis. Here, we are looking at changes in gene expression that occur in the aorta with the development of atherosclerosis

DESIGN
Analysis used RNA from thoracic aortas from chow fed ApoE knockout mice as control samples for comparison to the experimental samples from 8 week and 16 week ApoE knockout mice fed a western-type diet
