TITLE
Rootstock and soil effects on grape transcriptome

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
Soil qualities and rootstocks are among the main factors that have been acknowledged to influence grape development as well as fruit and wine composition. Despite the role of the soil and rootstock in establishing a successful vineyard in terms of grape quality, almost no molecular evidence linking soil and rootstock properties to the gene expression have been reported. The transcriptome variation in response to different soils and rootstocks was investigated through microarray technology. The cv. Pinot Noir was grown on different soils: sand, turf and vineyard soil. The plants were grafted on the contrasting 101-14 and 1103 Paulsen rootstocks. The modulation of genes expression in response to  different soils and rootstocks was evaluated considering their potential impact on primary  (carbohydrate) and secondary (phenylpropanoid) metabolisms.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Alessio Aprile.
