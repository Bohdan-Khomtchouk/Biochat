TITLE
The identified enhancer RNAs across human cell and tissue types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identity enhancer RNA across human cell and tissue types, histone modifications and RNA-Seq data were used to calculate candidate enhancers and classify enhancer RNA

DESIGN
Identity enhancer regions based on H3k27ac, H3k4me3,H3k4me1 ChIP-Seq data across 50 different human tissues and cell lines, corresponding RNA-Seq data were used to detect enhancer RNA This series includes data from 281 re-analyzed samples from GSE16256 (127), GSE16368 (69),  GSE17312 (44), GSE18927 (15) and GSE19465 (26).
