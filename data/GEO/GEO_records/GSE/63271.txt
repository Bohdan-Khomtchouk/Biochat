TITLE
A Novel Neuron-specific Histone H4K20 Demethylase LSD1n Promotes Transcriptional Elongation and is Essential for Learning and Memory

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LSD1n regulates transcriptional elongation by removing H4K20 methylation.

DESIGN
Identification of genome-wide binding sites of LSD1, and examination of the histone modifications upon LSD1n deletion in primary cortical neurons
