TITLE
Dicer knockout induced altered miRNA profile

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We detected whole genome microarray expression profiling in three pairs of Dicer knockout coloretal cell lines and their normal controls, including DLD-1, RKO and HCT116.

DESIGN
Dicer knockout cell lines were indicated as DLD-1-D, RKO-D and HCT116-D, and their corresponding normal cell lines were referred to DLD-1-C, RKO-C, and HCT116-C.
