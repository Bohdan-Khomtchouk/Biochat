TITLE
Expression data from 22  human myotubes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from 22  human myotubes (7 healthy controls, 4 Dysferlinopathy (DYSF), 4 Caveolinopathy 3 (CAV3), 4 Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy(FSHD) and 3 Four and a half LIM 1 protein deficiency FHL1).cDNA microarray data showed that cyclin A1 levels are specifically elevated in FSHD vs. other muscular disorders such as CAV3, DYSF, FHL1 and healthy control. Data could be confirmed with RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showing up-regulated levels of cyclin A1 also on the protein level. Comparison of gene expression among 4 different muscular dystrophies and helathy controls. Looking for genes expression specifically changed (down/upregulated)  in FSHD. In these data sheet we include expression data obtained for human cells lines derived from human V.lateralis muscle, shown as mean value. From 59 different expressed genes, Cyclin A1 was selected as a highly overexpressed (28 fold) gene in FSHD if compared to DYSF, CAV3, FHL1 and healyhy controls.
