TITLE
Conditional deletion of Bcl6 in naive B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bcl6 germline deletion causes a prominent inflammatory disease, owing to over-expression of Th2 cytokines, and affects the properties of B cells prior to immunization. Therefore we established the B cell-specific Bcl6 deletion mice and analyze the gene expression of naive B cells under physiological conditions.

DESIGN
Total RNAs of splenic follicular and marginal zone B cells from Bcl6(flox/flox), Bcl6(+/flox) or Bcl6(+/+) mice heterozygous for mb1-cre were extracted and analysed on Affymetrix microarrays.
