TITLE
Analysis of Drosophila salivary glands and Kc cells with depleted levels of linker histone H1 (Illumina smRNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Salivary glands or larval ovaries were isolated from transgenic flies expressing RNAi targeting Nautilus (control) or linker histone H1 using a Tub-Gal4 driver.

DESIGN
~200 larvae were used to isolate salivary glands or ovaries, independently.  Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent following manufacturer's guidelines. Then 5 Âµg of total RNA was separated on a polyacrylamide gel, and 18-29 nt small RNAs were isolated for cloning.
