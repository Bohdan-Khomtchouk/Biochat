TITLE
Daphnia magna DNA microarray for the evaluation of toxicity of environmental chemicals

ORGANISM
Daphnia magna

SUMMARY
Toxic chemical contaminants have variety of detrimental effects on various species and the impact of pollutants on ecosystems has become an urgent issue.  However, very limited species have been examined to date and those studies are mainly limited to vertebrates.  In this study, we aimed to establish an ecotoxicogenomic bases for Daphnia magna.  Based on a daphnia EST database, we made oligonucleotide-based DNA microarray that has high reproducibility.  The DNA microarray was applied to evaluate gene expression profiles of daphnid exposed to chemicals.  Characteristic gene expression patterns depending on chemicals indicate that the Daphnia microarray can be used for mechanistic understanding of chemical toxicity.  Although acute toxicity test or reproductive toxicity test can provide hazardous concentrations of chemicals, they give no information about mode of action.  Our study can be a breakthrough for the evaluation of chemical toxicity on environmental organisms. Keywords: Chemical response

DESIGN
Daphnia neonates were picked up within 24 h and they were exposed to chemicals for 24 h.  Chemicals used in this study were CuSO4, H2O2, pentachlorophenol and beta-naphthoflavone. Number of replicates is 3.
