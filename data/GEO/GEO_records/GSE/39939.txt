TITLE
Genome wide transcriptional profiling of HIV positive and negative children with active tuberculosis, latent TB infection and other diseases from Kenya

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study aimed to define transcriptional signatures for detection of active TB (TB) compared to latent TB infection (LTBI) as well as to other diseases (OD) with similar clinical phenotypes in patients with and without HIV in a paediatric cohort from Kenya Transcriptional signatures were identified that distinguished active TB from LTBI, active TB from other diseases, and active TB from both LTBI and other diseases in HIV+/- patients.

DESIGN
Children were recruited from 2 hospitals in Coast Province, Kenya (n=157) who were either HIV+  or HIV - with either active TB (culture confirmed), active TB (culture negative), LTBI or OD. Blood was collected into PAX gene tubes (PreAnalytiX). Total RNA integrity was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Labeled cRNA was hybridized to Illumina Human HT-12 Beadchips. Data were analysed in R.
