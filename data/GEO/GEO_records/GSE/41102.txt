TITLE
Expression data from pooled RNA of various ocular tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The normal gene expression profiles of the tissues in the eye are a valuable resource for considering genes likely to be involved with disease processes.  This is based on the assumption that transcript abundances in healthy tissue are correlated to the continued health of that tissue. Expression values were compared with publically available EST and RNA-sequencing resources.  The estimated gene and exon level abundances are available online on the Ocular Tissue Database.

DESIGN
Ten different tissues were obtained from 6 different individuals and RNA was pooled.  The tissues included:  retina, optic nerve head (ONH), optic nerve (ON), ciliary body (CB), trabecular meshwork (TM), sclera, lens, cornea, choroid/RPE and iris.
