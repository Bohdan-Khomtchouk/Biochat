TITLE
microRNA (miRNA) expression data from induced pluripotent stem cell  (iPSC)-derived neurons exposed to soman/GD

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chemical warfare nerve agents (CWNA) are potent cholinesterase inhibitors that may also have non-cholinesterase effects. Several in vivo studies have shown that exposure to CWNA compounds induces damage in the brain and heart. Underlying mechanisms of this damage are a critical area of research for the development of medical countermeasures. This study utilized microRNA (miRNA) analysis to evaluate potential direct cellular effects of the nerve agent GD/soman (O-Pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate) on human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons

DESIGN
iPSC-derived neurons were treated with GD  at concentrations of 0µM (saline control), 0.1µM or 100µM for either 1 hour or 6 hours. Total RNA was then isolated and processed for miRNA microarray analysis using Affymetrix miRNA 2.0 GeneChips
