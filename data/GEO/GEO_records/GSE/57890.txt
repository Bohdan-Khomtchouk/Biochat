TITLE
Pericyte Characteristics and an Optimal Factor Combination Enable Generating Bona-Fide iOPCs with the High Efficiency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The possibility to generate induced oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (iOPCs) from fibroblasts may enable in vitro neurological disease modeling and autologous remyelinating therapies.

DESIGN
10 samples were analyzed PC  Pericyte 2 replicates OPC  Primary Oligodendrocyte 2 replicates PC2FiOPCp5  Induced oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from pericyte after 5 passages 2 replicates PC2FiOPCp15  Induced oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from pericyte after 15 passages 2 replicates PC2FiOPCp25  Induced oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from pericyte after 25 passages 2 replicates
