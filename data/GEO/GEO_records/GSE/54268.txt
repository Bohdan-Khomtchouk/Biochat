Expression data of ATM, ATR, CHK1, CHK2, and 53BP1 shRNA knockdown and control shRNA in MCF-10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair deficiency (HRD) predisposes to cancer development, but also provides therapeutic opportunities. Here, we identified an HRD gene signature that robustly predicted HRD status. Unexpectedly, concurrent loss of PTEN in BRCA1-deficient cells might extensively rewire the HR repair network and confer resistance to PARP inhibitor, partially through over-expression of TTK. We used the HRD gene signature as a drug discovery tool and found several PARP-inhibitor-synergizing agents through the connectivity map. Thus gene expression profiling can be used to define the functional status of the HR repair network providing prognostic and therapeutic information.

DESIGN
Various shRNAs that target genes involved in homologous recombination (HR) were transfected in MCF-10A non-transformed breast cells lines. Stable HR gene knockdown MCF-10A cells were seeded 200000 at 10 cm plate. Cells were harvested after 48 hours culturing and used for gene expression profiling. The shRNAs that target ATM, ATR, CHK1, CHK2, and 53BP1 genes were transfected in MCF-10A non-transformed breast cell line by lentiviral particles and selected stable ATM, ATR, CHK1, CHK2, and 53BP1 knockdown MCF-10A cells. Scrambled control shRNA-transfected and wild type MCF-10A cells were applying as control.  All knockdown and control MCF-10A cells were seeded with 2 x 10^5 cells at 10 cm culture plate. Cells were cultured in MCF-10A medium and harvested after 48 hours culturing.  mRNA was extracted from collected cells and performing gene expression profiling. Three biological replicates were applied.
