SUMMARY
Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) traits differ between genetically distinct mouse strains. For example, DBA/2 mice have a higher HSPC frequency compared to C57BL/6 mice. We performed a genetic screen for microRNAs that are differentially expressed between LSK, LSâˆ’K+, erythroid and myeloid cells isolated from C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice. This analysis identified 131 microRNAs that were differentially expressed between cell types and 15 that were differentially expressed between mouse strains. Of special interest was an evolutionary conserved miR-cluster located on chromosome 17 consisting of miR-99b, let-7e and miR-125a. All cluster members were most highly expressed in LSKs and down-regulated upon differentiation. In addition, these microRNAs were higher expressed in DBA/2 cells compared to C57BL/6 cells, and thus correlated with HSPC frequency. To functionally characterize these microRNAs, we overexpressed the entire miR-cluster 99b/let-7e/125a and miR-125a alone in BM cells from C57BL/6 mice. Overexpression of the miR-cluster or miR-125a dramatically increased day-35 CAFC activity and caused severe hematopoietic phenotypes upon transplantation. We showed that a single member of the miR-cluster, namely miR-125a, is responsible for the majority of the observed miR-cluster overexpression effects. Finally, we performed genome-wide gene expression arrays and identified candidate target genes through which miR-125a may modulate HSPC fate.

DESIGN
These data consist of total mRNA obtained from 7-day cultured post 5-FU BM cells positively transduced with empty vector, miR-cluster 99b/let-7e/125a, miR-125a or miR-155 retroviral vector. Dataset (A) and dataset (B) were analyzed individualy. In each dataset, all samples were analyzed in independent biological triplicates.
