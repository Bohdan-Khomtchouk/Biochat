TITLE
Lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) treated with a MAF-targeted siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kaposi sarcoma is the most common cancer in AIDS patients and is typified by red skin lesions. The disease is caused by the KSHV virus (HHV8) and is recognisable by its distinctive red skin lesions. The lesions are KSHV-infected spindle cells, most commonly the lymphatic endothelial and blood vessel endothelial cells (LEC and BEC), plus surrounding stroma. The KSHV virus expresses multiple MAF-downregulating microRNA. Here we test the effects of MAF silencing by siRNA in LEC cells using Affymetrix hgu133plus2 chips.

DESIGN
There are n=3 of  1. LEC control cells transfected with a non-targeting siRNA, 2. LEC transfected with a MAF-targeting siRNA
