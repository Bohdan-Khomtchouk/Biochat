TITLE
Gene expression analysis in AML systems after 6 hours of HDACi treatments

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
K562, U937 and NB4 AML cell lines were treated with 2 HDACi, MS-275 and SAHA, and gene expression profiles were analysed to 6-hours treatments. The analysis revealed commonly regulated genes in the 3 cell lines and by 2 HDACi.

DESIGN
Total RNA were obtained from 3 AML cell lines after 6 hours of treatment with SAHA and MS-275 and gene expression profiles were compared to untreated cells (control).
