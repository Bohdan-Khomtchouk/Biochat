ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Splicing profiling of deletion strains compared to wild-type control 1 replicate for each WT/deletion comparison

DESIGN
Splicing sensitive S. pombe microarrays (Agilent-027365) were used to compare the splicing profile of various deletion strains relative to wild-type. The ΔSPAC1952.06c strain displayed reduced growth at 37°C so to elicit a strong phenotype we shifted this strain and the WT reference sample prior to collecting cells
