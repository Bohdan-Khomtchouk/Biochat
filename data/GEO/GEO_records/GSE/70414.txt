TITLE
mRNA Expression data from human osteosarcoma (OS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore possible oncogenic factors in OS, we used a microarray-based approach to profile changes in the expression of mRNAs in five OS cell lines and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We used a microarray-based approach to profile the mRNA expression of OS

DESIGN
Human OS cell lines were analyzed with genome-wide expression arrays.
