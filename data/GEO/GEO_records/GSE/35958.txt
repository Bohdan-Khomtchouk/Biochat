TITLE
Effects of Primary Osteoporosis on Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study we analyzed the effect of primary osteoporosis on the transcriptome of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC; alternatively named mesenchymal stromal cells) from human bone marrow. Human MSC of elderly patients suffering from osteoporosis were isolated from femoral heads after low-energy fracture of the femoral neck. Bone marrow of age-matched, non-osteoporotic donors was obtained of femoral heads after total hip arthroplasty.

DESIGN
Cells were isolated from human bone marrow according to the previously described protocol (Noth et al., 2002, J Orthop Res, 20/5, 1060-1069) under agreement of the local Ethics Committee of the University of WÃ¼rzburg. Human MSC of elderly patients suffering from osteoporosis were isolated from femoral heads after low-energy fracture of the femoral neck. Additional criteria for confirming primary osteoporosis in these donors were vertebrae fractures and advanced age. Bone marrow of age-matched, non-osteoporotic donors was obtained of femoral heads after total hip arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis and/or hip dysplasia. RNA samples were taken from passage 1 or passage 2.
