TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of zones of colonies of the ΔflbA strain of Aspergillus niger

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Gene expression was studied at the periphery, an intermediate zone, and the centre of wild-type and ∆flbA colonies using Affymetrix A. niger whole genome microarrays. We used Affymetrix GeneChip A. niger Geome Arrays and identifed up- and down-regulated genes that may account for the differences between wild-type and  ΔflbA colonies.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from a biological duplicate of concentric zones of 7-day old wildtype and mutant colonies. Zone 1 represented the most central zone, zone 3 an intermediate zone, and zone 5 the peripheral zone. Mycelium of the distinct zones was harvested from three colonies.
