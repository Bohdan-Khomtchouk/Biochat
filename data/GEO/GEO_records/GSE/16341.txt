TITLE
A simple optimization can improve the performance of single feature polymorphism detection by Affymetrix expression array: Transcript and Genome Hybridizations

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group ; Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
The publicly available genome sequence information of two rice strains, japonica cultivar Nipponbare and indica cultivar 93-11, opens a great opportunity for investigation of performances DNA genotyping by high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Here, we compare single feature polymorphism (SFP) detection performances between whole genome hybridization and transcript hybridization using Affymetrix Rice Expression Array and the two rice cultivars.

DESIGN
Total RNA  from 3-4 week shoots and genomic DNA both Nipponbare and 93-11 were analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL2025 [Rice] Affymetrix Rice Genome Array
