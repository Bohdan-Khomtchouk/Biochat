TITLE
mRNASeq  of Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter winogradskyi

ORGANISM
Nitrobacter winogradskyi ; Nitrosomonas europaea

SUMMARY
N.europaea and  N. winogradskyi were grown singly and in co-culture in chemostat to probe for transcriptome diffrences between the two growth conditions.

DESIGN
The comparison was done in chemostats. Single cultures maintained with 60 mM ammonium or nitrate, as appropiate, were compared to co-culture maintained with 60 mM ammonium.
