TITLE
Expression data from G9a overexpression and knockdown lung cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
G9a is the major mammalian H3-K9 methyltransferase that targets euchromatic regionsand is essential for murine embryogenesis . We demonstrate that G9a is endowed with methyltransferase activity to concomitantly repress the downstream effector Ep-CAM, thereby promoting the invasion step of the invasion-metastasis cascade. We used microarrays to detail the G9a regulated gene expression underlying invasion-metastasis cascade and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Lung adenocarcinoma cells with G9a knockdown or overexpression were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
