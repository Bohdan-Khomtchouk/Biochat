TITLE
Sox2 suppresses gastric tumorigenesis in mice [CHIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Sox2 expression marks gastric stem and progenitor cells, raising important questions regarding the genes regulated by Sox2 and the role of Sox2 itself during stomach homeostasis and disease. The goal of this study is to determine the function of and the genes regulated by Sox2 in the stomach. Methods: Sox2 ChIP-enriched DNA and input DNA was isolated from gastric glands of adult antrum from Sox2 KO and Sox2 WT mice. DNA was purified and genomic libraries were prepared as described (Sulahian et al., 2014), using four micrograms of goat anti-SOX2 (AF2018, R & D). Libraries were sequenced (50 bp, single-end reads) on an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 instrument. Results: Sox2 is dispensiable for gastric stem cell self-renewal and epithelial homeostasis, however modulates the expression of wnt, intestinal and cancer related genes

DESIGN
Examination of Sox2 targets in the stomachs of Sox2 WT and Sox2 KO mice.
