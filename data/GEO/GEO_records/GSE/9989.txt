TITLE
Tobramycin Treatment of P. aeruginosa Biofilms Grown on CFBE41o- Cells

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
We grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on CFBE41o- human airway cells in culture, and we treated these biofilms with tobramycin.  Microarray analysis was performed to gain an understanding of the global transcriptional changes that occur during antibiotic treatment. Keywords: Antibiotic Response
