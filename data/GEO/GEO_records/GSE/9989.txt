TITLE
Tobramycin Treatment of P. aeruginosa Biofilms Grown on CFBE41o- Cells

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
We grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on CFBE41o- human airway cells in culture, and we treated these biofilms with tobramycin.  Microarray analysis was performed to gain an understanding of the global transcriptional changes that occur during antibiotic treatment. Keywords: Antibiotic Response

DESIGN
We compared three untreated control samples with three tobramycin-treated samples.  Biofilms were grown on CFBE41o- cells in culture for 9 hours in MEM/0.4% arginine.  Replicate samples were then incubated in the presence or absence of 500 Î¼g/mL tobramycin for 30 minutes.
