TITLE
Serotonin effect on Bxpc-3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of Bxpc-3 cells treated with serotonin under metabolic stress induced by serum deprivation. Serotonin (5-HT), a well-known neuromodulator with both neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine functions, is also involved in tumorigenesis. Results provide insight into molecular basis of serotonin in pancreatic cancer.

DESIGN
Three serotonin treated Bxpc-3 cells, three untreated controls.

PLATFORM
