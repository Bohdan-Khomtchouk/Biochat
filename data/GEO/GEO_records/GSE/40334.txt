TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of garlic induced hepatoprotection against alcoholic fatty liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alcohol induced fatty liver cause a dangerous health problem and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Garlic (Allium sativum) is documented to possess anti-fatty liver properties. However the exact molecular mechanisms are unknown. The main aim of this experiment is to elucidate the underlying pathways through which garlic ameliorates alcohol induced fatty liver. Dially disulfide and garlic oil were the garlic compounds used in this study. Leiber DeCarli ethanol liquid diet was to induce fatty liver in C57BL/6 mice model. Also the expression impaired by alcohol induced fatty liver is another aim of this study.

DESIGN
Leiber-Decarli ethanol diet was used to induce fatty liver in male C57BL/6 mice (n=12).  For control, Lieber-DeCarli liquid control diet was fed to mice (n=4). The control mice were pair-fed to the ethanol mice. After adaptation, the ethanol fed mice were divided into three groups viz. alcohol (n=4), dially disulfide [DADS] (n=4) and garlic oil [GO] (n=4). The study started with the administration of DADS (15 mg/kg bw) or GO (50 mg/kg bw) mixed in 0.1 ml olive oil through gavage. For the control and alcohol groups, same amount of olive oil (0.1 ml) was gavaged. The mice were gavaged daily for 4 weeks. The mice were euthanized by CO2 and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Liver, kidney, spleen, lungs and hearts were collected and their weights recorded. A portion of liver was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (200 mg) for RNA extraction.
