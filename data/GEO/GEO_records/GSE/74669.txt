TITLE
Electrical stimulation of human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of electrical field stimulation frequency at the gene expression level. Electrical stimulation has been shown to mature nascent cardiomyocytes and alter their beating properties. The purpose of the array was to identify potential mediators of these effects.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from cardiomyocytes subjected to 0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, or 2 Hz continuous electrical stimulation for 7 days, compared to an unstimulated control. Three samples from each group were analyzed
