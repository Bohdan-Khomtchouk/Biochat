TITLE
Transcriptome Kinetics of 1[2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oyl] imidazole (CDDO-Im) in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC): Mechanism of Action of Cytoprotection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study evaluated temporal gene expression profiles to better characterize the early transcriptional events and their relationship to the dynamics of the cytoprotective response in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to CDDO-.

DESIGN
Time-course gene expression profiling was performed on HUVEC treated with CDDO-Im for 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours.

PLATFORM
GPL20729 Agilent-028944 human B w 20 w 27 8x60 [Feature Number version]
