TITLE
Transcript Profiling of Soybean Seed Compartments Using Laser Capture Microdissection Coupled With RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
We used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to capture soybean seed compartments and profiled the transcriptomes of several compartments using next-generation sequencing.  We profiled the transcriptomes of the embryo-proper and the suspensor region from globular stage embryos and the seed coat parenchyma layer of early maturation stage seeds using the Illumina GAIIx system.

DESIGN
Illumina sequencing of transcripts from laser-captured embryo proper and suspensor of globular stage embryo and seed coat parenchyma layer of the early maturation stage seed.

PLATFORM
GPL11192 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Glycine max)
