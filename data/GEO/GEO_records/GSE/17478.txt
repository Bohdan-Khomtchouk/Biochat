SUMMARY
Particulate Matter Triggers Carotid Body Dysfunction, Respiratory Dysynchrony and Cardiac Arrhythmias in Mice with Cardiac Failure The mechanistic link between human exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution and the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality observed in people with congestive heart failure (CHF) is unknown. We now show that exposure of genetically-engineered mice with CHF (expressing a cardiac-specific CREB mutant transcription factor) to ambient PM (collected in Baltimore, mean aerodynamic diameter 1.9 um) unmasks severe autonomic morbidities manifested as significant reductions in heart rate variability, respiratory dysynchrony and increased frequency of serious ventricular arrhythmias, features not observed in PM-challenged wild type mice without CHF. PM exposure in CREB mice with CHF reflexly triggers autonomic dysfunction via heightened carotid body function as evidenced by pronounced afferent nerve responses to hypoxia and marked depression of breathing by hyperoxia challenge. Genomic analyses of lung and ventricular tissues revealed PM-induced molecular signatures of inflammation and oxidative stress. These findings in a murine model of cardiac failure provide the first direct assessment of autonomic function in response to PM challenge and are highly consistent with current epidemiologic findings on cardiovascular morbidity in susceptible PM-exposed human populations. We utilized a murine model of dilated cardiomyopathy to address potential mechanistic links between PM exposure and the development of life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias.
