TITLE
Expression data from after-ripened wheat seeds imbibed in ABA

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Wheat seed germination and seminal root growth can be inhibited by treatment with exogenous ABA We used Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array to detail transcriptional programs affected by ABA during imbibition

DESIGN
After-ripened seeds imbibed in ABA for 24 h were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChip. After-ripened seeds were generated by storing dormant seeds at room temperature for 10 months.
