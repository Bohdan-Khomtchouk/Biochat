TITLE
Analysis of BES1-PIF4 interdependency in gene expression

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
BES1 transcription factor is a master regulator of brassinosteroid signalling. Part of BES1 activity as a transcription factor is brought about upon dimerization with light-responsive PIF4 transcription factor. To analyse BES1-dependent transcriptional cascade, and to which extent BES1 requires PIF4/PIF5 for target gene regulation, we performed microarray analysis of the following phenotypes: Col-0, bes1-D, pif4pif5 and bes1-D;pif4pif5 in dark grown seedlings.

DESIGN
Col-0, bes1-D, pif4pif5 and bes1-D;pif4pif5 5-days seedlings grown in the dark were used for RNA extraction. 3 independent biological samples were collected for each genoptye.
