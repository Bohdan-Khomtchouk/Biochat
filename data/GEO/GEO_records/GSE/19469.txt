TITLE
An initial map of chromosomal segmental copy number variations in chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Chromosomal segmental copy number variation (CNV) has been recently recognized as a very important source of genetic variability. Some CNV loci involve genes or conserved regulatory regions. Compelling evidence indicates that CNVs impact genome functions. The chicken is a very important farm animal species which has also served as model animal for biological and biomedical research for hundreds of years. A map of CNVs in chickens could facilitate the identification of chromosome regions that segregate for important agricultural and disease phenotypes. NimbleGen 385k whole genome tiling arrays were used to map CNVs in the chicken. This study has identified 96 CNVs in three lines of chickens (broiler, Leghorn and Rhode Island red). These CNVs encompass 16 Mb (1.3%) of the chicken genome. Twenty six CNVs were found in two or more animals. Smaller sized CNVs mostly affect none coding sequences while larger CNV regions involve genes, for example prolactin receptor, aldose reductase and zinc finger proteins, suggesting chicken CNVs potentially affect agricultural or disease related traits.
