SUMMARY
Peumonia is the most common cause of death due to infectious diseases in the western hemisphere. The molecular events associated with pulmonary infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Influenza A virus are incompletely understood. Pathophysiological and protective processes are initiated by immune receptors specifically recognizing pathogenic structures serving to elicit a qualitatively and quantitatively adequate immune response. To provide a molecular framework towards a better understanding of the processes relevant in severe infectious pneumonia we performed a transcriptome analysis of  lungs from mice infected with S. pneumoniae or Influenza A virus. Overall, we detected 1300 genes that exhibit significant differential expression after infection with either pathogen. Of those were approximately 36 % specific for pneumococcal and 30 % specific for the viral infection, yielding pathogen-specific as well as common inflammatory transcriptional signatures. Characteristically, these results resolve not only a differential response on the cytokine and chemokine level, although common induction of type I and type II interferons, TNFa, and  IL-6 underlies both infections, but emphasize the potentially important role exerted by many genes implicated in the regulation and fine tuning of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, we noted a specific decrease in B cells after S. pneumoniae infection, which is not solely confined to the lung. Massive induction of apoptosis in pulmonary B cells could reflect a  pneumococcal virulence strategy aiming against the lymphocyte population that is of utmost importance for the defence against capsulated bacteria. The pathophysiological consequences of Influenza A virus infection become obvious through differential induction of genes implicated in tissue regeneration and proliferation associated with detection of the emerging protective T cell response.  These results may provide new insights into the pathogenesis and protective mechanisms important for the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
