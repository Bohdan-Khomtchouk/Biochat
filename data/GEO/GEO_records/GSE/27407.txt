TITLE
Transcriptional response of an azole-resistant Candida parapsilosis isolate [posaconazole].

ORGANISM
Candida parapsilosis

SUMMARY
Azole resistance was induced in vitro by growth of a susceptible C. parapsilosis isolate in the presence of posaconazole. Whole genome microarrays were used to compare the transcriptional response of the posaconazole-resistant and susceptible isolates.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profile of an in vitro derived posaconazole-resistant isolate of C. parapsilosis (BC014PSC) compared to the susceptible isolate (BC014S). Cell were grown in YPD medium in normoxia at 35 degrees. Each strain was labelled with Cy3 or Cy5. Overall, 3 independent biological replicates were compared; 1 dye swap was performed to normalize dye effects.
