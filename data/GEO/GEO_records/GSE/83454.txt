TITLE
Transcript profiling of WT and lsm1∆ Saccharomyces cells before and after 1, 2 and 4 hours of hydroxyurea treatment (200 mM)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies) are cytoplasmic granules that form in eukaryotic cells in response to numerous stresses to serve as sites of degradation and storage of mRNAs. Functional P-bodies are critical for the DNA replication stress response in yeast, yet the repertoire of P-body targets and the mechanisms by which P-bodies promote replication stress resistance are unknown. In this study, we identify the complete complement of mRNA targets of P-bodies during replication stress induced by hydroxyurea treatment. The key P-body protein Lsm1 controls the abundance of HHT1, ACF4, ARL3, TMA16, RRS1 and YOX1 mRNAs to prevent their toxic accumulation during replication stress. Accumulation of YOX1 mRNA causes aberrant down-regulation of a network of genes critical for DNA replication stress resistance. Among these genes we identify ALD6, whose de-repression is critical to prevent accumulation of acetaldehyde, a strongly toxic molecule during DNA replication stress.

DESIGN
WT and lsm1∆ cells were cultured in YPD. Sample were taken before and after 1, 2 and 4 hours of treatment with hydroxurea at a final concentration of 200 mM. Experiment was repeated twice.
