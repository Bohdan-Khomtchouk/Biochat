TITLE
Gene expression analysis of S. Typhimurium cells residing in the food vacuole (phagosome) of the bacteria grazing ciliate Tetrahymena

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica

SUMMARY
The gene expression of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium MB282 residing in the food vacuole (phagosome) of Tetrahymena was analyzed by microarray.

DESIGN
A minimum of three biological replicates were used. Each biological rep was comprised of at least two technical replicate arrays. MB282 incubated in H2O and MB282 grown to mid - log in LB were used as controls.
