TITLE
Molecular architecture underlying fluid absorption by the developing inner ear

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of pre- and postnatal mouse endolymphatic sac demonstrates two types of differentiated cells distinguished by their mRNA expression signatures.

DESIGN
mRNA-seq profiles from 213 single cells from embryonic day 12.5, 16.5, postnatal day 5 and 30 mouse endolymphatic sac were analyzed

PLATFORM
GPL15103 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Mus musculus)
