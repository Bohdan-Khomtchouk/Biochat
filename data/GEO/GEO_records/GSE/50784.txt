TITLE
Gene expression of the human trabecular meshwork (TM) of the eye

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the gene expression of the human TM. We isolated TM cells from healthy human donor eyes. Next, we performed RNA isolation, amplification, labeling and hybridization against 44k Agilent microarrays.

DESIGN
We performed the microarrays against a common reference sample, namely human RPE/choroid RNA. We performed 2 replicates of human TM samples from 2 different donors.

PLATFORM
