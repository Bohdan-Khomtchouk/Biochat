TITLE
Genome-wide analysis rice transcriptional change during the early stages of false smut formation caused by Ustilaginoidea virens [2011].

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Rice false smut is a common fungal disease caused by Ustilaginoidea virens. As it only scatter occured in panicle at florescence, little information is known about this crop disease. In the previous study, 3 uninterrupted infecting stages were divided and each stage was monitored by Solexa/Illuminaâ€™s digital gene expression (DGE) system, and all data were submitted to NCBI (GSE32010). As the disease was greatly affected by environment and to eliminate environment factor, an experimental replication was done in 2011. Samples collection and analysis were described in GSE32010. Our results contribute to the knowledge of understanding rice molecular mechanism in response to U. virens infection.

DESIGN
Four samples including one control (CK) and three infected (S1, S2, S3) were analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL14553 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Oryza sativa Indica Group)
