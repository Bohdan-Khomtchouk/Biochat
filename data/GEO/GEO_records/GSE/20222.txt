TITLE
Cesium Toxicity in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Cesium (Cs+) is a potentially toxic mineral element that is released into the environment and taken up by plants. Although Cs+ is chemically similar to potassium (K+), and much is known about K+ transport mechanisms, it is not clear through which K+ transport mechanisms Cs+ is taken up by plant roots. In this study, the role of AtHAK5 in high affinity K+ and Cs+ uptake was characterized. It is demonstrated that AtHAK5 is localized to the plasma membrane under conditions of K+ deprivation, when it is expressed.

DESIGN
9 samples were used in this experiment.
