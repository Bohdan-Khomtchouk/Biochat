TITLE
Identification of eQTLs for Hepatic Xbp1s and Socs3 Gene Expression in Mice fed a High-Fat, High Caloric Diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent form of hepatic disease and feeding mice a High-Fat, High-Caloric (HFHC) diet is a standard model of NAFLD. In order to better understand the genetic basis of NAFLD, we conducted an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis of mice fed a HFHC diet. 265 (A/J Ã— C57BL/6J) F2 male mice were fed a HFHC diet for 8 weeks. QTL analysis was utilized to identify genomic regions that regulate hepatic gene expression of Xbp1s and Socs3. We identified two overlapping loci for Xbp1 and Socs3 on Chr 1 (164.0-185.4 Mb and 174.4-190.5 Mb, respectively) and Chr 11 (41.1-73.1 Mb and 44.0-68.6 Mb, respectively), and an additional locus for Socs3 on Chr 12 (109.9-117.4 Mb). C57BL/6J-Chr 11A/J/ NaJ mice fed a HFHC diet manifested the A/J phenotype of increased Xbp1s and Socs3 gene expression (p < 0.05), while C57BL/6J-Chr 1A/J/ NaJ mice retained the C57BL/6 phenotype. In addition, we replicated the eQTLs on Chr 1 and 12 (LOD scores ? 3.5) using mice from the BXD murine reference panel challenged with CCl4 to induce chronic liver injury and fibrosis. We have identified overlapping eQTLs for Xbp1 and Socs3 on Chr 1 and 11, and consomic mice confirmed that replacing the C57BL/6 with the A/J Chr 11 resulted in an A/J phenotype for Xbp1 and Socs3 gene expression. Identification of the genes for these eQTLs will lead to a better understanding of the genetic factors responsible for NAFLD and potentially other hepatic diseases.
