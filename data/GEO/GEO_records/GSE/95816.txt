TITLE
Whole genome methylation profiling of melanoma-derived induced pluripotent cancer cells in comparison to the parental melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles. Samples included melanoma cell lines A375 and HT-144 as well as their reprogrammed progeny and melanoma-iPCC-derived fibroblasts. Pluripotent stem cells and normal human fibroblasts served as references.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from reprogrammed induced pluripotent cancer cells compared to parental melanoma cells, pluripotent stem cells and iPCC-derived fibroblasts as well as normal human fibroblasts.
