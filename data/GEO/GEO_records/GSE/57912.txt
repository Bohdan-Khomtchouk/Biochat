TITLE
Long-range chromatin interactions in mouse embryonic stem cells identified by ChIA-PET [H3K27me3 ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is produced by active transcription of cell identity genes and repression of genes encoding lineage-specifying developmental regulators. Here we use large ESC cohesin ChIA-PET datasets and other genomic data to identify the local chromosomal structures at both active and repressed genes across the genome. The results show that super-enhancer driven cell identity genes generally occur within large loops that are connected through CTCF-CTCF interaction sites occupied by cohesin.

DESIGN
H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data from wild type murine embryonic stem cells V6.5 were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hi-Seq 2000.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
