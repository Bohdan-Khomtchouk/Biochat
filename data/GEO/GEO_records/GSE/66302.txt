TITLE
A human fetal transcriptional atlas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression is highly dynamic during fetal development and determines tissue specification and function. In humans, the transcriptional profile of different organs during development has not been systematically studied. However, understanding how a particular tissue acquires its tissue identity will give insight into the development and maturation of tissues from a developmental biology perspective.

DESIGN
Next-generation sequencing (DeepSAGE) dataset of 111 RNA samples representing 21 different human fetal organs and the maternal endometrium at three timepoints (gestational ages) during first and second trimester development (W9, W16-18, W22)

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
