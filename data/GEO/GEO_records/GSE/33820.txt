TITLE
Gene Expression Analyisis of T-ALL LOUCY cell lines treated with ETV6 siRNA vs. scramble control siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional effects of ETV6 inactivation in immature T-ALL were investigated by gene expression analysis upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of ETV6 in LOUCY cells, a T-ALL cell line with a transcriptional program highly related to that of immature T-ALLs. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the ETV6 knockdown signature showed a significant enrichment in genes characteristically upregulated in ETV6 mutant immature T-ALLs including HOXA13, PRDM16, PTEN and CD33.

DESIGN
4 samples were analyzed: two biological replicates for each experimental group.
