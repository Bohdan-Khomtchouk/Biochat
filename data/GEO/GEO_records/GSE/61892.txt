TITLE
Functional Antagonism Between CELF and Mbnl Proteins in Cytoplasm and Nucleus [CLIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The CUG-BP and ETR-3-like factor 1 (Celf1) RNA binding protein plays an important role in heart and muscle development, and is over-expressed in the disease myotonic dystrophy.  Celf1 has known roles in regulation of RNA splicing, RNA stability, and protein translation.  To identify transcriptome-wide targets of the Celf1 protein, we performed CLIP-seq against Celf1 using the 3B1 antibody, in myoblasts, heart tissue, and muscle tissue.

DESIGN
CLIP-Seq was performed against Celf1 in mouse muscle, heart, and C2C12 mouse myoblasts.
