TITLE
Retinoic Acid-Induced DR2 Alu Transcripts in Stem Cells Generate Functional Small RNAs that Mediate Target mRNA Degradation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
While liganded nuclear receptors are well established to regulate Pol II protein-coding transcription units, their role in regulation of DNA repeats remains largely unknown. Here, we report that ~2-3% of the ~1-200,000 human DR2 Alu repeats, particularly those in proximity to retinoic acid-activated Pol II transcription units, are bound and activated by retinoic acid receptor in human embryonic stem cells, triggering their PolÂ  III-dependent transcription. The non-coding DR2 Alu transcripts are processed in a Dicer-dependent fashion into a series of small RNA products with sizes ranging ~28-65nt and exhibit substantial co-localization with P bodies.  These small RNAs cause degradation of a subset of mRNAs critical for the " stem cell " state, which harbor complimentary sequences in their 3' untranslated regions. This regulation requires Ago3- dependent stabilization of full-length and processed DR2 Alu transcripts, and recruitment of Ago3-associated decapping complexes to the target mRNAs. Thus, the RAR/Pol III-dependent DR2 Alu transcriptional program in stem cells serves as a functional complement to the RAR/Pol II-dependent counterpart.
