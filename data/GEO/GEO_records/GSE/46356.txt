TITLE
Expression data from mouse cecum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To adapt the lives of organisms to the day-night cycle, evolution has built a complex machinery, whose molecular components are able to anticipate and drive changes in organism behavior and metabolism. A mutual bidirectional interaction exists between circadian abnormalities and development of diseases. Microarrays were used to determine whether circadian regulation occurs at the transcriptional level in response to Salmonella Typhimurium infection.

DESIGN
Cecal tissues from wild type mice and Clock mutant mice infected with S. Typhimurium or mock control at two circadian times (10am and 10pm) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
