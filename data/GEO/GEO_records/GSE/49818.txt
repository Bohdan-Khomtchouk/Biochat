TITLE
Expression data from additional fertilization rice seeds

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents of grain-filling stage are keys item that determined the growth of rice, and also the quality of seed. Therefore, to elucidating the mechanism of C/N signaling in a seed is an important problem for crops whose seed is used as food like rice. The DNA microarray analysis with the rice seed which was performed the additional fertilizer at the time of heading, in order to clarify how C/N signal change of the rhizosphere in seed production stage affects a seed component on a gene expression level.

DESIGN
Fertilization was supplied at the same time of plantation and performed middle fertilizing 37 days after germination. 400 mg of ammonium chloride (NH4 Cl) was supplied at the time of heading to the “ + NH4 Cl ” group. Rice seeds were selected from 6 plants for RNA extraction, and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to understand the change of gene expression by the additional fertilization.
