TITLE
U937 scramble vs shHDAC2 upon SAHA (Vorinostat; suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of U937 scramble vs shHDAC2 before and after SAHA treatment at 5µM concentration for 6 and 24 hours.

DESIGN
Different Experimental Conditions: U937 scramble (U937 trasfected with empty vector) vs shHDAC2 (U937 trasfected with shHDAC2 vector), untreated and treated with SAHA at 5 µM concentration for 6h and 24h. Biological replicates: 2 for each sample, independently grown and harvested at 6 and 24 hours. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
