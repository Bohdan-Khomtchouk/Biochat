TITLE
Dual Role of FoxA1 in Androgen Receptor Binding to Chromatin, Androgen Signaling and Prostate Cancer [ChIP_seq, DHS_seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the dual role of FoxA1 in androgen receptor recruitment to the chromatin of androgen responsive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP-1F5 using ChIP-sequencing. Depletion of FoxA1 reprograms both androgen and glucocorticoid receptor recruitment and subsequent gene expression. The ChIP-seq has been performed using AR, FoxA1, GR, H3K4me2 antibodies. We have also mapped the DNaseI-hypersensitive sites (DHS) using deep sequencing.

DESIGN
Examination of AR, FoxA1, GR, H3K4me2 binding sites and DHS sites in parental and FoxA1 depleted LNCaP-1F5 cells.
