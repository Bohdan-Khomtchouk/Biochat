TITLE
Depletion of the Chromatin Remodeler CHD4 Sensitizes AML Blasts to Genotoxic Agents and Reduces Tumor Formation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Depletion of CHD4 sensitizes AML cells but not normal CD34+ progenitors to genotoxic agents by relaxing chromatin and impairing DSB repair. Depletion of CHD4 modulates expression of AML cell genes that regulate tumor formation in vivo and colony formation in vitro.

DESIGN
To investigate the effect of CHD4 depletion on the overall chromatin structure and transcriptome of AML cells by integration of a CHD4-targeting shRNA into U937 and MV4-11 cells, compared to scramble shRNA integration. Biological triplicates for each cell line, including scramble shRNA controls, were run on microarrays.
