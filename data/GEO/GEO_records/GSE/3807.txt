TITLE
CD3+ T cells derived from bone marrow or peripheral blood of aplastic anemia patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD3+ T cells derived from bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood samples of newly diagnosed AA patients and healthy volunteers were  analysed using Affymetrix HG_U133A GeneChips. Additionally, two patients were studied after achieving a partial remission (post-Therapy). Keywords: disease vs health vs response to therapy

DESIGN
Altogether, we analysed 8 different samples. Pool I contained three female and one male patients, 19 to 70 years old, suffering from (severe) aplastic anemia. From these four donors, samples derived from bone marrow aspirates and from peripheral blood, were pooled on total-RNA basis. Pool II consisted of additional two patients, one male (64 years old) and one female (70 years old). From both donors, total-RNA was extracted and pooled from CD3+ T cells derived either from bone marrow or peripheral blood, each prior and post therapy. Healthy control pools included three donors for the peripheral blood sample and two donors for bone marrow derived T cells.
