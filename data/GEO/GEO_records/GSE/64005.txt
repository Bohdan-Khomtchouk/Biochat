TITLE
Gene expression at E9.5 after deletion of type I BMP receptors in the mouse lens placode

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The type I BMP receptors, Bmpr1a and Acvr1 were conditionally deleted from the mouse lens placode with Le-Cre. The heads of wild type and knockout E9.5 mouse embryos were laser micodissected to isolate the lens ectoderm from three embryos of each genotype. Total RNA was purified and reverse transcribed and amplified using a NuGEN Ovation Pico WTA system kit. cDNA was biotinylated and hybridized to Illumina Mouse6 V1.1 bead arrays.

DESIGN
Three wild type and three knockout embryos were used. RNA obtained from the lens ectoderm was pooled, amplified and used for microarray analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the values from the 25-50 beads on each array.

PLATFORM
GPL6105 Illumina mouse-6 v1.1 expression beadchip
