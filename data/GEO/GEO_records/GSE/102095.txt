TITLE
VHL restoration alters cis-regulatory landscape

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
VHL loss is the most common genetic alteration event in ccRCC. By profiling histone modifications from VHL-deficient ccRCC primary tumors and cell lines, we identifed tumor-associated promoters and enhancers. We next investigate whether VHL restoration alters tumor associated promoters and enhancers. We compared H3K27ac ChIP-seq with and without VHL restoration in 786-O cells. Restoration of wild-type VHL significantly altered a subset of tumor enhancers but affected promoters to a less extent.

DESIGN
