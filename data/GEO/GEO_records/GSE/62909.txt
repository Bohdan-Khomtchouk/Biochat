TITLE
SOX15 governs a transcriptional program in human esophageal stratified epithelium and in a subset of esophageal adenocarcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified spatially restricted transcription factors and found SOX15 expression confined to stratified esophageal epithelium, with attenuation in Barrett's esophagus. SOX15 binds esophagus-specific loci and its loss in human esophageal cells affected esophagus-specific transcripts

DESIGN
[RNA-Seq] Total RNA isolated from CPA control cells and CPA cells following SOX15 depletion, samples were prepared for sequencing using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 75 base pair single-end reads were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument. The data include 2 independent biological replicates per genotype. [ChIP-Seq] Examine SOX15-chromatin binding in CPA cells.
