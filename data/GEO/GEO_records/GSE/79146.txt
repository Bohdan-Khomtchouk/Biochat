TITLE
Expression data from induced parvalbumin neurons.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Parvalbumin neurons, as an important subtype of inhibitory neurons, play a crucial role in the brain. The dysfunctions of those cells are associated with multiple neural system disorders. We carried out whole gene expression studies for the induction process of parvalbumin neurons. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying cellularization and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Induced parvalbumin neuron cells were selected at successive stages of induction process for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of induced parvalbumin neurons at each developmental stage in order to increase the temporal resolution of expression profiles.
