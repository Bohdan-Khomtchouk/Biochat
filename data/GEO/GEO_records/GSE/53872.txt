TITLE
miR-27b synergizes with anticancer drugs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Drug resistance, caused by complex and redundant mechanisms, is a major obstacle in cancer treatment, especially in liver and kidney cancers. Combinational therapy of miRNAs, which concurrently target multiple pathways, with anticancer drugs represent a new strategy to improve the drug response. By a systems approach, we identified that miR-27b, a miRNA deleted in liver and kidney cancers, sensitizes cancer cells to a broad spectrum of anticancer drugs in vitro and in vivo.

DESIGN
Two samples transfected with nontarget miRNA control or miR-27b mimics followed by 48 hours doxorubicin treatment

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
