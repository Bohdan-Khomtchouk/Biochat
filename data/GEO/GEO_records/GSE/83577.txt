TITLE
Genome-wide Transcriptome Analysis of CD36 Overexpression in HepG2.2.15 Cells to Explore Its Regulation Role of Metabolism and HBV Life Cycle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular basis underlying the response to increasing CD36 overexpression in HepG2.2.15 cell, we performed genome-wide sequencing of the mRNAs from HepG2.2.15-CD36OE cell and HepG2.2.15-vector cell using the RNA-seq technology to detect its differential transcriptomic profile.

DESIGN
To better understand the molecular changes in the response of the CD36 overexpression in HepG2.2.15 cell, three cDNA libraries from HepG2.2.15-vector cell (Vector-1, Vector-2, Vector-3) and HepG2.2.15-CD36 overexpression cell (CD36OE-1, CD36OE-2, CD36OE-3) were constructed, respectively. After ensuring quality control, Ion ProtonTM Sequencer was used for sequencing the cDNA libraries.
