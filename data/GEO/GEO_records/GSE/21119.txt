TITLE
Effect of clp1 induction on b-dependent gene regulation

ORGANISM
Ustilago maydis

SUMMARY
The clp1 gene is a b-regulated gene that is required for clamp formation during the biotrophic growth phase of U. maydis. Clp1 expression blocks b-dependent filament formation and cell cycle arrest if co-induced with the b-heterodimer.

DESIGN
Strains AB33 (control) and UMS84 were grown for the times indicated in array medium containing 3 g/l nitrate and 1% arabinose for the induction of nar1P- (bE1/bW2) and crg1P- (clp1) controlled gene expression. Samples were taken from two biological replicates each.
