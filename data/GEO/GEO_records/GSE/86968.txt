TITLE
Gene expression changes in Tulasnella calospora- Serapias vomeracea mycorrhizal protocorms at stage P2 compared to Tulasnella calospora free-living mycelium

ORGANISM
Serapias vomeracea ; Tulasnella calospora

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Tulasnella calospora mycorrhizal protocorms at stage P2 compared to free-living mycelium  grown on Modified Melin-Norkrans medium with two different N sources, ammonium (AL13M) and glutamine (AL1 G) . Protocorms were harvested at stage P2 and mycelium after 15 days and used for RNA extraction. Reads of 150bp were generated and aligned to Tulasnella calospora  transcripts ( http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Tulca1 ) using CLC Genomics Workbench 9.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Tulasnella calospora mycorrhizal protocorms stage P2 and free-living mycelium grown on Modified Melin-Norkrans medium with two different N sources, ammonium (AL13M) and glutamine (AL13 G) were generated by 150bp Illumina HiSeq2500  sequencing. Three biological replicates were sequenced for mycorrhizal and mycelium samples.
