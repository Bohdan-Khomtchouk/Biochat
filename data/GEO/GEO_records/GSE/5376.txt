TITLE
Cell cycle of yeast deleted for yox1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription profiles across the cell cycle of yox1 deleted yeast cells. BY2399 cells (yox1 delete cells isogenic with W303a) were arrested with alpha factor in YEPD media. After release from arrest cells were sampled every 5 min for 2 hr. Keywords: cell cycle time course

DESIGN
Cells were synchronized with alpha factor and sampled every 5 min across 2 cell cycles. A total of 25 samples were analyzed. Technical replicates were included. cDNA of the cell cycle samples were labelled with Cy5. For Cy3 labelling, asynchronous yeast population was used.

PLATFORM
