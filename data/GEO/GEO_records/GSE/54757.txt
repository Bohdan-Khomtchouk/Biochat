TITLE
Determination of gene expression changes in HCC cells selected for migration ability.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We determined whole genome expression changes in 2 migratory  cell lines that were derived from a parent HCC cell line.

DESIGN
Migratory cell lines, M1 and I1 were compared to the parent cell line BL185 for gene expression profiling.
