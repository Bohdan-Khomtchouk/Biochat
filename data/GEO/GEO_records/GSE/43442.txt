TITLE
Profiling of long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs in neonatal and adult mouse testis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Todate, the investigation into the molecular mechanisms of testis development and spermatogenesis has largely focused on the role of protein-coding genes and small noncoding RNA including microRNAs and piRNAs. In recent years, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play critical regulatory roles in mammalian development. To understand the role of lncRNAs in development of the mammalian testis and spermatogenesis, we firstly utilized commercial microarray to systematically investigate lncRNAs expression profiles of neonatal (6-day-old) and adult (8-week-old) mouse testis. By comparison the lncRNAs expression profiles of two developmental stage of testes, we obtained the differentially expressed lncRNAs and examined their genomic context, promoter characteristics, neighbored protein-coding genes, provide an important foundation for future research on molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in mammalian testis development and spermatogenesis.

DESIGN
LncRNAs expression profiles were measured using neonatal (6-day-old) and adult (8-week-old) C57/BL6 mouse testis. Each of two age groups have three biological replicates.
