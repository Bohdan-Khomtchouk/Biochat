TITLE
Effects of E. coli Shiga toxin on the gene expression profile of human microvascular endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Changes in endothelial phenotype induced by E. coli-derived Shiga toxins (Stx) are believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Stx inactivate host ribosomes, but also alter gene expression at concentrations that minimally affect global protein synthesis. The effect of Stx on the gene expression profile of human microvascular endothelial cells was examined using the Affymetrix HG-U133A platform.  Data were processed using 13 different methods and revealed 369 unique differentially expressed genes, 318 of which were up-regulated and 51 of which were down-regulated.  These studies implicated activation of the CXCR4/CXCR7/SDF-1 chemokine pathway in Stx-mediated pathogenesis.

DESIGN
Primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were treated with vehicle or Shiga toxin (10 fM, 24 h, n = 6) and changes in steady-state mRNA levels were determined by hybridization to Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays
