TITLE
RNA-protein interaction screening for SNORD50A and SNORD50B

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Putative RNA-protein interactions with selected snoRNAs were screened using labaled RNA hybridized to a human protein microarray

DESIGN
snoRNAs SNORD50A and SNORD50B were in vitro transcribed, labeled with Cy5 and independently hybridized on human protein microarrays. The labeling process was optimized in order to achieve ~ 3 pmol dye per every microgram RNA while maintaining signal intensities that were readily visualized.
