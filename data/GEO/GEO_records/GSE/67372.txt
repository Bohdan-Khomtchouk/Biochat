TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type, 4L;C* and Isofagamine treated 4L;C* region specifics mouse brain miRNA profile (miRNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study are to compare NGS-derived brain transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) in neuropathic region specific Gaucher mouse brain compared with WT and Isofagamine treated mice of the same age and background and secondly to identify the DEmiRNA associated with the DEmRNA before and after treatment This will give us some insights to see if miRNA is also involved in the the regulation of the expression of the genes involved in the disease process before and after treatment. Methods: 42-45 days old 4L;C*,  wild-type (WT)  and Isofagamine treated  4L;C* mouse brain  were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using IlluminaHiseq. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzedwith two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed and TopHat followed by DESeq. qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays

DESIGN
Regional brain  miRNA profiles of ~42 -days old wild type (WT) and 4L;C* an d Isofagamine treated  mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using IlluminaHi Seq.
