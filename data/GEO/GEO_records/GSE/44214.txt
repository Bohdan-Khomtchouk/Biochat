TITLE
Gene expression profiling in Nalm6 ALL leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identify the expression intensity for all genes in Nalm6 cells and all the genes are divided into 4 equal groups with group 1 containing the 25% of genes that were expressed at the highest levels, and group 4 containing the 25% of genes that were expressed at the lowest levels.

DESIGN
Total RNA are isolated from 3 lots of Nalm6 cells and gene expression are determined by microarray gene expression analysis with Nimblegen Human 385K array.

PLATFORM
GPL15143 NimbleGen Human Expression Array [2006-08-03_HG18_60mer_expr]
