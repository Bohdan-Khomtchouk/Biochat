TITLE
Expression data of MLL-AF9-transformed murine leukemia progenitor cells, following treatment with UNC1999, a dual Ezh1 and Ezh2 inhibitor, or knockdown of EED

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ezh2 and EZH1 are histone H3 lysine 27 specific methyltransferase. Their hyperactive mutations and overexpression were found in cancer including various hematological malignancies. UNC1999 is a highly selective inhibitor for both enzymes. It suppresses H3K27 tri- and di-methylation globally and inhibits growth of MLL-rearranged acute leukemia cell lines. UNC2400, a di-methylated derivative of UNC1999, is employed an inactive analog compound for assessment of off-target effects. EED knockdown was used to demonstrate gene targets of PRC2. Here we performed microarray analysis in MLL-AF9 transformed acute leukemia cells following treatment with DMSO, UNC2400 or UNC1999, or after induction of EED shRNA (Renilla shRNA as control). This study allows us to identify UNC1999-responsive gene signatures as well as their overlap with PRC2 targets in MLL-AF9-bearing leukemia cells.

DESIGN
We analyzed 5 of DMSO-treated, 5 of UNC2400 (inactive analog of UN1999)-treated, and 6 of UNC1999-treated MLL-AF9 leukemia cell samples to identify UNC1999-responsive gene signatures. We also performed microarray in 3 of shRNA control lines (Renilla or Ren) and 3 of shEED lines to identify downstream targets of PRC2 complex in MLL-AF9 leukemia cells.
