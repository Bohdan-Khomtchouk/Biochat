TITLE
Inflammatory cytokines activate unliganded estrogen receptor and alter the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analyses of the transcriptomes and transcription factor recruitment in estrogen receptor breast cancer cells in response to estradiol, IL1b, or TNFa treatments. Also, the role of inflammatory cytokines on affecting tamoxifen sensitivity is analyzed on a genome-wide scale.

DESIGN
Transcription factor binding (ERa, p65) and transcriptome analyses were performed in estradiol- and pro-inflammatory cytokine-treated MCF7 cells.

PLATFORM
