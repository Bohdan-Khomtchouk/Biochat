TITLE
Gene expression analysis using RNA Sequencing of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HTA1-S121A strain upon thermo and osmotic stress.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To study the relevance of the post-translational modification in the H2A histone residue S121, we assessed the genome-wide transcriptional response of the non-phosphorylatable histone mutant HTA1-S121A (H2AS121A) upon two different stress conditions; osmostress and heat shock. Results point out that the unphosphorylatable H2AS121A protein showed an impaired stress responsive gene expression indicating that this specific histone residue plays a relevant role in stress responsive transcriptional regulation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HTA1 wild type and HTA1-S121A strains (Nakanishi, S. et al. (2008)  Nature structural & molecular biology, 15(8), 881-888) untreated or subjected to osmotic stress (15 min at 0,4M NaCl) or to heat stress (10 min at 39ÂºC). Experiment was done by triplicate.
