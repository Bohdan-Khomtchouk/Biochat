TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Acute Lung Injury

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)/Acute Lung Injury (ALI) was described 30 years ago, yet the interaction between specific sets of genes involved in this syndrome remains incompletely understood. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
13 patients with ALI + sepsis and 21 patients with sepsis alone were recruited from the Medical Intensive Care Unit of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between February 2005 and June 2007.  Whole blood was obtained from each patient within 48 hours of admission, and RNA was extracted for gene expression profiling, and comparison analysis.
