TITLE
Effect of NDRG3 expression on cell response to hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of Huh-7 hepatocarcinoma cell line depleted of NDRG3 or HIF-1α under hypoxic condition. HIF-1α and NDRG3 have distinct functions in hypoxia responses. Results provide insight into molecular basis of HIF-independent signaling in the development and progression of hypoxic tumors

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of Huh-7 cells stably expressing NDRG3-shRNA or HIF-1α-shRNA under normoxia were compared to gene expression profiles of Huh-7 stable cells under  hypoxia for 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours.
