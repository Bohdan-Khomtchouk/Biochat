TITLE
Gene expression from aged and young sciatic nerve after nerve injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sciatic nerve ligation was performed on cohorts of 2-month and 24-month old animals. Resulting gene-expression data were generated from sciatic nerve 1 and 4 days after injury compared to na√Øve animals. Results show differences in sciatic nerve responses with normal aging.

DESIGN
Total RNA taken from sciatic nerves from 2-month and 24-month old animals at either day 0, 1 and 4 after sciatic nerve crush injury.
