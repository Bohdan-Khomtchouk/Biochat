TITLE
AC61 Vector vs. pRb

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This experiment is to identify genes that are regulated by pRb in AC61 cells. AC61 cells were derived from a C-cell adenocarcinoma developed in an Rb+/-N-ras-/- mouse.

DESIGN
AC61 cells were infected with retrovirus derived from pLXSB or pLSXB-Rb and selected with balsticidin for 36 hours. At 72 hour after infection, cells were quickly frozen.
