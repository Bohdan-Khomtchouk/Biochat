TITLE
RNA-seq-based transcriptome analysis of a Streptococcus pyogenes mutant expressing cytoplasmically restricted enolase.

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
We report the mRNA expression profile of Streptococcus pyogenes Type M1 strain M1T15448-derived mutant lacking eukaryote-type Serine threonine kinase.

DESIGN
Measuring transcriptome profiling in M1T1SENhb mutants vs M1T1-WT  5448 strain
