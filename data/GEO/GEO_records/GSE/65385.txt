TITLE
Comparison of Escherichia coli K-12 tynA- with wild type Escherichia coli K-12

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Escherichia coli (E. coli) amine oxidase (ECAO) encoded by tynA gene has been one of the model enzymes to study the mechanism of oxidative deamination of amines to the corresponding aldehydes by amine oxidases. The biological roles of ECAO have been less addressed. Therefore we have constructed a gene deletion Escherichia coli K-12 strain, E. coli tynA-, and used the microarray technique to address its function by comparing the total RNA gene expression to the one of the wt. Our results suggest that tynA is a reserve gene for stringent environmental conditions and its gene product ECAO a growth advantage compared to other bacteria due to H2O2 production.

DESIGN
The effect of deleting the expression of E. Coli amine oxidase by deleting tynA gene to the expression of other genes was done by comparing the knock out strain to wild type strain in different time points.
