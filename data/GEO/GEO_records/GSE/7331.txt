TITLE
CGH result of Neisseria meningitidis ST-7 isolates

ORGANISM
Neisseria meningitidis

SUMMARY
Neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of bacterial meningitis and septicemia worldwide. Seven new serogroup C meningococci were isolated from two provinces of China in January, 2006. Their PorA VR types were P1.20, 9. Multilocus sequence typing results indicated that they all belonged to ST-7. It is a new serogroup C N. meningitidis sequence type clone identified in China. Here we also present the results of a genomic comparison of these isolates with other 15 N. meningitidis serogroup A and B isolates, which belonged to ST-7, based on comparative genomic hybridization analysis. The data described here would be helpful to monitor the spread of this new serogroup C meningococci sequence type clone in China and worldwide. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization
