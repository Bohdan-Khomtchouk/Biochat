TITLE
H3K9me3 ChIP-seq from Neurospora crassa wild type (WT) and dim-3 (severely reduced H3K9me3 levels) strains

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
We report the placement of the H3K9me3 heterochromatin mark from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa in wild type and dim-3 strains.  The dim-3 strain has a global reduction in H3K9me3, which results from a causative mutation in importin alpha (NUP-6), a component of the nuclear transport machinery. NUP-6(dim-3) compromises the heterochromatic localization of several components of the DCDC, a histone H3K9 methyltransferase complex, from their sub-nuclear chromatin targets despite appropriate nuclear transport. To determine whether the reduced level of global H3K9me3 observed from isolated histones localizes to A:T rich DNA (genomic DNA destined to become heterochromatin), we performed H3K9me3 ChIP-seq on a dim-3 strain and compared that to a wild type strain.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K9me3 in two different strains
