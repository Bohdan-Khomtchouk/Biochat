TITLE
Gene Expression-Based High Throughput Screening: HL-60 Cells Treated with ATRA and PMA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We developed a general approach to small molecule library screening called GE-HTS (Gene Expression-Based High Throughput Screening) in which a gene expression signature is used as a surrogate for cellular states and applied it to the identification of compounds inducing the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. In screening 1,739 compounds, we identified 8 that reliably induced the differentiation signature, and furthermore yielded functional evidence of bona fide differentiation. This data set contains HL-60 cells treated in a time course, in replicate, with 1 uM all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 10 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Also included are untreated HL-60 controls.  This data set was used to select marker genes that distinguish the undifferentiated from the PMA or ATRA differentiated states.
