TITLE
Transcrioptome analysis of human primary macrophages stimulated by bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and (1,3)-b-glucans, curdlan and glucan from baker´s yeast (GBY)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression microarray experiments to compare the global transcriptional response induced by b-glucans and LPS with their secretomes. We identified 1683, 767 and 1447 genes with over two-fold increase or decrease in LPS-, curdlan- or GBY-stimulated macrophages, respectively. We show that both LPS and b-glucan induces significant gene expression changes in macrophages, but only b-glucans activate a robust protein secretion.

DESIGN
The gene expression of human primary macrophage cells was measured at 6 hours after exposure the cells to 1 µg LPS or 10 µg Curdlan or 100 µg GBY (glucan from baker´s yeast), also 0-group was included. Three independent experiments were performed using three different donors for each experiment.
