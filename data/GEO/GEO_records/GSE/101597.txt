TITLE
Mapping histone acylations in mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of histone acylations in liver from fed and fasted mice. We have mapped H3K9ac, H3K14pr and H3K14bu by ChIP-seq in livers of either re-fed or 48h fasted mice.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of histone acylations H3K9ac, H3K14pr and H3K14bu in mouse liver.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
