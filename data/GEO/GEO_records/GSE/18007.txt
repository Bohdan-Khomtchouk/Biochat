TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of TOC1-ox transcriptional networks

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To gain insights into the mechanisms of TOC1 function in the Arabidopsis circadian clock we performed transcriptional profiling of Wild-Type (WT) and and TOC1 overexpressor plants (TOC1-ox).

DESIGN
Comparisons of WT and TOC1-ox. Three biological replicates synchronized under 12-hour light:12-hour dark (LD) cycles for 12 days. Samples were collected at Zeitgeber Time 15 (ZT15).
