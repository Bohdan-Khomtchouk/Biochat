TITLE
A systems approach identifies progeroid Ercc1[-/Δ] mice as a model system for kidney aging.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using these samples, it has been shown that the transcriptional landscape in glomeruli of Ercc1[-/Δ] mice at a rather young age of 14 weeks mimics that of mice which have undergone real-life renal aging. Thus, young Ercc1[-/Δ] mice can be used as a model system for glomerular aging in future studies.

DESIGN
The RNAs origin from glomerular tissues of mice of 2 distinct genotypes at 3 distinct stages of age. Between 3 and 6 replicates have been prepared per group.
