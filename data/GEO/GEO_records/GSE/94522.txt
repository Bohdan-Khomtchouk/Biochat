TITLE
Depletion of club cells attenuates bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background and objective: The role of bronchiolar epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis has not been addressed. We previously demonstrated that DNA damage was found in bronchiole at early phase, and subsequently extended to alveolar cells at later phase in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Club cells are progenitor cells for bronchiole, and are recognized to play protective roles against lung inflammation and damage. The aim of the study was to elucidate the role of club cells in the development of pulmonary fibrosis.   Methods: C57BL/6J mice were received naphthalene intraperitoneally at day -2 to deplete club cells, and were given intratracheal bleomycin or vehicle at day 0. Lung tissues were obtained at day 1, 7, and 14, and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at day 14. Gene expression was analysed from bronchiolar ephithelial cells sampled by laser captured microdissection at day 14.  Results: Surprisingly, naphthalene-induced club cell depletion protected mice from bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis. We conclude that club cells are involved in the development of lung injury and fibrosis.

DESIGN
Gene expression was analysed from bronchiolar ephithelial cells sampled by laser captured microdissection at day 14.
