TITLE
A novel synthetic jumonji H3K27 demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 exert immunosuppressive activities

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq, we report that jumonji H3K27 demethylase inhibitor, GSK-J4, exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells.

DESIGN
Examination of effects of LPS-stimulated BV2 cells with or without GSKJ4 treatment, were generated by deep sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000(101 cycles PE lane).
