TITLE
HCaRG vs NEO

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Summary: HEK293 cells were transfected with control plasmid (pcDNA1/Neo; Invitrogen) or with the plasmid encoding HCaRG by a standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. The clones expressing the highest levels of HCaRG, HCaRG clone 8 and 9 were used in this experiment, while clone transfected with vector alone, Neo clone, served as control. Stable transfectants were synchronized and grown in the presence of 10% FBS for 48 h. Total RNAs were purified with the mini RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Keywords: parallel sample

DESIGN
Chips HG-U133 Plus 2.0: - Labeling protocol: GeneChip IVT  Labeling Kit. - Hybridization: According to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix). - Scanner: GeneChip Scanner 3000. - Normalization: Employing GCOS software, chips were normalized using all probe sets scaling option and target signal at 500.
