TITLE
RNA-seq data: Baf60c homozygous deletion vs. WT at two time points in cardiac differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This project compares Baf60c homozygous deletions to WT at two time points during cardiac differentiation. This data is used in two separate projects: first to assess the role of Baf60c in regulating cardiac gene expression, and second to assess the repeatability of results from different RNA-seq analysis tools.

DESIGN
There are 12 samples total; 3 replicates for each group, times 2 genetic backgrounds (WT and Baf60c homozygous KO), times two timepoints (cardiomyocyte (D10) and cardiac precusor (D5.3)).

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
