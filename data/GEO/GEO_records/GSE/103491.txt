TITLE
Human dermal fibroblast reprogramming: compact and differentiated colonies during maturation phase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of reprogrammed cells at day 20 post-transduction comparing compact and differentiated colonies with established induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) generated from human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). This study focused in the identification of upregulated transcription factors related to early developmental processes, particularly during primitive streak formation.

DESIGN
Compact embryonic stem cell-like colonies and differentiated polygonal cell-containing colonies at day 20 after reprogramming vector transduction into HDF, isolated from three different reprogramming experiments; and undifferentiated colonies from and established iPSC line, at passage 20. One replicate for compact and differentiated samples. Two replicates for iPSC sample.
