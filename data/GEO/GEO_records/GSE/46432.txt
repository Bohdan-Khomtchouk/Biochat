TITLE
Analysis of the effects of the methyltransferase encoded by Rv3263  on gene expression in M. tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
DNA methylation affects gene expression in many organisms. To determine to effects of DNA methylation on gene expression in M. tuberculosis, we genetically deleted a predicted DNA methyltransferase encoded by Rv3263 and subjected wildtype, mutant, and complemented strains to global expression analysis.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from triplicate cultures of wildtype, methyltransferase deletion, and complemented strains.
