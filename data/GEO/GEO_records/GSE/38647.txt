TITLE
Identification of type A spermatogonia specific transcriptome in rainbow trout immature testis

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
To identify the transcripts preferentially expressed in type A spermatogonia in rainbow trout immature testis, we compared the transcriptome between type A spermatogonia and testicular somatic cells by microarry analysis. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate type A spermatogonia or testicular somatic cells from the fishes carrying the transgene, pvasa-GFP, which expresses GFP in spermatogonia.

DESIGN
RNA from type A spermatogonia and from testicular somatic cells were hybridized to a microarray after Cy3 labeling.
