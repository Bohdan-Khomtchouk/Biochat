TITLE
Effects of ACE2 on BMPR2 mutation-mediated defects in gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BMPR2 mutation causes pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); ACE2 treatment can resolve established BMPR2-mediated PAH. The purpose of this study was to uncover the molecular mechanism behind this.

DESIGN
Four groups: +/- ACE2 and +/- BMPR2 transgene, two arrays each, each array a pool of three animals.
