TITLE
Discovery of genes involved in facial midline specification

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The patterning of the facial midline involves early specification of neural crest cells to form skeletal tissues that support the upper jaw . In order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved  we have taken advantage of a beak duplication model developed in the chicken embryo. Here we can induce the transformation of the side of the beak into a second midline that is easily identifiable by the formation of a supernumerary egg tooth. The phenotype is induced by implanting two microscopic beads, one soaked in retinoic acid and the other soaked in Noggin into the side of the head of the chicken embryo.  Here we use microarrays to profile expression of maxillary mesenchyme 16h after placing the beads.  A subset of genes were validated using in situ hybridization and QPCR. The aims of the study are to test the function of these genes using retroviral transgenesis, knockdown with morpholinos or expression of secreted proteins and their application to the embryo.

DESIGN
Embryos were incubated at 38 degrees C until they reached Hamburger Hamilton Stage 15 or 25 somites. Four different treatments were carried out consisting of two beads simultaneously implanted into the side of the head between the eye and mandibular arch. The beads were either Noggin+retinoic acid, Tris+retinoic acid, Noggin+DMSO or the control, Tris+DMSO. Embryos were reincubated for another 16h until they reached stage 18.  Embryos were dissected on ice in Hanks Buffered Salt Solution and batches of 12-15 maxillary pieces were snap frozen in liquid Nitrogen. These pooled facial prominences comprised one biological replicate. A total of three biological replicates were generated for each treatment.
