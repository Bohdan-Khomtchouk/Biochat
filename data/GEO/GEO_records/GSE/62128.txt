TITLE
Whole gene expression data from osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 under large gradient high magnetic field (LG-HMF)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
osteocyte is the mechanosensor in bone, taking up pivotal position in mediating the mechano-induced bone remodeling. Dimagnetic levitation has been used to stimulating a reduced gravity environment for studing the effects of changed gravity to different organisms.we constructed a superconducting magnet based platform with a large gradient high magnetic field(LG-HMF),which can provide three apparent gravity levels (μ-g,1-g and 2-g). osteocytes are sensetive to gravitational changes, our aim is to explore what  responses do osteocytes exists under different gravitational environments in gene level, together with filtering the up-  and down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
mouse osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 were cultured under three different apparent gravity levels  (μ-g,1-g and 2-g) and normal gravity environment (control) for 48 hours, after which total RNA was extracted . And then RNA samples  hybridized  on affymetrix microarrays to obtain the whole genome expression profiles. the aim that we selected 48 hours as the cell culture time was to make a comparison with our previous researches of osteocytes.
