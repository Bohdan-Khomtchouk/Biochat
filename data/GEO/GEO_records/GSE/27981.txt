Early Origins Meta-peak generation

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3441 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of David MacAlpine. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 We will precisely identify sequence elements that direct DNA replication by using chromatin immunoprecipitation of known replication initiation complexes.  These experiments will be conducted in multiple cell types and developmental tissues. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Output file represents the union of the coordinates of peak data from various experiments peak calls. These unioned areas, referred to as meta-peaks, cover any genomic coordinate that has been experimentally shown to be capable of sustaining a peak.
