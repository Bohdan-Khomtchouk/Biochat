TITLE
Molecular Events Initiating B Cell Fate Specification

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Functional genomics comparison of EBFko, Pax5ko, and RAG2ko cell lines. Identify gene signatures associated with specfication and commitment to the B cell fate.

DESIGN
Cultured cells harvested and for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix 430 2.0 Arrays.
