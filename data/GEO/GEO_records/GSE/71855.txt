TITLE
Histone deacetylase inhibitor enhanced salinity stress response

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify salt-resistant related genes by histone deacetylase inhibitor Ky-2, expression profiles between plants treated with or without Ky-2 under salt stress were analyzed using the custom microarray (GPL20781).

DESIGN
Wild-type plants (Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia) were grown on 1/2 MS 0.1 % Agar medium for four days. Then, the plants were administrated to Ky-2 for 24 hours and then treated 100 mM Nacl for two hours. Expression profiles were analyzed using the custom array (GPL20781).
