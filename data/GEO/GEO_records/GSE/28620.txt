TITLE
Progastrin dependent cancer cell proliferation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Overexpression of human progastrin (hGAS) in mice has been observed  to increase colonic mucosa proliferation significantly, but the mechanism and receptors of progastrin have not been defined. We investigated this mechanism by observing the microarray gene expression in mGAS-/- mice, WT mice, and hGAS transgenic mice.

DESIGN
Gene expression of colonic mucosa of WT C57BL/6 mice,Gas-/- C57BL/6 mice, and hGAS transgenic mice, all 6 weeks old were compared.
