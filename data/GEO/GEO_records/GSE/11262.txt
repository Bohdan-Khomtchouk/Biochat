TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis Seed Compartments at the Globular Embryo Stage.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We collected globular stage seed compartments from 5 or 7-micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments of an Arabidopsis seed containing a globular stage embryo. For the purposes of this study we broke down the seed into 8 capturable compartments: embyro proper, suspensor, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat, general seed coat, and whole seeds. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Globular stage seed compartments were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 17 samples (Embryo Proper, Micropylar Endosperm, Peripheral Endosperm, General Seed Coat, Chalazal Seed Coat, and Whole Seeds, 2 biological replicates each and Chalazal Endosperm with 3 biological replicates).
