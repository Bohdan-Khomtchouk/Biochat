TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of intestinal CD4 T-cells from control, HFD-induced prediabetic and diabetic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine whether diet-induced changes in gut microbiota modified intestinal immune cell gene expression, we analyzed the transcriptome of CD4 T lymphocytes isolated from the lamina propria of the small intestine from mice fed with different diets.

DESIGN
Mice were fed a high fat diet to change microbiota. 10 and 30 days after the diet started, microarray were performed on lamina propria CD4 T lymphocytes.
