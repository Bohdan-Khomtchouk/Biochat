TITLE
Heart failure in TNF-alpha transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cardiac-specific TNF-alpha transgenic mice are an excellent model to study the pathologenesis of heart failure. Affymetrix U74V2A was used to analyze the gene expression profile of  male and female wildtype FVB and TNF-alpha transgenic mice at the time point of compensated hypertrophy  and dilated heart failure. 3 week, 13 week and 40 week samples examined.
