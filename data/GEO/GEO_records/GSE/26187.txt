TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Escherichia coli during a transition from zinc starvation to surfeit

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Escherichia coli strain MG1655 was grown in a Zn-depleted custom-built chemostat.  Culture volume (120 ml), temperature (37 oC) and stirring speed (440 rpm) were maintained.  Steady state values for pH and OD600 were 6.9 and 0.6, respectively.  Chemostats were grown for 50 h to allow five culture volumes to pass through the vessel and allow an apparent (pseudo-)steady state to be reached.  At this point, ZnSO4.7H2O in water was added to a final concentration of 0.2 M in the chemostat.  A 10 ml sample of culture was taken using a polypropylene pipette tip immediately prior to Zn addition and 2.5, 7, 10 and 30 min after addition.  Samples were harvested into RNAprotect and total RNA was purified using Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini kit (using the supplier’s protocol) prior to use in microarray analysis.  A control experiment was also carried out in which water was added.  Biological experiments were carried out twice (i.e. control (water added) and experiment (ZnSO4 added) chemostats were grown separately twice), and a dye swap performed for each experiment, providing at least two technical repeats for each of the two biological repeats at all five time points.  Slides were analysed so that time points “with Zn” were compared to the same time point “without Zn” (e.g. 30 min after Zn was added was compared to 30 min after water being added).
