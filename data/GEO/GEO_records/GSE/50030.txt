TITLE
Phytophthora have distinct endogenous small RNA populations that include short interfering and microRNAs: Phytophthora infestans small RNA

ORGANISM
Phytophthora infestans

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of small RNAs from three Phytophthora species, P. infestans, P. ramorum and P. sojae, was done to systematically analyze small RNA-generating components of Phytophthora genomes. We found that each species produces two distinct small RNA populations that are predominantly 21- or 25-nucleotides long. We present evidence that 25-nucleotide small RNAs are short-interfering RNAs that silence repetitive genetic elements. In contrast, 21-nucleotide small RNAs are associated with inverted repeats, including a novel microRNA family, and may function at the post-transcriptional level.

DESIGN
Phytophthora infestans mycelium small RNAs were sequenced and aligned to the P. infestans genome for analysis.
