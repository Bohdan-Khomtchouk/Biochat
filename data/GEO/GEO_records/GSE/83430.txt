TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of equine sarcoids

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify changes in transcriptome of horse sarcoids - a locally invasive skin tumors of equids, which are considered to be the most common equine skin neoplasm. The global expression of genes was investigated in four tumour samples and in the tumour-distant skin samples, obtained from the same individual.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, sarcoid vs. tumour-distant skin. Biological replicates: 4 sarcoid replicates, 4 control tissue replicates.
