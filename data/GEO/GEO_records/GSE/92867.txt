TITLE
Sequencing analysis of m6A-methylated RNAs responding to UV

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
m6A RNA immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted to identify RNAs that are directly m6A-methylated by the METTL3 methylatransferase specifically in response to UV.

DESIGN
WT and METTL3 KO U2OS cells were subjected (plus UV condition) or not (minus UV condition) to a 50 J dose of UVC irradiation. Following irradiation, cells were lyzed and total RNAs were extracted. Poly A+ RNAs were isolated and subjected to m6A RNA precipitation.
