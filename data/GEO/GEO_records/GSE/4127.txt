TITLE
Anticancer drug clustering in lung cancer based on gene expression profiles and sensitivity database

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Anticancer drug clustering in lung cancer based on gene expression profiles. We performed gene expression analysis in lung cancer cell lines. (used: Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Array Set HG-U133A). We also examines the sensitivity of these cell lines to commonly used anti-cancer agents (docetaxel, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, 5-FU, SN38, cisplatin, and carboplatin) via MTT assay. We related the cytoxic activity of each of these agents to corresponding expression pattern in each of the cell lines using modified NCI program. Keywords: cytotoxicity, lung cancer, anticancer drugs
