TITLE
Comparative Genomics of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis

ORGANISM
Bacillus anthracis ; Bacillus cereus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to carry out a CGH study utilizing a set of 39 diverse Bacillus isolates. Thirty four B. cereus and five B. anthracis strains and isolates were chosen so as to represent different lineages based on previous characterizations, including MLEE and MLST (Helgason, Okstad et al. 2000; Helgason, Tourasse et al. 2004). They represent the spectrum of B. cereus phenotypic diversity by including soil, dairy and periodontal isolates in addition to virulent B. anthracis strains.

DESIGN
39 diverse Bacillus isolates were chosen for the study.Thirty four B. cereus and five B. anthracis strains. Dye swap experiments were performed yielding 2 hybridizations per query strain. Each 70mer oligo spotted on the B. cereus species microarray is spotted once.  Positive controls on the array consist of oligos designed from the sequenced reference genome, STERNE, and negative controls on the array consist of oligos designed from the thale cress plant, Arabidopsis thaliana.

PLATFORM
GPL9206 JCVI PFGRC Bacillus anthracis 32K vt1 array designed primarily based on strain Sterne
