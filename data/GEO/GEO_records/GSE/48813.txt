TITLE
Expression changes in the absence of miR-128 in striatal D1-receptor positive neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNA regulates protein expression of cells by repressing translation of specific target messenger transcripts. Loss of the neuron specific microRNA miR-128 in Dopamine D1-receptor expressing neurons in the murine striatum (D1-MSNs) lead to increased neuronal excitability, locomotor hyperactivity and fatal epilepsy. To examine expression changes in the absence of miR-128 in D1-MSNs, we used mice expressing EGFP-tagged ribosomes in D1-MSNs with either D1-MSN-specific homozygous deletion of miR-128-2 locus or no deletion. Transcripts co-immunoprecipitated with tagged ribosomes were analyzed by microarray.

DESIGN
9 mutant animals ( D1-MSN-tagged ribosome; D1-MSN specific miR-128-2 homozygous deletion) and 7 age matched littermate control animals (D1-MSN-tagged ribosome only).
