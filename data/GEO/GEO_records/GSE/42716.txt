TITLE
miRNA microarray of mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To find miRNAs that involve in renal epithelial transition and renal fibrosis, we performed unilateral ureteral obstruction of mice for 7 days. After that, we harvested kidneys, and performed microarray of miRNA. Contralateral kidneys without ureteral obstruction were used as controls. miRNAs were purified from kidneys with ureteral obstruction and contralateral kidneys without ureteral obstruction. Then microarray of miRNA was performed (n=4). miRNAs up-regulated in kidneys with ureteral obsctruction compared with contralateral kidneys were sorted.

DESIGN
We performed unilateral ureteral obstruction of mice for 7 days, and harvested kidneys.
