TITLE
Transcriptional analysis between Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 and mutants altered in the antibiotics production

ORGANISM
Streptomyces clavuligerus

SUMMARY
The objective is to analyze the differential expression between the wild strain and a ccaR-deleted and oppA2::aph mutants

DESIGN
6 biological conditions were used, three strains in two times (exponential and stationary growth phase; Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064, S. clavuligerus âˆ†ccaR and S. clavuligerus oppA2::aph). Four biological replicates were made for each condition

PLATFORM
GPL17796 Agilent-019494 Streptomyces clavuligerus DDTS_02 Microarray (Feature Number version)
