TITLE
Neuroblastoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of cell lines initially established as neuroblastoma cell lines. Cells were harvested and processed for DNA-microarray analysis using Affymetrix HG-U133A microarrays. Primary image analysis was performed using MAS 5.0 and data were scaled to an target intesity of 500. Keywords: other

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from established cell lines and subjected to microarray analysis
