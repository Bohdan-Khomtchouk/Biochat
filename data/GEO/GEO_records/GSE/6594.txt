TITLE
Nitrosomonas europaea cells treated with chloromethane for one hour and compared to untreated cells

ORGANISM
Nitrosomonas europaea

SUMMARY
We analyzed the global transcriptional response of N. europaea when exposed to  chloromethane (3.2 mM for 1 h).  Chloromethane treatment led to down regulation of 175 genes and  up regulation of 67 genes. This treatment was less harmful to the cells than chloroform Keywords: stress response, global transcription, toxin-antitoxin genes

DESIGN
We selected chloromethane concentration and exposure time that caused significant changes in cell physiology but without being too severe. Our  experiments demonstrated that 3.2 mM chloromethane  caused the desired effect. Based on the physiological, proteomic and transcriptional observations, we  analyzed the whole-genome transcriptional responses of N. europaea at 1 h after the chloromethane  treatment. Cells from treated samples and untreated control samples were collected  for RNA extraction and hybridization with Affymetrix microarray GeneChip.
