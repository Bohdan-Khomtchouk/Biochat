TITLE
H3K27me3 ChIP-sequencing on LSK (Lin-Sca-1+c-kit+) cells isolated from control, MxCre Jak2VF/+ and MxCre Jak2VF/+ EZH2-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inactivating EZH2 mutations have been associated with myelofibrosis (MF). Moreover, EZH2 mutations co-exist with the JAK2V617F mutation in a significant cases of MF. To determine the effects of concomitant loss of EZH2 and JAK2V617F mutation in hematopoiesis, we generated Ezh2-deficient Jak2V617F-expressing mice. To identify the Ezh2 target genes that are regulated by H3K27me3 in MF, we performed H3K27me3 ChIP-sequencing in sorted LSK cells from control, MxCre;Jak2VF/+ and MxCre;Jak2VF/+ EZH2-/- mice.

DESIGN
1500μg pI-pC was administrated to control, MxCre Jak2VF/+ and MxCre Jak2VF/+ EZH2-/- at 4 weeks after birth in five times (300μg each time). Bone marrow cells were harvested from the mice at 12 weeks after pI-pC injections.ChIP-seq experiments were performed for LSK cells sorted from BM cells.
