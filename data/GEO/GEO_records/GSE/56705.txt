TITLE
Muscle in beef steers with low vs. high residual feed efficiency

ORGANISM
Bos indicus x Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of bovine skeletal muscle comparing metabolically efficient steers to metabolically inefficient steers to ascertain what expression differences can be found in muscle tissue that might help explain differences in this economically significant phenotype.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, efficient versus inefficient animals. 8 efficient and 8 inefficient samples were used representing 16 unique individual animals.

PLATFORM
GPL9712 Agilent-015354 Bovine Oligo Microarray (4x44K) (Probe Name version)
