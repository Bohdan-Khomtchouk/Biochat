TITLE
TARBP2 HITS-CLIP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify TARBP2 binding sites on endogenous RNA, we performed HITS-CLIP on a myc-tagged TARBP2 expressing cell-line (transient transfection)

DESIGN
Cells were transfected with tagged TARBP2 vector (Origene) and 48-hr post-transfection, they were subjected to the HITS-CLIP procedure (Licatalosi D, et al. 2008, Nature 456:464-U22)

PLATFORM
