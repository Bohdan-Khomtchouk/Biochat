TITLE
Gene analysis of the neonatal rat lung exposed to STZ-induced maternal diabetes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Maternal diabetes is associated with a wide range of fetal and neonatal adverse effects including pulmonary disturbances. To investigate the effects of maternal diabetes on neonatal lung gene expression profile, we performed microarray analysis on the lungs of 14-day-old rats born to diabetic dam. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
Four neonatal lungs exposed to maternal diabetes and four control lungs were analyzed.
