TITLE
Laminin-guided highly efficient endothelial commitment from human pluripotent stem cells [Single Cell RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Obtaining highly purified differentiated cells via directed differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is an essential step for the clinical application of hPSCs. Among the various conditions that should be optimized, the precise role and contribution of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during differentiation are relatively unclear. Here, using a short fragment of laminin 411 (LM411-E8), an ECM predominantly expressed in the vascular endothelial basement membrane, we demonstrated that the directed switching of defined ECMs robustly yields highly purified ( > 95%) endothelial progenitor cells (PSC-EPCs) from hPSCs in integrin-laminin axis and rho signaling pathway-dependent manner.

DESIGN
Single cell RNA-sequencing was conducted to describe transcriptional dynamics from pluripotent stem cells toward the endothelial lineages.
