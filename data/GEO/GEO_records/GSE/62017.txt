TITLE
A cross-comparison of technologies for the detection of microRNAs from FFPE samples of hepatoblastoma patients [NanoString]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This work highlights similarities and differences between three platforms (next-generation sequencing, microarray and NanoString) for detecting miRNAs and compares their strengths and weaknesses.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiles were determined in Hepatoblastoma FFPE samples using a NanoString platform.

PLATFORM
GPL19223 NanoString nCounter Human miRNA Expression Assay v2 [miRBase accession version]
