TITLE
Estrogen Receptor alpha ChIP-Seq in mouse mammary gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Estrogen Receptor is a key transcriptional regulator in mammary gland development and breast cancer. In this study, we have mapped the Estrogen Receptor chromatin binding patterns in healthy mouse mammary gland

DESIGN
A minimum of 6 pairs of mouse mammary gland pads from mice at 5-6 weeks of age were excised and Estrogen Receptor ChIp-seq was performed.
