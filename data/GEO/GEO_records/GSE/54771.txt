TITLE
Comparison of the tarnscriptome of 4T1 control cells versus shRNA NFAT1 transduced cells (mouse)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
4T1 is a mammary tumor cell line to which the NFAT1 transcription factor is essential for tumorigenesis and metastasis.

DESIGN
control or shRNA transduced 4T1 cells growing in culture were collected and RNA was extracted from each sample and processed for hybridization to Affymetrix arrays.

PLATFORM
