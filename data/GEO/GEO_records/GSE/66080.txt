TITLE
RNA-seq of small RNA in Ammopiptanthus mongolicus to investigate drought and cold adaptation

ORGANISM
Ammopiptanthus mongolicus

SUMMARY
Ammopiptanthus mongolicus is an ecologically important desert plant. To understand the role of miRNA genes in draught and cold stress adaptation, RNA-seq of small RNA in Ammopiptanthus mongolicus was performed.

DESIGN
To identify microRNAs and other small RNA in A. mongolicus, we generated five small RNA libraries using RNA isolated from drought stressed-roots (DT_R) and unstressed roots (CK_R), and RNA isolated from drought stressed-leaves (DT_L), cold stressed-leaves (CT_L)  and unstressed leaves (CK_L). These small RNA libraries were then sequenced by the high throughput Illumina /Solexa sequencing platform.
