TITLE
Expression data from WT, DSigT and DSigU Caulobacter crescentus (syn. C. vibrioides) starved for carbon

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
Bacteria adapt to shifts from rapid to slow growth, and have developed strategies for long-term survival during prolonged starvation and stress conditions. We report the response of C. crescentus to carbon starvation, a common form of nutritional stress encountered by free-living bacteria, that induces stasis. We explored the differential gene expression changes in wild type cells and cells carrying deletions of two alternative extracytoplasmic function sigma factors, SigT and SigU.

DESIGN
Glucose, the only carbon source in the minimal media M2G was removed from C. crescentus exponential phase cultures (wild-type (strain LS101), DSigT (strain LS3554) and DSigU (strain LS3547)). Total RNA was extracted after 15 minutes of incubation. Controls are cells that were mock washed and incubated in parallel in complete media.
