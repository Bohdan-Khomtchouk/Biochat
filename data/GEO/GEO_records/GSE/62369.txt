TITLE
Delineating the transcriptional network of prognostic gene signatures refines treatment recommendations for lymph node negative breast cancer patients

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To define proliferative and senescent cell transcriptional profiles, we performed genome-wide expression analyses of growing and senescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)

DESIGN
MEFs were passaged from P1 (growing) to P7 (replicative senescence) and RNA was harvested from 3 independent MEF lines at P2 and P7. This RNA was used for genome-wide expression analyses.

PLATFORM
GPL19294 Agilent-023442 Custom Mouse Array
