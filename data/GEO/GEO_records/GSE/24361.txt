TITLE
Transcriptome response to different carbon sources in Acetobacter aceti

ORGANISM
Acetobacter aceti NBRC 14818

SUMMARY
Acetic acid bacteria are obligately aerobic alphaproteobacteria that have a unique ability to incompletely oxidize various alcohols and sugars to organic acids. The ability of these bacteria to incompletely oxidize ethanol to acetate has been historically utilized for vinegar production. The mechanism of switching between incomplete oxidation and assimilatory oxidation and the control of energy and carbon metabolism in acetic acid bacteria are not fully understood. To understand the physiology and molecular biology of acetic acid bacteria better, we determined the draft genome sequence of Acetobacter aceti NBRC 14818, which is the type strain of the genus. Based on this draft genome sequence, the transcriptome profiles in A. aceti cells grown on ethanol, acetate, glucose, or mix of ethanol and glucose was determined by using NimbleGen Prokaryotic Expression array (4x72K).

DESIGN
Acetobacter aceti NBRC14818 was cultivated in the medium containing ethanol, acetate, glucose, or mix of ethanol and glucose as carbon sources in Erlenmeyer flask with rotary shaking. Total RNA was extracted when optical density at 600 nm was 0.3-0.4. The experiment was performed in duplicate independent cultures.
