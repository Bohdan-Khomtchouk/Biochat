TITLE
Systematic Transcriptome Analysis of Zebrafish Model of Diamond-Blackfan Anemia from RPS24 Deficiency (miRNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In this study, we found RPS24 is required for both the primitive hematopoiesis and definitive hematopoiesis process partly mediated by P53 pathway. With the RNA-seq and miRNA-seq technique, several deregulated genes and miRNAs were found to be related with hematopoiesis, vascular development and apoptosis process in RPS24-deficient zebrafish. Meanwhile, a comprehensive regulatory network was firstly constructed to indentify the mechanisms of key miRNAs and gene pathways in this Model of Diamond-Blackfan Anemia. Interestingly, we found that the central nodes genes in the network were almost all targeted by significantly deregulated miRNAs, with partial verification from previous studies, revealing that our network-based approach is promising for the identification of new and important miRNAs in DBA. The present study provided comprehensive potential pathogenic genes and miRNAs data that are associated with RPS24-deficient zebrafish embryos as a model of DBA, which should provide a valuable resource for understanding the complex molecular pathogenesis of mutant RPS24-mediated human diseases.

DESIGN
Determine the differences of miRNome between RPS24-deficient and MO control zebrafish embryos for understanding the complex molecular pathogenesis of mutant RPS24-mediated human diseases
