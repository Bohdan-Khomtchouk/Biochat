TITLE
Global Gene Expression in Deceased Donor Liver Transplantation with Ischemic Preconditioning

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The clear benefits of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) in reducing ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) remain indistinct in human liver transplantation. To further understand the mechanistic aspects of IPC in human deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT), we performed microarray analyses to determine global gene expression profiles associated with IPC administration. Donor and recipient characteristics in both groups were comparable. Clinical data from our study subset and larger trial were similar.  IPC increased expression of 10 transcripts at either time point with roles in: antioxidant defenses, immunological response, lipid biosynthesis, and xenobiotic metabolism.  IPC decreased the expression of 1 cell development related transcript.  Conclusions: 1) IPC in DDLT increased the expression of antioxidant transcripts similar to studies in animal IPC, anesthetic, and remote IPC.  2) IPC increased expression of lipogenic transcripts, which may be relevant to the clinically observed increased IRI in our IPC group. 3) Our microarray findings support our clinical observations and are compatible with the varied outcomes of hepatic IPC studies in human liver transplantation.
