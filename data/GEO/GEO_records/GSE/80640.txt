TITLE
Gene expression of Ewing sarcoma cell lines treated with 20S proteasome inhibitors and benzyl‐4‐piperidone compounds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the expression changes in Ewing sarcoma cell lines following treatment with 2 known 20S proteasome inhibitors versus 2 novel compounds

DESIGN
Two Ewing Sarcoma cell lines (TC71 and CHP100) were treated with compounds for 6 hours.  RNA was then extracted and sent for expression analysis.  DMSO treated cells were used as controls
