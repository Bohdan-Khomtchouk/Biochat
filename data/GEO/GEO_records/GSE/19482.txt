TITLE
Transcriptional responses of human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Evolutionary change in gene expression is generally considered to be a major driver of phenotypic differences between species. We investigated innate immune diversification by analyzing inter-species differences in the transcriptional responses of primary human and mouse macrophages to the TLR4 agonist, LPS. Using a custom platform permitting cross-species interrogation coupled with deep sequencing of mRNA 5’ ends, we identified extensive divergence in LPS-regulated orthologous gene expression between humans and mice (24% of orthologs, http://www.macgate.qfab.org ). Divergently regulated (DR) orthologs were enriched for genes encoding cellular “inputs” such as cell surface receptors (e.g. TLR6, IL-7Rα), and functional “outputs” such as inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (e.g. CCL20, CXCL13). Conversely, intracellular signaling components linking inputs to outputs were typically concordantly regulated. DR genes were associated with a large dynamic range of gene expression, and specific promoter architectural features (TATA box enrichment, CpG island depletion). Surprisingly, regulatory divergence was also associated with enhanced inter-species promoter conservation. Thus, the genes controlled by complex, highly conserved promoters that facilitate dynamic regulation are also the most susceptible to evolutionary change.

DESIGN
Human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) were stimulated with the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide, over a time course (0, 2, 6, 24h) and analysed in biological quadruplicate (each of which represents a pool of two independent blood donors), in total representing 8 macrophage preparations from independent blood donors, on a custom-designed, focused microarray.
