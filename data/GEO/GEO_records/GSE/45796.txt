TITLE
Transcriptional profiles on different yeast strain mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiles on different yeast strain mutants (DEgd2/1, DEgd2/Btt1)were identified by microarray analysis comparing total mutant RNA vs wild type RNA.

DESIGN
Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments
