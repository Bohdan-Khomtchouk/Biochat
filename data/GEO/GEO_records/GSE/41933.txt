TITLE
Human bone and marrow niche formation by mesenchymal progenitors in vivo is predefined by an organotypic epigenetic signature

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we have analyzed DNA methylation characteristics of human mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) form different tissue sources including bone marrow (BM), white adipose tissue (WAT ), umbilical cord (UC) as well as dermal fibroblasts by using the HumanMethylation450K array. Cells able to form bone through endochondral ossification and attract bone marrow in an innovative in vivo model were compared to cells lacking these capacities. Interestingly only BM-derived MSPCs were capable of bone formation and marrow attraction. These features correlated with unique epigenetic characteristics potentially enabling BM-derived cells to undergo endochondral ossification.

DESIGN
