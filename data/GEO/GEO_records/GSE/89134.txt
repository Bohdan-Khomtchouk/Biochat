TITLE
Hit-and-run' programing of CAR-T cells using mRNA nanocarriers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNAseq of ex vivo CD8 T cell lineages and in vitro differentiated CD8 T cells treated with nanocarriers encapsulating control or Foxo1-3A transcription factor mRNA

DESIGN
Gene expression in central memory CD8 and in vitro Foxo1-3A nanoparticle treated CD8 were compared to control cells cultured in vitro with eGFP mRNA encapsulating nanoparticles.
