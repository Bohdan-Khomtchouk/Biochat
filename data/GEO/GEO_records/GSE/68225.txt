TITLE
MicroRNA signature in skeletal muscle in insulin resistant rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The current study aimed to address the hypothesis that programmed expression of key miRNAs in skeletal muscle mediates the development of insulin resistance, and consequently long-term health. We thus examined microRNA signatures in skeletal muscle of programmed insulin resistant rats offspring from high fat-fed dams vs control offspring from chow fed dams.

DESIGN
Skeletal muscle (soleus) was collected from the hind limb of 1 year old male offspring (6 from control dams, 6 from high fat-fed dams) . Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics (UNSW, sydney, Australia)
