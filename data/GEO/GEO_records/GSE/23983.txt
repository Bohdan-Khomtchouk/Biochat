TITLE
Short-term exposure to effluent from bulk drug industries

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The Patancheru area near Hyderabad in India is recognized as a key link in the global supply chain for many bulk drugs. A central treatment plant receives wastewater from about 90 different manufacturers and the resulting complex effluent has contaminated surface, ground and drinking water in the region. Ecotoxicological testing of the effluent has shown adverse effects for several organisms, including aquatic vertebrates. In an attempt to start investigating how exposure to effluent-contaminated water may affect humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, rats were tube-fed effluent. Results from microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays indicated, however, no marked effects on hepatic gene expression after five days exposure. Neither did a clinical analysis of blood serum constituents used as biomarkers for human disease reveal any significant changes, nor were there any effects on weight gain. Taken together, we could not find evidence for any acute toxicity in the rat; however, we cannot rule out that higher doses of effluent or a longer exposure time may still be associated with risks for terrestrial vertebrates.

DESIGN
10 rats (5 controls and 5 exposed to effluent) were subjected to microarray analysis. Further information is available in Rutgersson et al., 2010.
