TITLE
Gene expression in wild-type vs. G2 -77 enhancer knockout myeloid progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
-77-/- mice exhibited late embryonic lethality, anemia, and a constellation of phenotypes. -77 conferred a unique genetic network in myeloid progenitors, endowing progenitors with potential to produce diverse progeny.

DESIGN
E13.5 WT or -77-/- fetal liver cells were isolated and sorted for common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) defined by  Lin-Sca- CD34+FcRlow, and subjected to RNA-sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
