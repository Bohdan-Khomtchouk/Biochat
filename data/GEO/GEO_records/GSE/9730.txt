TITLE
Effect of foliar spray of lipo-chitooligosaccharide (Nod factor) on soybean leaf gene expression.

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Currently unpublished data suggested that the foliar application of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum Nod factor induced changes in hormone level and enzyme activity in soybean cv. OAC Bayfield. This study was designed to examine any possible differences in gene expression that occur as a result of the foliar treatment of Nod factor. The data herein are gene expression data of that experiment, from the sprayed, first trifoliolate leaf of each plant, 48 h after treatment. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
This experimental design was a Completely Randomized Design (CRD), comparing 1 treatment (first trifoliolate leaf sprayed with 10^-7M LCO/Nod factor and 0.02% Tween 20) against a mock-treated control (first trifoliolate leaf sprayed with dH2O and 0.02% Tween 20). There are 3 replicates per treatment type, with a total of 6 samples for this experiment.
