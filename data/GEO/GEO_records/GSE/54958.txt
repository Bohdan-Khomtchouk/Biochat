TITLE
Expression profiling in proliferative thyroid lesions of different histologies and normal thyroid tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experiment a) Establishment of expression profiles in conventional papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) with a BRAF mutation vs. PTCs without a BRAF mutation and using normal thyroid (TN) specimens as reference. Experiment b) Establishment of expression profiles in follicular adenomas (FAs) of the thyroid and follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas (FVPTCs).

DESIGN
We extracted DNA from specimens and performed mutational analysis in malignant lesions and extracted RNA that was processed and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.
