TITLE
Expression of orthologs of ribosome biogenesis factors in vegetative and reproductive tissues in Solanum lycopersicum

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Ribosome biogenesis is a major cellular processes involving a large inventory of proteinaceous and RNA cofactors. Recent bioinformatics approaches discovered a large but not complete overlap of the inventory between yeast, mammals and plants. We re-inspected the complexity of ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs) by assigning co-orthologs to each protein family in the A. thaliana and S. lycopersicum genomes. We realized that about 25% of all analyzed RBFs in the two plant genomes are encoded by more than one gene. The majority is expressed in leaves and anthers of tomato as determined by next generation sequencing (NGS). For the analysis of NGS data we developed a software pipeline ‘CRACPipe’. This pipeline is designed to be very flexible with respect to genome selection and experimental set up. The NGS analysis revealed the expression of 24.538 genes in tomato leaves and of 22.893 genes in anthers. The observed expression of RBFs was confirmed by qRT-PCR for a randomly chosen sub-set of genes. Further, analysis of the expression profile of selected RBFs during male gametophyte development revealed a differential expression in the different developmental stages for the majority of genes. Based on our analysis we conclude that RBFs described in yeast but not present in plant genomes as concluded from previous orthology analysis are in parts replaced by other RBFs for which multiple genes have been identified in here. In addition, the obtained complexity for some RBFs accounts for a tissue and developmental specific regulation of ribosome biogenesis as well.
