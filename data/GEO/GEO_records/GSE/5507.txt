TITLE
Androgen-starved LNCaP cells treated with celastrol and androgen, androgen alone, or vehicle alone for 24h

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
celastrol is a natural product that affects LNCaP androgen-signalling by 24h We used microarrays to detail the androgen-responsive program of gene expression affected by celastrol treatment at 24h Keywords: drug treatment

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were grown to 50% confluency and deprived of androgen, and subsequently treated with celastrol plus androgen, androgen alone, or vehicle alone for 24h prior to direct Trizol lysis and RNA isolation
