TITLE
The histone demethylase JMJD1A is essential to prostate cancer cells through regulation of c-Myc expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expresssion altered upon knockdown of histone demethylase JMJD1A in human prostate cancer cells. The objective is to elucidate the transcriptional programs that are controlled by JMJD1A in human prostate cancer.

DESIGN
CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cells were transduced with lentiviral particles encoding control pLKO.1 or JMJD1A shRNA (shJMJD1A). After 48 h, total RNAs were collected for the microarray analysis to determine the differentially expressed genes between Rv1 pLKO.1 and Rv1 shJMJD1A samples.
