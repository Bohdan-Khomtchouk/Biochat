TITLE
Primary and ras keratinocytes plus TGFbeta1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have compared the response to TGFbeta1 in normal and v-rasHa transduced primary mouse keratinocytes using NCI cDNA microarrays. This analysis reveals that Ha-ras alters global TGFbeta1 mediated gene expression in a gene specific manner. The expression pattern of TGFbeta1 immediate early response genes and down regulation of cell cycle control genes is not altered by Ha-ras but the induction of most extracellular matrix genes is blocked. Using Smad3 null keratinocytes, we find that the majority of TGFbeta1 responsive genes in primary keratinocytes are Smad3 dependent, but patterns of transcriptional responses suggest that the ability of Ha-ras to block TGFbeta1 mediated gene expression is not dependent on Smad3. However, the combination of oncogenic ras and loss of Smad3 prevents the TGFbeta1 dependent suppression of genes associated with cell cycle progression and apoptosis observed with either genotype alone. In addition several extracellular matrix genes are super-repressed by TGFbeta1 in the Ha-ras Smad3 null keratinocytes. These data provide a genomic framework for understanding how disruptions of TGFbeta signaling and oncogenic ras cooperate to promote premalignant progression of primary keratinocytes.
