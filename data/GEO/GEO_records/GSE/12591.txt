TITLE
Angiotensin II induced aneurysms in male ApoE mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we used microarrays to examine relative genes expression within the aorta of ApoE-/- infused with angiotensin II in relation to aneurysm formation. Infusion of angiotensin II induces aortic dilatation particularly of the suprarenal aorta in ApoE-/- mice. Based on studies carried out in our and other laboratories the response to angiotensin II is variable, with some mice developing large aneurysms but other animals appearing resistant to aneurysm formation with aortic diameters similar to that of saline controls.     We compared RNA expression from whole aortas of 17 week old male ApoE-/- mice exposed to angiotensin II (1.44 Âµg/kg/min) for 4 weeks where there was clear evidence of aortic aneurysm formation (n=5) with that of mice failing to develop aneurysms (n=7) and those exposed to saline infusion (n=6). AAA was defined as diameter of suprarenal aorta greated than 1.5mm measured on photographs of aortas at necroscopy. Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
18 samples analysed, AAA (n=5), no AAA (n=7), saline (n=6). AAA - abdominal aortic aneurysm
