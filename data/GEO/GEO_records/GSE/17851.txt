TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of STAT6 target genes in IL-4 treated human cord blood CD4+ cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
STAT6 is a major transcription factor driving the polarization of Th2 cells in response to cytokine IL-4. Here we have analyzed on a genome wide level the STAT6 mediated gene expression after IL-4 induction in naive human CD4+ T cells. RNAi mediated STAT6 knockdown was used to reveal the genes specifically regulated by STAT6.

DESIGN
Total RNA from STAT6 siRNA treated cord blood CD4+ T cells 12, 24, 48 or 72 hours after culturing the cells in activating (antiCD3+antiCD28) plus or minus IL-4 conditions was compared to total RNA from nonspecific control siRNA treated cells. All together 18 samples were analyzed and 3 biological replicates of the culture were performed for a total of 54 samples.
