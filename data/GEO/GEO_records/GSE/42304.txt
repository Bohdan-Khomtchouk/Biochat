TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus of Sim1-Cre specific DNMT3a deletion mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus (PVH) of WT and Sim1-Cre specific DNMT3a deletion mice. Results provide important information about genes regulated by DNMT3a.

DESIGN
For the gene expression profiling, total RNA was extracted from PVH of WT and Sim1-Cre specific DNMT3a deletion mice (C57BL6 background) at 6 weeks old using Qiagen RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) and Phase Lock Gel (5 Prime Inc., Gaitherburg, MD). To make sure reproducibility and biological significance, triple hybridizations were performed for each genotype with the RNA from 3 indipendent PVH samples, each sample contains RNA from 5 animals. Genomics and Microarray Core Facility at UTSW ( http://microarray.swmed.edu/ ) checked RNA quality with Bioanalyzer Chip and processed the samples for hybridization with Illumina Mouse-6 V2 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). We used GeneSpring GX (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) for data analysis.
