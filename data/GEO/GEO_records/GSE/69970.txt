TITLE
Transcriptome of mouse preimplantation development [Rlim KO]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to establish a roadmap of XCI and compare the transcriptomes of WT and Rlim KO embryos during X chromosome inactivation. Methods: mRNA profiles of 175 preimplantation embryos WT and KO for Rlim were elucidated by RNA-seq at various stages. Trophoblasts isolated from blastocyst outgrowths were also included. The sequence reads that samples where gender could be determined and that passed quality filters were analyzed at the level of autosomes, X xhromosomes as well as single genes. Results: Using single cell RNA-seq technology on 175 whole preimplantation embryos, we obtained about 2.95 million sequence reads per sample. Reads were normalized to autosomal gene expression. Gender of each embryo was determined by expression of Y-linked genes and Xist. Data analysis showed normal expression profiles of marker genes for epiblast and trophoblast cell types during preimplantation development. Comparing Xist expression profiles in embryos WT and KO shows that Rlim is not required for initiation of Xist transcription but for upregulation of Xist expression. Moreover, our results identify two waves of XCI during preimplantation development: One that occurs at Morula stages that is Rlim-independent and one at blastocyst stages that in dependent on Rlim. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed mouse preimplantation transcriptome. Our results show that Rlim is required for a second wave of imprinted XCI that occurs in female embryos at blastocyst stages.
