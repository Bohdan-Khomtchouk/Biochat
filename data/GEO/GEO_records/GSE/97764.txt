TITLE
The microprotein Minion controls cell fusion and muscle formation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These findings establish minion as a novel microprotein required for muscle development, and define a two-component program for the induction of mammalian cell fusion.

DESIGN
RNAseq of muscle samples before and after cardiotoxin injury
