TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of PpABI1 disruptants

ORGANISM
Physcomitrella patens

SUMMARY
To investigate the disruption effect of Group A PP2C on global gene expression in Physcomitrella patens, we performed microarray analysis of wildtype plant and PpABI1 disruptants using a custom Physcomitrella oligonucleotide microarray, which carries probes for 33,942 gene models of Physcomitrella genome version 1.1. on a 4 x 44 K Agilent platform.

DESIGN
Gene expression in wildtype plant and ppabi1 disruptants were measured at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours after exposure to 10 μM ABA.  Three biologically independent experiments were performed at 0 hour. Also to discover the early ABA-responsive genes, gene expression in wildtype was measured at 0 and 3 hours after exposure to 1 μM ABA.
