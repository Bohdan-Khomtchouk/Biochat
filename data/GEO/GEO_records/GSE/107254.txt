TITLE
MAPK pathway activation abrogates CCR7-mediated migration and prolongs survival to trap dendritic cells in LCH lesions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patient  lesion and control sorted cells were used, treatment with different inhibitors for MAPK pathways for desired amount of time and then was sorted for CD207 and was used for RNA followed by Cdna amplification and was subjected for gene expression analysis using Affy Chips

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis from inhibitor treated and sorted LCH lesion cells to understand how the treatment can change gene regulation

PLATFORM
GPL17586 [HTA-2_0] Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 [transcript (gene) version]
