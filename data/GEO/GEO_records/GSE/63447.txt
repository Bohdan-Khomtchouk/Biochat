TITLE
mRNA expression of brain endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
To investigate the mRNA expression after extracellular vesicles or miRNA treatement, global gene expression analysis was performed in endothelial cells after the transfection of N.C. or miR-181c and or after the addition of extracellular vesicles from cancer cells.

DESIGN
mRNA expression in brain endothelial cells was collected from negative control or miR-181c treatment and or after the addition of extracellular vesicles from MDA-MB-231-D3H1, MDA-MB-231-D3H2LN, BMD2a and BMD2b breast cancer cell lines.
