TITLE
MogR regulon in response to temperature and growth condition

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
Microarray analyses comparing the transcriptional profile of wild-type EGDe relative to ∆mogR (L. monocytogenes) during growth at 37˚C and RT in BHI broth and during intracellular growth inside J774 host cells at 37˚C. These analyses revealed that MogR primarily functions to repress flagellar motility genes during growth at 37˚C. Keywords: EGDe vs ∆mogR, Temperature, Growth condition
