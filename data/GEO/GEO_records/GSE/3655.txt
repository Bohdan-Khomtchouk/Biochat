TITLE
MogR regulon in response to temperature and growth condition

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
Microarray analyses comparing the transcriptional profile of wild-type EGDe relative to ∆mogR (L. monocytogenes) during growth at 37˚C and RT in BHI broth and during intracellular growth inside J774 host cells at 37˚C. These analyses revealed that MogR primarily functions to repress flagellar motility genes during growth at 37˚C. Keywords: EGDe vs ∆mogR, Temperature, Growth condition

DESIGN
Oligonucleotide spotted arrays obtained from the Pathogen Functional Genomic Resource Center at TIGR were used for competitive hybridization studies comparing the transcriptional profile of wild-type EGDe to ∆mogR (L. monocytogenes). A minimum of two technical replicates with associated dye swaps was performed for each growth condition. 14 samples were analyzed, comprising 9 biological replicates; dye swaps were performed for 6 of the biological replicates.
