TITLE
Drosophila CNS mitochondrial DNA dysfunction microarray

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential components of the respiratory chain and loss of mtDNA leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is an essential component of mtDNA replication and a regulator of mitochondrial copy number in cells. Studies have shown that TFAM knockdown leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and respiratory chain deficiencies.  ATP synthase is Complex V of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is driven by a proton gradient between the intermembrane space and the mitochondrial matrix and generates the majority of cellular ATP. The knockdown of coupling factor 6 (Cf6), one of the components of the proton channel F0, causes dysfunction in the complex, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and respiratory chain deficiencies. Using gene expression analysis, we aimed to investigate the effects of mtDNA dysfunction in the CNS at the molecular level.

DESIGN
RNA was purified from the late third instar larval CNS from control larvae, or larvae over-expressing mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) in post-mitotic neurons using the neuron specific driver nsyb-Gal4. Three replicates are included for each condition.
