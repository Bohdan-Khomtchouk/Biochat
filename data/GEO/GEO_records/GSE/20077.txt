TITLE
Aberrantly microRNA profiling in cancerous hepatocytes versus normal primary hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs is a rapidly expanding area expected to change the way in which diseases will be diagnosed, treated and monitored in the future. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) shows a rising incidence with high mortality but lack of effective targeted therapies. We identified the aberrantly expressed miRNAs involved in HCC through the comparison of miRNA expression profiling in cancerous hepatocytes with that in normal primary human hepatocytes and found 37 dysregulated miRNAs in HCC. There were 9 up-regulated miRNAs and 28 down-regulated miRNAs in HCC, of which, miR-221 and miR-99b were the most overexpressed miRNAs, while miR-375, miR-192, miR-146b-5p, miR-885-5p, miR-122* and miR-122 were noted for their greatest changes of decreased expression.  These aberrantly expressed miRNAs may provide insights into pathogenesis of HCC and thus may be used for diagnosis and therapy.

DESIGN
Over the past few years, though several studies have uncovered aberrant miRNA expression profiles in HCC compared with matched nonmalignant tissues, the overlap of deregulated miRNAs from different platforms is limited. To solve this problem, we recommend a method that using primary cancer cells or cancer cell lines and nonmalignant primary cells to identify the specific aberrantly miRNA expression profiles in HCC and even in other types of cancer. Here, we identified the aberrantly expressed miRNAs involved in hepatoma through the comparison of miRNA expression profiling in cancerous hepatocytes with that in normal primary human hepatocytes and 37 dysregulated miRNAs were screened out by 2-fold change with a significant difference (P < 0.05). Clustering analysis based on 13 miRNAs whose fold changes were over 15-fold change exhibited significantly differential expression pattern between the cancerous and normal hepatocytes.
