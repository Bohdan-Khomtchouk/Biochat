TITLE
Fission yeast Jmj2 reverses histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We compared the genomic localization of H3K4me3 in wild type and jmj2- S. pombe. Keywords: mutant vs wild-type

DESIGN
The ChIP-on-chip experiments were implemented as a reference design including a dye reversal. Additional statistical power is added by the fact that the all experimental spots on the array platform are printed in duplicate.
