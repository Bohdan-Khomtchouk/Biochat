TITLE
Effects of irradiation on mouse lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total lung RNA from 3 mouse strains after 18Gy thoracic irradiation. Thoracic cavity radiotherapy is limited by the development of alveolitis and fibrosis in susceptible patients.  To define the response to 18 Gy pulmonary irradiation in mice, at the expression level, and to identify pathways which may influence the alveolitis and fibrosis phenotypes expression profiling was completed.  Male mice of three strains, A/J (late alveolitis response), C3H/HeJ (C3H, early alveolitis response) and C57BL/6J (B6, fibrosis response) were exposed to thoracic radiation, euthanised when moribund and lung tissue gene expression was assessed with microarrays.
