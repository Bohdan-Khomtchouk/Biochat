TITLE
Differential DNA methylation profiles in estrogen-pre-exposed breast epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study tried to determine whether exposure of breast stem/progenitor cells to estrogen disrupts the epigenome of progeny epithelial cells.  DNA methylation profiles were compared between control and pre-exposed epithelial cells using a genome-wide detection method called MeDIP-chip. Keywords: MeDIP-chip

DESIGN
Breast stem/progenitor cells were continuously exposed to 17beta-estradiol (E2, 70 nM) or DMSO (vehicle control) for two weeks and then placed on 2-dimensional collagen substratum for 2-3 weeks for epithelial cell differentiation. DNA from control and pre-exposed cells were extracted and MeDIP ssays were performed using antibodies against 5-methylcytosine. The immunoprecipitated and input DNA were used to probe the Agilent human CpG island microarray. Dye-swap experiments were also performed.
