TITLE
Gene expression analysis of pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts and control fibroblasts To identify signaling pathways important in tumor-stromal cell interactions, we performed gene expression profiling on pancreatic cancer associated fibroblast cultures and control fibroblast cultures using Affymetrix Exon arrays.

DESIGN
We analyzed 3 control fibroblast cultures and 9 pancreatic cancer associated fibroblast cultures using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST platform.  Gene expression levels were compared using Partek (version 6.3beta).

PLATFORM
