TITLE
The functional  study of zebrafish Bad gene

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of zebrafish embryo comparing wild type untreated embryos with embryos injected with morpholino of zf-bad. This assay is used for determination of expression profiling at 24 hpf and 48 hpf under Bad deficiency.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild type vs. MO-Bad treated cells. Biological replicates: each group contains 200 embryos.

PLATFORM
GPL6457 Agilent-019161 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray (V2) G2519F (Feature Number version)
