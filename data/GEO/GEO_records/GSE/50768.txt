TITLE
Mapping the inter- and intra-chromosomal interactions of specific insulator binding sites with circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) assay (Gondor et al., 2008 Nature Protocol) [NimbleGen Array data]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila Insulator proteins mediate long-range chromosomal interactions. ChIP-seq revealed that binding of insulator proteins to some specific DNA sites was regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in S2 cells. Three insulator sites regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation were used as baits to map their distant interacting sites using 4C assay in control S2 cells.

DESIGN
Mapping the chromosomal interactions of three specific insulator binding sites with 4C assay in control S2 cells.
