TITLE
Early-onset sporadic rectal cancer : Wnt- vs. Wnt+ rectal tumor [GE]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of early-onset sporadic rectal adenocarcinoma, comparing Wnt- and Wnt+ rectal tumor. Goal was to determine differentially expressed genes between them based on global gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Wnt- vs. Wnt+ rectal tumors. Wnt- tumors: 28, Wnt+ tumors: 23.
