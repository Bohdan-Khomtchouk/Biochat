TITLE
Expression data from intact and ventilation-preconditioned murine lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the effects of previous exposure to mechanical ventilation may modify the development of Ventilator-induced lung injury, preconditioning was induced by low-pressure ventilation for 90 minutes. After 1 week, intact (sham) and preconditioned mice were sacrificed, the lungs extracted and gene expression measured in order to identify differences responsible for the observed tolerance to ventilator-induced lung injury observed in preconditioned animals.

DESIGN
6 samples were analyzed, from 3 intact (sham) and 3 preconditioned CD1 mice.
