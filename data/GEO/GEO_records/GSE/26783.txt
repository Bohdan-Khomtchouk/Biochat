TITLE
Mast cell microRNAs regulated by KIT signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Objective is to identify microRNAs regulated by KIT signaling in mast cells.  miRNA profiles of murine bone marrow derived mast cells with and without SCF treatment were compared.  In addition, miRNA profiles of the P815 mutant KIT cell line with and without the KIT inhibitor, imatinib, were compared.  We identified miRNAs that were differentially regulated by KIT signals.

DESIGN
Two systems were used to identify microRNAs regulated by KIT.  RNA was collected from primary murine bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMC) treated and not treated with KIT ligand (SCF).  In addition, RNA was harvested from the P815 (activating KIT mutation positive) cell line treated and not treated with the KIT inhibitor, imatinib. Samples were harvested after 24 hours of treatment
