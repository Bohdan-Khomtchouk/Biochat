TITLE
Mast cell microRNAs regulated by KIT signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective is to identify microRNAs regulated by KIT signaling in mast cells.  miRNA profiles of murine bone marrow derived mast cells with and without SCF treatment were compared.  In addition, miRNA profiles of the P815 mutant KIT cell line with and without the KIT inhibitor, imatinib, were compared.  We identified miRNAs that were differentially regulated by KIT signals.
