TITLE
Primary cancer cell culture: mammary-optimized versus conditional-reprogramming [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Experiments used RNAseq data to compare transcriptomes of primary cells from different genetic backgrounds cultured under EpiCult and CRC conditions to each other and to allografts grown from these primary cells in nude mice

DESIGN
Paired-end mRNA-seq with WT, Esr1 over-expressing (CERM, tetracycline-operator(tet-op)-Esr1MMTV-rtTA), CYP19A1 over-expressing (AROM, tet-op-CYP19A1MMTV-rtTA) and Brca1 KO  (BRCA, Brca1fl11/fl11/MMTV-Cre/p53+/- ) mice
