TITLE
Gene expression analysis during reprogramming with sequential infecion of Oct4/Klf4/cMyc/Sox2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further understand the mechanism of reprogramming, the mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were infected with Oct4, Klf4, c-Myc and Sox2 with special sequence. 1) Oct4 and Klf4 containing retrovirus was delivered on day 0. 2) Oct4, Klf4 and c-Myc were delivered on Day 1.5. 3) c-Myc and Sox-2 were deivered on Day 3. 4) Sox2 were delivered on Day 4.5. 5) Vitamin C containging medium were used from Day 6. The gene expression of Day 0 (MEF), Day 1.5, Day 3, Day 4.5 and Day 6 were analyzed with micro array to indentify the possible underlying mechanism. Especially the factors related to MET/EMT, cell cycle and epigenetic were focused.

DESIGN
MEF cells were subjected for reprogramming with special protoocl: 1) Oct4 and Klf4 containing retrovirus were delivered on day 0. 2) Oct4, Klf4 and c-Myc were delivered on Day 1.5. 3) c-Myc and Sox-2 were deivered on Day 3. 4) Sox2 were delivered on Day 4.5. 5) Vitamin C containging medium were used from Day 6. RNA on Day 0 (MEF), Day 1.5, Day 3, Day 4.5 and Day 6 were collected for analysis.
