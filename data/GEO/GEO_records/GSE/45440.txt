TITLE
Transcription factor–mediated reprogramming of fibroblasts to expandable, myelinogenic oligodendrocyte progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cell-based therapies for myelin disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and leukodystrophies, require technologies to generate functional oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.  Here we describe direct conversion of mouse embryonic and lung fibroblasts to ‘induced’ oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (iOPCs) using sets of either eight or three defined transcription factors.  iOPCs exhibit a bipolar morphologyical and global gene expression profile molecular features consistent with bona fide OPCs.  They can be expanded in vitro for at least five passages while retaining the ability to differentiate into induced multiprocessed oligodendrocytes.  When transplanted to hypomyelinated mice, iOPCs are capable of ensheathing host axons and generating compact myelinmyelinating axons both in vitro and in vivo.  Lineage conversion of somatic cells to expandable iOPCs provides a strategy to study the molecular control of oligodendrocyte lineage identity and may facilitate neurological disease modeling and autologous remyelinating therapies.

DESIGN
6 total samples were analyzed.  MEFs were either untreated or infected with inducible lentiviral vectors containing the open reading frames of transcription factors.  Samples were compared to bona fide OPCs.
