TITLE
Expression data from WT and transgenic plants overexpressing cold-induced transcription factors

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Our goal in this study is to understand the regulation mechanism of genes including CBF regulon in low temperature. We addressed these issues by overexpressing the transcription factors encoded by genes that are rapidly induced in parallel with the CBF genes.  The results show that the low temperature regulatory network is highly interconneted.

DESIGN
Global gene expression profile of the transgenic plants overexpressing TFs was compared with that of WT plants

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
