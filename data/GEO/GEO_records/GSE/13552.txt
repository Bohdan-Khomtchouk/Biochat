TITLE
Gene expression changes in Jhdm2a knock-out skeletal muscle as compared to wild-type.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression changes in mouse skeletal muscle were assessed in wild-type and Jhdm2a null skeletal muscle in an effort to define the role of Jhdm2a in energy expenditure and metabolism.

DESIGN
RNA prepared from the skeletal muscle of 3 wild-type mice was combined, amplified, labeled, and hybridized to an Affymetrix 430 2 microarray.  RNA was similarly prepared from the skeletal muscle of 3 Jhdm2a null mice and hybridized to an Affymetrix 430 2 microarray.
