TITLE
The G-patch protein NF-κB-repressing factor mediates the recruitment of the exonuclease XRN2 and activation of the RNA helicase DHX15 in human ribosome biogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In eukaryotes, the synthesis of ribosomal subunits, which involves the maturation of the ribosomal (r)RNAs and assembly of ribosomal proteins, requires the co-ordinated action of a plethora of ribosome biogenesis factors. Many of these cofactors remain to be characterized in human cells. Here, we demonstrate that the human G-patch protein NF-κB-repressing factor (NKRF) forms a pre-ribosomal subcomplex with the DEAH-box helicase DHX15 and the 5’-3’ exonuclease XRN2. Using UV crosslinking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC), we reveal that NKRF binds to the transcribed spacer regions of the pre-rRNA transcript. Consistent with this, we find that depletion of NKRF, XRN2 or DHX15 impairs an early pre-rRNA cleavage step (A’). The catalytic activity of DHX15, which we demonstrate is stimulated by NKRF functioning as a cofactor, is required for efficient A’ cleavage, suggesting that a structural remodelling event may facilitate processing at this site. In addition, we show that depletion of NKRF or XRN2 also leads to the accumulation of excised pre-rRNA spacer fragments and that NKRF is essential for recruitment of the exonuclease to nucleolar pre-ribosomal complexes. Our findings therefore reveal a novel pre-ribosomal subcomplex that plays distinct roles in the processing of pre-rRNAs and the turnover of excised spacer fragments.

DESIGN
HEK293 cell lines expressing Flag-His-tagged NKRF or the Flag-His tag alone were crosslinked (UV - 254 nm; PAR - 365 nm after growth in media containing 4-thiouridine) and analyzed by CRAC.
