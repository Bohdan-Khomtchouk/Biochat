TITLE
lncRNA expression of CRC liver metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to identify lncRNAs involved in the pathology of colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastasis and investigate their underlying mechanisms. A total of 439 miRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed between 7 primary CRC tissues with liver metastases and 8 CRC tissues without liver metastases from 15 patients by Arraystar lncRNA microarrays

DESIGN
7 CRC with liver metastasis and 8 CRC without liver metastasis were subjected to microarray to select differentially expressed lncRNAs

PLATFORM
GPL16956 Agilent-045997 Arraystar human lncRNA microarray V3 (Probe Name Version)
