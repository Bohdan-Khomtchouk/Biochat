TITLE
1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3 induces expression of CCR10 and other genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human naive T cells from peripheral blood were cultured in 24 wells coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence or absence of retinoid acid, IL-12, and 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3.  The T cells were FACS-sorted based on expression of CD3, integrin alpha4beta7, cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) and chemokine receptor 10.  This serie includes microarray data from stimulated T cells under indicated conditions. Keywords: Human T cell, vitamin D and A, chemokine receptor, nuclear receptor

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from these sorted T cells using Invitrogen RNeasy mini-kit.  The quality of RNA was prechecked by Agilent BioAnalyzer.  Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized, and transcribed into Biotin-labeled cRNA, which was fragmented before hybridization.  All the procedure was performed in the Stanford University PAN facility.
