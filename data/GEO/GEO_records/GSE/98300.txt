TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptional and epigenomic map of primary and metastatic Sonic Hedgehog subgroup medulloblastomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report findings that illuminate a dynamic metastasis pathway in the common pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma.

DESIGN
We examined binding states of H3K27ac and ATOH1 in primary and metastatic medulloblastoma driven by ATOH1 in collaboration with aberrant Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling.
