TITLE
Expression data from the hearts of a mouse model of spontaneous myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice with homozygous null mutations in the HDL receptor (SR-BI) and apoE genes (SR-BI KO/apoE double KO (dKO) mice) spontaneously develop occlusive, atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) and die prematurely (50% mortality at 42 days of age) on standard chow diet feeding. Microarray analysis was performed to investigate the changes in gene expression profiles during the development of spontaneous severe CAD, which includes myocardial infarction and heart failure. These data will provide new insights in understanding the pathophysiology of CAD.

DESIGN
The whole Hearts from dKO or SR-BI+/- apoE-/- (HET) mice (n=9-12) were harvested at 21, 31 and 43 days of age, and analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays. dKO mice do not show detectable signs of CAD at 21 days of age, small myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure at 31 days of age, and extensive MI and severe heart failure at 43 days of age (50% mortality at 42 days of age). Each mouse was assigned to one array. SR-BI+/- apoE-/- mice (HET) which do not develop detectable signs of CAD on chow diet were used as controls.The data also include those from probucol treated dKO and HET mice (n=2-8).
