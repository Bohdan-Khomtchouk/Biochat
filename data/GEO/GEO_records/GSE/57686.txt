TITLE
Gene expression in murine pancreatic tumor tissues in response to the blockade of macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF1R) signal

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of responses induced upon the blockade of CSF1R signaling at the gene expression level. Hypothesis of this study was that CSF1R signal blockade alters the local immune responses in a murine pancreatic tumor model. Results provide important information on changes in the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from whole mouse pancreatic tumor tissues after vehicle or CSF1Ri treatment for 8 days

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
