TITLE
The role of Foxp1/4 in lung development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Foxp1/4 transcription factors are conserved transcriptional repressors expressed in overlapping patterns during lung development as well as in the adult lung. However, the role of Foxp1/4 in development and homeostasis of the pseudostratified epithelium of the proximal airways and trachea is unknown. We propose to determine the roles for Foxp1/4 in lung development by deleting these genes in lung epithelial specific knockout mice.

DESIGN
To explore the genome wide consequences of Foxp1/4 deficiency on secretory epithelial differentiation in the lung, we performed microarray analysis of Shh- cre control and Foxp1/4ShhcreDKO mutants lungs at E14.5, 3 embryos, respectively.
