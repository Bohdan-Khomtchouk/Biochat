TITLE
ENCODE Transcript Mapping for Total RNA from Human NB4 Cells untreated, treated with RA, and treated with TPA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcript Mapping on Affymetrix ENCODE arrays for Total RNA from 4 different samples (2 or 3 technical replicates of each). All of the four same NB4 samples have also been treated with Retanoic Acid (RA) (2 or 3 technical replicates of each). Three of the four same NB4 samples have also been treated with TPA (2 or 3 technical replicates of each). RA treated NB4 cells can be partially differentiated to Neutrophils and TPA treated NB4 cells can be differentiated to Monocytes. Keywords = Transcript Mapping, Human, Affymetrix, Genome Tiling Arrays Keywords: parallel sample
