TITLE
Histone H2A^4-20

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Total RNA from three replicate cultures of wild-type and mutant strains was isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays. Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by histone H2A^4-20 mutant. Keywords: histone H2A mutant, repeat
