ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate gene expression profiling in intact human prostate tissue xenografts in mice, following the addition or subtraction of androgens.

DESIGN
58 prostate samples were implanted into castrated or testosterone-treated mice for 5 different lengths of time. Samples were compared to a control pool created by combining day zero tissue samples from all patients
