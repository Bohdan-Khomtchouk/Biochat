TITLE
Lon Protease Promotes Survival of Escherichia coli During Anaerobic Glucose Starvation

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
In Escherichia coli, Lon is an ATP-dependent protease which degrades misfolded proteins and certain rapidly-degraded regulatory proteins. Given that oxidatively damaged proteins are generally degraded rather than repaired, we anticipated that Lon deficient cells would exhibit decreased viability during aerobic, but not anaerobic, carbon starvation.  We found that the opposite actually occurs.  Wild-type and Lon deficient cells survived equally well under aerobic conditions, but Lon deficient cells died more rapidly than the wild-type under anaerobiosis.  Microarray analysis revealed that genes of the Clp family of ATP-dependent proteases were induced during aerobic growth but not during anaerobic growth.  Thus, Clp may compensate for loss of Lon when cells are in an oxygen containing atmosphere.  Under anaerobic carbon starvation conditions, Lon must be active to support survival. Keywords: Other
