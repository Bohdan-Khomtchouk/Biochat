TITLE
Expression data of thermally eluted RNA from human primary fibroblasts with non-targeting or GLD4 siRNA treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a screen for downregulated genes in poly(U) chromatography upon GLD4 knockdown, we identified carbohydrate metabolism genes were affected including a glucose transporter, GLUT1

DESIGN
human primary fibroblasts are treated with non-targeting siRNA or siGLD4. RNAs were subjected to poly(U) chromatography and eluted at 65C. Differentially expressed genes were identified using illumina microarray.
