TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of trehalose-responsive gene expression in control or JNCL human fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes in gene expression induced by trehalose administration in fibroblasts derived from JNCL patients and control fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from control or JNCL fibroblasts treated with 100 mM of trehalose for 4 days was compared to untreated control or JNCL fibroblasts. Experiments were performed in triplicates. The microarray analysis was performed at The Microarray Core Lab, UTHSC, under the supervision of Dr David S. Loose and Tuan M. Tran.
