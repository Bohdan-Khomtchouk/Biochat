TITLE
High Mobility Group Box Protein 1 is Dispensable for Autophagy and Mitochondrial Quality Control in Vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of livers with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Hmgb1 was compared to control livers with floxed Hmgb1 Hmgb1-deleted livers (from mice expressing Albumin-Cre and floxed Hmgb1) and control liver (mice expressing only floxed Hmgb1) Whole liver from 8 week old mice was used. Both groups are littermates, and have been backcrossed to C57Bl/6 five times.

DESIGN
Gene expression of mouse hepatic stellate cells was characterized A. Livers from mice with Albumin-Cre-mediated deletion of Hmgb1  (n=4). B. Livers from mice carrying Hmgb1 floxed alleles (n=4).
