TITLE
Expression profiles of mouse NK cell subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It is known that NK cells are a heterogeneous population of functionally distinct NK cell subsets. Here we report on different genomic, phenotypic and functional properties of four murine NK cell subsets distinguished by CD117 (c-kit), CD27 and CD11b expression.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in NK cell subsets freshly sorted from murine C57Bl/6 splenocytes. Two to three different batches were analysed.
