TITLE
Expression data from rhesus macaque tongue epithelium

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
A majority of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have inadequate access to antiretroviral therapy and ultimately develop debilitating oral infections that often correlate with disease progression.  Our study evaluates the potential of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected rhesus macaques to serve as a non-human primate model for oral manifestations of HIV disease. Microarrays were used to characterize changes in gene expression in the dorsal tongue epithelium that occur during chronic SIV infection.

DESIGN
Epithelial cells were laser microdissected from dorsal tongue tissue sections from healthy uninfected macaques and macaques with chronic stage SIV infection and used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
