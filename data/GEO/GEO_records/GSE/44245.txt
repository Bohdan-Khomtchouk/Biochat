TITLE
Expression data from human lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Baseline gene expression of human lymphocytes 24 hours after 5 Gy gamma irradiation We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of human lymphocytes after irradiation

DESIGN
Compare the gloable gene expression of human lymphocyte 24 hours after exposure to doses between 0 and 5 Gy Î³ rays
