TITLE
Time dependent salicylate treatment effect on human embryonic kidney cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293 cells treated with salicylate. 50 mM final concentration of sodium salicylate was treated to HEK293 cells, and their mRNA expression perturbation was observed time-dependent manner.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HEK293 cells was compared after salicylate treatment (30 min and 60 min).
