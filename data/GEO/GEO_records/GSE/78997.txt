TITLE
LET-dependent change in rice gene expression profile after heavy-ion beam irradiation [time]

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Linear energy transfer (LET) is an important factor affecting several aspects of the irradiation effect, e.g. cell survival and mutation frequency, making the heavy-ion beam an effective mutagen. To study the mechanisms behind LET-dependent effects, expression profiling was performed after heavy-ion beam irradiation of imbibed rice seeds. Array-based experiments at three time points (0.5, 1, 2 h after the irradiation) revealed that the number of up- or down-regulated genes was highest 2 h after irradiation. Array-based experiments with four different LETs at 2 h after irradiation identified LET-independent regulated genes that were up/down-regulated regardless of the value of LET; LET-dependently regulated genes, whose expression level increased with the rise of LET value, were also identified.

DESIGN
Oryza sativa L. 'Nipponbare' seeds were imbibed for 3 days. The seeds were irradiated with 22.5 or 50 keV/Î¼m C-ion at a dose of 15 Gy. Gene expressions of irradiated and unirradiated embryos were measured at 0.5, 1, and 2 hours after irradiation. Three independent experiments were performed at each time and LET.
