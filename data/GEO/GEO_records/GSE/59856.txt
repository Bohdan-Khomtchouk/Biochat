TITLE
MicroRNA markers for the diagnosis of pancreatic and biliary tract cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs from serum samples could detect pancreatic and biliary tract cancer patients more accurately than other traditional markers.

DESIGN
Prospective miRNA markers for pancreatic/biliary tract cancer were selected in the training cohort. Using these miRNAs, discriminant analysis was performed, and the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated in the test cohort.
