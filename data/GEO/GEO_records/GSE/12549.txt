TITLE
Expression data in Arabidopsis rdr2-1 and ddc (drm1-1drm2-2cmt3-11) mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We applied the tiling arrays to study the Arabidopsis whole-genome transcriptome in Arabidopsis rdr2-1 and ddc mutants. Keywords: untreated condition

DESIGN
The total RNA was prepared from 15-day-old Arabidopsis plants (wild type (WT), rdr2-1 and ddc) and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each strand array were carried out using the independent biological RNA samples.
