TITLE
DNA Methylation Patterns Associated with Fatigue in Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation profiles from patients with Sjögren's syndrome with high versus low fatigue levels using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip array. Background  Chronic fatigue is a common, disabling, and poorly understood phenomenon. Recent studies indicate that epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in the expression of fatigue, a prominent feature of primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether DNA methylation profiles of whole blood are associated with fatigue in patients with pSS.  Methods  48 pSS patients with high (n=24) or low (n=24) fatigue as measured by a visual analogue scale were included. Genome-wide DNA methylation was investigated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array.

DESIGN
Case-case study including Sjögren's patients with high fatigue (n=24) and patients with low fatigue levels (n=24)
