TITLE
Functional characterization of Taf4b in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Expression analysis was performed with two TDNA insertion mutants of taf4b i.e; taf4bprm (TDNA insertion in promoter region) and taf4bint (TDNA insertion in intronic region), Taf4b overexpression lines, taf4bprmcpr5 double mutant lines (Double mutant was generated by crossing taf4bprm with cpr5) and Col-0 in normal condition as well as with taf4bprm mutant and Col-0 infected with fungi AB (Alternaria brassicicola) and bacteria ES4 (Pseudomonas syringae pv.maculicola ES4326 ) in different perspectives. Affymatrix expression analysis was executed to provide mechanistic details of regulation of genes by Taf4b in plants.

DESIGN
The RNA of taf4b mutants (taf4bprm and taf4bint), Taf4b overexpression lines, taf4bprmcpr5 double mutant and Col-0 were isolated in normal and infected condition.The ATH1 gene chips were used for expression analysis.
