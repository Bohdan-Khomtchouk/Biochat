TITLE
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation microarray data from antiHA IP in stable LNCaP cells expressing either YFP or HA-SOX4/YFP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX4 is a critical developmental transcription factor in vertebrates and is required for   precise differentiation and proliferation in multiple tissues.  In addition, SOX4 is   overexpressed in many human malignancies, but the precise role of SOX4 in cancer   progression is not well understood.  Here we have identified the direct transcriptional   targets of SOX4 using a genome-wide localization ChIP-chip analysis. Keywords: ChIP-chip
