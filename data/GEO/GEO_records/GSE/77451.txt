TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of Drosophila clock and non-clock neurons reveals neuron-specific cycling and novel candidate neuropeptides

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
LNd, LNv, DN1 and TH neurons were manually sorted from dissociated Drosophila brains.  RNA was extracted and transcriptomes analyzed via RNA-seq.

DESIGN
LNd, LNv, DN1 and TH neurons at various timepoints.
