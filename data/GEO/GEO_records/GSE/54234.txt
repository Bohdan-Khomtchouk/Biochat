TITLE
CDH1 knockout in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Employing Cre/loxP technology, a mouse model of liver specific Cdh1 (E-cadherin) depletion was created (fl/fl | +/wt). Previously, the mice had already been compared to littermates with normal Ecadherin levels (fl/fl | wt/wt), using a broad range of laboratory methods (Serum parameters, long-term weight analysis, histology, western blot, etc.). To analyze the effect of Cdh1 (E-Cadherin) depletion on the liver homeostasis on the RNA-level over the course of 3 time-points, liver tissue was aquired from mice groups aged 1 week, 3 weeks and 6 weeks.

DESIGN
Mice with liver-specific Cdh1 depletion were compared to wildtype-like littermates. 1 week: n=2+2; 3 weeks: n=3+3; 6 weeks: n=3+3. Samples (mice) were not paired.
