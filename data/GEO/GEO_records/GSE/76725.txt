TITLE
Gene expresssion changes associated to diet induced fatty liver in hamster

ORGANISM
Mesocricetus auratus

SUMMARY
Our aim was to study the gene expression changes associated to the development of non hepatic steatohepatitis from simple steatosis in a model of diet induced obesity in hamster (mesocricetus auratus)

DESIGN
10 golden hamsters (mesocricetus auratus) were fed a standard diet (STD) and 10 more a high fat diet (HFD). For gene expresion analysis, RNA from STD were pooled and gene expression changes of each HFD was evaluated againts the STD pool.
