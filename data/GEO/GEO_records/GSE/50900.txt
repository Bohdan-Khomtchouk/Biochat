TITLE
Gene profiling of the zone of altered morphology of choriodecidua overlying the cervix before labor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the molecular signature of the choriodecidua remodeling in late pregnancy befour labour, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes that sign for fetal membranes remodeling. Fetal membranes were collected from healthy women, after an uncomplicated pregnancy, undergoing a planned cesarean delivery at term, for feto-pelvic disproportion or scarred uterus. During surgery, a Kocher's forceps was placed on membranes overlying the cervix and the swelling area surrounding the forceps was dissected in the operating room under sterile conditions, the site, pinched by the forceps, being discarded. Fetal membranes in a remote zone were also sampled. Isolated RNAs were hybridized to the Aligent SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray. Two independent bio-analyses singularize  a signature in the zone of altered morphology for Graft vs Host Disease and leukocyte activation, arguing for a focal loss of maternal-fetal tolerance. This was further confirmed by flow cytometry, electron microscopy, and immuhistochemistry analyses.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was conducted on three distinct groups of three paired sets of zone of altered morphology and intact morphology from nine pregnant women in total. These women were delivered at term by cesarean sectionfor feto-pelvic disproportion or scarred uterus, after an uncomplicated pregnancy.
