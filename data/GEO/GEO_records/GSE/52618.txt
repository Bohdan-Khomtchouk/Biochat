TITLE
Expression profiling of long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs in uterine leiomyoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global protein coding gene and miRNA expression profiling studies in uterine leiomyoma showed their aberrant expression and involvement in the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyoma. But the global expression patterns and potential clinical value of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in uterine leiomyoma have not been explored.In this study, we performed lncRNA expression profiles analysis of uterine leiomyoma using microarray(Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v2.0) to evaluate the genome-wide expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs and their potential role in the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyoma.

DESIGN
Expression profiling analysis of the 15 samples including 5 large fibroids, 5 small fibroids and 5 matched myometrium by Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v2.0.

PLATFORM
GPL15314 Arraystar Human LncRNA microarray V2.0 (Agilent_033010 Probe Name version)
