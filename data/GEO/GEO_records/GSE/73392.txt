TITLE
Expression data from Wild type and SIRT6 konckout Hematopoietic stem cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression is tightly regulated in Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).  SIRT6 play a important role in HSCs function. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in SIRT6 KO HSC

DESIGN
SIRT6 knockout HSC and Wild type HSC were selected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
