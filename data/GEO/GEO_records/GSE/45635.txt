TITLE
Expression Profiles of HepG2 cells treated with Cyclosporin A and solvent control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptomics changes induced in the human liver cell line HepG2 by Cyclosporin A after treatment for 12h, 24h, 48h and 72h

DESIGN
The study investigated differential gene expression in HepG2 cell line mRNA following 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours of exposure to Cyclosporin A and solvent. Three biological replicates per compound/solvent. In total 36 arrays.
