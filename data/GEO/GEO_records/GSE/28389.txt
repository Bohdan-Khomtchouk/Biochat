TITLE
[E-MTAB-368] Transcription profiling by array of mouse embryos at 8 different stages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of mouse development The experiment were perfomed as a part of our Vertebrate Evo-Devo project. The aim of the project is to compare transcription profiles of normal (unmanipulated, wild-type, whole embryo) vertebrate embryos.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from wild type C57BL/6 mice, whole embryos at 8 different stages (Stages:E7.5, E8.5, E9.5, E10.5, E12.5, E14.5, E16.5, E18.5), and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. All the stages contains data from 2 to 3 biological replications. Each staged-samples consists of pooled total RNA from several whole embryos.
