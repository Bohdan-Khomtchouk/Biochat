SUMMARY
Purpose:  This study uses a high-throughput glycan microarray to profile anti-glycan immune responses to whole-cell vaccines: GVAX Pancreas, K562-GM and H1299. The aim was to indentify anti-glycan antibody responses relevent to patient clinical outcomes Results:  Immune responses to non-human antigens bovine fetuin and alpha-Gal antigens were identified induced by GVAX Pancreas. The magnitude of these responses inversely correlate with patient survival. The non-human antigens were likely incorporated from cell media used for vaccine production. Their presence distracted immune system, resulting in decreased immune response to vaccine antigens. Conclusion: This study highlighted the importance of anti-glycan immune response in vaccine development. Whole-cell vaccinesderived from human cell lines could incorporate non-human antigens from cell media. These xeno-antigens may have negative impact on the vaccine efficacy.
