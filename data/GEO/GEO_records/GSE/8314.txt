TITLE
Characterization of weight loss and weight regain mechanisms after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most effective therapy for morbid obesity, but it has a ~20% failure rate. We used our established RYGB model in diet-induced obese (DIO) Sprague-Dawley rats, which reproduces human bi-phasic body weight (BW) loss pattern, to determine mechanisms contributing to success (RGYB-S) or failed (RYGB-F) RYGB. DIO rats were randomized to RYGB, sham operated Obese, and sham operated obese pair fed-linked to RYGB (PF) groups. BW, caloric intake (CI) and fecal output (FO) were recorded daily for 90 days, food efficiency (FE) was calculated, and morphologic changes were determined. Gut, adipose and thyroid hormones were measured in plasma. Mitochondrial respiratory complexes in skeletal muscle, expression of energy-related hypothalamic and fat peptides, receptors and enzymes were quantified. A 25% failure rate occurred. RYGB-S, RYGB-F and PF rats vs. Obese showed rapid BW decrease, followed by sustained BW loss in RYGB-S. RYGB-F and PF gradually increased BW. Expression profiling of both CNS (hypothalamus) and peripheral tissues (subcutaneous abdominal fat) strongly supported the involvement of a number of metabolic and feeding-related genes in the differential outcomes.
