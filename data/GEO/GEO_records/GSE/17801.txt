ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 = ATCC 700819

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of C. jejuni HPC5 grown in anaerobic jar supplemented with air mix and in Modular Atmospheric Controlled System (MAC). C. jejuni HPC5 is a Campylobacter strain isolated from broiler chickens. Majority of the Campylobacter strains are cultured in an atmosphere containing 5-10% (v/v) oxygen or 5% hydrogen and 5-10% (v/v) carbon dioxide and the rest with nitrogen. To set up a jar (3.5L, Oxoid) to the required microaerophilic conditions, a vacuum is created to -22 psi and then air mixture of 85% v/v nitrogen, 10% v/v carbon dioxide and 5% v/v hydrogen (Air Products, Crewe, UK) is introduced into the jar. This resulted in a microaerobic atmosphere containing approximately 5.6% oxygen, 3.6% hydrogen, 7.3% carbon dioxide and 83% nitrogen. The Modular Atmospheric Controlled System (MAC; Don Whitely Scientific) is an anaerobic chamber where air mixture of 85% nitrogen, 10% carbon dioxide and 5% oxygen is used for growing Campylobacter. Differences in growth pattern were observed when Campylobacters were grown in it and transcriptomic analysis was done to prove the difference in the regulation of genes in the two conditions.
