TITLE
Gene profiling in CBA and BL/6 bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of baseline gene expression in bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from female CBA/J  (CBA) and C57BL/6 (BL/6) mice.  Results provide insight into strain-dependent differences in gene expression.

DESIGN
CBA and BL/6 BMDCs prepared from individual mice were plated in replicate at 1x10^6 cells/ml in 48-well tissue culture plates (BD Falcon). Replicates were pooled after 4hr and total RNA was obtained by Trizol® (Invitrogen) extraction according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
