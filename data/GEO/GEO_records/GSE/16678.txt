TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from differentiation of human Cyt49 ESCs into definitive endoderm in feeder-free conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pluripotent hESCs can differentiate into the three primary embryonic lineages (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm) as well as extraembryonic tissues.  Definitive endoderm is the first step into the pathway to endoderm dreived tissues (pancreas, liver, gut, lung). We used microarrays to detail the changes in microRNA expression during the transition from pluripotent hESCs into definitive endoderm.

DESIGN
hESCs (Cyt49) were differentiated in the presence of Activin A and Wnt3A under low serum conditions to induce DE formation.  Samples were collected at day 0 (2 samples), day 2 (3 samples) and day 4 (3 samples).
