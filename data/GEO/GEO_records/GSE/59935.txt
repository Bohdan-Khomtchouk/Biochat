TITLE
Hypoxia-related Transcription factor ChIP-Seq data in T47D breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the comprehensive genome-wide binding peaks for key factors inovled in oxygen sensing pathways, such as HIF1α, HIF1β and EglN2. In addition, we also report the genome-wide binding peaks for NRF1 in breast cancer cells

DESIGN
We conducted HA-EglN2, HIF1α, HIF1β (ARNT) or NRF1 ChIP-Seq in the T47D cell line that overexpresses HA-EglN2 in the presence of hypoxia (1%) and DMOG treatment. T47D parental cells  treated with the same condition followed by  HA ChIP-seq served as the control to filter non-specific binding.
