TITLE
Expression data from SKOV/ip-Fumock- or SKOV/ip-FuEP2/Ex2-derived tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We intraperitoneally injected SKOV3 (derived from human ovarian adenocarcinoma) expressing soluble fragment of human EP2 receptor or hIgG Fc (SKOV/ip-FuEP2/Ex2 and (SKOV/ip-Fumock). After 4 week, resulted tumors were lysed and total RNAs were isolated. By using microarray, We analyzed gene expression and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes in SKOV/ip-FuEP2/Ex2-derived tumor.

DESIGN
Tumor tissues from SKOV/ip-Fumock or SKOV/ip-FuEP2/Ex2 were lysed and total RNAs were extracted. And then we analyzed expression status by Affymetrix microarrays.
