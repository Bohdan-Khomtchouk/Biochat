TITLE
Diverse Non-Genetic Allele Specific Expression Effects Shape Genetic Architecture at the Cellular Level in the Mammalian Brain [Primate Parents]

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
Genotype parent macaques. This allows us to distinguish maternal and paternal expression in the transicriptomes from the offspring. This also allows us to create a transcriptome index  for each daughter that reflects the possible heterozygous SNPs  wiith IUPAC codes.  This then allows for an alignment that is not biased towords the maternally or paternally expressed reads.

DESIGN
Whole genome sequencing
