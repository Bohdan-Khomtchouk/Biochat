TITLE
Comprehensive expression analyses of neural cell type-specific miRNAs  identify new determinants of the specification and maintenance of neuronal phenotypes.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed microarray profiling of miRNA expression across the four principal cell types of the central nervous system: neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, isolated from rat cortex. Our microarray results showed that the four cell types differ extensively in their miRNA expression. Over one third of the 351 miRNAs examined had higher than 5-fold differences in expression between two of the four cell types. As expected, cell types of common developmental origin differed least in their miRNA expression profiles (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), while neurons and microglia showed more unique miRNA expression profiles. 63 miRNAs showed cell type specific enrichment (39 miRNAs) or depletion (24 miRNAs) when comparing the four cell types using criteria of a minimum 5-fold difference in expression in one cell type compared to the average expression in the other three and minimum 2-fold change compared to each of the other three types individually and a false positive rate (FDR) p value lower than 0.01. When comparing only neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes 115 miRNAs were specifically enriched (89 miRNAs) or depleted (36 miRNAs) in one cell type.

DESIGN
Genome-wide profiling comparing miRNA expression between mature neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. Three to four biological replicates per cell type were analyzed.
