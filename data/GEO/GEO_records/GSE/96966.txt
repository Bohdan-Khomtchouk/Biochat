TITLE
RNA-seq analysis comparing normal mouse melanocyte stem cells to the melanoma tumor derived from them upon Braf:Pten mutations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that mouse melanocyte stem cells give rise to melanoma whose signatures highly mimicks human melanoma

DESIGN
Melanocyte stem cells with Braf:Pten mutations were isolated from mouse back skin and transplanted into nude mice to form tumor. The tumor cells were harvested and compared with the non-transformed melanocyte stem cells for RNA-seq analysis

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
