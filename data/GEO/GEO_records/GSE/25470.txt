TITLE
Adipose Tissue MicroRNAs as Regulators of CCL2 Production in Human Obesity [miRNA data]

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We used an unbiased systems biology approach to study the regulation of gene expression in human adipose tissue focusing on inflammation. We show that microRNAs play a major role as regulators of CCL2 production in obesity.
