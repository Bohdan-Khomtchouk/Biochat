TITLE
Adipose Tissue MicroRNAs as Regulators of CCL2 Production in Human Obesity [miRNA data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used an unbiased systems biology approach to study the regulation of gene expression in human adipose tissue focusing on inflammation. We show that microRNAs play a major role as regulators of CCL2 production in obesity.

DESIGN
Abdominal subcutaneous adipose needle biopsies were obtained from women (n=56) with a wide variation in BMI. From the biopsies, total RNA was isolated and labelled using the FlashTag biotin HSR labeling kit (Genisphere Inc., Hatfield, PA) according to the supplier's protocol. The labelled samples were placed in a hybridization cocktail mix containing 4% formamide and hybridised overnight to Affymetrix miRNA Arrays (Affymetrix Inc.) following the indicated Genisphere protocol. The arrays were washed, stained and scanned in an Affymetrix GCS 3000 scanner. Signal intensities and present calls were generated by using the microRNA QC tool by Affymetrix.
