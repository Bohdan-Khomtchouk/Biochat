TITLE
Conserved Molecular Program for Root Development in Diverse Plants

ORGANISM
Cucumis sativus

SUMMARY
We define genome-wide temporal expression patterns of root development genes in seven vascular plants, enabling a detailed comparative analysis of the molecular development of a single organ across diverse species.

DESIGN
Measuring mRNA expression of the root development zones in 7 vascular plants.  Each measurement includes 3 biological replicates.
