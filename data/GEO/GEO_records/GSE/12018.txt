TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Carbonyl Sulfide Neurotoxicity

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the pathogenesis of carbonyl sulfide induced neurotoxicity, we examined the gene expression profile of exposed rats before the onset of morphological changes (days 1 and 2) using the most consistently affected brain region, the posterior colliculus.
