TITLE
DUAL RNASeq ANALYSIS REVEALS AN INCREASE OF FUNGAL PATHOGENICITY FUNCTIONS AND A ROLE OF PLANT GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE IN NITROGEN-INDUCED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THE RICE BLAST FUNGUS

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa ; Magnaporthe oryzae

SUMMARY
In order to understand the mechanisms of Nitrogen induced susceptibility (NIS) weâ€™ve conducted a dual RNAseq experiment on rice infected tissues by Magnaporthe oryzae. At 0 day post inoculation and 2 days post inoculation tissues have been collected on mock inoculated and M. oryzae inoculated plants. Rice were conducted under two type of nitrogen fertilization: 0N all fertilization but nitrogen, 1N all fertilization and NH4NO3. The fertilization was applied one day before inoculation. RNAseq was conducted both on rice and fungal RNA.

DESIGN
shoot tissus mRNA 28-day old rice plant were generated by deep sequencing. Three samples per conditions, Four conditions: 0N Mock, 0N Inoc, 1N Mock, 1N Inoc. 0N = plant fertilized one day before inoculation without nitrogen. 1N = plant fertilized one day before inoculation with NH4NO3. Mock = Plant inoculated with control solution (gelatin 0,5%). Inoc = Plant inoculated with Magnaporthe oryzae isolate Guy11 with gelatin 0,5%.
