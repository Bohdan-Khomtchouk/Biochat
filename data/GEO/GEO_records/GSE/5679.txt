TITLE
Comparative gene expression profile of PPARg and RARa ligand treated human dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our data indicated that activation of the PPARg nuclear receptor induces a retinoid response in human dendritic cells. In order to assess the contribution of retinoid signaling to the PPARg response we decided to use a combination of pharmacological activators and inhibitors of these pathways. Cells were treated with the synthetic PPARg ligand rosiglitazone (RSG), or with RSG along with the RARa antagonist (AGN193109) to block RARa mediated gene expression, or the RARa specific agonists (AM580) alone.  This design allows one to determine if retinoid signaling is a downstream event of PPARg activation and what portion of PPARg regulated genes are regulated via induced retinoid signaling. Keywords: ligand response
