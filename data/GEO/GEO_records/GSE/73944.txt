TITLE
Expression analysis of WT and COMP KO peritoneal macrophages elicited by thioglycollate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in COMP KO macrophages compared with WT macrophages.

DESIGN
A two-chip study used mRNA extracted from peritoneal macrophages pooled from 6 WT and COMP KO mice individually. In each array, 44,170 genes were probed. To identify differentially expressed genes, we performed a Fold Change filtering between the two compared arrays. The threshold is Fold Change > = 2.0.

PLATFORM
GPL15887 NimbleGen Mouse gene expression array [100718_MM9_EXP] (gene-level version)
