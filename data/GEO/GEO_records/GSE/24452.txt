TITLE
Genetic abnormalities in various cell subpopulations of GBM brain tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GBM is a heterogenous tumor. Based on membrane protein expression, the GBM single cell dissociates were seperated into different subfractions by FACS assay. The genomic aberration among each populations were compared by analysis of CGH data.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA were extracted from sorted cell population and CGH assay were performed to compare the similarity genomic abnormality among different cell groups.
