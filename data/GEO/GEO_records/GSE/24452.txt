TITLE
Genetic abnormalities in various cell subpopulations of GBM brain tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GBM is a heterogenous tumor. Based on membrane protein expression, the GBM single cell dissociates were seperated into different subfractions by FACS assay. The genomic aberration among each populations were compared by analysis of CGH data.
