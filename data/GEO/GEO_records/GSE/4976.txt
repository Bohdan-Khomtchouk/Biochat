TITLE
Sex and line specific gene expression and alternative splicing in Drosophila revealed

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Many multi-exon genes are subject to alternative splicing, which is thought to increase phenotypic complexity by allowing a single locus to produce multiple functionally distinct proteins.  However, genetic and developmental variation in alternative splicing has never been examined systematically.  We therefore undertook a genome-wide analysis of sex- and genotypic-specific splicing in Drosophila in conjunction with sex- and line-specific transcription. Keywords: microarray, sexual dimorphism, alternative splicing, genetical genomics, genetic variation
