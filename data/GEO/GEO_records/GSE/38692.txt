TITLE
ASXL1 Knock Down in Normal CD34+ Cord Blood and UKE1 Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of Normal CD34+ Cord Blood and UKE1 cell lines treated with hairpins targeting ASXL1.

DESIGN
Two independent studies where 1) CD34+ cord blood from normal donors were treated with either A) GFP Vector or B) ASXL1 specific short hairpin and 2) UKE1 cell lines treated with either A) GFP Vector or B) ASXL1 specific short hairpin.
