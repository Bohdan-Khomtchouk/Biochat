TITLE
Transcriptome changes in Streptococcus agalactiae due to deletion of both the CiaR and LiaR Transcriptional Regulators

ORGANISM
Streptococcus agalactiae

SUMMARY
The CiaRH and LiaFSR two-component regulatory systems in Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) are essential mediators of the organism s response to biologically important sources of environmental stress, and positive regulators of GBS virulence. Transcriptional profiling of CiaR mutant GBS and LiaR mutant GBS reveals that LiaR is positively-regulated by CiaR, and the individual mutant transcriptomes share a number of commonly-regulated genes.  To determine the GBS response to loss of both of these key regulatory systems, we constructed a GBS mutant strain with non-polar deletions in both ciaR and liaR, and performed transcriptional profiling using DNA microarray analysis, comparing wild-type GBS to CiaR/LiaR double mutant GBS under non-stressed conditions.

DESIGN
Two separate RNA samples were extracted for each condition.  One flip-dye replicate (2 hybridizations) was obtained for each pair of RNA samples for 4 hybridizations total.

PLATFORM
GPL7691 Streptococcus agalactiae pan microarray (GBS_2603_A909_515_4reps)
