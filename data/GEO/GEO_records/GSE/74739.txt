TITLE
A conserved factor Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2 triggers premature transcription termination and nucleates heterochromatin to promote gene silencing [sRNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Co-transcriptional RNA processing and surveillance factors mediate heterochromatin formation in fission yeast. In addition to RNAi, RNA elimination machinery including MTREC (Mtl1-Red1 core) and the exosome are involved in facultative heterochromatin assembly, however, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that RNA elimination factors cooperate with the conserved exoribonuclease Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2, which couples pre-mRNA 3’-end processing to transcription termination, to promote premature termination and facultative heterochromatin formation at meiotic genes. Dhp1 also affects termination of transcripts at genes that are targets of RNAi-mediated heterochromatin assembly. Moreover, Dhp1 facilitates constitutive heterochromatin formation and silencing at centromeric and mating-type loci. Remarkably, we find that Dhp1 interacts with the Clr4/Suv39h methyltransferase complex and acts directly to nucleate heterochromatin. Our results uncover a novel role for 3’-end processing and termination machinery in gene silencing through premature termination and suggest that non-canonical termination by Dhp1 and RNA elimination factors is linked to heterochromatin assembly. These findings have important implications for understanding mechanisms of gene silencing in higher eukaryotes.
