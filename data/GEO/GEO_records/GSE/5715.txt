TITLE
Intestinal Phenotype of Variable Weight Cystic Fibrosis Knockout Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr) knockout mice present the clinical features of low body weight and intestinal disease permitting an assessment of the interrelatedness of these phenotypes in a controlled environment.  To identify intestinal alterations which affect body weight in CF mice the histological phenotypes of crypt-villus axis height, goblet cell hyperplasia, and mast cell infiltrate were measured, cardiac blood samples assessed, and gene expression profiling of the ileum was completed for 12 week old (C57BL/6xBALB) F2 Cftrtm1UNC and non-CF mice presenting a range of body weight.  Crypt-villus axis height decreased with increasing weight in CF, but not control, mice.  Goblet cell hyperplasia and mast cell infiltration in the submucosa and muscularis externa layers of the CF intestine, were identified to be independent of bodyweight.  Blood triglyceride levels were found to be significantly lower in CF mice than control mice (p = 3.02 x 10-5) but were not dependent on CF mouse body weight.  By expression profiling, genes of DNA replication and lipid metabolism were among those altered in CF mice relative to non-CF controls; and no differences in gene expression were measured between samples from CF mice in the 25th and 75th percentile for weight.  This study indicates that the absence of Cftr leads to altered morphology in the CF intestine the extent of which is correlated with body weight in CF mice while CF related changes in blood triglyceride levels and in the intestinal gene expression profile were not dependent on body weight in this model.
