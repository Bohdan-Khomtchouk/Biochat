TITLE
Aberrant expression of Fra-2 promotes CCR4 expression and cell proliferation in adult T-cell leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The 4　Fra2-targeting siRNA and 4 control-siRNA samples were used for analysis. Keywords: siRNA

DESIGN
A microarray procedure was performed according to the Affymetrix protocols (Santa Clara, CA). In brief, total RNA extracted from the tumor samples was analyzed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) and cRNA was synthesized with the GeneChip® 3’-Amplification Reagents One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix). The labeled cRNAs were then purified and used for probes. Hybridization was performed on the Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133 Plus2.0 array for 16 hours at 45 ºC. Signal intensity was measured by a GeneChip®Scanner3000 (Affymetrix) and converted to numerical data with GeneChip Operating Software, Ver.1 (Affymetrix).
