TITLE
Androgen repsonsive microRNAs in LNCaP cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goals of this study were to evaluate changes in microRNA expression following androgen treatment.

DESIGN
Four treatment groups were studied:  untreated and those treated with 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 nM of synthetic androgen (R1881).  Data is relative to the untreated sample.
