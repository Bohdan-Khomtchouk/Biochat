TITLE
microRNA expression profiling in TPC1 cell line treated with the RTK inhibitor RPI-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We treated the papillary thyroid carcinoma-derived cell line TPC1 with the RTK inhibitor RPI-1 to obtain a thyroid carcinoma cell model. The RET tyrosine kinase is a target of the inhibitor. microRNA expression changes were evaluated comparing cells treated with the inhibitor fo 24 hours versus cells treated with DMSO for 24 hours.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates for RPI-1 and DMSO treated cells were generated by independent treatments and total RNA extractions. One sample from each class did not pass quality control, and thus was discarded. The final dataset comprises two samples for each class.
