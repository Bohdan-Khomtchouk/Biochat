TITLE
Gene expression biomarkers discovery for the Sini Decoction Pattern

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to investigate the syndrome of Sini decoction pattern. The Sini decoction was first mentioned in Shang Han Za Bing Lun, then was developed into Sini decoction pattern (SDP) by Sun Simiaoâ€™s Qian Jin Yi Fang. The syndromes of SDP were correlated with various extremely Yang deficiency related symptoms, but there does not exist common definition.

DESIGN
Loop design, one kind of statistical microarray experimental design, was utilized to construct an optimal design. The basic principles of good design: balance among the factors, approximately equal sampling of varieties, and minimizing the distance between pairs of varieties. Samples from twenty four individuals were hybridized on 48 arrays based on the two loop designs that are presented in Figure 1.Individuals of sample L1A1, L1A2, L1A3, L1C1, L1C2, L1C3, L2A1, L2A2, L2A3, L2C1, L2C2 and L2C3 are diagnosed as SDP, and individuals of sample L1B1, L1B2, L1B3, L1D1, L1D2, L1D3, L2B1, L2B2, L2B3, L2D1, L2D2, and L2D3 are diagnosed as non-SDP. Each arrow indicates a microarray hybridization experiment. The arrow heads and tails represent samples labeled with Cy5(-3DNA Capture Reagent) and Cy3(-3DNA Capture Reagent) respectively. We used twelve individuals in Loop 1 experiments as the training set and the other twelve individuals in Loop 2 experiments as the test set.
