TITLE
Gene expression profile of BAFF-stimulated B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to illucidate how BAFF mediates B cell survival and growth through the identification of BAFF-regulated genes. Keywords: cell stimulation

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from unstimulated B cells ( " minus " ) or after 36 hours of treatment with 25 ng/ml of BAFF ( " plus " ). A fraction of cell lysate was used for extraction of total RNA (samples Total_minus and Total_plus). The rest of the cell lysate was used for polysome purification as described (Patke et. al., 2006; samples Polysome_minus and Polysome_plus)
