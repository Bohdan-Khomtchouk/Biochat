TITLE
Gene expression breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There exists a common deletion polymorphism on the genetic loci of APOBEC3B and this polymorphism exist in ~37% of East Asians and ~7% of Europeans. Germline APOBEC3B deletion has bee27233495n shown to confer modest risk to breast cancer in both East Asian women and women of European descent We performed expression profiling by array to investigate the significantly differentially expressed genes and enriched gene sets in APOBEC3B-null vs. APOBEC3B breast cancers

DESIGN
This series represents RNA isolated from 28 primary breast cancer patients and 3 normal breast tissues. We aim to investigate the distinguish features between APOBEC3B-null and APOBEC3B breast cancers to identify significantly differentially expressed genes and enriched gene sets
