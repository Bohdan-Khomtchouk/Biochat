TITLE
Elf18-induced long noncoding RNA associates with Mediator to enhance expression of innate immune response genes in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant immune response is a complex process involving both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. Here, we identify an Arabidopsis long-noncoding (lnc) RNA, designated elf18-induced long noncoding RNA 1 (ELENA1), as a factor enhancing resistance against Pseudomonas syringe pv. tomato DC3000. ELENA1 knock-down plants show a decreased expression of PR1 and the plants are susceptible to pathogens. By contrast, plants over-expressing ELENA1 show elevated Pathogenesis-Related gene 1 (PR1) expression after elf18 treatment and display pathogen resistance phenotype. RNA-seq analysis of ELENA1 overexpressing plants after elf18 treatment confirms increased expression of defense-related genes compared to WT. ELENA1 directly interacts with Mediator subunit 19a (MED19a) and affects enrichment of MED19a on PR1 promoter. These results show that ELENA1 is a novel lncRNA that regulates PR1 expression through MED19a. Our findings uncover an additional layer of complexity implicating lncRNA in the transcriptional regulation of plant innate immunity.

DESIGN
To investigate the role of ELENA1 in regulating immune response, we performed strand-specific RNA-seq (ssRNA-seq) on WT and ELENA1 OX plants grown under normal (0 h) and elf18-treated conditions (1 h, 6 h and 12 h). For each condition we used three biological replicates.
