TITLE
Comparative cistromics reveals genomic crosstalk between FOXA1 and ERα in tamoxifen-associated endometrial carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tamoxifen, which is used to treat breast cancer, increases the risks of endometrial cancer. In this study, we performed a genome-wide assessment of ERα-chromatin interactions in surgical specimens obtained from patients with tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer. ERα was found at active enhancers in endometrial cancer cells as marked by the presence of RNA polymerase II and the histone marker H3K27Ac. Our results define conserved sites for genomic interplay between FOXA1 and ERα in breast cancer and tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer.

DESIGN
Binding sites were mapped of Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERa) and FOXA1 in five tamoxifen-associated endometrial carcinoma's (tumor A, tumor B, tumor C tumor D and tumor E). Biological replicated were produced for tumor B.
