TITLE
A MEIG1/PACRG complex in the manchette is essential for building the sperm flagella

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Meig1-deficient mice show male germ cell development defect after they are 28 days old. To understand if the phenotype was caused by altered gene expression due to MEIG1 deficiency, total testicular RNA was isolated from 22 day old and  28 day old wild type and Meig1-deficient mice, microarray was conducted and gene expression was compared between wld-type and Meig1-deficient mice at the two time points.

DESIGN
Total testicular RNA was extracted from 22 day or 28 day old wild-type and Meig1-deficient mice, and gene expression was compared between wild-type and Meig1-deficient mice at the two time points.
