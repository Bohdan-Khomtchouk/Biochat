TITLE
Expression analysis of Phytophthora infestans isolates 06_3928A and NL07434 during potato infection 2-4 days post-inoculation

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The expression of genes in P. infestans isolates 06_3928A and NL07434 was monitored from 2 to 4 days time course of a potato infection. Genes encoding known and putative effector proteins were found induced at two and/or three days post-inoculation.
