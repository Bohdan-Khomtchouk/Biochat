TITLE
Expression analysis of Phytophthora infestans isolates 06_3928A and NL07434 during potato infection 2-4 days post-inoculation

ORGANISM
Phytophthora infestans

SUMMARY
The expression of genes in P. infestans isolates 06_3928A and NL07434 was monitored from 2 to 4 days time course of a potato infection. Genes encoding known and putative effector proteins were found induced at two and/or three days post-inoculation.

DESIGN
We used a custom chip GPL8093 from Roche Nimblegenâ€™s proprietary Maskless Array Synthesis (MAS) technology uses digital light processing and rapid, high-yield photochemistry to synthesize long oligo, high-density DNA microarrays with extreme flexibility. Each GPL8093 chip measures the expression level of 18155 genes from Phytophthora infestans with 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene. Total RNA samples recovered from mycelia in two medias (rye sucrose agar and V8 agar) and infected potato leaves from a time couse infection (2, 3 and 4 days post incoulation). Experiments included two biological repllicates from each sample. We carried out total RNA extractions (mycelia and potato infected material) for two P. infestans isolates 06_3928A and NL07434. cDNA synthesis was performed Nimblegen.
