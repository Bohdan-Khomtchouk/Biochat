TITLE
Systematic identification of genes involved in embyonic chicken muscle development

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The genetic closeness and divergent muscle growth rates of broilers and layers make them great models for myogenesis study. In order to discover the molecular mechanisms determining the divergent muscle growth rates and muscle fiber sizes in different chicken lines, we systematically identified differentially expressed genes between broilers and layers during muscle development (embyonic day 10, 12, 14 and 18) by microarray hybridization experiment.

DESIGN
Time-course studies of two different intra-species breeds

PLATFORM
GPL10234 Affymetrix Chicken Genome Array [GgChicken_ENTREZG10]
