TITLE
Airway Epithelial Gene Expression Diagnostic for the Evaluation of Smokers with Suspect Lung Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA was obtained from histologically normal bronchial epithelium of smokers during time of clinical bronchoscopy from relatively accessible airway tissue. Gene expression data from smokers with lung cancer was compared with samples from smokers without lung cancer. This allowed us to generate a diagnostic gene expression profile that could distinguish the two classes. This profile could provide additional clinical benefit in diagnosing cancer amongst smokers with suspect lung cancer. Keywords: Disease state analysis
