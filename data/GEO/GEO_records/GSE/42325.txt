TITLE
Expression data from in vitro derived dendritic cells generated in the presence of FLT3-L from wt and miR-142-/- BM cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
2 types of dendritic cells (DCs) can be generated in vitro in the presence of Flt3-L: CD4+ equivalent CD24- DCs and CD8+ equivalent CD24+ DCs. miR-142-/- mice show a severe defect in the generation of CD4+ equivalent CD24- DCs. To understand the underlying mechanism, RNA expression was analyzed by Affymetrix microarray from the 2 in vitro subtypes of DCs derived from miR-142+/+ and miR-142-/- bone marrow cells. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in the presence or absence of miR-142 in in vitro derived DCs.

DESIGN
Bone marrow cells from miR-142+/+ and miR-142-/- C57Bl/6 mice were isolated and incubated in the presence of Flt3-L for 8 days. in vitro derived wt and ko dendritic cells were devided into CD4+ and CD8+ equivalent DCs by FACS and sorted with a FACS-Aria. RNA was isolated and gene expression was investigated
