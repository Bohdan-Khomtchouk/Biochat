TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells in asthmatics with and without depression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine whether asthma with depression is characterized by unique pathophysiological pathways by analyzing the global gene expression patterns of CD4+ lymphocytes from asthmatics with or without depression.

DESIGN
Four groups of subjects (non-depressive asthmatics, depressive asthmatics, depression patients, and healthy controls) consisting of 6 participants in each group were studied. Peripheral CD4+ 4 lymphocytes were isolated and the global transcriptomic profiles were defined by using the Agilent SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray.
