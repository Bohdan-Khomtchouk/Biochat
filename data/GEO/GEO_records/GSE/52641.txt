TITLE
Genomic profiling of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma by array-based comparative genomic hybridization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated CNAs of 4 tumor samples from 2 patients, including conventioanl chromophobe renal cell carcinoma(ChRCC), ChRCC with neuroendocrine differentiation and no-tumor region by 44k oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH).

DESIGN
2 cases of ChRCC(NOS) vs ChRCC with neuroendocrine differentiation

PLATFORM
GPL8841 Agilent-014950 Human Genome CGH Microarray 4x44K (Probe Name version)
