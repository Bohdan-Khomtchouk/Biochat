TITLE
Genes regulated by Sox2 in colorectal cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Knockdown of Sox2 in SW620 colorectal cancer cells decrease their growth rates in vitro and in vivo in xenograft models. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in Sox2 Knockdown sw620 cells compared with mock knockdown sw620 cells

DESIGN
Sox2 knockdown sw620 cells and and mock knockdown sw620 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 cell culture media for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the genes regulated by Sox2 in colorectal cell lines and end (T4) of gastrulation.
