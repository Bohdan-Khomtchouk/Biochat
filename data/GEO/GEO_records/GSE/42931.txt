TITLE
Knockdown of CDKN1C (p57kip2) and PHLDA2 results in developmental changes in bovine pre-implantation embryos

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome of CDKN1C-siRNA-injected embryos were compared to sham-injected embryos using RNA-sequencing to determine the genes and pathways downstream of the silenced gene that may have been altered.

DESIGN
Transcriptome comparison between two pools of embryos (i.e. CDKN1C-siRNA-injected vs sham-injected embryos)

PLATFORM
GPL15749 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Bos taurus)
