TITLE
Change expression of genes in iron chelation and deficient conditions

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Firstly, cell senescence and anti-oxidant genes were down-regulated by iron deficient mice and iron-specific chelator deferoxamine (DFO) using a DNA microarray. Our data suggested that down-regulation of anti-oxidant genes and cell senescence gene induced oxidative stress in iron-deficient and -specific chelated condition.

DESIGN
FAO cells (rat liver cell lines) were untreated or treated with iron chelator, DFO for 24 h (n=3, respectively). Mice in the CTL (n=6) and ID groups (n=6) were fed AIN-93G diet with or without iron for 4 weeks. Rat liver cells and FAO cells were extracted total RNA and hybridization on Agilent microarrays.
