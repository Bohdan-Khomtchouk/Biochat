TITLE
Expression analysis of Saos-2 p53-null cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our compound (PRIMA) selectively kills tumor cells expressing mutant p53. Here in our study we decided to investigate the impact of our compound on the transcriptome of Saos2 cells lacking p53.

DESIGN
We plated Saos-2 cells, and treated them with our compound for 6h or 12h. We then harvested the cells, extracted the RNA, and followed the protocol to run affymetrix array to analyse the impact of our drug on the whole transcriptome of cells lacking p53.
