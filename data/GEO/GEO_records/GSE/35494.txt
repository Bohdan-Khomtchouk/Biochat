SUMMARY
Obscurins (~70-870kDa), encoded by the single OBSCN gene, are cytoskeletal proteins originally identified in striated muscles with structural and regulatory roles.  Recently, analysis of 13,023 genes in breast and colorectal cancers identified OBSCN as one of the most frequently mutated genes, implicating it in cancer formation.  Herein, we studied the expression profile of obscurins in breast, colon and skin cancer cell lines, and their involvement in cell survival.  Immunoblot analysis demonstrated significant reduction of obscurins in cancer cells, resulting from decreased mRNA levels and/or the presence of mutant transcripts.  In normal epithelium, obscurins localize in cytoplasmic puncta, the cell membrane and the nucleus.  Accordingly, subcellular fractionation demonstrated the presence of two novel nuclear isoforms of ~110 and ~120kDa.  Non-tumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cells stably transduced with shRNAs targeting giant obscurins exhibited increased viability (~30%) and reduced apoptosis (~20%) following exposure to the DNA damaging agent, etoposide.  cDNA microarrays followed by Gene Ontology profiling indicated a substantial number of transcripts related to apoptosis and survival are differentially regulated upon obscurin knock-down.  Quantitative RT-PCR further indicated that the anti-apoptotic genes BAG-4 and HAX-1 were up-regulated (1.5 and 1.4 fold, respectively), whereas initiator caspase-9 and death caspase-3 transcripts were down-regulated (0.8 and 0.6 fold, respectively).  Our findings are the first to pinpoint critical roles for obscurins in cancer development by contributing to the regulation of cell survival.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: control shRNA- vs. obscurin shRNA-expressing MCF10A cells exposed to 150 uM etoposide. 3 independent replicates per condition.
