TITLE
Serum amyloid and serum amyloid P are not induced in response to diesel exhaust particles or carbon black

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
W evaluated an experimental particle exposure model, including markers of the acute phase system assessed as the hepatic mRNA expression of Sap, the murine homologue of CRP, and Saa1 and Saa3. Keywords: Toxicology, disease state analysis, stress response, nanoparticles, air pollution

DESIGN
12-13 weeks old Apoe knockout mice (C57BL/6-Apoe tm1) mice were injected intraperitoneally with varying doses of SRM 2975. In a parallel experiment C57BL mice were exposed by inhalation for 90 minutes to four consecutive doses of 20mg/m3 of filtered air, NIST 2975 or Ptintex 90. Livers and aortic tissue were collected.
