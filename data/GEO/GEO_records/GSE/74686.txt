TITLE
Expression data of Langerhans cells purified from Il34+/LacZ and Il34LacZ/LacZ mice after UV treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the impact of IL-34 on repopulation of Langerhans cells after inflammation

DESIGN
Langerhans cells were FACS-purified from Il34+/LacZ and Il34LacZ/LacZ mice after UV treatment
