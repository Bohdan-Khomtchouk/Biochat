TITLE
Transcriptional activation without chromatin marking in developmentally regulated genes [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have conducted ChIP-Seq of H3K4me1/H3K27ac in order to perform a comparative study between wing imaginal discs and eye imaginal discs from Drosophila melanogaster.

DESIGN
Examination of two histone modifications associated with gene regulation in wing/eye imaginal discs cells

PLATFORM
GPL9058 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Drosophila melanogaster)
