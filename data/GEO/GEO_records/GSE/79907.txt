TITLE
α7β1 Integrin Regulation of Gene Transcription in Skeletal Muscle Following an Acute Bout of Eccentric Exercise

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to understand the mechanisms behind the contribution of the alpha7BX2 integrin to improvements and growth in skeletal muscle post exercise.  We utilized global gene profiling to identify novel signaling pathways and patterns of gene expression involved in this adaptation process, and found the alpha7BX2 integrin initiates transcription of genes that allow for protection from stress and modulation of protein synthesis.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from frozen gastrocnemius muscles of female mice 3 hours post an acute 40 minute bout of downhill running. Mice that had transgenic overexpression of the alpha7BX2 integrin were compared to wild type mice, and half of each were exercised or left as sedentary controls.  Mice were equally distributed among the four groups, and genes of interest were validated via qPCR using remaining RNA from the female mice, and RNA from equal numbers of male mice.
