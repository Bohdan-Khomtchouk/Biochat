TITLE
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing of heterochromation associated proteins in Tetrahymena

ORGANISM
Tetrahymena thermophila

SUMMARY
In the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena, de novo heterochromatin body formation is accompanied by programmed DNA elimination. We previously reported that dephosphorylation of the HP1-like protein Pdd1p is required for the formation of heterochromatin bodies during the process of programmed DNA elimination in the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena. Here, we show that the heterochromatin body component Jub4p is required for Pdd1p phosphorylation, heterochromatin body formation and DNA elimination. Moreover, our analyses of unphosphorylatable Pdd1p mutants demonstrate that Pdd1p phosphorylation is required for heterochromatin body formation and DNA elimination, while it is dispensable for local heterochromatin assembly. Therefore, both phosphorylation and the following dephosphorylation of Pdd1p are necessary to facilitate the formation of heterochromatin bodies. We suggest that Jub4p-mediated phosphorylation of Pdd1p creates a chromatin environment that is a prerequisite for subsequent heterochromatin body assembly and DNA elimination.

DESIGN
New macronuclei (MACs) of exconjugants were isolated from wild-type and various mutant cells at 12 hpm (hours post-mixing), sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated andprecipitated DNA was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing
