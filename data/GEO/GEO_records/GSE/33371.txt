TITLE
Beta-catenin status effects in human adrenocortical carcinomas (33), adenomas (22), and normal adrenal cortex (10)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We scored adrenocortical carcinomas and adenomas for abnormal beta-catenin staining, and sequenced the beta-catenin gene in some samples. We compared adrenocortincal carcinomas with and without abnormal beta-catenin staining and found many significant expression differences and significant results from enrichment testing. A similar comparison in the adenomas gave relatively few differences, and they did not correlate to differences found for the carcinomas.  Abnormal beta-catenin staining was associated with mitotic rate and poorer patient survival in the carcinomas.  In a second independent data set (given in a supplement) we again found beta-catenin associated with poor survival.  The array data given is the same as GEO series GSE10927, with additional characteristics about beta-catenin, and new patient followup data.  The analysis shown in a supplementary Excel file is also new.

DESIGN
Human samples of 33 adrenocortical carcinomas, 22 adrenocortical adenomas, and 10 normal adrenal cortex samples, each from a different patient, had mRNA assays performed using Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays, with 54675 probe-sets.  23 of the carcinomas were used in survival analysis.  27 additional samples without array data were also used in a survival analysis.
