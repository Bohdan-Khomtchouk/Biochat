TITLE
Recipe for a busy bee: MicroRNAs in honey bee caste determination (microRNA array)

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
Social caste determination in the honey bee is assumed to be determined by the dietary status of the young larvae and translated into physiological and epigenetic changes through nutrient-sensing pathways. We have employed microRNA gene-microarray, and observed that both worker jelly and royal jelly showed dynamic changes in miRNA content during the 4th to 6th day of larval development . Adding specific miRNAs to royal jelly elicited significant changes in queen larval mRNA expression and in morphological characters of the emerging adult queen bee. We propose that miRNAs in the nurse bee secretions constitute an additional element in the regulatory control of caste determination in the honey bee.

DESIGN
We collected worker and royal jelly of the Italian honeybee (ZND No.1, Apis mellifera ligustica) at 73~90 hours (4th-day larvae), 97~114 hours (5th-day larvae), and 121~138 hours (6th-day larvae) after hatching. After total RNA was extractedÂ  and quantified , equal amounts of total RNAs from each of the three sampling days were analyzed on the LC Science miRNA-array to observe the expression variation of miRNAs between worker jelly and royal jelly along with the development time points (4th-day, 5th-day and 6th-day).
