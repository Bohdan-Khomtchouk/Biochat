TITLE
Functionally distinct subsets of lineage-biased multipotent progenitors control blood production in normal and regenerative conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the molecular characterisitics of parallel lineage-biased MPP populations arising from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) we conducted genome-wide analyses of hematopoietic stem, progenitor and mature myeloid cell populations using Affymetrix Gene ST1.0 arrays.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of 3-5 biological replicates of the indicated hematopoietic populations, isolated by FACS sorting from C57BL/6 mouse BM. Immunophenotypic definitions: Long-term HSC (HSCLT) (Lin-/cKit+/Sca1+/Flk2-/CD48-/CD150+); Short-term HSC (HSCST)  (Lin-/cKit+/Sca1+/Flk2-/CD48-/CD150-); MPP2  (Lin-/cKit+/Sca1+/Flk2-/CD48+/CD150+); MPP3  (Lin-/cKit+/Sca1+/Flk2-/CD48+/CD150-); MPP4 (Lin-/cKit+/Sca1+/Flk2+); CMP (Lin-/cKit+/FcγR-/CD34+); GMP (Lin-/cKit+/FcγR+/CD34+); Pre-granulocyte (PreGr) (Mac1+/Gr1int); Granulocyte (Gr) (Mac1+/Gr1hi). HSC and GMP samples listed here were also used as controls for our related microarray study GSE48893.
