TITLE
Diet Induced Obesity Signature in Mouse Liver Tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the murine liver expression traits that were changed in response to diet induced obesity. Keywords: diet induced obesity signature

DESIGN
Liver tissue from five diet induced obesity (DIO) mice were arrayed against a pool of liver tissue from chow-fed wildtype B6 animals.  All samples were hybridized as fluor-reverse pairs, and then the data between the pairs was combined to form a single experiment.  Five repeats were performed to increase the power to detect expression changes and to reduce effects of experimental noise.
