TITLE
LncrRNA and mRNA expression profiling in human esophageal squamous cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LncRNAs are characterized by transcripts more than 200 nucleotides in length with no or limited protein coding potential, emerging as a novel class of vital regulators in recent years. Aberrant lncRNA and mRNA expression has been linked to various human tumors. This study was aimed to identify new aberrant expression  lncRNA and mRNA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and invested the potential functions in this tumor.

DESIGN
lncRNA and mRNA microarray analysis with 5 ESCC and adjacent non-tumor tissues was performed.

PLATFORM
GPL16956 Agilent-045997 Arraystar human lncRNA microarray V3 (Probe Name Version)
