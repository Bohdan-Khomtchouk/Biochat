TITLE
mRNA differential expression in LNCaP cells expressing the wild-type androgen receptor (AR-WT) or the ligand-independent AR-V7 splice variant

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Constitutively active AR variants are truncated proteins lacking the c-terminal region containing the ligand binding domain (LBD) and the activation function 2 (AF-2). The expression of these AR variants in CRPC was also associated with the resistance to novel therapies such as enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate. These variants are also involved in tumor progression.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were transduced with lentival particles for expression of AR-WT or AR-V7 for 72 hours in complete medium containing 10 nM DHT. Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq2500 technology The goal of this experiment was to delineate differential gene expression upon the expression of the AR-V7 in LNCaP cells compared with cells expressing the wild-type AR.
