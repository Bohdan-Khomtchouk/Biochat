TITLE
Microarray gene expression study of cycling vs arrested S. Pombe minimal cells

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
A minimal cell cycle control module is driving the cell cycle in these S. Pombe cells. During the experiment the cells are arrested or released to cycle through  the different phases of the cell cycle.

DESIGN
Samples were collected at the indicated times points from arrested and cycling cells and expression of genes were measured by microarrays on an Affymetrix platform.

PLATFORM
GPL2529 [Yeast_2] Affymetrix Yeast Genome 2.0 Array
