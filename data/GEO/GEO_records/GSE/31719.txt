TITLE
ENCODE SUNY RNA Binding Protein GeneST Data for HeLaS3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA Binding Protein immunoprecipitation study for multiple target proteins in HeLaS3 cell line as part of the ENCODE consortium.  Analyzed data tracks available for view on UCSC Genome browser. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Three sample replicates per sample type.  Total input RNA and Negative target RIP (antibody for bacteriophage coat protein) are provided as controls.  Individual samples reflect biological replicates defined as separate RIP runs (as opposed to technical replicate defined as multiple arrays run with same RIP sample as starting material)

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
