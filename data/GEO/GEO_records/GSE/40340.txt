TITLE
Effect of Beta-Naphthoflavone on Rat Primary Hepatocytes.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study provides an evaluation of changes in gene expression associated with beta-naphthaflavone treatment of rat hepatocytes in vitro. Primary rat hepatocytes were treated for 24 and 48 hours with two doses 1 uM and 100 mM) of beta-naphthaflavone and 1% DMSO vehicle control.  Five replicates of each treatment were performed.  Cells were then extracted and RNA processed for microarray analysis.

DESIGN
This series is part of a SuperSeries in which primary rat hepatocytes were treated with two doses of ten chemical compounds (and corresponding vehicle controls) for 24 and 48 hours.  Each compound/vehicle treatment group was an individual study performed at different times. Each study was analyzed separately and themes common between studies were reported.
