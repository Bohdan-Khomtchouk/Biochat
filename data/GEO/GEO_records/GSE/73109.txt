TITLE
EZH2 and BCL6 cooperate to assemble CBX8-BCOR Polycomb complex to repress bivalent promoters, mediate germinal center formation and promote lymphomagenesis [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EZH2 mediates the humoral immune response and drives lymphomagenesis through de novo formation of bivalent chromatin domains and critical germinal center (GC) B cell promoters.  We show that such formation is dependent on the presense of BCL6 and the presence of non-canonical PRC1-BCOR complex.  We observe that BCL6 and EZH2 cooperate to accelerate diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) development and combinatorial targeting of these repressors results in enhanced anti-lymphoma activity in vitro, in vivo, and in primary human DLBCLs.

DESIGN
DLBCL cell lines treated with BCL6 inhibitor 79-6.1085
