TITLE
Molecular and cellular response profiles induced by the TLR4 agonist-based adjuvant Glucopyranosyl Lipid A

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 agonists are known potent immunostimulatory compounds. These compounds can be formulated as part of novel adjuvants to enhance vaccine medicated immune responses. However, the contribution of the formulation to the innate in vivo activity of TLR4 agonist compounds is not well understood. Molecular expression profiles and cellular responses in a mouse model were used to compare for GLA-SE, GLA, Alum, SE, PBS. This study was to evaluate the mechanism of actions of different adjuvants and to identify potential biomarkers for clinical evaluation.

DESIGN
Muscle, lymphnode, and blood tissues from Balb/c mice were examined after treatments with GLA-SE, GLA, SE and Alum.  A time course study at 0, 6h, day 1, day 2, and day 4 were carried out. ACF Study No.  078-10-007 and Study No.  078-11-008
