TITLE
Genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis of Nr4a1 binding sites in regulatory T (Treg) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have revealed that Nr4a family nuclear orphan receptors broadly regulate a transcriptional program in Treg cells. In this study, to give an insight into Nr4a-mediated regulation of the transcriptional program in Treg cells, we performed ChIP-seq experiment using anti-Nr4a1 antibodies and a chromatin lysate from Treg cells.

DESIGN
Examination of Nr4a1 binding sites in mouse Treg cells.

PLATFORM
