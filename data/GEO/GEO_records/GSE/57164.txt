TITLE
Transcriptome of Dinoroseobacter shibae under changeing light regimes

ORGANISM
Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12 = DSM 16493

SUMMARY
D. shibae was cultivated under changing light regimes and samples for transcriptome and metabolome were taken.

DESIGN
Two independent cultivations in a Chemostat have been performed. Each reactor was run for 3 light/dark-cycles of 12h/12h. Sampling started from the second cycle and continued to the third cycle.

PLATFORM
