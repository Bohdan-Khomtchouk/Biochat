TITLE
Predictive analysis of long non-coding RNA expression profiles in tumor and normal tissues from glioblastoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared lncRNA expression data in tumor tissues from 9 patients and 3 healthy tissues by using an HlncOA 1.0 array. Data show that 185 lncRNAs, including 90 upregulated and 95 downregulated lncRNA transcripts, were significantly dysregulated in glioblastoma tissues. Then, 8 dysregulated lncRNAs were validated in another 50 samples of specimens using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays（qRT-PCR）. We predicted lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks by co-expressing lncRNA and mRNA with altered miRNA. Bioinformatic analysis was used to predict possible pathways in which these networks might be involved. Finally, we analyzed interactions between validated lncRNAs and their potential cancer-related miRNA targets to identify the potential roles of lncRNAs in glioblastomas.

DESIGN
We hypothesized that lncRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of glioblastomas, so we compared lncRNA expression data in tumor tissues from 9 patients and 3 healthy tissues by using an HlncOA 1.0 array. Data show that 185 lncRNAs, including 90 upregulated and 95 downregulated lncRNA transcripts, were significantly dysregulated in glioblastoma tissues. Then, 8 dysregulated lncRNAs were validated in another 50 samples of specimens using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays（qRT-PCR）. We predicted lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks by co-expressing lncRNA and mRNA with altered miRNA.
