TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of Hypoxia and Normoxia cultured cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To study differential mRNA and precursor miRNA expression under hypoxia exposure in cancer cells. We treated ovarian cancer cell line A2780 under hypoxia condition at different time points. Normoxi acultured cells at corresponding time point were used as controls.

DESIGN
A2780 cancer cells, cultured under hypoxia and normoxia. Time points tested: 6hr, 48hr, 6days.
