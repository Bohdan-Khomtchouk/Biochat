TITLE
Microarray analysis of primary melanoma patient cells, melanoma cell lines, and HL cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analyses of 1300 genes involved in UPS-signalling in malignant and non-malignant cells

DESIGN
Gene ratio of references (non-malignant) were compared to gene ratio of samples (malignant cells) under non-treated conditions
