TITLE
Human-specific patterns of gene expression in the brain (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta ; Pan troglodytes ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified human-specific gene expression patterns in the brain by comparing expression with chimpanzee and rhesus macaque.

DESIGN
DpnII tag-based libraries were generated from human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque brain (frontal pole, hippocampus, caudate nucleus), and sequenced using an Illumina Genome Analyzer.
