TITLE
Repression of Igf1 expression by Ezh2 prevents basal cell differentiation in the developing lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression (RNA-seq) and H3K27me3 binding (ChIP-seq) profiling of wild type and Ezh2-deficient mouse lung epithelium. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Lungs from wild type and Ezh2-deficient mice (Ezh2 deletion is specific to lung epithelium) were collected at day e16.5. Lung cells were separated into epithelial and stromal populations based on EpCAM expression. Epithelial cells were profiled for both gene expression (Total RNA-seq) and H3K27me3 binding (ChIP-seq). Additionally, stromal cells were also profiled for gene expression. Refer to individual Series
