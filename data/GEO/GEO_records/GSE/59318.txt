TITLE
Neural gene expression in Pten knock-in mice at 6-weeks of age

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to assess the changes in the neural transcriptome of Ptenm3m4 mice, in order to better understand their ASD-related phenotypes. For our initial cellular and behavioral characterization of this mouse line, see Tilot, et al., Human Molecular Genetics, 2014

DESIGN
Comparison of mice heterozygous and homozygous for the Ptenm3m4 mutation to Wt littermates at 2 and 6 weeks of age

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
