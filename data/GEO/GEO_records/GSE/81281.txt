TITLE
Hydra modifies bacterial quorum sensing signals for stabilizing host-microbe interactions

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
This study looks at gene expression changes in Curvibacter sp. AEP1.3 in the presence of homoserine-lactones modified or unmodified by the host (Hydra)

DESIGN
This study compares five biological replicates of the Curvibacter sp. AEP 1.3 strain for each condition. The conditions are: 3OC12-HSL 3OHC12-HSL and control (solvent).
