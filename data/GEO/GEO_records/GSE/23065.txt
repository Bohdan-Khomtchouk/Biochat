TITLE
Multiple chromosomal monosomies are characteristic of giant cell ependymoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Giant cell ependymoma (GCE), a rare ependymoma subtype, was only recently recognised as a separate diagnostic entity with variations both in malignant potential and in course of disease. The pathogenetic mechanisms behind ependymomas remain unknown. Only one karyotyped GCE has so far been reported. We present the first genomic characterisation of a supratentorial GCE using G-band karyotyping, DNA ploidy analysis and array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH). The G-banded karyotype was hypodiploid with multiple monosomies, a feature present also in the previously published case and, hence, probably characteristic of these tumours. We could also analyse cytogenetically a subsequent recurrent tumour, phenotypically an anaplastic ependymoma, but exhibiting a pattern of monosomies largely similar to that found in the primary tumour, allowing a first insight into the genetic events involved also in disease progression.
