TITLE
Global gene expression profiling in mouse plasma cell tumor precursor and bystander cells revels potential intervention targets for plasma-cell neoplasia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We extracted nascent plasma cell tumor (PCT) cells from within inflammatory granulomas (OG) isolated from intraperitoneal pristane-injected BALB/c.iMyc  EÎ¼ mice at five different time points during tumor progression. We used laser capture micro-dissection to collect incipient PCT cells and analyzed their global gene expression on Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A microarrays.  Two independent studies were performed with different sets of mice

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from both laser capture samples and whole tissue sections at 5 different times after tumor initiation: 7 days, 17 days, 33 days, 49/46 days and 104/105 days in two independent experiments, studies 1 and 2
