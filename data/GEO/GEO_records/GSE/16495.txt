TITLE
Expression data from poplar apices

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
We studied differences in gene expression between Populus P35S::EBB1  lines and control, affecting plant growth and differentiation, and dormancy. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying morphological and developmental changes driven by overexpression of the EBB1 gene. By screening activation tagging population, we identified the EARLY BUD-BREAK1 (EBB1) mutant. We positioned the tag, localized a putative candidate gene and verified transcription activation. The activated gene encodes an AP2/ERF  transcription factor similar to a small B1 gene-subfamily in Arabidopsis encoding strong regulators of meristem function and lateral organ outgrowth.  We fully recapitulated the phenotype by overexpression of the gene into the same genotype under a strong constitutive promoter (P35S::EBB1).  We also found that EBB1 transcript abundance in wild type plants increases during the period prior to bud-break, and in response to the hormone cytokinin.  Our data indicates that EBB1 plays an important role in the process of bud-break.

DESIGN
Poplar apex was selected  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain homogeneous native expression of affected genes in P35S::EBB1  lines and control, in order to increase the resolution of expression profiles inducing the developmental changes in P35S::EBB1. To do that,  we selected apex tissue from greenhouse healthy plants.
