TITLE
Aging-related virtually na誰ve memory T (TVNM) cells: a new stage in T cell response to persistent infections in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We conducted RNA-Seq on T cell subsets sorted from five donors to identify a transcriptional signature associated with virtually na誰ve memory T cells.

DESIGN
We sorted various T cell subsets from five donors including TEMRAs, na誰ve T cells, effector memory T cells, central memory T cells, and virtually na誰ve memory T cells and used a template-switching-based library construction protocol to faciliate low-input RNA-Seq from tens to hundreds of thousands of cells in each subpopulation.
