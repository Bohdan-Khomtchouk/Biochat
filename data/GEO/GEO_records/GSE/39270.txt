TITLE
Corticosterone regulation of mRNAs and and corresponding RU486 antagonism in astrocytes in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of mRNA gene expression changes mediated by natural glucocorticoid ligand corticosterone in mouse cortical primary astrocyte cultures; also, parallel analysis of RU486 (mifepristone) antagonism of corticosterone-mediated mRNA changes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from astrocyte cultures subjected to 2, 4, or 6 hours of (1) 100nM corticosterone alone, (2) 500nM RU486 alone, or (3) 100nM corticosterone + 500nM RU486 exposure compared to vehicle control astrocyte cultures.
