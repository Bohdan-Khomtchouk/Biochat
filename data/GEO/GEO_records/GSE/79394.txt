TITLE
Gene expression in a 3-dimensional human epidermal tissue culture model after water-filtered near-infrared irradiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the effects of near-infrared radiation, we assessed DNA microarray after water-filtered  near-infrared (1100-1800 nm together with a water-filter that excludes wavelengths 1400-1500 nm) irradiation.

DESIGN
We performed 5 and 10 rounds of near-infrared irradiation at 10 J ‚ÅÑcm2.
