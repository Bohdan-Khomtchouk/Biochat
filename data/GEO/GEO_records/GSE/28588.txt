TITLE
Photoperiodic induction of gene expression in Drosophila.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Young Drosophila females respond to low temperature and short photoperiod by developmental arrest of the ovaries.   This form of reproductive diapause is a winter adaptation. Here we used Affymetrix microarrays to study global expression in female heads associated with long vs. short day.

DESIGN
Within 8 hr after eclosion, flies were transferred to vials and maintained in light boxes illuminated by a 4W fluorescent bulb at 12.5Â°C under either long (16 hr) or short (10 hr) photoperiod. After for 12 days, femlaes were collected 4 hr after lights-on (ZT4).
