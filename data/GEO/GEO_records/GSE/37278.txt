TITLE
Transcriptional profile of rve8 in circadian time course

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of Arabidopsis Columbia and rve8-1, a longer period mutant, in circadian time course (ZT72-116). Results provide insight into where RVE8 functions in the clock system and the targets regulated by RVE8.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis Col and rve8-1 seedlings (~50 plants/ per sample) were grown in 12 hours light/ 12 hours dark for 7 days before releasing to the constant light. After 72 hours in the constant light, samples were harvested every 4 hours for 2 days. RNA was extracted, labeled and hybridized onto Agronomics1 tiling arrays.
