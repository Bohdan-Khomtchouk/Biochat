TITLE
Gene expression profile of the SV40-immortalized human corneal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray was used to study global gene expression of a cell culture model based on SV40-immortalized human corneal epithelial (iHCE) cells. The gene expression profile of the cell line was compared to the normal human corneal epithelium. Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips® were used for microarray experiments and results were validated by performing RT-qPCR for selected genes. iHCE was found to over- and under-express 22 % and 14 % of the annotated genes, respectively. The results of this study suggest that differences between iHCE cells and normal corneal epithelium are substantial and therefore the use of these cells in corneal research should be considered with caution.

DESIGN
SV40-immortalized human corneal epithelial (iHCE) cells were cultured on collagen coated permeable supports for one week using standard culture conditions. Subsequently the apical medium was removed and culturing was continued at the air-liquid interface which allows cells to stratify. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance was followed and total RNA was extracted from cultures with resistance > 300 Ω x cm2. RNA was amplified, labeled with biotin, fragmented and hybridized to the HG-U133A GeneChips® (Affymetrix) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Three separate experiments with samples from three independent culture batches (iHCE1, iHCE2, iHCE3) were performed. The Global gene expression profile of iHCE was compared to previously published human corneal epithelial tissue (GSE5543) data.
