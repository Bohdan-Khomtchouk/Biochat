TITLE
Comparison of the transcriptome of K-LEC spheroids to control LEC spheroids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kaposi sarcoma is the most common cancer in AIDS patients and is typified by red skin lesions.The disease is caused by the KSHV virus (HHV8) and is recognisable by its distinctive red skin lesions. The lesions are KSHV infected spindle cells expressing markers of the lymphatic endothelial and blood vessel endothelial cells as well as other cell types. The effects of KSHV infection of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) cultured in 3D matrix for three days were assayed using Affymetrix hgu133plus2 chips.

DESIGN
There are n=3 of  1.  control LEC spheroids (LEC), 2. KSHV infected LEC spheroids (K-LEC)
