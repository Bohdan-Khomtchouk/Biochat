TITLE
Histone chromatin modifications in control and Med12-deficient mouse HSPCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using iChIP, we map H3K27Ac, H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 in small populations (HSPCs) in the presence or absence of Med12 and identify affected super-enhancers. iChIP was performed using previously published protocols (Lara-Astiaso et al, 2014 Immunogenetics. Chromatin state dynamics during blood formation - Science, 345, 6199)

DESIGN
Examination of histone modification in mouse HSPCs with and without Med12

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
