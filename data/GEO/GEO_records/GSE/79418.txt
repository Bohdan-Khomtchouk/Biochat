TITLE
Gene expression signatures of ischemia on porcine kidney

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Using an oligonucleotide microarray we performed differential transcriptomic analysis of porcine kidneys subjected to intense ischemic stress which could be observed in donors deceased after circulatory death situation (60 min warm ischemia then 24h of cold storage in University of Wisconsin solution) compared to healthy kidneys (n=3). 43 genes were differentially expressed in ischemic versus healthy kidneys (adjusted p value < 0.05 + log2 fold change > 0.5 or < -0.5). Functional enrichment analysis via Gene ontology revealed relevant biological processes and signaling pathways such as: cellular responses to stress and cell cycle adaptation, metabolism modification, RNA reprograming, cellular phenotype changes and inflammation. Our data showed that ischemia is a dynamic process, with important transcriptional modifications on major pathways. We uncovered a number of targets which we will further validate as biomarkers and therapeutic targets to optimize organ quality.

DESIGN
ISCHEMIA samples: Three independent porcine kidney (from different Large White pig) were clamped, removed and maintained clamped 60 min at 37°C, and then flushed with cold (4°C) University of Wisconsin preservation solution (UW) and stored at 4°C for 24h, then kidneys were immediatly sampled and frozen. CONTROL samples: Three independent porcine kidney (from different Large White pig) were removed and then immediatly sampled and frozen.
