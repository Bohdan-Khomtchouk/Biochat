TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for knockdown of synthetic lethal gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide expression profiling analysis to define the genes underlying the synthetic-lethal relationship between CBP and p300. We extracted 1,936 genes whose expression levels changed > 2-fold upon p300-knockdown (KD) in CBP-KO cells, or upon CBP-KD in p300-KO cells, but not in either KD in wild-type cells

DESIGN
Gene expression profile in human lung H1299, H1299 CBP KO, H1299 p300KO cells was measured at 48 hours after transfection of siNT, siCBP or sip300.  Two independent experiments were performed at each time (48 hours).
