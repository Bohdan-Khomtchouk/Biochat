TITLE
Mouse Bone-marrow Stromal Cell Lines Genetic Expression Comparison

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OP9 stromal cells are strong inducers of mesoendodermal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. They acquire inductive function after prolonged post-confluence culture. The experiment is designed to determine the genes specifically expressed in these highly inductive OP9 cells compared to non-confluent OP9 cultures as well as other stromal cell lines (MS5, S17).

DESIGN
OP9, MS5, and S17 cells were plated on gelatin-coated 10cm dishes in alphaMEM/20%FBS. Cells were collected at confluence (day 4) and after additional 4 days post-confluence culture. Half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium on day 4. Cells were collected by trypsin-EDTA, lysed in TRIReagent and strored at -80C up to 1 month. RNA was isolated and treated with DNase using Ambion RiboPure RNA isolation kit and TURBO DNAfree reagents. One sample was analyzed per condition.
