TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression profile analysis in pulmonary sarcoidosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that tissue genome-wide gene expression analysis, coupled with gene network analyses of differentially expressed genes, would provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary sarcoidosis. Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
Genome-wide gene expression profiles were compared in tissues derived from subjects with active pulmonary sarcoidosis (n=6) and those with normal lung anatomy (n=6).  Differentially expressed genes were analyzed by gene network analysis
