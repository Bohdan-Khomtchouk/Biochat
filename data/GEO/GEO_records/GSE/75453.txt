TITLE
RNA-Seq to compare gene expression to MIRTA tiling arrays

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed additional sequencing of samples from GSM718982, GSM718983 to increase coverage in order to comapre gene expression by RNA-Seq to MIRTA tiling array expression performed on the same samples.

DESIGN
Re-sequencing of samples from GSE22959  (GSM718982, GSM718983) in two technical replicates
