TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq analysis of mature thymic epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study set out to assay the (polyA+) transcriptomes of single mature (MHCII high) mouse medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC).

DESIGN
Following isolation by FACs, the transcriptomes of single mature mTEC was assayed using the Fluidigm C1 microfluidics platform and Illumina RNA-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
