TITLE
Expression data from Tg4510 and Wild-type mice after AAVTFEB injection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression after 4 months of TFEB overexpression in the brain.

DESIGN
Groups of Tg4510 and Wild-type mice were injected at P0 in the brain. Those groups of mice and the respectively controls were sacrificed and analyzed after 4 months from the injection. RNA extraction from the hippocampus and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays was done.
