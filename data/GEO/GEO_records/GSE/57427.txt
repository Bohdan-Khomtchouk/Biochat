TITLE
Whole-genome microarray analysis was performed on cells treated with 5 μM dTAT for 1h

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the impacto of dTAT treatment on primary human dermal flibroblast at the gene expression level. Results show that dTAT cytosolic penetration has a minimal impact on mRNA expression and that cells rapidly recover from treatment with dTAT.

DESIGN
Primary Human dermal Fibroblast (HDF) were treated with dTAT (5µM) for 1h. Total RNA was harvested from HDF cells immediately, 1h or 24h after treatment.
