TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of miR-144/451-null bone marrow erythroid cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
microRNA miR-144/451 is highly expressed during erythropoiesis. We deleted the miR-144/451 gene locus in mice and compared the transcriptomes of miR-144/451-null bone marrow erythroid precursors to stage-matched wild-type control cells.

DESIGN
Ter119+/CD71+/FSC-high bone marrow erythroblasts were sorted directly into Trizol LS reagent. Total RNAs extracted from three miR-144/451 knock-out and three wide type mice were analyzed using  Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.
