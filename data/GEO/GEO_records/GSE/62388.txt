TITLE
Expression data from muscle samples following synergist ablation

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the program of gene expression underlying the growth of the plantaris muscle following synergist ablation-induced supraphysiological overload

DESIGN
Rats were subjected to bilateral Achilles tenectomy surgeries, where the Achilles tendon is removed to ablate the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, which places a robust stimulus for growth in the synergist plantaris muscle. We measured the expression of transcripts at time 0, 3, 7 and 28 days post surgery on Affymetrix Rat Gene 2.1 ST arrays.
