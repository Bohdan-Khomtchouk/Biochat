TITLE
Sugarcane transcriptome - MeJa treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharum officinarum

SUMMARY
Sugarcane one-eyed seed sets (genotype SP80-3280, CTC, Brazil) were planted in 200 ml plastic cups containing a commercial planting mix (Plantmax, Eucatex) and cultivated for 20 days under greenhouse conditions. The plantlets were subsequently transferred to a growth chamber at 26°C on a 16 h/8 h light/dark cycle with a photon flux density of 70 µE.m-2.s-1 to acclimate. Plantlets were then sprayed with a 100 µmol.L-1 MeJA solution (Bedoukian Research Inc., Danbury, CT), whereas control plantlets were treated with distilled water. Leaves were collected  0, 1, 6and 12 h after exposure to MeJA and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Six plantlets were used for each time point. Extraction of total RNA was performed separately on each sample pool. Keywords: time course of hormone treatment
