TITLE
Sugarcane transcriptome - MeJa treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharum hybrid cultivar SP80-3280

SUMMARY
Sugarcane one-eyed seed sets (genotype SP80-3280, CTC, Brazil) were planted in 200 ml plastic cups containing a commercial planting mix (Plantmax, Eucatex) and cultivated for 20 days under greenhouse conditions. The plantlets were subsequently transferred to a growth chamber at 26°C on a 16 h/8 h light/dark cycle with a photon flux density of 70 µE.m-2.s-1 to acclimate. Plantlets were then sprayed with a 100 µmol.L-1 MeJA solution (Bedoukian Research Inc., Danbury, CT), whereas control plantlets were treated with distilled water. Leaves were collected  0, 1, 6and 12 h after exposure to MeJA and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Six plantlets were used for each time point. Extraction of total RNA was performed separately on each sample pool. Keywords: time course of hormone treatment

DESIGN
RNA from experimental sample and from the control sample (0 h) was used for hybridization to dual channel arrays. Two biological replicates were used for each experimental point. The quantification of each hybridization was submitted in two files, one for each slide side (technical replicates).
