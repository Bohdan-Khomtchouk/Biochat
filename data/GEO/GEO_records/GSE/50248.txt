TITLE
Expression profiling of Wnt3a-treated HeLa cells in G1 and G2/M phase

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The early transcriptional response of HeLa cervical carcinoma cells to the canonical Wnt signalling pathway was investigated at two different cell cycle phases (G1 and G2/M) via microarray gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
HeLa cells grown under standard conditions were treated for 3 h with either Control, Wnt3a- or Dkk1-conditioned media and then FACS-sorted into G1 and G2/M populations for microarray expression analysis with 4 independent replicates per group.
