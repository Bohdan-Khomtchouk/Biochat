TITLE
Gene expression in OsRR6-overexpression line

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Cytokinins (CKs) are a class of plant hormones that regulate many aspects of growth and development, including cell division, apical dominance, leaf senescence, nutrient signaling, and shoot differentiation. In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding CK biosynthesis, metabolism and signal transduction. Much of this knowledge is based on research in Arabidopsis, a dicotyledonous model plant. The current model of the CK signaling pathway is a multi-step His-Asp phosphorelay system. Some of the cytokinin-inducible response regulators are thought to act as negative regulators of CK signaling. We tried to identify rice genes regulated by CK-inducible response regulator using an Affymetrix rice genome array and transgenic rice that over-express OsRR6. Keywords: genetic modification
