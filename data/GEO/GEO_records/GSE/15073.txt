TITLE
Effect of sulfide on growth physiology and gene expression of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough

ORGANISM
Desulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough

SUMMARY
The effect of sulfide stress on Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) gene expression was determined by comparing the gene expression profiles of DvH  under conditions in which sulfide was allowed to accumulate (high sulfide, average concentration 10 mM) against DvH cells grown under conditions in which sulfide was removed by continuous gassing (low sulfide, average concentration 1 mM). High sulfide significantly decreased the instantaneous growth rate constant and final cell density of the culture indicating a decreased bioenergetic fitness. Changes in gene expression caused by exposure to high sulfide were determined using full-genome DvH microarrays. The transcription of ribosomal protein-encoding genes was decreased, in agreement with the lower growth rate of DvH under high sulfide conditions. Interestingly, expression of the gene for DsrD, located downstream of the genes for dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB) was also strongly down-regulated. In contrast, the expression of many genes involved in iron accumulation, stress response and proteolysis, and chemotaxis were increased. This indicates that high sulfide represents a significant stress condition, in which the bioavailability of metals like iron may be lowered and in which proteins (e.g. metalloenzymes) may need to be refolded, or proteolytically degraded. Overall this leads to a reduced growth rate and less efficient biomass production with available resources.

DESIGN
For each condition 2 unique biological samples were hybridized to 4 arrays that each contained duplicate spots. Genomic DNA was used as universal reference.
