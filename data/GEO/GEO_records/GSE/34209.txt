TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of genes regulated by overexpression of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) is expressed in the boundary between the shoot apical meristem and initiating lateral organs. To identify genes regulated by LOB activity, we used an inducible 35S:LOB-GR line. This analysis identified genes that are differentially expressed in response to ectopic LOB activity.

DESIGN
35S:LOB-GR and Col wild-type seedlings were treated with dexamethasone (DEX) or mock-treated. Three biological replicates were conducted for each treatment.
