TITLE
Functional genomic analysis of three nitrogenase isozymes in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris

ORGANISM
Rhodopseudomonas palustris

SUMMARY
To address the question of how photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris differentially regulates gene expression of three nitrogenase isozymes (Mo, V, and Fe nitrogenases), we constructed Mo strain (Mo nitrogenase only strain), V strain (V nitrogenase only strain), and Fe strain (Fe nitrogenase only strain), and analyzed the whole genome transcriptome profiles of each mutant and wild-type cells grown under nitrogen-fixing conditions. Keywords: Genetic modification
