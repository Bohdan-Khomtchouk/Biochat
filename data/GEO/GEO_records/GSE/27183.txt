TITLE
Comparative gene expression profiles induced by PPARγ and PPARα/γ agonists in human hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of primary human hepatocytes after treatment  with 2 glitazones (TRO and ROSI) and 2 glitazars (MURA and TESA) Singe-Channel Samples: We have analysed changes in gene expression profiles in primary human hepatocytes after a 24 h treatment with various concentrations of glitazones and glitazars Dual-Channel Samples: We have analysed changes in gene expression profiles in primary human hepatocytes and differentiated human hepatoma HepaRG cells after a 24 h treatment with various concentrations of glitazones and glitazars

DESIGN
Singe-Channel Samples: 5 condition experiments, control, TRO (3 concentrations) , ROSI  (3 concentrations) , MURA (3 concentrations)  and TESA  (1 concentration) , biological replicates:2 to 4 Dual-Channel Samples: 5 condition experiments, control, TRO (3 concentrations) , ROSI  (4 concentrations) , MURA (4 concentrations)  and TESA  (1 concentration) , biological replicates: 3

PLATFORM
