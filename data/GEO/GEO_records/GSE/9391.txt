TITLE
Gene expression in brain following stroke

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used microarrays to investigate the changes in gene expression at various times after stroke. Our findings reported that gene expression screening can detect known and unknown transcriptional features of stroke. Keywords: time course, disease state analysis
