TITLE
Gene expression in brain following stroke

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used microarrays to investigate the changes in gene expression at various times after stroke. Our findings reported that gene expression screening can detect known and unknown transcriptional features of stroke. Keywords: time course, disease state analysis

DESIGN
Brain samples were obtained from 9 patients who died from stroke, with the approval of the local Ethics Committee. The patients were aged between 51 and 86 years and had survived between 2-37 days following stroke. Tissue samples were taken from infarct and peri-infarcted zones while controls were obtained from the contralateral hemisphere. We established mRNA expression profiles of the damaged brain tissues between 2 to 6 days, 9 to 20 days, and 26 to 37 days after stroke. RNA from three stroke patients was pooled for each patient survival group.
