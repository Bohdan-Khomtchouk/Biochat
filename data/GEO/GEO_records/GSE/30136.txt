TITLE
Comprehensive gene expression profiling of the rice root system based on developmental stages and tissue types

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
The root system is a crucial determinant of plant growth potential because of its important functions, e.g., acquisition of water and nutrients, structural support, and interaction with symbiotic organisms. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of root development and functions is therefore necessary for improving plant productivity, particularly for crop plants including rice. As an initial step towards developing a comprehensive understanding of the root system, we performed a large-scale transcriptome analysis of the rice root via a combined laser microdissection and microarray analysis approach.

DESIGN
We performed comprehensive microarray analysis of a rice crown root using laser microdissection and collected a total of 13 samples (3 replicates for each sample except for one sample, 38 total microarray data) representing 8 different developmental stages along the longitudinal axis and 3 distinct tissue-types along the radial axis at 2 different developmental stages. The 8 developmental stages represent root cap, division zone, elongation zone and maturation zone_I, II, III, IV and V. The 3 tissue-types represent epidermis/exodermis/sclerenchyma, cortex, and endodermis/pericycle/stele. In the maturation zone_V, the cortex consisted largely of aerenchyma (non-living cells) and was not used for the microarray analysis.
