TITLE
Brain transcriptome of honeybees (Apis mellifera) infected by Nosema ceranae and/or Black Queen Cell Virus

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
Experimental infection of (2 days old) adult honey bee workers (30 bees per replicates, 3 replicates per treatments, from 3 different colonies (one colony per cage for each treatment)) with 10^9 genome equivalent of Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV) in 10µl of sugar solution and/or 10^5 fresh Nosema ceranae spores (control bees were given a similar bee extract in PBS, without pathogen). Bees were kept in cages of 30 bees in incubator (30°C/50%RH). At day 13 p.i., bees were flash frozen, and stored at -80°C.

DESIGN
Brain mRNA profiles of 15 old bees were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicates except for bees infected by both Nosema ceranae and Black Queen Cell Virus (duplicates)
