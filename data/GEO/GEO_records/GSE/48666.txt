TITLE
CpG island-mediated global gene regulatory modes in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the regions occupied by transcription factors, we performed bio-ChIP followed by massive parallel sequencing (bioChIP-Seq) in mouse ES cells. A total of seven DNA transcription factors including Myc module (Myc, Max, E2F4, Tip60 and Dmap1) and Core module transcription factors (Nanog, Dax1; Kim et al., 2010) were identified. We show that the transcription factors can be classified into several classes according to their occupancies. Our data also show transcription factors in the same class co-occupy the same regulatory elements, share the common characteristics and act together.

DESIGN
Identification of seven transcription factor binding sites in mES cells
