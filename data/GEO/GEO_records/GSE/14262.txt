TITLE
Human nasopharyngeal carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To uncover the oncogenic pathways of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gene expression profiles of  primary NPC cell strains and NPC-derived cell lines were conducted and analyzed in depth. Keywords: Oncogenesis

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of 9 primary NPC cell strains and 5 NPC-derived cell lines were analyzed. Forty Î¼g total RNA from one NPC sample was needed for a dye-swap experiment. Total RNA from 32 normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cell strains was pooled to serve as a universal reference.
