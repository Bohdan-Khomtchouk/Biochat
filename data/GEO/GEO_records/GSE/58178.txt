TITLE
Endometriosis: Normal endometrial stromal cells and endometriotic stromal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of primary stromal cell cultures isolated from human endometrium and ovarian endometriosis. Samples are derived from the endometrium of 6 healthy patients and the endometriomas of 6 diseased patients. The results indicate the gene expression differences between these two cell populations.

DESIGN
Stromal cells were obtained from human normal endometrial tissues and ovarian endometriomas. The tissues were digested enzymatically, and pure stromal cell populations were established.
