TITLE
YAP and TAZ modulate cell phenotype in a subset of small cell lung cancer.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We explored the functional role of YAP in SCLC cells (SBC3 and SBC5) by YAP knockdown.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from SBC3 and SBC5 cells 48 h after siNC or siYAP transfection. Microarray analysis was carried out using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array.
