TITLE
Molecular changes induced by melanoma cell conditioned medium (MCM) in HUVEC cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Malignant melanoma is a complex genetic disease and the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Melanoma progression and metastatic dissemination fundamentally relies on the process of angiogenesis. Melanomas produce an array of angiogenic modulators that mediate pathological angiogenesis. Such tumor-associated modulators arbitrate the enhanced proliferative, survival and migratory responses exhibited by endothelial cells, in the hypoxic tumor environment. The current study focuses on melanoma-induced survival of endothelial cells under hypoxic conditions. Melanoma conditioned media were capable of enabling prolonged endothelial cell survival under hypoxia, in contrast with the conditioned media derived from melanocytes, breast and pancreatic tumors. To identify the global changes in gene expression and further characterize the pro-survival pathway induced in endothelial cells, we performed microarray analysis on endothelial cells treated with melanoma conditioned medium under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

DESIGN
Huvec cells were grown in melanoma conditioned medium or DMEM 10% FCS for 12 h under hypoxic or normoxic conditions. In order to identify the transcripts modulated by melanoma CM,  samples treated with MCM were compared to those grown in DMEM alone.
