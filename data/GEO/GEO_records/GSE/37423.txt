TITLE
miRNAs expression in kidneys tissues of MRL/lpr mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated as fine-tuning regulators controlling diverse biological processes at the level of posttranscriptional repression. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been described in various disease states, including inflammatory autoimmune diseases. By using high-throughput microRNA profiling analysis, we identified a series of miRNAs dysregulated in local inflammatory lesions of human patients with autoimmune diseases, as well as their relevant mouse models such as MRL/lpr.

DESIGN
We isolated the kidneys tissues pooled from six female MRL/lpr mice or from three control mice. Total RNA was extracted for the TaqMan® Low Density Assay v3.0

PLATFORM
GPL15466 TaqMan® Rodent MicroRNA Array v3.0 A/B
