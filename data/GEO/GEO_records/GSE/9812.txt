TITLE
Molecular heterogeneity of developing retinal ganglion and amacrine cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During development of the central nervous system (CNS), cycling uncommitted progenitor cells give rise to a variety of distinct neuronal and glial cell types.  As these different cell types are born, they progress from newly specified cells to fully differentiated neurons and glia.  In order to define the developmental processes of individual cell types, single cell expression profiling was carried out on developing ganglion and amacrine cells of the murine retina.  Individual cells from multiple developmental stages were isolated and profiled on Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays. These experiments have yielded an expanded view of the processes underway in developing retinal ganglion and amacrine cells, as well as several hundred new marker genes for these cell types.  In addition, this study has allowed for the definition of some of the molecular heterogeneity both between developing ganglion and amacrine cells and among subclasses of each cell type. Keywords: Single retinal cell gene expression profiling across multiple mouse developmental stages

DESIGN
Single retinal cells were isolated in tubes containing lysis buffer, their mRNAs were reverse transcribed, and the resulting cDNAs were PCR amplified for 35 cycles. Labeled cDNA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarrays and the data was normalized using MAS5.0 software.  Cells were identified post hoc as either developing retinal ganglion cells, amacrine cells or  rod photoreceptor cells.
