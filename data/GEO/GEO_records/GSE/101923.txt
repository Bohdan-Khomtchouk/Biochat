TITLE
Gene expression profile of multiple myeloma cell lines treated with CB-5083

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal was to determine the gene expression differences between CB-5083 and Bortezomib treated multiple myeloma cell lines Inhibition of the AAA ATPase, p97, was recently shown to be a novel method for targeting the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and CB-5083, a first in class inhibitor of p97, has demonstrated broad antitumor activity in a range of both hematological and solid tumor models. Here, we show that CB-5083 has robust activity against multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines and a number of in vivo MM models. Treatment with CB-5083 is associated with accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and apoptosis. CB-5083 decreases viability in MM cell lines and patient derived MM cells, including those with background proteasome inhibitor (PI) resistance.  CB-5083 has a unique mechanism of action that combines well with PIs which is likely owing to the p97-dependent retro-translocation of the transcription factor, Nrf1, which transcribes proteasome subunit genes following exposure to a PI. In vivo studies using clinically relevant MM models demonstrate that single-agent CB-5083 inhibits tumor growth and combines well with MM standard of care agents. Our preclinical data demonstrate the efficacy of CB-5083 in several MM disease models and provide the rationale for clinical evaluation as monotherapy and in combination in MM.
