TITLE
Analysis the Ability of Producing Secondary Metabolites of Streptomyces bingchenggensis By The Genome Sequence and GeneChip DNA microarrays

ORGANISM
Streptomyces bingchenggensis

SUMMARY
Streptomyces bingchenggensis is a soil bacterium that produces a family of macrolide antibiotics, milbemycins, which is commercially important in crop protection, human and veterinary medicine. After the complete genome sequence, and annotation, for further development of our gene expression approach to biosynthesis, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to obtain improved specificity and sensitivity of gene expression analysis, allowing a global and at the same time detailed picture of how gene clusters for secondary metabolism are modulated. In the result, we confirmed the expression mil and nan gene cluster, furthermore, pks3, pks5 and nrps7, nrps8 also showed significant gene expression, but no obvious products detected. In Streptomyces bingchenggensis, there are also corresponding genes belonging to Defense mechanisms, which is much more than other Streptomyces, for the resistance of own metabolites and dealing with complex environmental factors.

DESIGN
16 time points were designed at 12, 18, 24, 30, 33, 39, 42, 45, 51, 57, 60, 69, 72, 96, 120, and 144 hours. The samples were collected at each time point named L1, L3, L5, L7, L8, L10, L11, L12, L14, L16, L17, L20, L21, L22, L23, and L24.
