TITLE
Expression data from HCCC-9810 cells with MBD5 or BAP1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MBD5 can physically interact with BAP1. Some genes may be regulated by both MBD5 and BAP1. We used microarrays to check whether the overlaps of differentially expressed genes when knockdown MBD5 or BAP1 were more than that would be expected by chance. Thus, we could suggest that BAP1 was required for the regulatory effect of MBD5

DESIGN
The human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines HCCC-9810 were transfected with BAP1 siRNAs or MBD5 siRNAs or control shRNA. Three biological replicates each.
