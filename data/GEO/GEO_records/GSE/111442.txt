TITLE
Genome-wide epigenetic maps in the liver from male and female Wistar and Sprague-Daley rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We carry out methyl DNA immunoprecipitation (meDIP) and hydroxymethyl DNA immunoprecipitaion (hmeDIP)  prior to sequencing on the Ion Proton semiconductor sequencing platform to report on the genome-wide epigenetic patterns in rat livers

DESIGN
Genome-wide patterns were generate on the Ion Proton P1 sequencer.

PLATFORM
GPL19482 Ion Torrent Proton (Rattus norvegicus)
