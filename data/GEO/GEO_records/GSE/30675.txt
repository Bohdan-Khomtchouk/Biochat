TITLE
A new, highly conserved domain in Swi2/Snf2 is required for SWI/SNF remodeling

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The in vivo role of a novel domain in Swi2/Snf2 required for its function was investigated using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
The effect of domain deletions of Swi2/Snf2 on expression changes were studied. The ∆SnAC strain, along with Δsnf2 and wild type strains (BY4741 and Snf2-2FLAG, PSY2), were analyzed by genome-wide expression profiling with DNA microarrays. The method has been described in Chitikila et al., Mol. Cell, 10:871-882, 2002 (PMID 12419230).
