TITLE
Cocaine Study

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The 10 samples below represent a study where gene expression levels were measured in 5 different parts of the rat brain under cocaine-treated (GSM4696, GSM4698 - GSM4701) and saline-treated control (GSM4702 - GSM4706) conditions. The regions studied were amygdala (amy), caudate putamen (cpu), nucleus acumbens (na), prefrontal cortex (cpu), and the ventral tegmental area (vta). The data were analyzed using two different computational techniques, viz. singular value decomposition (SVD) and self-organizing maps (SOM), to identify a common set of genes that were regulated by cocaine administration.
