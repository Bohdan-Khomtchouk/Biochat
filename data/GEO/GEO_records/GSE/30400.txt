TITLE
RNA-Seq in GM12878 (ENCODE Project)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-Seq as part of the ENCODE project in order to determine sites of allele-specific expression This was done in the GM12878 cell line which was genotyped as part of the pilot II phase of the 1000 genomes project. There is a matching ChIP-Seq experiments for a number of transcription factors were also performed on the same cell line. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf
