TITLE
Gene expression profile of developing adipose tissue in vivo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obesity is characterized by an increase in the size and the number of adipocytes. However, the mechanisms responsible for the formation of adipocytes during development and the molecular mechanisms regulating their increase and maintenance in adulthood are poorly understood.  Here, we report the use of leptin-luciferase BAC transgenic mice to track white adipose tissue (WAT) development and guide the isolation and molecular characterization of adipocytes during development using DNA microarrays. These data reveal distinct transcriptional programs that are regulated during murine WAT development in vivo.

DESIGN
Developing mouse adipose tissue from at least 3 embryos were pooled for embryonic and postnatal time points.
