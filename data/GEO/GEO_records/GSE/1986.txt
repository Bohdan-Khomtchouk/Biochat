TITLE
Global gene expression across a range of tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to survey global gene expression across a range of mouse tissues. Biotinylated cRNA was synthesized from total RNA, then fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip arrays at the Siteman Cancer Center Gene Chip Core Facility (Washington University, St Louis, Missouri) according to manufacturer's protocols. Image files were generated using MicroArray Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix). Keywords: other
