TITLE
Study of the effect of C2 on the transcriptome and the response to MeJA

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
affy_meja_arabidopsis - We want to determine if the presence of C2 modifies the cell transcriptome and its response to methyl jasmonate. Comparison of control lines and transgenic lines expressing C2 in basal conditions and after treatment with 50uM MeJA for 10 hours. C2 lines are expressing geminivirus C2 under a 35S promoter. PR1-LUC have a luciferase transgene under the control of the promoter of PR1; since the plants are not induced, these are the control plants (resistant to kanamycin, but not expressing anything else) Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic),treated vs untreated comparison

DESIGN
12 arrays - ATH1
