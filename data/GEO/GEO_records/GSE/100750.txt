TITLE
Repression of stress-induced LINE-1 expression protects cancer cell populations from lethal drug-exposures [ATAC-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DTP heterochromatin in genomic repeat regions protects the population from drug-induced death.

DESIGN
Investigation of chromatin structure by ATACseq in 1 cell type, 6 different conditions (heterogenous parental population, drug tolerant cells derived from the heterogenous parental population, 2 subpopulations (ALDH_High and ALDH_Low) obtained from the heterogeneous parental population before or after drug treatment)

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
