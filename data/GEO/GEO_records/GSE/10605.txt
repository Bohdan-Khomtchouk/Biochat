TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Toxicogenomic Effects of Ortho-Phenylphenol on Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Staphylococcus aureus GeneChip arrays to investigate the dynamics of global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Staphylococcus aureus to Ortho-Phenylphenol, which involved initial growth inhibition and metabolism. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
We conducted five independent microarray experiments (biological replicates) in the absence (control) and the presence (experimental) of Ortho-Phenylphenol. We calculated fold change as the ratio between the signal averages of five untreated (control) and five ortho-phenylphenol-treated (experimental) cultures for 0, 20 and 60 min exposures.
