TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts and pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Splicing profiles in pluripotent stem cells are different from those in somatic cells. Generally, alternative splicing is regulated by RNA binding proteins. To identify the candidate RNA-binding protein-encoding genes, we performed gene expression profiling experiments.

DESIGN
Expression levels were profiled in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), 2 iPS cell lines (492B4, 178B5), and ES cells (v6.5).
