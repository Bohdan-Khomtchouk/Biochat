ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs), WHO Grade I, are one of the most frequently occurring childhood brain tumors. We have used microarray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to study copy number changes on chromosome 7 in a series of PAs (n=44). Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization
