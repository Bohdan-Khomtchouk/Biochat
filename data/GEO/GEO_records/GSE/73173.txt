TITLE
Effect of exogenous FABP4 (A-FABP/aP2) with and without palmitic acid on gene expression in RAW264.7 macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of FABP4 treatment in RAW264.7 macrophages was examined to show a ligand (palmitic acid)-dependent and a ligand-independent effect of FABP4.

DESIGN
RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with and without 200 nM recombinant FABP4 in the absence and presence of 0.2 mM palmitic acid.
