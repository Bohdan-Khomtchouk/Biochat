TITLE
Expression data of bone marrow and peripheral adipocytes from leptin deficient mice and obese mice fed with a high fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to characterize the obesity-related gene expression profiles between bone marrow adipocytes and peripheral white adipocytes from obese mice fed with high fat diet and leptin deficient mice Alterations of gene expression with high fat diet and in mice lacking leptin were analyzed in bone marrow and peripheral white adipocytes isolated from C57BL/6J male mice using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays.

DESIGN
Bone marrow adipocytes and peripheral white adipocytes (n=6-10 animals per group) were isolated from male C57BL/6J mice (6-months, 14-months ) fed with either standard chow or a high fat diet containg 60% calories from fat.  Samples were grouped into diet (standard chow vs. high fat diet) and age (6-month (6M), 14-month (14M) and 18-month (18M)).
