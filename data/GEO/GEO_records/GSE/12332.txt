TITLE
Mating induces an immune response and developmental switch in the Drosophila oviduct

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Mating triggers physiological and behavioral changes in females. To understand how females effect these changes, we used microarray, to characterize gene expression in oviducts of mated and unmated Drosophila females. The transition from nonegg laying to egg laying elicits a distinct molecular profile in the oviduct.

DESIGN
3 microarrays (3 biologicl repeats) of RNA from oviducts of unmated females (control) and 3 microarrays (3 biological repeats) of RNA from oviducts of mated females

PLATFORM
GPL72 [DrosGenome1] Affymetrix Drosophila Genome Array
