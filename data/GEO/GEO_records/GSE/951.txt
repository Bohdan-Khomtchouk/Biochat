TITLE
267B1, PC3M, LNCaP Methylation Profile vs. mRNA Expression Level

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two prostate immortalized cell lines, 267B1, RWPE-1, Ml-csv40, and five prostate cancer cell lines, PC3, PC3M, PC3M-Pro4, PC3M-LN4 and LNCaP are included in this experiment. Their methylation profile are detected using human promoter array (v11). mRNA expression level are profiled with Affymetrix U133A Arrays for 267B1 and PC3M. Keywords: other
