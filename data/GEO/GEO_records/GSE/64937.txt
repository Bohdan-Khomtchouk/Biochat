TITLE
mRNA profiling of SNEV (PRPF19) knockdown in human adipocyte precursor cells at early stage (day 3) of adipocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aging and premature aging are both accompanied by loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue mass in human and in mouse model of progeria. This may be due to reduced differentiation or deficiency in DNA damage repair (DDR) factors. Here we investigated the role of SNEV (Senescent Evasion factor; pre-mRNA processing factor 19) which was implicated in DDR and senescence evasion, in adipogenic differentiation of human adipose derived stem cells (ASCs).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, ASCs at day 3 after induction of adipocyte differentiation, comparison of cells transfected with an siRNA targeting SNEV (siSNEV) to cells transfected with a control siRNA (siC). Biological replicates: 2, indepently grown and harvested. On each array, one biological replicate of siSNEV-transfected cells was directly compared to one biological replicate of siC-transfected cells (serving as reference sample). All hybridizations were repeated with reversed dye assignment (dye-swap) as technical replicates.
