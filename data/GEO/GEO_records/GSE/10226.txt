TITLE
Analysis of RNA distribution between pseudopodia and cell bodies in response to LPA stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to identify on a genome-wide scale RNAs that are enriched at the leading edge of migrating cells. For this, we employed a fractionation method in which serum-starved cells are first plated and allowed to spread on a microporous filter. Addition of LPA at the bottom side of the filter induces the cells to polarize and extend pseudopodial protrusions. These protruding pseudopodia can then be physically isolated from the bottom surface of the filter and their contents compared with the remaining cell bodies, which are isolated from the upper surface of the filter. Keywords: comparative RNA distribution

DESIGN
We analyzed two independent pseudopodia samples (05-61_PS_A and 06-04_PS_A) and two independent cell body samples (05-61_CB_A and 06-04_CB_A)
