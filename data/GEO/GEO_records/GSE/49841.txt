TITLE
Microarray analysis of deletants of two transcription factor B in the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus kodakarensis.

ORGANISM
Thermococcus kodakarensis

SUMMARY
Thermococcus kodakarensis, which can grow in a wide range of temperatures, from 60°C to 100°C, optimally at 85°C, has two transcription factor Bs, TFB1 and TFB2, both of which are basal transcription factor. TFB1 is unique to hyperthermophiles, but TFB2 is widely conserved in Euryarchaeota. To screen the genes dependent on each TFB in a temperature dependent manner, we investigated the transcriptional profilings of each TFB deletant strain grown at each temperature, 60˚C, 85˚C, and 93˚C, by comparing with the host strain, KU216. Data analyses showed that TFB1 apparently controls the expression of genes essential for motility and adhesion, such as flagellin genes, at  85˚C and 93˚C, but TFB2 regulates genes involved in basal metabolism including amino acid biosynthesis.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, KU216 vs. DTF1 cells and KU216 vs. DTF2. Technical replicates: 2 DTF1 at 60˚C, 2 DTF1 at 85˚C, 2 DTF1 at 93˚C, 2 DTF2 at 60˚C, 2 DTF2 at 85˚C, 2 DTF2 at 93˚C, independently measured. One replicate per array.
