TITLE
Coupling between alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing is limited to terminal introns

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alternative polyadenylation has been implicated as an important regulator of gene expression. In some cases, alternative polyadenylation is known to couple with alternative splicing to influence last intron removal. However, it is unknown whether alternative polyadenylation events influence alternative splicing decisions at upstream exons. Knockdown of the polyadenylation factors CFIm25 or CstF64 was used as an approach in identifying alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing events on a genome-wide scale. Although hundreds of alternative splicing events were found to be differentially spliced in the knockdown of CstF64, genes associated with alternative polyadenylation did not exhibit an increased incidence of alternative splicing. These results demonstrate that the coupling between alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing is usually limited to defining the last exon. The striking influence of CstF64 knockdown on alternative splicing can be explained through its effects on UTR selection of known splicing regulators such as hnRNP A2/B1, thereby indirectly influencing splice site selection. We conclude that changes in the expression of the polyadenylation factor CstF64 influences alternative splicing through indirect effects.

DESIGN
HeLa cell line was stably transfected with shRNA plasmids targeting CstF64. Total RNA was isolated from CstF64 KD cells and wild-type control cells using Trizol according to manufacturerâ€™s protocols. Samples were deep sequenced in duplicate using the Illumina GAIIx system.
