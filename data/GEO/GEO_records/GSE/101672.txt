TITLE
Identification of GLYMA.06G314400 and GLYMA.13G317000 binding sites in soybean early maturation embryos

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
To dissect the gene regulatory networks operating during soybean embryo development, we identified the binding sites genome-wide for transcription factor GLYMA.06G314400 and GLYMA.13G317000 in early maturation embryos using ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
Identification of GLYMA.06G314400 and GLYMA.13G317000 binding sites in soybean embryos at the early maturation stage.  ChIP and total chromatin controls (input) were obtained for two biological replicates.  A total of 6 samples were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL19246 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Glycine max)
