TITLE
Profiling of Cell cycle genes dysregulated by knockdown of lncRNAs at 8q24.21 using Nanostring Gene Expression Assay

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idetification of cell cycle-related genes dysregulated by knockdown of CARLos (lncRNAs) in colorectal cancer-derived HCT116 Idetification of cell cycle-related genes dysregulated by knockdown of CARLos (lncRNAs) in prostate cancer-derived PC3

DESIGN
Using siRNAs targeting CARLos, the cells were transfected and RNA samples from the treated cells were subjected to Nanostring Gene Expression Assay
