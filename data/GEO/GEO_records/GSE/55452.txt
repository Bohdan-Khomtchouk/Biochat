TITLE
Age-dependent changes in phosphorylation of signaling molecules in brain tissues of Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To demonstrate the utility of the newly developed dendron-coated phosphokinase antibody array(DPA) in which the antibodies are immobilized on a dendron-coated glass slide, the phosphorylation profiles of brain tissue samples obtained from Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice were generated.

DESIGN
The phosphorylation profiles were generated from four conditions of mice brain tissues; normal at the age of 2month, AD at the age of 2month, normal at the age of 6month and AD at the age of 6month. For each conditions, the profiling was done with three biological replicates (n=3).
