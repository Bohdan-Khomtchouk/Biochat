TITLE
The effect of short term Rapamycin on the transcriptome of old mouse liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of gene expression in the livers of old mice (25 months of age) fed rapamycin short term (6 months) Rapamycin from 19 months of age.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from livers of 25 month old C57BL6/N male and female mice started on control or 14 ppm rapamycin (Rapa) from 19 months of age on 6 months of treatment. Number of samples total: 42, with 10 samples in Control males, 12 samples in Rapa males, 9 samples in Control Females, and 11 samples in Rapa Females
