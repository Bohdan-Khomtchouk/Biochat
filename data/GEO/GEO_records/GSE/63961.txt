TITLE
Analysis of wildtype and Csnk2b-deficient Foxp3+ regulatory T cells transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the transcriptional changes evoked by Csnk2b-deficiency in Foxp3+ regulatory T cells

DESIGN
Messenger RNA profiles of CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells isolated from 8 week old wild type (WT) and Csnk2b-deficient mice were generated by deep sequencing in duplicate, using Illumina MiSeq

PLATFORM
GPL16417 Illumina MiSeq (Mus musculus)
