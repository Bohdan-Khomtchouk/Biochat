TITLE
HCT116 MYC 3' TBE1 (WT) and KO RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA was sequenced from HCT116 MYC 3' TBE1 (WT) and KO cells to identify genes differentially expressed after deletion of the MYC 3' TBE1

DESIGN
mRNA levels from two biological replicates of HCT116 MYC 3' TBE1 (WT) and KO cells were examined

PLATFORM
