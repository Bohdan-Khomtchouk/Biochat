TITLE
Allergen-challenged CD4+ cells from patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) is a complex disease that is caused by many interacting genes and environmental factors. It is also an excellent model disease for clinical studies; it is common, it is seasonal, and since it takes place in the nasal cavity it can be studied in vivo non-invasively. Furthermore, the key disease cell, the Th2 cell is known. We study SAR using allergen-challenged CD4+ cells from allergic patients.

DESIGN
Samples were obtained from 3 patients with SAR; each separated into allergen-challenged samples and unchallenged controls.
