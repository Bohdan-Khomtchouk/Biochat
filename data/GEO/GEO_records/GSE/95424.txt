TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of liver tissue in HBV - associated liver fibrosis mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose:Next-generation sequencing (NGS) were performed to investigate the differentially expressed molecular signature that were associated with HBV-mediated liver fibrosis Method: four cDNA libraries of separated groups ranging from 1, 3, 6-months post injection were constructed in the HBV (-) and analyzed using RNA-seq. results: Sequencing of the clean reads resulted in ~29â€“40 million reads per sample, for a total of ~438 million reads across 12 samples.  Specifically, an average of 16,782, 17,088, 18,701, and 19,364 genes were identified  in the HBV (+) mouse (1, 3, 6-months post injection) and HBV (-) mouse (control groups), respectively.

DESIGN
Analysis mRNA profiles of HBV(+) mouse samples from 1, 3, 6-months post injection and HBV(-) mouse samples.
