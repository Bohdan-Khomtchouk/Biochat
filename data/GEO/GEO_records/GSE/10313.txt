TITLE
Identifying Novel Predictors of Resistance to DNA Damaging Agents

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have investigated whether gene expression signatures can be used to predict inter-individual responses to DNA damaging agents We used microarrays to detail inter-individual variation in gene expression across a healthy population under basal and damage induced conditions Keywords: dose (MNNG)
