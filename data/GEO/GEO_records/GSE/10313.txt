TITLE
Identifying Novel Predictors of Resistance to DNA Damaging Agents

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have investigated whether gene expression signatures can be used to predict inter-individual responses to DNA damaging agents We used microarrays to detail inter-individual variation in gene expression across a healthy population under basal and damage induced conditions Keywords: dose (MNNG)

DESIGN
lymphoblastoid cell lines that are part of the NIHPDR were examine for gene expression differences as well as killing upon exposure to MNNG
