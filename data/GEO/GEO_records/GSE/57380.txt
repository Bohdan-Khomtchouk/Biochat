TITLE
Coexistent ARID1A-PIK3CA mutations promote ovarian clear cell tumorigenesis through pro-tumorigenic inflammatory cytokine signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is an aggressive form of ovarian cancer with high ARID1A mutation rates.  Here we present a genetically engineered mouse model of OCCC.  We find that ARID1A inactivation is not sufficient for tumor formation, but requires concurrent activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit, PIK3CA.  Remarkably, the mice develop highly penetrant tumors with OCCC-like histopathology, culminating in hemorrhagic ascites and a median survival period of 7.5 weeks.  Therapeutic treatment with the pan-PI3K inhibitor, BKM120, prolonged mouse survival by inhibiting tumor cell growth.  Cross-species gene expression comparisons support a role for IL-6 inflammatory cytokine signaling in OCCC pathogenesis.  We further show that ARID1A-PIK3CA mutations cooperate to promote tumor growth through sustained IL-6 overproduction.  Our findings establish an epistatic relationship between SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling and PI3K pathway mutations in OCCC and demonstrate that these pathways converge on pro-tumorigenic cytokine signaling.  We propose that ARID1A protects against inflammation-driven tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from mouse primary tumor samples or contral ovaries to use on Affymetrix microarrays. As the tumor was induced in only the right ovary, we used the left (control) ovary for a paired analysis in a total of eight mice.
