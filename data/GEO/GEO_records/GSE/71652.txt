TITLE
Alterations in serum microRNA in humans with alcohol use disorders impact cell proliferation and cell death pathways and predict structural and functional changes in brain [mouse NSC miRNA 2.0]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed a global analysis of extracellular miRNAs in the serum of human subjects diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) to identify robust biomarkers of early brain damage or dysfunction. This was performed in a set of 20 AUD subjects and 10 age-matched controls. They were subjected to comprehensive medical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging tests, followed by comparison of miRNA levels found in peripheral blood serum. The levels of miRNAs were quantified using two independent high-throughput methods: Affymetrix microarray and Illumina next-generation RNA-sequencing. Cross-species validation was performed using rat drinking models and mouse neural stem cell culture models, with tissue specificity of the serum miRNAs examined using additional RNA-sequencing of serum and body tissues in untreated rats. This data series includes the mouse neural stem cell miRNA 2.0 GeneChip data only but is part of a larger SuperSeries (GSE71579).

DESIGN
A total of 14 miRNA 2.0 GeneChips were run on small RNA purified from the mouse neural stem cell samples.
