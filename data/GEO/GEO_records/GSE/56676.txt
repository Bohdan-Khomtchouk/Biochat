TITLE
Detect genomic aberrations between PB1 and its counterpart, spindle-chromosome complex in human MII oocyte, PB2 and female pronucleus in human zygote at a single-cell level.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diseases transmit maternally and cause severe phenotypes. Since no effective treatment or genetic screening is available, nuclear genome transfer between patientsâ€™ and healthy eggs to replace mutant mtDNAs holds promises. Since polar body contains very few mitochondria and share same genomic material as oocyte, here we perform polar body transfer to prevent the transmission of inherited mtDNA variants. We compare the value of different germline genome transfer (spindle-chromosome, pronuclear, first and second polar body) in a mouse model. Reconstructed embryos support normal fertilization and produce live offspring. Strikingly, genetic analysis confirms F1 generation after polar body transfer possesses minimal donor mtDNA carry-over compared with spindle-chromosome (low/medium carry-over) and pronuclear (medium/high carry-over) transfer. Moreover, mtDNA genotype remains stable in F2 generation of progeny after polar body transfer. Our preclinical model demonstrates polar body transfer holds great potential in preventing the transmission of inherited mtDNA diseases.

DESIGN
The objective of the present study was to detect genomic aberrations between PB1 and its counterpart, spindle-chromosome complex in human MII oocyte, PB2 and female pronucleus in human zygote at a single-cell level.
