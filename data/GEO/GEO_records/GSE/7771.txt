TITLE
Glycodelin-induced changes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent reports suggest that glycodelin induces epithelial differentiation. Little is known about the mechanisms involved in this process. To elucidate this we transfected glycodelin-negative MCF-7 breast cancer cells with glycodelin cDNA. Cells transfected with a vector in which glycodelin cDNA was in antisense orientation were used as non-glycodelin-producing controls. Oligo microarray was performed to study gene expression changes between glycodelin-transfected and control cells. Keywords: Cell type comparison, genetic modification
