TITLE
RNA-seq of naive and primed ES cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we propose a set of molecular criteria for evaluating the naive human pluripotent state. We show by RNA-seq that transcription of transposable elements provides a sensitive measure of the concordance between pluripotent stem cells and early human development.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of 4 naive ES samples in 4i/LA, 3 naive ES samples in 5i/LA, 2 transgene-dependant naive ES cell samples, and 5 primed ES cell samples (in hESM)

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
