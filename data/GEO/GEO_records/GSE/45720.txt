TITLE
Beta-tubulin and Actin Filament-Associating Small GTPase GIMAP4 is Required for IFN-Æ” Secretion During Early Human CD4+ T Cell Activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the dataset was to study on a genome-wide level the effect of GTPase of the human immune associated protein 4 (GIMAP4) knockdown on the gene expression of resting T cells and immediately after T cell activation and Th1(Act+IL12) polarizing conditions of human cord blood-derived CD4+ T cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA from GIMAP4 siRNA-treated cord blood CD4+ T cells 48 hours after siRNA treatment, before TCR activation and corresponding cells cultured for 2h in TCR activating (antiCD3+antiCD28) plus IL-12 conditions was compared to total RNA from nonspecific control siRNA-treated cells. Samples from 3 biological replicates were analysed.
