TITLE
Genetic Framework for GATA Factor Function in Vascular Biology

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Vascular endothelial dysfunction underlies the genesis and progression of numerous diseases. Whereas the GATA transcription factor GATA-2 is expressed in endothelial cells and is implicated in coronary heart disease, it has been studied predominantly as a master regulator of hematopoiesis. As many questions remain unanswered regarding GATA-2 function in the vascular biology realm, we used ChIP-seq and loss-of-function strategies to define the GATA-2-instigated genetic network in human endothelial cells. By contrast to erythroid cells, GATA-2 occupied a unique target gene ensemble, consisting of genes encoding key determinants of endothelial cell identity and inflammation. GATA-2-occupied sites characteristically contained motifs that bind Activator Protein-1 (AP-1), a pivotal regulator of inflammatory genes. GATA-2 frequently occupied the same chromatin sites as c-JUN and c-FOS, heterodimeric components of AP-1. Though all three components were required for maximal AP-1 target gene expression, GATA-2 was not required for AP-1 chromatin occupancy. GATA-2 conferred maximal phosphorylation of chromatin-bound c-JUN at Ser 73, which stimulates AP-1-dependent transactivation, in a chromosomal context-dependent manner. This work establishes a link between a GATA factor and inflammation, mechanistic insights underlying GATA-2-AP-1 cooperativity, and a rigorous genetic framework for understanding GATA-2 function in normal and pathophysiological vascular states.
