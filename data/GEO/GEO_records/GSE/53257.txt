TITLE
Mitoscriptome analysis to understand the pathogenesis of Diabetic Retinopathy using tissue microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a progressive disease affecting the structure and cellular composition of the microvasculature. Several factors like genetic, environmental and biochemical are involved in the development of DR. However, the inheritance pattern of this disease is multi factorial resulting from the interaction of one or more genes but the exact mechanism is not completely understood. Over the decade there has been alot of molecular genetics work done in nuclear genome for DR in different ethnic groups and  identified several candidate genes involved in disease pathogenesis but the role of these genes in the development of disease is not yet clearly understood.  Recently there are very few reports in determining the role of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of DR but no such studies are reported so far in India. The high relevance of mitochondria in the maintenance of cellular structure and function places mitoscriptome analysis as an important piece of the puzzle in understanding the pathogenesis of DR. Therefore we would like to focus on entire Human Mitoscriptome gene expression profile in relation to DR which could help us to identify new biomarker in health and disease condition.
