TITLE
DNA methylation profiles across different brain regions in APP/PSEN1 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and APP/PSEN1 mice.  A custom Illumina Golden Gate DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 800 CpGs.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 96 samples were hybridised to the Illumina custom golden gate DNA methylation array.

PLATFORM
