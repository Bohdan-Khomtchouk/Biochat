TITLE
SigX ECF sigma factor deletion mutant expression profile in Pseudomonas aeruginosa in M9 minimal medium (M9G)

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Analysis of a SigX knockout mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa H103 strain in minimal medium with glucose as carbon source (M9G). SigX, one of the 19 extra-cytoplasmic function sigma factors of P. aeruginosa, was only known to be involved in transcription of the gene encoding the major outer membrane protein OprF in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Deletion of the  ECF sigma factor sigX gene provide insights into the SigX role in several virulence and biofilm- related phenotypes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

DESIGN
To better understand the cellular function of SigX, a deletion mutant of the sigX gene (PAOSX) was generated and its expression profile was compared with parental strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa H103. To this end, H103 and a sigX mutant were cultured in M9G, in which their growth are similar. Three independant biological replicate were taken for the RNA extraction and hybridization on affymetrix array in the middle of the exponential growth phase.
