TITLE
Expression data from normal B cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells -- with/without treatment of Wnt3a

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wnt pathway is dysregulated in CLL-We characterized Wnt pathway gene expression in normal B and CLL-B cells and identified Wnt targets in normal B and CLL-B cells through this data set. In this dataset, we included normal B cells and CLL-B cells for Wnt pathway gene expression. This leads to the identification of 62 Wnt pathway components which are differnetially expressed between normal and CLl-B cells. We also included normal B cells and CLL-B cells with or without Wnt3a treatment and identified 468 and 676 Wnt regulated genes in normal and CLL B cells, respectively.

DESIGN
24 normal B cells and 179 CLL-B cells were used in the Wnt pathway gene expression analysis. Three normal and three CLL samples were included in the identification of Wnt regulated targets
