TITLE
Shear Stress and NOTCH1 Regulate Calcification Related Genes in Human Aortic Valve Endothelium (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are interested in the role of NOTCH1 and Shear Stress in Aortic Valve Endothelium.

DESIGN
Primary human aortic valve endothelium was subjected to 4 conditions in vitro. 1) Control siRNA, No shear stress. 2) NOTCH1 siRNA, No shear stress. 3) Control siRNA, 15 dynes/cm2 shear stress. 4) NOTCH1 siRNA, 15 dynes/cm2 shear stress. Triplicates of each condition were pooled for library perp and sequencing
