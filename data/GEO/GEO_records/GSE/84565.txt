TITLE
Effect of JAK blockade on IFNa response in CD4+ T cells in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD4+ T cells respond robustly to type 1 interferons which signal through JAK1 and TYK2. Here we analyzed the effects of a panel of JAK inhibitors on the IFNa transcriptional response in activated CD4+ T cells in vitro.

DESIGN
Splenic CD4+  T cells were isolated by negative selection from 6wk old male C57BL/6 mice. These were activated with CD3/28 beads for 48hrs and thereafter cultured with IFNa (100U/ml) in the presence or absence of JAK inhibitors at IC80 for 2hrs or 8hrs in vitro. Cells were then transferred directly into TriZol. RNA was prepared in Trizol for gene expression profiling by  Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
