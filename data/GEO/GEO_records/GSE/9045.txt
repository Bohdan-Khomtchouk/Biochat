TITLE
Regulation of gene expression by MafA phosphorylation in transformed cells.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transformation of Chicken Embryo fibroblast by MafA is dependent on its phosphorylation status. Using microarray analysis, we identify a gene expression subprogram regulated by MafA phosphorylation. Keywords: phosphorylation mediated transcriptional regulation

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from Chicken Embryo Fibroblasts expressing control (RCAS), MafA-WT, MafA-4A using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA from two independent cultures for each condition were analyzed and processed by the genomic facility of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle) using a 13K chicken microarray ( http://www.fhcrc.org/science/shared_resources/genomics/dna_array ). For one set of sample, dye swap experiments were performed.
