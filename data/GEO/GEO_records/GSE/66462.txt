TITLE
SW1 mutant vs Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 wild-type strain

ORGANISM
Shewanella piezotolerans WP3

SUMMARY
The prophage and RF DNA of SW1 were removed from WP3 to construct the phage-free strain. The two strains were cultured at 20MPa and 4Â°C and the transcriptional profiles were compared.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates sample and 6 technical replicates for each experiment

PLATFORM
GPL16568 Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 whole genome microarray
