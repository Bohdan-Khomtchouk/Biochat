TITLE
Cytoplasmic Assembly and Selective Nuclear Import of Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE4/siRNA Complexes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Here we profiled small RNAs from whole cell,  cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from three-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings. We unexpectedly found that nuclear functional hc-siRNAs are predominantly present in the cytoplasm.

DESIGN
Samples from Arabidopsis thaliana whole cell,  cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts with 3 replicates for each.  9 samples in all.
