TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris CECT 8666 in response to agmatine

ORGANISM
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris

SUMMARY
The goal was to determine the effect of agmatine on the trancriptional profile of L. lactis CECT 8666 strain. For that we compared the expression profile of L. lactis CECT 8666 cells grown in culture medium supplemented with 20 mM agmatine with the expression profile of L. lactis CECT 8666 cells grown in culture medium without agmatine.

DESIGN
L. lactis CECT 8666 cells grown in GalM17 medium (reference) compared to L. lactis CECT 8666 cells grown in GalM17 medium supplemented with 20 mM agmatine (test).

PLATFORM
