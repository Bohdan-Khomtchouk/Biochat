TITLE
Normalisation Against Circadian and Age-related Disturbances Enables Robust Detection of Gene Expression Changes in Liver of Aged Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pilot experiment to uncover age-related changes of the mouse liver transcriptome derived from healthy male mice. To avoid bias, RNA samples from multiple time points over the day were combined.

DESIGN
For each age point, we pooled equal amounts of liver RNA from six time points per day and from four animals each.
