TITLE
Gene expression profile of response to auxin at 3 h after treatment in rice root tips: IR64 vs Dro1-NIL

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of response to auxin at 3 h after treatment in rice root tips: IR64 (loss-of-function of DRO1 type) vs Near-isogenic line homozygous for the Kinandang Patong allele of DRO1 in an IR64 genetic background (Dro1-NIL; gain-of-function of DRO1 type)

DESIGN
We used two rice varieties, IR64 and near-isogenic line homozygous for the Kinandang Patong allele of DRO1 in an IR64 genetic background (Dro1-NIL). We performed comprehensive microarray analysis of rice root tips with auxin treatment (3h) and pre-treatment (0h) in IR64 and Dro1-NIL. Seedling root tips of IR64 and Dro1-NIL were treated with 10 ÂµM 2,4-D. n = 3 biological repeats (15 seedlings per repeat).
