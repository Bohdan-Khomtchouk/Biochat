TITLE
Gene expression in liver of morbidly obese patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of liver disease affecting 20-30% of the population in developed countries. NAFLD is strongly associated with abdominal obesity and is recognized as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. In a subgroup of patients with NAFLD inflammation and fibrosis develops, this so-called Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A multi-hit hypothesis has been proposed in which during the first “hit” fat accumulation occurs in hepatocytes from excessive delivery of fatty acids from adipose tissue, in addition there is an imbalance in lipid synthesis and export. However, the reason why fat accumulation is subsequently followed by inflammation and fibrosis in some patients is poorly understood. We studied the role of gene expression at the transcriptional level using microarray in bariatric patients from whom the liver histology was available.

DESIGN
Patients scheduled for bariatric surgery were recruited in Pretoria/South-Africa. At the time of the procedure, tissue samples of the visceral and subcutaneous fat were taken for molecular analysis as well as liver tissue for histology, also full biochemical data was collected. Patients were grouped according histology: group I ( < 5% steatosis), group II (NAFLD, 30-50% steatosis) and group III (NASH). The 15 samples were used for microarray (nr patients respectively for stages I-II-III: 6-4-5).
