TITLE
Low- and High-Grade Mucoepidermoid Carcinomas have different genomic profiles and CRTC1-MAML2 Fusion Gene Status

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using high-resolution oligonucleotide arrayCGH, FISH, and RT-PCR we have performed a comprehensive analysis of genomic imbalances, and CRTC1-MAML2 gene fusion status in a series of 28 well characterized mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MECs) with the aims to identify distinct differences in genomic profiles and CRTC1-MAML2 gene fusion status between low- and high-grade MECs.

DESIGN
High-resolution aCGH (44K/244K) on fresh frozen and paraffin embedded tissue from 28 well-characterized MECs.

PLATFORM
GPL2879 Agilent-013282 Human Genome CGH Microarray 44B (Feature number version) GPL4091 Agilent-014693 Human Genome CGH Microarray 244A (Feature number version)
