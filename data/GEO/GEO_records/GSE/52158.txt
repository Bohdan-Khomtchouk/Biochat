TITLE
Dynamic developmental signaling logic underlying lineage bifurcations during human endoderm induction and patterning from pluripotent stem cells [Expression data set]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The definitive endoderm germ layer is the provenance of multiple internal organs, including the lungs, liver, pancreas and intestines. Molecular events driving initial endoderm germ layer specification and subsequent anterior-posterior patterning of endoderm into distinct organ primordia remain largely cryptic. Through microarray analyses, we captured genome-wide transcriptional dynamics driving successive stages of endoderm development with the intent of identifying novel regulatory genes or diagnostic markers that respectively drive or mark endoderm committment.

DESIGN
HES3 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were differentiated into highly homogeneous endodermal progenitor populations, and microarray analyses were conducted of six different populations at different tiers of the endodermal lineage hierarchy: undifferentiated hESCs, anterior primitive streak (day 1 of in vitro differentiation), definitive endoderm (day 3) and anterior foregut, posterior foregut or midgut/hindgut patterned endoderm populations (day 7). Additionally, we compared hESCs differentiated using two alternative endoderm induction protocols, serum-based or AFBLy-based differentiation (both day 3 of differentiation).
