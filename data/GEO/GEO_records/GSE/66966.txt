TITLE
Analysis of bone marrow derived mast cell transcriptomes in presence or absence of SialostatinL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goal of this study was to compare transcriptional changes in stimulated mast cells in the absence or presence of sialostatinL

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 4 weeks old mast cells (BMMC derived from C57BL/6 mice ) stimulated for 24h with ionomycin in absence or presence of tick derived sialostatinL were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2000

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
