TITLE
Gene expression regulation in response to heat stress in different yeast strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Different yeast strains were subjected to heat stresss; samples were collected at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes after heat stress; microarray analysis were performed using the Affymetrix Y-GS98 microarray.

DESIGN
7 time points, heat stress, 3 strains
