TITLE
Gene expression profiling of 19 bladder cancers from the University of Virginia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Given the heterogeneity of disease evident from study of the presentation, histomorphology, disease course, and molecular lesions of bladder cancer, a cohort of 8 non-muscle invasive and 11 muscle invasive bladder cancers were profiled for gene expression using the Affymetrix HG-U133A platform.

DESIGN
Under an IRB-approved protocol, snap frozen tissues for 19 cases of bladder cancer were procured and profiled for gene expression using Affymetrix HG-U133A microarrays.
