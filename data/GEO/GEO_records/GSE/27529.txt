TITLE
Inhibition of miR-9 regulates HuR and DICER1 and blocks Hodgkin Lymphoma tumor outgrowth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An Hodgkin Lymphoma cell line have been treated with an LNA inhibitor for miR-9 or with a scramble LNA to identify miR-9 regulated pathways that could be important for Hodgkin Lymphoma pathogenesis.

DESIGN
L428 cells were transfected with a miR-9 LNA inhibitor or a scrambled LNA. Total RNA was harvested 9 hours post-transfection and analyzed on Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 human arrays. A total of six arrays were analyzed. For filtering, uninformative genes with the same expression level across all arrays (including non-expressed genes) were removed and the differentially expressed genes, their corresponding p-values and false discovery rates were calculated using limma.
