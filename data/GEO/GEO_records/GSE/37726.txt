TITLE
A novel miRNA produced during lytic HSV-1 infection is important for efficient replication in tissue culture.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a HSV-1 encoded miRNA present during lytic infection that influences replication efficiency in a tissue culture model.  miRNAs were identified using high-throughput sequencing of HSV-1 infected epithelial cells.  Functional assays were performed by mutating the miRNA coding region and testing grow of the mutant in vitro.

DESIGN
Construction of a miRNA library and sequencing to reveal novel viral miRNAs from lytically infected cells

PLATFORM
GPL10999 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Homo sapiens)
