TITLE
Expression profile of bcl11b-deficient NAÏVE CD8+ T cells versus wild type

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Naïve CD44low CD25low CD8+ T cells from Bcl11bF/F/dLck-iCre and wild type mice at steady state were sorted at 90% purity, RNA was extracted and profile for mRNA expression to identify mRNAs differentially expressed in Bcl11b-/- naïve CD8+ T cells versus wild type.

DESIGN
Naïve CD44low CD25low CD8+ T cells purified from Bcl11bF/F/dLck-iCre and wild type mice and investigated for mRNA expression

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
