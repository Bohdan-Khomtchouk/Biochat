TITLE
Estrogen-dependent gene expression in human breast cancer cells relies upon proteosome-dependent monoubiquitination of histone H2B

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) determines breast cancer cell phenotype and is a prognostic indicator. A better understanding of the mechanisms controlling ERα function may uncover improved strategies for the treatment of breast cancer. Proteasome inhibition was previously reported to regulate estrogen-induced transcription but the mechanisms by which it influences ERα function remain controversial. In this study we investigated the transcriptome-wide effects of the proteasome inhibitor Velcade on estrogen-regulated transcription in MCF7 human breast cancer cells and demonstrate a specific global decrease in estrogen-induced transcription.

DESIGN
This set contains 21 microarray samples. 3 controls, 3 estrogen stimulated, 3 Bortezomib + estrogen stimulated, 2* 3 siRNA controls, 3 siRNA PSMB3 knockdowns, 3 siRNA PSMB5 knockdowns
