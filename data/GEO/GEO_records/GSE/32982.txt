TITLE
Androgen regulated gene expression in human prostate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgens are a prequisite for the development of human prostate and prostate cancer. Androgen action is mediated via androgen receptor. Androgen ablation therapy is used for the treatment of metastasized prostate cancer. The aim of the study was to identify genes differentially expressed in benign human prostate, prostate cancer and in prostate tissue three days after castration. These genes are potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. We used microarrays to examine the gene expression profiles in benign prostate adjacent to prostate cancer and prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens and in prostate tissue samples taken 3 days after surgical castration performed for treatment of prostate cancer.

DESIGN
Human prostate tissue was obtained from radical prostatectomy samples and from prostate biopsy samples (castrated samples). Benign and malignant tissues samples were microdissected from prostatectomy samples. Tissues were used for RNA isolation and were further processed as samples for microarray. Three prostatectomy samples were used as replicates (benign and malignant prostate). All prostate cancers were Gleason 3+3 pattern. Castrated tissue samples were taken from patients three days after surgical castration for the treatment of advanced or metastasized prostate cancer. Six biopsies were taken from each subject and individual subject samples were used as three replicates in microarray.
