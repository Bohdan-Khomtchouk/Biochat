TITLE
The Smc3 deacetylase Hos1 closes the cohesin acetylation cycle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Cohesion between sister chromatids is mediated by the chromosomal cohesin complex. In budding yeast, cohesin is loaded onto chromosomes during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. During S-phase, the replication fork-associated acetyltransferase Eco1 acetylates the cohesin subunit Smc3 to promote establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. At the time of anaphase, Smc3 loses its acetylation again, but the Smc3 deacetylase and possible importance of Smc3 deacetylation are unknown. Here, we show that the class I histone deacetylase family member Hos1 is responsible for Smc3 deacetylation. Cohesin is protected from deacetylation while bound to chromosomes, but is deacetylated as soon as it dissociates from chromosomes following separase cleavage at anaphase onset. Non-acetylated Smc3 is required as a substrate for cohesion establishment in the following cell cycle. Our results complete the description of the Smc3 acetylation cycle and provide unexpected insight into the importance of de novo Smc3 acetylation for cohesion establishment.

DESIGN
The Affymetrix Saccharomyces cerevisiae Chip Tiling 1.0F Arrays were used to analyze the binding pattern of both the wild type and the K112N/K113N mutated version of Smc3 along the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
