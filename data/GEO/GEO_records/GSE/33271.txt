TITLE
Expression of motor proteins in transgenic HeLa cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We employed whole transcriptome microarray profiling to measure the expression of myosin and kinesin genes in multiple HeLa cell lines and confirm the expression of recombinantly-tagged BAC transgenes encoding motor genes.

DESIGN
Normal and transfected HeLa cells grown to confluence were harvested for extraction of total RNA and microarray analysis
