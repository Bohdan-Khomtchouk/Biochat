TITLE
Bacillus Stress Responses

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Bacillus subtilis exhibits a complex adaptive response to low levels of peroxides. We used global transcriptional profiling to monitor the magnitude and kinetics of changes in the mRNA population after exposure to either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butyl peroxide (t-buOOH). The peroxide stimulons could be largely accounted for by three regulons controlled by the PerR, B, and OhrR transcription factors. Three members of the PerR regulon (katA, mrgA, and zosA) were strongly induced by H2O2 and weakly induced by t-buOOH. The remaining members of the PerR regulon were only modestly up-regulated by peroxide treatment. Overall, the magnitude of peroxide induction of PerR regulon genes corresponded well with the extent of derepression in a perR mutant strain. The B regulon was activated by 58 µM H2O2 but not by 8 µM H2O2 and was strongly activated by either t-buOOH or, in a control experiment, tert-butyl alcohol. Apart from the B regulon there was a single gene, ohrA, that was strongly and rapidly induced by t-buOOH exposure. This gene, controlled by the peroxide-sensing repressor OhrR, was not induced by any of the other conditions tested.
