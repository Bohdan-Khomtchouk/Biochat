TITLE
Vancomycin nephrotoxicity assessed by DNA microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (VCM) represents one of the last lines of defense against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. However, vancomycin is nephrotoxic, but the mechanism of toxicity is still unclear. The goal of this study was twofold: (1) gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of vancomycin nephrotoxicity at the genomic level and (2) evaluate potential biomarkers (gene expression profiles) of vancomycin-induced kidney injury Keywords: Dose response
