TITLE
microRNA expression in the megabladder mouse model of CKD and CON

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Congenital obstructive nephropathy (CON) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children. CON is a complex disease process involving pathological changes in kidney development and function that occur as a result of obstructed antegrade urine flow beginning in utero. The megabladder (mgb-/-) mouse is an animal model of CON that develops kidney disease secondary to a bladder-specific defect in smooth muscle development. Expression levels of specific microRNAs were compared by microarray analysis on the Agilent platform and by quantitative PCR (qPCR) of kidney samples from wild type and mgb-/- mice.

DESIGN
MicroRNA expression was measured in control and megabladder mouse kidneys. A total of 4 control kidneys were compared to 4 mutant kidneys from age-matched male animals.

PLATFORM
GPL20689 Agilent-021828 Unrestricted Mouse miRNA Microarray (V2) (Probe name version)
