TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for cone precursor derived retinoblastoma like samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Retinoblastoma is a childhood retinal tumor that initiates in response to biallelic RB1 inactivation. We show that post-mitotic human cone precursors are uniquely sensitive to the oncogenic effects of Rb depletion.  Rb knockdown induced cone precursor proliferation in prospectively isolated populations.   SNP-array analysis of two Rb/p130-depleted cone precursor cell lines, revealing no megabase-size loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or copy number alterations (CNAs). SNP-array analysis of one Rb/p130-depleted (tumor 1) or one Rb-depleted (tumor 2) cone precursor-derived tumors, revealing no megabase-size LOH or CNAs, consistent with the lack of DNA copy number alterations in some retinoblastomas.  Thus, the cone precursor tumors resembled human retinoblastomas at the molecular cytogenetic level.

DESIGN
High resolution SNP-array DNA copy number analyses were performed using CytoScanÂ® HD (Affymetrix, 901835) according to the manufacturer's directions. Data were analyzed using Chromosome Analysis Suite 2.0 (Affymetrix). DNA was extracted from two Rb/p130 depleted cone precursor cell lines and two cryopreserved mouse retinoblastoma samples from eyes xenograted with Rb/p130 or Rb depleted cone precursors. Affymetrix SNP analysis on retinoblastoma cell lines Y79, RB176, and WERI were used as control. Normal human genome 19 was used as reference.
