TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of IFNa response in WT and STAT3KO MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profiles in MEF cell lines in the absence or presence of STAT3 following IFNa stimulation. This study is to unveil possible role of STAT3 during type I IFN-mediated gene induction and functions.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from WT or STAT3KO MEFs stimulated without or with IFNa 1000 U/ml for 2 h.
