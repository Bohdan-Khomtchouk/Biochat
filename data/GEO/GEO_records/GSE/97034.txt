TITLE
Changes in miRNA expression during wound healing in mouse aged skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the candidate miRNAs that might compromise wound healing and contribute to the age-associated delay in wound repair, global miRNA profiling was performed in mouse back telogen skin of young (8-week-old) and aged (2-year-old) animals.

DESIGN
A full-thickness 3 mm wound was introduced by punch biopsy onto mouse back skin at the telogen stage of the hair cycle. Skin samples were collected on days 0, 3, 5, and 7 after wounding and were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
