TITLE
Gene expression in liver of wild-type and Dicer1-KO mice treated with genotoxic carcinogen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the possible changes of gene expression induced by a carcinogen, we treated wild-type and Dicer1-KO mice with one dose of 120 mg/kg N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), a model genotoxic carcinogen, and vehicle control. The gene expression profiles were assessed in the mouse livers in wild-type and Dicer1-KO mice design. Total RNA were isolated from the livers at days 15 after the treatment and their expression was determined using Gene Array.

DESIGN
Gene expression in treated wild-type and Dicer1-KO mice was measured at 15 days after exposure to one dose of 120 mg/kg N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU).  Each treatment duplex ,Drug-ko-a,Drug-ko-b,Drug-wt-a,Drug-wt-b,Control-ko-a,Control-ko-b,Control-wt-a,Control-wt-b.
