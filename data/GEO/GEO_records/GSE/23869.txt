TITLE
Adult grade II astrocytomas are genetically distinct from their pediatric counterparts, and display a more stem cell-like expression pattern linked with more aggressive behaviour

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have used microarray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) at 1Mb resolution to study copy number changes in a series of WHO Grade II Astrocytomas (n=21). We have used Illumina arrays to study genome-wide expression patterns in a series of WHO Grade II Astrocytomas (n=10). Keywords: Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH), Expression microarray

DESIGN
[aCGH]: Single hybridization per case. 21 astrocytomas WHO grade II were analyzed. Target (tumor) labelled with Cy5 and reference with Cy3. Mixture of 20 normal male or female genomic DNA was used in sex-mismatched hybridization. [mRNA]: Single hybridization per case. 10 astrocytomas WHO grade II were analyzed (5 adult, 5 pediatric)
