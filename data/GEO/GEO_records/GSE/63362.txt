TITLE
Identification of sexually dimorphically expressed genes in rat tissues

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The sexually dimorphic expression of genes across 26 somatic rat tissues was using Affymetrix RAE-230 genechips. We considered probesets to be sexually dimorphically expressed (SDE) if they were measurably expressed above background in at least one sex, there was at least a two-fold difference in expression (dimorphism) between the sexes, and the differences were statistically significant after correcting for false discovery. 14.5% of expressed probesets were SDE in at least one tissue, with higher expression nearly twice as prevalent in males compared to females. Most were SDE  in a single tissue. Surprisingly, nearly half of the probesets that were (SDE) in multiple tissues were oppositely sex biased in different tissues, and most SDE probesets were also expressed without sex bias in other tissues. Two genes were widely SDE: Xist (female-only) and Eif2s3y (male-only). The frequency of SDE probesets varied widely between tissues, and was highest in the duodenum (6.2%), whilst less than 0.05% in over half of the surveyed tissues. The occurrence of SDE probesets was not strongly correlated between tissues. Within individual tissues, however, relational networks of SDE genes were identified. In the liver, networks relating to differential metabolism between the sexes were seen. The estrogen receptor was implicated in differential gene expression in the duodenum. To conclude, sexually dimorphic gene expression is common, but highly tissue-dependent. Sexually dimorphic gene expression may provide insights into mechanisms underlying phenotypic sex differences.
