TITLE
Polysome profiling of Huh7.5 cells expressing HCV NS5A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatitis C Virus protein NS5A was found to upregulate assembly of cap binding initiation complex eIF4F in Huh7.5 cells. NS5A also was found to associate with translation machinery. To understand consequences of NS5A mediation in host translation, we analyzed mRNA associated with polysome fractions of NS5A expressing Huh7.5 cells and compared them with the corresponding fractions from control cells.
