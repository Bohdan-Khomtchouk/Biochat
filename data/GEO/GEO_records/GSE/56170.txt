TITLE
Hormonal and epigenetic control of hematopoiesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the role of epigenetics and hormones on hematopoietic stem cell function, hematopoietic stem and progenitor (LSK) cells were sorted from E14.5 embryos of wild-type, DNMT3B7 hemizygous or DNMT3B7 homozygous genotype. The expression analysis was performed to provide information regarding the mechanism by which hormones regulate hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor (LSK) cells from E14.5 murine embryonic fetal livers of wild-type, or DNMT3B7 transgenic genotypes were flow-sorted, and RNA isolated for expression analysis by RNA-Sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
