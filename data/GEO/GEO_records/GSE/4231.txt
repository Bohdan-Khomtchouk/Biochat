TITLE
Comparison of Bleo, Asthma, TH2 and Infection Models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Disease-Specific Gene Expression Profiling in Multiple Models of Lung Disease We profiled lung gene expression in 12 mouse models of infection, allergy, and lung injury. A total of 24 transcripts, including many involved in inflammation and immune activation, were differentially expressed in a substantial majority (9 or more) of the models. Expression patterns distinguished three groups of models: (1) bacterial infection (n = 5), with changes in 89 transcripts, including many related to nuclear factor-B signaling, cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors; (2) bleomycin-induced diseases (n = 2), with changes in 53 transcripts, including many related to matrix remodeling and Wnt signaling; and (3) T helper cell type 2 (allergic) inflammation (n = 5), with changes in 26 transcripts, including many encoding epithelial secreted molecules, ion channels, and transporters.
