TITLE
Comparative Genomic Hybridization in traditional fermentative Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces uvarum ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C

SUMMARY
We study the genetics, including microarray karyotyping using comparative genomic hybridization to explore global changes in the genomic DNA, of four S. bayanus var uvarum strains related to traditional fermentations of very different sources comparing to the sequenced S. cerevisiae laboratory strain (S288C). Our final goal is to determine the adaptive evolution of properties of biotechnological interest in Saccharomyces yeasts. Many copy number variations (CNV) were observed, especially in genes associated to subtelomeric regions and transposon elements. Among the fermentation strains, differential CNV was observed in genes related to sugar transport and metabolism. An outstanding example of diverse CNV is the gen PUT1, involved in proline assimilation, which correlated with the adaptation of the strains to the presence of this nitrogen source in the media.

DESIGN
Four S. bayanus var. uvarum strains were obtained from natural environments and different fermentation processes. The S. cerevisiae strain S288C was used as control for microarray hybridizations. All experiments were performed using duplicate arrays, and Cy5-dCTP and Cy3-dCTP dye-swap assays were performed to reduce dye-specific bias.
