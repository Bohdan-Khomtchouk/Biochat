TITLE
Comparative Genomic Hybridization in traditional fermentative Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We study the genetics, including microarray karyotyping using comparative genomic hybridization to explore global changes in the genomic DNA, of four S. bayanus var uvarum strains related to traditional fermentations of very different sources comparing to the sequenced S. cerevisiae laboratory strain (S288C). Our final goal is to determine the adaptive evolution of properties of biotechnological interest in Saccharomyces yeasts. Many copy number variations (CNV) were observed, especially in genes associated to subtelomeric regions and transposon elements. Among the fermentation strains, differential CNV was observed in genes related to sugar transport and metabolism. An outstanding example of diverse CNV is the gen PUT1, involved in proline assimilation, which correlated with the adaptation of the strains to the presence of this nitrogen source in the media.
