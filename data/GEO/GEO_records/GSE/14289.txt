TITLE
Ftz and Eve ChIP data

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Genome wide mapping of Ftz and Eve transcription factor binding sites in early Drosophila embryos

DESIGN
Ftz has one replicate and dyes swapping Eve has two replicates with one dye swap Mock IPs were used as controls Slides were hybridized with two color samples, but individual channels were uploaded seperately to GEO

PLATFORM
