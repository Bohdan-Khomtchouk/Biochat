TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling in diabetic GK rat model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are a newly identified class of small single-stranded non-coding RNAs, regulate their target genes via post-transcriptional pathway. It has been proved that miRNAs play important roles in many biological processes. To better understand miRNA function with type 2 diabetes, we have used an oligonucleotide microarray to monitor miRNA expression profiles of GK and Wistar ratsâ€™ muscle. We found 7 miRNAs were down-expressed and 2 were over-expressed in the muscle of GK rats. Among them, miR-24 showed the most prominent change. P38 MAPK, which is a direct target of miR-24 also showed expression difference. All the data give a clue that miR-24 might be associated with diabetes through down regulation of p38 MAPK.
