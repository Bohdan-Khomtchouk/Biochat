TITLE
Expression data from Rat ventricles 3 days/28 days/42 days after STZ injection

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cardiomyopathy in type 1 diabetic patients is characterized by early onset diastolic and late onset systolic dysfunction.  The mechanism underlying development of diastolic and systolic dysfunction in diabetes remains unknown. We used microarrays to detail the ventricle gene expression changes that underly development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.  We identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: disease state analysis, time course
