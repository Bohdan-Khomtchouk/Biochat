TITLE
Global analysis of X chromosome dosage compensation

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have conducted a global analysis of somatic dosage compensation and also asked if germ cell dosage compensate by microarray analysis of gene expression in wild-type tissues. To obviate the confounding effects of scatter and especially the skewed genomic distributions of genes with sex-biased expression in both the soma and germline [there are fewer X chromosome genes with male-biased expression], we used mutations that transform sexual identity.  In the soma we used gain-of-function transformer to turn X;AA flies into somatic females with tumorous germlines.  The gonadectomized somas of these X;AA female flies were compared to similarly prepared XX;AA females.  The X;AA ovarian tumors, which are possibly the result of germline sex transformations,  were compared to the similar XX;AA ovarian tumors generated with loss-of-function alleles of ovarian tumor and Sex-lethal. We used alleles of transformer-2 and doublesex to transform XX;AA flies into somatic males with atrophic germlines. Keywords: other
