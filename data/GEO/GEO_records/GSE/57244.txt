TITLE
Tet2-/-Flt3ITD and WT stem and progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study was a comparison of gene expression using RNA-seq. We analyzed the stem and progenitor cells from WT and Vav-cre+ Tet2fl/fl Flt3-ITD (T2F3) mice. We isolated stem cells LSK (lin- sca+ kit+) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors GMP (lin- sca- kit+ fcgr+ cd34+) cells from bone marrow. Comparisons were made across genotypes WT vs. T2F3 and cell types LSK vs. GMP.

DESIGN
Comparison of WT and Tet2-/-Flt3ITD bone marrow stem and progenitor cells.
