TITLE
Expression data of transduced mouse glioblastomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic GFAP-, NES-, and SYN- CRE mice were injected with a lenti-viral construct containing a floxed RFP directly upstream of a cassette containing si-p53, GFP, and mutant HRAS. Tumors arising from the various CRE tissue specific promoters and differing injections sites were compared to normal hippocampus and cortex.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from dissected tumors and applied to microarray anaylsis using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays according to manufactures instructions
