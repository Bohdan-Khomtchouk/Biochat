TITLE
Analysis of gene expression during the early stages of zebrafish heart valve development

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report changes in the levels of gene expression between 48hpf hearts and 56hpf hearts, the initial stages of valvulogenesis

DESIGN
48hpf and 56hpf hearts were dissected and RNA was extracted. RNA profiles were then generated at each stage using Illumina deep sequencing
