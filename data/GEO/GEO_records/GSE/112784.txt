TITLE
Effect of PRSS3 knockdown in PC9 lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Response of PC9 cells to infection with NT (control) lentivirus or one of two different PRSS3 knockdown lentiviruses.

DESIGN
Cells were plated in 35 mm dishes, infected with NT lentivirus, PRSS3 KD #C24 lentivirus (NM_002771.2-454s1c1, Sigma), or PRSS3 KD #337 lentivirus (NM_002771.3-337s21c1, Sigma), then harvested after 2 days.
