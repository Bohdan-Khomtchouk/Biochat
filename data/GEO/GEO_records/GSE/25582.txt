TITLE
Time course expression data in wild-type and TF-deletion yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of transcriptional factors Gcn4, Leu3, Gat1 and Met31 in the response to 3AT-induced amino acid starvation, we performed time-course microarray studies of wild-type, single deletion and double deletion strains. The analyses provide insight into a complex regulatory response involving at least four transcription factors.

DESIGN
Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae BY4741 wild-type and deletion strains were collected at various time points after 3AT induced amino acid starvation.
