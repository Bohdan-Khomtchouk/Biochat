TITLE
Effects of novel antiandrogens (enzalutamide and ARN-509) on global gene expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) xenograft model

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global transcriptome analysis revealed altered expression of 291 genes, including mRNAs for several AR-interacting proteins and multiple enzymes involved in steroid metabolism. The data indicate that antiandrogens modify the androgen signaling in VCaP xenografts at multiple levels by reducing concentrations of active androgens, increasing AR expression and inducing alterations in the expression of AR interacting proteins, steroid metabolizing enzymes and AR downstream target genes.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analyses of vehicle (control group, n=15), enzalutamide (n=14) and ARN-509 treated (n=15) castration-resistant VCaP tumors after 4-week treatment.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
