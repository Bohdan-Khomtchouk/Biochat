TITLE
FAIRE-seq analysis of Ras transformed mouse mammary gland epithelial cells transfected with Etv4 and Etv5 siRNAs and stimulated with TGF-beta.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed global mapping of accessible chromatin in mouse mammary gland epithelial EpH4 cell line and its Ras-transformed derivative (EpRas) using formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory element (FAIRE)-sequencing (seq) to analyze the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation during TGF-beta-induced EMT.

DESIGN
FAIRE-seq was perfomed using EpRas cells transfected with Etv4 and Etv5 siRNAs and stimulated with 1 ng/ml TGF-beta or left untreated for 4 days.

PLATFORM
