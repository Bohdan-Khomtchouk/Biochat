TITLE
Targeted inhibition of human breast cancer cell lines selected as model systems of ERBB2-positive/EGFR high breast cancer [RPPA-SKBR3]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EGFR-inhibition is required for targeted therapies of ERBB2-positive/EGFR high breast cancer. Approximately 30% of human ERBB2-positive breast tumors also express EGFR.

DESIGN
Three targeted therapeutics (erlotinib, pertuzumab, trastuzumab) and two ligands (EGF, HRG) were analyzed in all possible combinations. Each experiment involving inhibition with targeted drugs was performed in three, and measurements without inhibitors were performed in five biological replicates. This resulted in 780 samples. HRG stimulated cells under the triple drug combination exceptionally have two biological replicates. Incubation with therapeutics only and dilution series of control lysated were included as controls.
