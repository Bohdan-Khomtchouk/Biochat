Responses to P. aeruginosa infection - Shapira

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Synchronized C. elegans cultures were prepared using standard techniques ( ). Live young adult worms were split between NG plates pre-seeded with the non-pathogenic E. coli strain OP50 or the Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate PA14 and incubated at 25C for 4, 12 or 24 hours before harvesting. This experiment was repeated three times on independent occasions. cDNA probes were prepared from experimental samples and from reference mRNA extracted from mixed stage wild type worms grown at 25C, and were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5, respectively. In the paper corresponding to this experiment set colors were flipped for easier visualization (probes from experimental samples are represented with red, probes from reference RNA are represented with green). Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series.
