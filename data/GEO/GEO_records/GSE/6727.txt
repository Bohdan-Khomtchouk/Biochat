TITLE
TGFb/Smad4 targets promter in IOSE cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Unlike ovarian cancer, normal ovarian epithelium response to TGFb1 induced growth inhibition. This study tried to idenify promoters that showed Smad4 binding after additionof TGFb1 in immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells (IOSE) which is derived from normal ovarian epithelial cells Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
IOSE cells were treated with TGFb1 for 0 or 3 hrs. Cells were cross-linked and harvested for chromatin. ChIP assays were performed using antibodies against Smad4). The immunoprecipitated DNA was used to probe the Agilent human promoter microarray. Two experiments were performed.
