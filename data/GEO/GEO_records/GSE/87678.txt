TITLE
Transcriptional response of small intestinal epithelial cells (S-IECs) to bacterial monocolonization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we analyzed the transcriptional profile of S-IECs sorted from GF and monocolonized mice (C. histolyticum and B. adolescentis), as well as SPF mice colonized with SFB or not.

DESIGN
S-IECs were double-sorted from mice colonized with the respective bacterial species directly into TRIzol.
