TITLE
Identification of potential KLF7 target genes in olfactory sensory neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
KLF7 null mice show profound axonal growth defects in the olfactory epithelium. The goal of this study was the identification of potential KLF7 target genes in olfactory sensory neurons. Keywords: Molecular analysis of knockout mice.

DESIGN
Olfactory epithelia were isolated from 3 wildtype and 3 mutant 1 day old pups and the RNA isolated, labeled and hybridized to one chip each.
