TITLE
KSHV LANA upregulates the expression of EGFL7 proteins in BJAB cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of LANA on the expressions of the cellular genes.

DESIGN
BJAB cells were transduced with lentiviral vector expressing LANA or the control vector, total RNA was extracted for the detection of relative expression of cellular genes in LANA expressing cells.

PLATFORM
