TITLE
The Schizophrenia Risk Gene Product Satb2 Regulates miRNAs Expression and Long-Term Memory in Adult CNS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
(i)  The hippocampal transcriptome was analyzed in mice that lack the SatB2 gene (ii)  Satb2 binds to active promoters of protein-coding and non-coding loci and determines the levels of a large cohort of miRNAs in the CA1 hippocampal field that are implicated in synaptic plasticity and/or memory formation.

DESIGN
(i) RNA was isolated from the hippocampal CA1 region of mice that lack the SatB2 gene from the adult forebrain and subjected to RNA-sequencing (ii) Mapping the genomic localization of Satb2 in mouse primary hippocampal neurons.

PLATFORM
