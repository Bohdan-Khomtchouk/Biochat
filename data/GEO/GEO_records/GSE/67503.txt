TITLE
RNA-Seq profiles of Drosophila melanogaster S3 cells treated with novel lipid storage inhibitors

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We performed mRNA transcriptional profiling on Drosophila S3 cells after 4 hours treatment with novel lipid storage inhibitors belonging to three different chemotypes.

DESIGN
Profiling of RNA expression after treatment with three pairs of active/inactive compounds or DMSO as a control in triplicates and without treatment in the presence/absence of oleic acid in sextuplicate.

PLATFORM
