TITLE
MicroRNA expression in chicken cecum following Salmonella Enteritidis infection

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
White leghorn layers were infected with Salmonella Enteritidis. The cecum were collected at 7 days post infection for total RNA isolation. The significantly expressed microRNAs between infected and non-infected chickens were identified through Solexa sequencing technology.

DESIGN
Three libraries were made from each group, in total, six libraries were used for Solexa sequencing.

PLATFORM
