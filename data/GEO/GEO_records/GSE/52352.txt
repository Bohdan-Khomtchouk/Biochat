TITLE
Cell cycle and P53 gate the direct conversion of human fibroblasts to dopaminergic neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Suppression of P53 in conjunction with cell cycle arrest at G1 and appropriate extracellular environment markedly increases the efficiency in the transdifferentiation of human fibroblasts to iDA neurons bt Ascl1, Nurr1, Lmx1a and miR-124.

DESIGN
MRC-5 cells were used as control, iN cells generated from MRC-5 were analyzed.
