TITLE
Human dietary intervention study with blueberry-apple juice

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human volunteers (N=143; 98 females and 45 males; aged 18-45 years) consumed one litre of blueberry-apple juice per day for four weeks. Before and after the intervention blood was drawn and lymphocytes were isolated for subsequent RNA isolation. Each participant acted as his own control.

DESIGN
Each subject acted as his own control, meaning that the fluorescent labeled cRNAs of each subject before and after the intervention were mixed and hybridized on one chip. To rule out any possible dye effect, samples from each subject before and after the intervention were randomly labeled with Cy3 and Cy5.
