TITLE
Time-dependent changes in gene expression after endotoxinic challenge followed by LR12-scrambled or LR12 treatment.

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
Gene expression assessment in blood from male Cynomolgus monkey after endotoxin challenge followed by intravenous infusion with peptide control (LR12-scrambled) or LR12. The samples were analyzed at different time-points:  0,  2, 4 and 8 hours

DESIGN
56 samples : 4 time points, 4 vehicle samples/time point, 4  peptide control samples/time point, 6 LR12 samples/time point

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
