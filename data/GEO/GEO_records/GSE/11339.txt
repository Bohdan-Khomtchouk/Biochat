TITLE
GNF mouse atlas_macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Monocytes and macrophages express an extensive repertoire of G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) that regulate inflammation and immunity. In this study we performed a systematic microarray analysis of GPCR expression in primary mouse tissues to identify family members that are either enriched in macrophages compared to a panel of other cell types, or are regulated by an inflammatory stimulus, the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Keywords: macrophage

DESIGN
Macrophage, osteoblast, osteoclast, and mast cell samples were profiled on our GNF1M array.
