TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing identifying the dosage compensation state in human endometrial carcinoma and adjacent tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mammals have evolved an XY sex chromosome system, resulting in dosage imbalance not only between sexes, but also between X-chromosome and autosome.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of 9 pairs of human endometrial carcinoma and adjacent tissues were generated by Illumina 100-nucleotide paired-end sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
