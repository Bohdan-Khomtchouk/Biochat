TITLE
mRNA-seq of L1 larvae recovering from arrest

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to sequence the transcriptome of worms arrested in the first larval stage after hatching without food and starved for 12 hours, then a timecourse of animals recovering from arrest after feeding. We collected samples after 12 hours of starvation and 1, 3 and 6 hours after feeding.

DESIGN
Four time points (12 hr starvation and 1, 3, and 6 hr of recovery) with three biological replicates at times 0 and 6 and two biological replicates at times 1 and 3.
