SUMMARY
Title: Gene Expression in Ara-C Resistance in AML A microarray study of altered gene expression in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines Keywords: cell type comparison Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
Two highly Ara-C resistant cell lines, B117H and B140H were derived from Ara-C sensitive parental cell lines, B117P and B140P. Variations in gene expression between these resistant/sensitive sets were studied
