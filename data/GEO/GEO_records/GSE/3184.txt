TITLE
Murine Airway Hyperresponsiveness

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This project investigates the mechanisms that underlie asthma-related phenotypes associated with allergen exposure. See http://www.hopkins-genomics.org/asthma/asthma006/index.html The goal of the experiment was to identify genes that change their levels of expression as a consequence of challenge with allergen. The experiments utilized a murine model of human asthma that employed BALB/CJ mice. In this particular sensitization-challenge protocol, the response produced by BALB/CJ mice is representative of a majority of the mouse strains tested. The antigen complex used to sensitize and challenge the mice was ragweed pollen an allergen that is highly relevant to human disease. Keywords: time series, allergen

DESIGN
40 samples: 2 time points, 2 strains, allergen and PBS control

PLATFORM
GPL339 [MOE430A] Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430A Array
