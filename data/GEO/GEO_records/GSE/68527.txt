TITLE
Gene expression studies of a human monocyte cell line identify dissimilarities between Copaxone and Probioglat

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glatiramer Acetate (GA) has provided safe and effective treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients  for two decades. It acts as an antigen, yet the precise mechanism of action remains to be fully  elucidated, and no validated pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic biomarkers exist. In order to better  characterize GAâ€™s biological impact, genome-wide expression studies were conducted with a human  monocyte (THP-1) cell line. Consistent with previous literature, branded GA upregulated antiinflammatory  markers (e.g. IL10), and modulated multiple immune-related pathways. Despite some  similarities, significant differences were observed between expression profiles induced by branded GA  and Probioglat, a differently-manufactured glatiramoid purported to be a generic GA.

DESIGN
Cells from a human monocyte cell line (THP-1) were stimulated with either branded GA, purported  generics from several manufacturers including Probioglat by ProbioMed, or vehicle control (mannitol)  for 6, 12, or 24h. RNA was extracted and expression profiled genome-wide using the Affymetrix U133  Plus 2.0 chip. Four batches of GA and one batch of Probioglat were comparatively tested in six  biological replicates each.
