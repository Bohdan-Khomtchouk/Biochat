TITLE
Profiling sex-biased and developmental gene expression in Daphnia pulex

ORGANISM
Daphnia pulex

SUMMARY
We use a custom microarray for the crustacean Daphnia pulex to investigate gene expression in males, juvenile females and pregnant females. Keywords: sex-biased, developmental

DESIGN
Eight biological replicates of 8 day old healthy male Daphnia pulex are compared to four biological replicates of 8 day old healthy (pregnant) females, or to four biological replicates of healthy 6 day old (juvenile) females.  Each comparison involved two dye swaps: two males (green) vs. two pregnant females (red), two males (red) vs. two pregnant females (green) and so on.
