TITLE
small RNA-seq from upper lobe of left lung (ENCSR737NPO)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this Experiment come from tissue sub-sections of a 53 year old female's upper lobe of left lung tissue section obtained from GTEx. They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Total RNA < 200 nucleotides in size.
