TITLE
Comparison between blood myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) extracted from syngeneic kidney transplanted recipient and tolerant kidney allografted recipient induced by anti-CD28 antibody

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The goal is to identify molecules involved in the accumulation of blood MDSCs in tolerant kidney allografted recipients when compared to syngeneic grafted recipients.

DESIGN
In this study 27,088 individual rat genes expression from total mRNA of blood MDSCs from 3 tolerated allogeneic kidney transplanted recipient by anti-CD28, were compared to MDSCs from 3 syngeneic kidney transplanted recipient at day 100 post transplantation.
