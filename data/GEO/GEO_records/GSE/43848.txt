TITLE
iCLIP and NGS to map protein-RNA interactions for U1-snRNP proteins in Trypanosoma brucei

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma brucei

SUMMARY
Individual-nucleotide resolution UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) combined with high-throughput sequencing was performed to generate genome-wide binding maps of two U1-snRNP proteins: U1C and U1-70K in Trypanosoma brucei.

DESIGN
3 (2) biological replicates of U1C (U1-70K) -specific co-immunoprecipitated RNA after UV-crosslinking

PLATFORM
GPL16561 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Trypanosoma brucei) GPL16562 Ion Torrent PGM (Trypanosoma brucei) GPL16563 Illumina MiSeq (Trypanosoma brucei)
