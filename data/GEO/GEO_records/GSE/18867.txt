TITLE
Expression profiling of HONE1 cell line stably transfected with LMP1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using gene expression profiling technology from Capitalbio to find out the whole genome influence after LMP1 stably transfectted to HONE1 cell line.

DESIGN
We analyzed gene expression change by LMP1 in HONE1 cell to find the active pathway and related biology function.

PLATFORM
GPL5918 CapitalBio Human 22k oligonucleotide microarray
