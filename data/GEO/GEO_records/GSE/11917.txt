TITLE
Vitamin D sterol effects on coronary ASMC genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chondro/osteoblastic and cardiovascular-disease associated genes are modulated in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells that calcify in the presence of phosphate and vitamin D sterols. Looking at the effect of media conditions with and without Vitamin D, paracalcitriol (a vitamin D analog), or R568 (a calcimimetic) vs. dose and time on calcification of human coronary smooth muscle cells.

DESIGN
CASMCs were exposed to differentiation medium [beta glycerophosphate (10 mM), ascorbic acid (50 mg/ml), and dexamethasone (10-9 M) with and without calcitriol or paricalcitol (10-8 M) for 7 days, and total RNA was examined by microarray.
