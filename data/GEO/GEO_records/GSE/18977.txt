TITLE
Epigenetic mutant gene expression analysis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The aim of this project is to identify endogenous targets of yet unidentified epigenetic mutants. Mutants were discovered in a forward genetic approach using T-DNA insertion mutagenesis.Pools of each 50 seedlings, grown in-vitro, will be used to examine changes in gene-expression. Keywords: Expression profilling by array

DESIGN
9 samples were used in this experiment

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
