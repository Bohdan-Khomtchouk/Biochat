TITLE
De novo transcription analysis of Haloxylon ammodendron in response to osmotic stress

ORGANISM
Haloxylon ammodendron

SUMMARY
Purpose: To elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms that are involved in drought tolerance of Haloxylon ammodendron. Method: Pathways and candidate genes drought-resistant genes were identified in shoots and roost of Haloxylon ammodendron under sorbitol treatment for 6 and 24h using RNA-seq and Digital Gene Expression. Results: 3,353 differently expressed genes in shoots and 4,564 in roots were successfully indentified. Conclusion: A detailed investigation of the pathways and candidate genes identified in this study promote the research on the molecular mechanisms of drought resistance in the xerophytic species, and lay a solid foundation for developing stress-tolerant forage and crop species by using excellent genes relevant to drought tolerance in Haloxylon. ammodendron.

DESIGN
RNA from shoots and roots of Haloxylon. ammodendron seedling treated with 0.4% sorbitol for 6 and 24h were sequenced.

PLATFORM
GPL19524 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Haloxylon ammodendron)
