TITLE
Gene expression data on human optic nerve head astrocytes in normal Caucasian and African americans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine whether optic nerve head astrocytes, a key cellular component of glaucomatous neuropathy, exhibit differential gene expression in primary culture of astrocytes from normal African American donors, compared to astrocytes from normal Caucasian American donors. All donors have no histories of eye disease, diabetes, or chronic CNS disease. Keywords: Gene expression profile
