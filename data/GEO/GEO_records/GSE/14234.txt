SUMMARY
Analysis of Histone H3 Lysine 4 mono-, di- and trimethyl and the boundary protein CTCF in CD4+CD25+CD45RA+ regulatory T-cells and conventional CD4+CD25- T-cells. To investigate regulatory functions or potential new transcription start sites in Treg and Tconv cells, we investigated the associated histone modifications. Mono- and dimethylation of histone 3 lysin 4 (H3K4) were previously shown to mark enhancer regions, whereas H3K4 trimethylation generally associates with transcription start sites. At imprinted loci, binding of the insulator protein CTCF, which restricts or directs enhancer-promoter interactions, is often regulated by DNA-methylation. Therefore we performed ChIP-on-chip experiments (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray hybridization; samples were amplified with ligation mediated PCR [see label protocol for the procedure] prior to labeling) for mono- di- and trimethylation of histone 3 lysin 4 and of CTCF in expanded Treg and Tconv cells. Keywords: ChIP-on-chip
