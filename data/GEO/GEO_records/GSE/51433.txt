TITLE
Erythropoietin promotes breast tumorigenesis through tumor initiating cell self-renewal

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The erythropoietin (EPO) hormone induces red blood cell production and its recombinant form is the most prescribed drug for the treatment of anemia, including that arising in cancer patients. Based on randomized trials showing that EPO administration to cancer patients result in a decreased survival, we investigated the impact of EPO modulation on tumorigenesis. Using genetically engineered mouse models of breast cancer we found that EPO promoted tumorigenesis by activating JAK/STAT signaling specifically in breast tumor initiating cells (TICs) and promoting their self-renewal.  Moreover, we define an active role for endogenous EPO in breast cancer progression and breast TIC self-renewal and demonstrate a potential application of EPO pathway inhibition in breast cancer therapy.
