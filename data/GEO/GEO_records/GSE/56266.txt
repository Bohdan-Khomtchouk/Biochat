TITLE
mRNA microarray analyses of A549, PC14, and PC14CDDP cells that were transiently transfected with either pre-miR-197 or LNA-miR-197 and their controls.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In general, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by repressing translation or promoting the degradation of their target genes. To strategically identify direct microR-197 (miR-197) target genes, we first performed mRNA microarray analyses of A549, PC14, and PC14CDDP cells that were transiently transfected with either pre-miR-197 or LNA-miR-197 and their controls. We observed that 1037 predicted target genes exhibited expression alterations consistently across the three different lung cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
To detect the mRNAs in cells, 100 ng of total RNA was labelled and hybridised using a SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Hybridisation signals were detected using a DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies).
