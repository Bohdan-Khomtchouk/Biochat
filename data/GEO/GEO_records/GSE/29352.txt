TITLE
miRNA expression profiles in Pancreatic Cystic tumours and Pancreatic Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiles have been described in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but these have not been compared with premalignant lesions. We wished to identify miRNA expression profiles in pancreatic cystic tumors with low malignant potential (serous microcystic adenomas) and high malignant potential (mucinous cystadenoma and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)) and compare these to PDAC and carcinoma-ex-IPMN (CEI).

DESIGN
n= 20 samples Benign Pancreatic Cystic Tumour (n=7 Microcystic, n= 6 Mucinous, n= 7 IPMN) were compared with n= 9 samples of  carcinoma ex IPMN and n= 14 samples of pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma) for known homo sapiens miRNAs (mirbase 13).
