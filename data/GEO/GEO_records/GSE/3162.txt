TITLE
Negative control of keratinocyte differentiation by Rho/CRIK signaling coupled with up-regulation of KyoT1/2 expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rho GTPases integrate control of cell structure and adhesion with downstream signaling events. In keratinocytes, RhoA is activated at early times of differentiation and plays an essential function in establishment of cell-cell adhesion. We report here that, surprisingly, Rho signaling suppresses downstream gene expression events associated with differentiation. Similar inhibitory effects are exerted by a specific Rho effector, CRIK (Citron kinase), which is selectively down-modulated with differentiation, thereby allowing the normal process to occur. The suppressing function of Rho/CRIK on differentiation is associated with induction of KyoT1/2, a LIM domain protein gene implicated in integrin-mediated processes and/or Notch signaling. Like activated Rho and CRIK, elevated KyoT1/2 expression suppresses differentiation. Thus, Rho signaling exerts an unexpectedly complex role in keratinocyte differentiation, which is coupled with induction of KyoT1/2, a LIM domain protein gene with a potentially important role in control of cell self renewal.

DESIGN
Total RNA from primary mouse keratinocytes infected with adeno-GFP, adeno-RhoV14, or adeno-CRIK-SK for 48 h was used for biotin-labeled cRNA probe preparation and hybridization to Affymetrix U74A gene chips. cRNA probes from each condition were tested in duplicate.
