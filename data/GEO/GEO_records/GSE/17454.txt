TITLE
Identification of transcription factor CEH-14 binding sites in C.elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We, being members of modENCODE consortium, have established an experimetal pipeline in C.elegans that allows global identification of the binding sites for transcription factors using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). In current study, we identified the binding sites for CEH-14 at L2 stage, which is required for specification of the AFD thermosensory neurons and for normal thermotactic behavior.

DESIGN
CEH-14 was tagged with a dual GFP:3xFLAG tag at the carboxy terminus, whose expression pattern was confirmed through both fluorescence imaging and immunoblot analysis. The binding sites were determined using ChIP-seq. Two biological replicates were used in this study, but replicate1 is at a later L2 stage. Only one Input sample (non-immunoprecipitated chromatin (input) from replicate2 was used as a control. The concordance between two replicates is just above 50% when p-value is 0.05.
