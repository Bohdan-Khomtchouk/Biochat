TITLE
miRNA profiling of Macaca mulatta intact colon samples during acute SIV infection

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
This study describes differential miRNA expression in intact colon tissue during acute SIV infection of rhesus macaques. Nine miRNAs were found to be significantly affected by infection, with 5 down-regulated and 4 up-regulated miRNAs. The expression of one upregulated miRNA was further characterized and found to be significantly elevated specifically in response to SIV replication and not immune activation/inflammation accompanying SIV infection.

DESIGN
We performed TaqMan Low Density Array based high throughput miRNA analysis on intact colon tissue from 10 acutely SIV-infected and 5 uninfected control macaques. All SIV-infected animals were inoculated intravenously with 100TCID50 of SIV. Out of the ten, one animal each was at 7, 8 and 10DPI (days post infection), 3 each at 13 and 21DPI, and 1 at 29DPI. microRNA reverse transcription and preamplification was performed according to the manufacturerâ€™s recommendation. Data analysis was performed using RQ Manager 1.2.2 and DataAssist v3.01 software. Data was normalized using Global normalization method and multiple comparisons correction was performed using Benjamini-Hochberg method.
