TITLE
Gene expression profiling of uterine stromal cells isolated from Hand2 floxed and Hand2 ablated mice on day 4 of pregnancy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our previous study revealed that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Hand2 is a downstream target of progesterone signaling in mouse uterine stroma at the time of implantation. Further, conditional deletion of Hand2 in mouse uterus leads to implantation failure due to impaired uterine epithelial receptivity. To identify the downstream targets of Hand2 in the uterus, we performed gene expression profling of uterine stromal cells isolated from Hand2-null mice and the corresponding controls on day4 of pregnancy (the time of implantation). The microarray results revealed elevated expression of mRNAs corresponding to several members of the fibroblast growth factor family in uterine stroma of Hand2-ablated mice. These factors act as paracrine mediators of mitogenic effects of estrogen on the epithleium. Thus, Hand2 is a critical regulator of the uteirne stromal-epithelial communication that directs proper steroid regulation conducive for establshment of pregnancy.

DESIGN
We performed conditional ablation of Hand2 in the mouse uterus using the PRcre mouse model. As Hand2 expression is restricted to stromal comaprtment,  we isolated uterine stromal cells from day4 pregnant mice (n=5 for each genotype), purified total RNA from these cells, pooled these samples and then hybridized to high density affymetrix microarrays. Control vs. KO.
