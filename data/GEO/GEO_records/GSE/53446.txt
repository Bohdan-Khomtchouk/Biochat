TITLE
Profiling of Islet, Lim3, Hb9 and Eve genomic binding in Drosophila with DamID

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
While developmental processes such as axon pathfinding and synapse formation have been characterized in detail, comparatively less is known of the intrinsic developmental mechanisms that regulate transcription of ion channel genes in embryonic neurons. Early decisions, including motoneuron axon targeting, are orchestrated by a cohort of transcription factors that act together in a combinatorial manner. These transcription factors include Even-skipped (Eve), Islet, Lim3 and Hb9. The perdurance of these factors in late embryonic neurons is, however, indicative that they might also regulate additional aspects of neuron development, including the acquisition of electrical properties. We have shown that Eve binds and regulates both voltage- and ligand-gated currents in motoneurons (Pym et al., 2006). We have also shown that Islet is sufficient to repress a Shaker-mediated A-type K(+) current, most likely due to a direct transcriptional effect (Wolfram et al., 2012). Finally, we have shown that Islet and Lim3 act in a combinatorial fashion to regulate Shaker-mediated A-type K(+) current (Wolfram et al., 2014).

DESIGN
3 biological relicates were performed for Islet, Lim3 and Hb9 (with one dye-swap). 2 biological relicates were performed for Eve.
