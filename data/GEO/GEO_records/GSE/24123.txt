TITLE
Effects of purine de novo synthesis knockdown on gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster S2 tissue culture cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The effect of inhibiting expression of the ade2 gene by RNA interference in Drosophila S2 tissue culture cells was examined.

DESIGN
S2 cells underwnt three different dsRNA treatments.  Two were for non-overlapping sequences of ade2 transcripts and the third was for a non-specific Chlamydomonas reinhardtii lhcb sequence.  3 samples from ade2 dsRNA-1 treated cells, 2 samples from ade2 dsRNA-2, and 3 samples from lhcb dsRNA treated cells were used on two 4x44K format slides (G2519F).
