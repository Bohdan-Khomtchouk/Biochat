TITLE
Affymetrix SNP Array data for familial coarctation of the aorta (CoA) II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) accounts for 5-8% of all congenital heart defects.  CoA can be detected in up to 20% of patients with Ullrich-Turner syndrome (UTS), in which a part or all of one of the X chromosomes is absent. The etiology of non-syndromic CoA is poorly understood. In the present work, we test the hypothesis that rare copy number variation (CNV) especially on the gonosomes, contribute to the etiology of non-syndromic CoA.

DESIGN
We performed high-resolution genome-wide CNV analysis using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarray platform for 13 individuals from 3 families with familial CoA.
