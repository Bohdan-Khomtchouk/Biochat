TITLE
Detailed analysis of the genetic and epigenetic signature of iPS cell-derived mesodiencephalic dopaminergic neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) harbor great promise for in vitro generation of disease-relevant cell types, such as mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons involved in Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Although iPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons have been generated, detailed genetic and epigenetic characterization of such neurons is still lacking. The goal of this study is to examine the authenticity of iPSC-derived DA neurons obtained by established protocols. We FACS-purified mdDA (Pitx3gfp/+) neurons derived from mouse iPSCs and primary mdDA (Pitx3gfp/+) neurons to analyze and compare their genetic and epigenetic features. Although iPSC-derived DA neurons largely adopt characteristics of their in-vivo counterparts, relevant deviations in global gene expression and DNA methylation were found. Hypermethylated genes, mainly involved in neurodevelopment and basic neuronal functions, consequently showed reduced expression levels. Such abnormalities should be addressed as they might affect unambiguous long-term functionality and hamper the potential of iPSC-derived DA neurons for in-vitro disease modeling or cell-based therapy.

DESIGN
RRBS methylation maps were generated for iPSCs cells, dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSCs and primary mesodiencephalic dopaminergic neurons
