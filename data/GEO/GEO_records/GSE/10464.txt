TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana (Ler) rosette leaves treated with paraquat (methyl viologen)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail Arabidopsis gene expression in response to paraquat, a herbicide that acts as a terminal oxidant of photosystem I that in the light leads to the enhanced generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide inside plastids. Within a few hours after paraquat treatment changes in nuclear gene expression occur. Distinct sets of genes were activated that were different from those induced by another reactive oxygen species, singlet oxygen. Keywords: Time course
