TITLE
Dectin1-Stimulated mTOR-C/EBPÎ² Signaling Induces IL-10-Producing Regulatory Tr2 Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the present study we describe a new subset of murine T cells producing high levels of IL-10 that, in this case, are induced by C-type lectin receptor-stimulated (i.e., Dectin-1-stimulated) dendritic cells. This T cell produces IL-10 as a result of a transcriptional mechanism that is distinct from that inducing IL-10 in Th2 cells, Tr1 cells or other T cell subsets. In particular, the mechanism involves mTOR signaling and induction of the LIP isoform of C/EBPb, a factor that interacts with phospho-CREB and GATA3 to induce transactivation of the IL-10 gene. These T cells have strong regulatory properties in relation to fungal infection and hence have been termed Tr2 regulatory T cells to distinguish them from other regulatory T cell subsets.

DESIGN
4 types of T-cells measured in duplicate are compared.  1) T-BMDC sup-CD3 sup (T0), 2) T-BMDC sup-CD3+ZD(Tr2), 3) Th2, 4) Tr1.
