TITLE
The footprint of the aging stroma in older breast cancer patients.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: Tumoral masses are not only composed of malignant cells, but also enclose a more or less ample stromal micromilieu, which has been shown to influence the cancer cell behaviour. As aging induces accumulation of senescent cells in the body, this micromilieu is thought to be different in cancers occurring in old patients compared to the younger counterparts. More specifically, senescence-related fibroblastic features, such as the Senescence Associated Secretory Profile (SASP) and the induction of Autophagy, are suspected to stimulate tumor growth and progression. Methods: We compared gene expression profiles in stromal fields of breast carcinomas by performing laser capture microdissection of the cancer-associated stroma from 8 old (â‰¥80 years at diagnosis) and 9 young ( < 45 years at diagnosis) triple negative breast cancer patients. Gene expression data were obtained by microarray analysis (Affymetrix). Differential gene expression and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed. Results: Differential gene expression analysis showed higher growth-, dedifferentiation- and migration- promoting gene expression in the stromal samples of older vs younger patients. GSEA confirmed the presence of a SASP, as well as the presence of Autophagy in the stroma of older patients. Conclusion: We provide the first evidence in humans that older age at diagnosis is associated with a different stromal micromilieu in breast cancers. The SASP and the presence of Autophagy appear to be important age-induced stromal features.

DESIGN
Gene expression data were generated from micro-dissected stromal tissue.
