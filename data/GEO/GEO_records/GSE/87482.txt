TITLE
Clonal isolates of PC3 cells overexpressing RWDD4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified RWDD4 as prostate cancer metastases genes by analyzing QTL, transcript profiles and SNP associations with aggressive disease phenotypic traits in transgenic mice and human cohorts RWDD4 was futher validated as a metastases gene in vitro and in vivo utilizing prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing the gene, and we used microarray to analyze the changes in transcripts

DESIGN
Human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 was cloned with etither a control (empty) p-Lenti vector, or a p-Lenti vector containing the RWDD4 gene. Cells were selected using blastocydin followed by propagation of 4 clonal isolates for RNA extraction and hybridization onto Affymetrix array
