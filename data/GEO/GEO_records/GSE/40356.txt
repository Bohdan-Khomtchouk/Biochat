TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Lactococcus garvieae 21881 in response to different stress conditions

ORGANISM
Lactococcus garvieae 8831 ; Lactococcus garvieae 21881

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of Lactococcus garvieae 21881 in response to different stress conditions: 42 ÂºC, high salt concentration and presence of linoleic acid.

DESIGN
Reference design experiment comparing samples of Lactoccocus garvieae 21881 exposed to different stress conditions. Three biological replicates for each condition (presence on the medium of high concentration of salt, linolieic acid and growth at 42 degrees Celsius). The results were referenced to a equimolar mixture of L. garvieae strains 21881 and 8831 grown at 29 degrees Celsius
