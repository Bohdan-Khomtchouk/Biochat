TITLE
Comparative ChIP-chip analysis of  general transcription factor TFIIB and negative cofactor NC2 in human B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comparative ChIP-chip analysis of TFIIB and NC2 in human B cells reveals that basal core promoter architectures control the equilibrium between NC2 and preinitiation complexes. We conducted a comparative ChIP-chip and gene expression analysis of TFIIB in human B cells and analyze associated core promoter architectures. TFIIB occupancy relates well to gene expression, with the vast majority of promoters being GC-rich and lacking defined core promoter elements. TATA consensus and TATA-like motifs but not the previously in vitro defined TFIIB recognition elements (BREs) are enriched in approximately 5% of the genes. Further insight was obtained by performing a parallel ChIP-chip analysis of the TFIIB antagonist NC2. The latter identifies a highly related target gene set. Nonetheless, subpopulations show strong variations in TFIIB/NC2 ratios, with high NC2/TFIIB ratios correlating to promoters that show dispersed transcription start site patterns and lacking defined core elements. Conversely, high TFIIB/NC2 ratios select for conserved core promoter elements that include TATA and INR (initiator), the upstream TFIIB recognition element (BREu) and the downstream promoter element (DPE).

DESIGN
Two biological samples from LCL 721 lymphoblastoid human B cells  were subjected to ChIP-chip analysis of TFIIB and NC2 using a Nimblegen human promoter array (based on the HG17 genome build) covering 1.5 kb DNA around transcription start sites.
