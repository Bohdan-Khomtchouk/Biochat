Profiling of antibodies against prostate cancer xenograft-released proteins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The present study describes a novel xenograft-based biomarker discovery platform and proves its usefulness in the discovery of novel serum markers for prostate cancer (PCa). By immunizing immuno-competent mice with serum from nude mice bearing PCa xenografts, an antibody response against xenograft-derived antigens was elicited. By probing protein microarrays with serum from immunized mice, several PCa-derived antigens were identified, of which a subset was successfully retrieved in serum from mice bearing PCa xenografts and validated in human serum samples of PCa patients. In conclusion, this novel method allows for the identification of low abundant cancer-derived serum proteins, circumventing dynamic range and host-response issues in standard patient cohort proteomics comparisons.
