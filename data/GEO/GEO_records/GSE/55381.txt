TITLE
Whole transcription data for mouse spermatogonial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Spermatogenesis is a multi-step yet tightly regulated developmental process to produce male gemetes for reproduction. In mouse spermatogenesis, a sub-group of type A spermatogonia (Spga) known as spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) maintain their population by self-renewal, and differentiate through mitosis and meiosis to form tetraploid (4n) pacchytene spermatocytes (Spcy) and haploid (n) round spermatids (Sptd), which further differentiate into functional sperms. In this study, we selected three representative stages of mouse spermatogenesis, namely Spga, Spcy and Sptd, to study their transcriptomic charteristics using whole genome tiling microarray.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of each selected stage. Spga were isolated from 6-day-old Balb/c mice, Spcy and Sptd from 60-day-old Balb/c mice. Transcriptomic landscapes of these three cell types were analysed with whole genome tiling array.
