TITLE
Regulation of gene expression in murine liver by IL-6

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
STEAP4 is a plasma membrane metallo-reductase involved in the transport of iron and copper. Recently, STEAP4 was implicated in promoting insulin sensitivity by acting in white adipose tissue (WAT) to control the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Indeed, the loss of STEAP4 expression in mice leads to increased production of inflammatory cytokines in visceral WAT and systemic insulin resistance. In this report, we demonstrate that in mouse liver STEAP4 is produced at significant levels and that STEAP4 transcription is induced by IL-6. We further demonstrate that the STEAP4 gene is a direct target of phosphorylated STAT3 in mouse liver. In addition, hepatic STEAP4 expression is regulated by feeding and fasting, and obesity leads to the induction of STEAP4 expression in the liver. Interestingly, the regulation of STEAP4 in both feeding and fasting and the obese state appears to require the transcription factor C/EBPalpha that may act in concert with STAT3 as they both bind to the proximal STEAP4 promoter in vivo. Taken together these data suggest the transcriptional regulation of hepatic STEAP4 may play a critical role in the response to nutritional and inflammatory stress and contribute to the protective effect of STEAP4 in vivo.

DESIGN
10-week old male C57BL6 mice were fasted for 16 h overnight and then given either saline or IL-6 (100 ng/mouse) injections intraperitoneally for 1 h. Mice were euthanized using CO2, and the livers were collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -800C until further use.
