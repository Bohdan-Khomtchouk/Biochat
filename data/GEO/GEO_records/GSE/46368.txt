TITLE
Comparison of gene change in lymphoma cells after co-culture with endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse lymphoma cells were co-cultured with endothelial cells in serum/cytokine-free condition. To identify specific genetic changes, we compared lymphoma cells cultured in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with lymphoma cells co-cultured with endothelial cells.

DESIGN
The experiment compared genetic change in lymphoma cells caused by co-culture with endothelial cells.
