TITLE
Expression profiling of human mesoangioblasts indicates that S1P induces differentiation towards smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cDNA microarray study of human mesoangioblasts treated with 1 ÂµM sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) at 6 and 24 h.

DESIGN
Agilent whole human genome oligonucleotide microarrays (44 K) were used to examine alterations in gene expression of cells after S1P treatment
