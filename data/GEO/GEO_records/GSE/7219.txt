TITLE
NIK/NF-kappaB2 regulated gene products.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aims at identifying genes that are NIK/NF-kappaB2 responsive in murine dendritic cells matured in vivo. Keywords: NIK/NF-kappaB2 responsive genes in dendritic cells after TLR/CD40 signaling

DESIGN
This study isolated dendritic cells from the spleens of Alymphoplasia or heterozygeous littlermates (wild type).  Mice were eiter not treated as a reference or treated I.P. with 25 micrograms of LPS and 100 micrograms of agonistic anti-CD40 antibody.  DCs were isolated 6 hours after treatment allowing in vivo maturation via both TLR and CD40 signals.  DCs from 3 mice per group were pooled.  Experiment was performed in triplicate.
