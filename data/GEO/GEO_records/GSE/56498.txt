TITLE
Activating transcription factor 6 is necessary and sufficient for alcoholic fatty liver disease in zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
ATF6 is a key regulator of the unfolded protein response. Through use of zebrafish and cultured cells we demonstrate that ATF6 drives fatty liver disease by interaction with fatty acid synthase (FASN).

DESIGN
Total small RNA from livers of 5 dpf larval zebrafish were collected: 2 batches of Tg(fabp10:nls-mCherry) control larvae, 2 batches of ethanol-treated Tg(fabp10:nls-mCherry) larvae, and 1 batch of Tg(fabp10:nAtf6-cherry; cmlc2:GFP). Each batch was purified for preparation of high-throughput sequencing libraries.
