TITLE
Clinical and Pathologic Response of the Primary Tumor in Women Receiving Neoadjuvant Docetaxel-Capecitabine (+/- Trastuzumab) Chemotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Results: In subjects who completed treatment and surgery, the pCR and near-complete response rates were 15.8% in HER2-negative and 50% in HER2-positive subjects. When stratified by genomic subtype, subjects of the HER2-enriched subtype had the best response (66.7%), the luminal A (11%) and B (4.8%) subtypes the poorest. Of 147 patients tested for p53 mutations using the AmpliChip test, 78 variants were detected; 55 were missense. The response rate among TP53 mutated patients was 30%, significantly higher than the rate in TP53 wild-type patients (10%, P = .0032). Concordance between AmpliChip mutation status versus IHC staining was 65%, with AmpliChip status being predictive of response and IHC status being not being predictive. Conclusion: Capecitabine plus docetaxel in HER2-negative subjects, and with trastuzumab in HER2-positive subjects, provided a good response rate with fewer cycles. p53 mutational analysis using the AmpliChip p53 assay, and genomic subtyping using the PAM50 assay, were promising predictive tests of response.
