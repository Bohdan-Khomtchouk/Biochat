L-Myc expression by dendritic cells is required for optimal T-cell priming

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor IRF8 is a critical regulator of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) and classical dendritic cell (cDC) development in both mouse and man.  Yet the downstream molecular targets that regulate DC homeostasis and development are largely unknown.  A recent study using gene expression analysis of IRF8-deficient myeloid and lymphoid progenitors identified the Myc paralog Mycl1 as a potential transcriptional target of IRF8.  We report here that Mycl1 is a mediator of DC homeostasis at steady state and during inflammation, and its expression is regulated by IRF8 in multiple DC lineages.  We have further validated these observations with ChIP-Seq of IRF8 binding to the Mycl1 locus.  Notably, IRF8 binding to Mycl1 locus is independent of an interaction with the AP1 factor, BATF3.  Additionally, our genome-wide survey of IRF8 binding identified both EICE and AICE motifs.
