TITLE
Expression data on 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with leukemia cell-conditioned media

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarray to survey the global gene expression changes in adipocytes that have been treated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell conditioned media.

DESIGN
3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 8093 murine ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell conditioned media for 24 hours. Then cells were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
