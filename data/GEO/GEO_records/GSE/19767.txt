TITLE
Microarray expression data from the Mus musculus intestine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome wide expression profiling to determine the overlap of Affymetrix-signals with SOLID sequencing RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit following the manufacturers guidelines, arrays were prepared and hybridized following the Affymetrix protocol.

DESIGN
Mus musculus samples from small intestine and colon, to be compared to transcript data aquired with other techniques
