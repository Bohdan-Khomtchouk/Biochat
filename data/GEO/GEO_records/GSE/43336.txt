TITLE
Gene expression profiling of GFP-positive cancer stem-like cells(CSLC) derived from MDA-MB453 cells, compared with GFP-negative non-cancer stem cells (non-CSLC).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of genes that differentially expressed in CSLC cells compared with non-CSLC cells, which are derived from the same parental MDA-MB453 cell line.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from two pairs of GFP-positive CSLCs (ST1, ST2) and GFP-negative non-CSLCs (NS1, NS2) on different days. Two batches of RNAs were combined for microarray analysis.
