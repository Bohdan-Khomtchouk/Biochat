TITLE
Gene expression profiling regulated by PDGF in pBSMCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore global molecular changes in smooth muscle in response to PDGFR activation, primary human bladder smooth muscle cells were treated with 1 nM PDGF-BB (hereafter PDGF) for 0, 4 or 24 h. Total RNA were prepared, and analyzed using expression profiling, and subjected to bioinformatic and functional interrogation.

DESIGN
To identify molecular signatures of bladder smooth muscle peturbed by PDGF, primary human bladder smooth muscle cells were treated with 1 nM PDGF-BB (hereafter PDGF) for 0, 4 or 24 h.
