TITLE
Omics-based identification of the combined effects of idiosyncratic drugs and inflammatory cytokines on the development of drug-induced liver injury

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To unravel the underlying mechanisms of inflammation-related idiosyncratic drug toxicity

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were exposed to 3 idiosyncratic and 3 non-idiosyncratic compounds with or without the cytokine mix (TNF 100 ng/ml + IFNγ 100 ng/ml + IL-1α 20 ng/ml + IL-6 20 ng/ml + LPS 10 µg/ml)as described previously (Cosgrove et al., 2009) for 6, 12 or 24 h.

PLATFORM
