TITLE
Chip-chip from Z138 MCL cell line with SOX11 antibody

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the role of SOX11 in aggressive lymphoid neoplasm, we first investigated direct target genes of this transcription factor using chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA microarrays (ChIP-chip) in MCL cell lines. Analysis of the exact location of SOX11 binding elements showed that SOX11 interacts with DNA predominantly in the enhancer regions (in 40% of the enriched regions) and intron segments (in 33% of the enriched regions), suggesting that in these genes SOX11 may interact with the general transcriptional machinery and transcriptional co-regulators.

DESIGN
