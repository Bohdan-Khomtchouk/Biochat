TITLE
Deriving mature Schwann cells from human BMSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A protocol was established for the derivation of Schwann cell-like cells from human BMSCs. The commitment to the Schwann cell fate was acquired by Schwann cell-like cells in co-culture with rat DRG neurons. Microarray analysis provided evidence that the human BMSC-derived Schwann cells were functionally mature.

DESIGN
Microarrays was used to compare the gene expression profiles of human BMSCs, Schwann cell-like cells, human BMSC-derived Schwann cells and adult human Schwann cells.
