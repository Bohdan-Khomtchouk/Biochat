TITLE
Digital gene expression tag profiling of digit morphologies in bats

ORGANISM
Myotis ricketti

SUMMARY
As the only truly flying mammals, bats use their unique wing formed from elongated digits connected by membranes to power their flight. The forelimb of bats consists of four elongated digits (digits II-V) and one shorter digit (digit I) that is morphologically similar to the hindlimb digits. Elongation of bat forelimb digits is thought to results from changes in the temporal and spatial expression of a number of developmental genes. As a result, comparing gene expression profiles between short and elongated digit morphologies of the fore- and hindlimbs may elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying digit elongation in bats. Here, we performed a large-scale analysis of gene expression of forelimb digit I, forelimb digits II-V, and all five hindlimb digits in Myotis ricketti using digital gene expression tag profiling approach. Results of this study not only implicate several developmental genes as robust candidates underlying digit elongation in bats, but also provide a better understanding of the genes involved in autopodial development in general.

DESIGN
A large-scale analysis of gene expression of 3 different parts of autopods in Myotis ricketti using digital gene expression tag profiling approach.
