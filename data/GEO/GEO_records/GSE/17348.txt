TITLE
Effects of prostate cancer cells on osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary murine osteoblasts were isolated form the calvariae of newborn mice.  10 days after the addition of ascorbic acid (50 µg/ml) and ß-glycerophosphate (10 mM),  cells were serum-starved over night and then incubated for 6 hours with condtioned medium of MDA-PCa2b cells or conditioned medium of PC-3 cells Keywords: expression profiling by array

DESIGN
The aim of the experiment was to identify transcriptional changes in osteoblasts caused by factors derived from two different prostate cancer cell lines
