TITLE
RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis of sarcomatoid (E/S), rhabdoid (E/R) and non-sarcomatoid (E*) clear cell renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The biphasic epithelioid (E-) and sarcomatoid(S-) components of sarcomatoid RCC and epithelioid (E-) and rhabdoid (R-) components of rhabdoid RCC shared a similar transcriptomic signature, despite morphologic differences; by contrast, the transcriptome of sarcomatoid and rhabdoid RCC was sharply distinct from non-sarcomatoid RCC.

DESIGN
Total RNA was processed for RNA-seq from the following patient samples:  7 sarcomatoid RCC (E- and S- pairs), 4 rhabdoid RCC (E- and R- pairs) and 15 non-sarcomatoid RCC.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
