TITLE
Microarray analysis of BHLHB2 and BHLHB3 target genes in human skeletal muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we have identified the target  genes of BHLHB2 and BHLHB3 in primary cultures of human skeletal muscle cells using adenoviral vectors expressing either BHLHB2 or BHLHB3, and oligonucleotide microarrays.

DESIGN
Human myotubes were prepared from 4 different skeletal muscle biopsies. After 7 days of differentiation, myotubes were infected for 48 hours with recombinant adenovirus expressing either GFP, BHLHB2 or BHLHB3. Each BHLHB2- or BHLHB3-infected myotubes culture was compared to GFP-infected myotubes culture. GFP-infected myotubes were considered the control. Four biological replicates were processed.
