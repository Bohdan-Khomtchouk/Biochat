TITLE
Gene expression analysis of peritoneal mesotheliomas following chemical treatment in F344 rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study was performed to characterize the gene expression profile of rat peritoneal mesothelioma (RPM) formation following treatment of Fischer 344 rats with o-nitrotoluene (o-NT) or bromochloracetic acid (BCA). Keywords: Rat, Mesotheliomas, Bromochloractetic acid, o-Nitrotoluene, Carcinogenesis, Microarray
