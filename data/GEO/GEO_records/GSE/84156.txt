TITLE
Hypothalamic gene expression profiles from diet-induced obese mice after Celastrol or Withaferin A treatments

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Obesity is characterized by central leptin resistance. Celastrol has been identified to reduce leptin resistance in diet-induced obese and leptin resistant mice. Current microarray data provide the hypothalamic gene expression profiles from mice treated with Celastrol or Withaferin A.

DESIGN
Expression profiles from mice treated with Celastrol or Withaferin A
