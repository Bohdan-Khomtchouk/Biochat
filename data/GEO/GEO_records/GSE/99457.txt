TITLE
Injury-inducible stem cell potential of the intestinal enteroendocrine lineage: single-cell mRNA-seq profiling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the single-cell transcriptomic profiles of Bmi1-GFP+ and Prox1-GFP+ cells in comparison to Lgr5-eGFP+ and Lgr5-eGFP- cells

DESIGN
Primary epithelial cells were isolated from Bmi1-GFP, Prox1-GFP or Lgr5-eGFP reporter mice and subjected to single-cell mRNA-seq

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus) GPL21103 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Mus musculus)
