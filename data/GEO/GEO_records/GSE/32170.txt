TITLE
Bisquinolinium Compounds Induce Quadruplex-Specific Transcriptome Changes in HeLa S3 Cell Line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The effect of bisquinolinium compounds PhenDC3 and 360A genome wide gene expression changes modulated via promoter based G-quadruplex (G4) motifs.

DESIGN
The total RNA was extracted after treating HeLa S3 cells with 10 ÂµM of no molecule (DMSO), 8979A (control molecule), PhenDC3 (G4 specific molecule) or 360A (G4 specific molecule) for 48 hrs in triplicate.
