TITLE
Legionella pneumophila JR32 and rpoS- (LM1367) strains: Statinoary phase (stat) vs. Logarithmic (log) phase growth

ORGANISM
Legionella pneumophila

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of L. pneumophila JR32 (wild-type) and rpoS- (LM1376) strains grown to stat phase compared to cultures grown to log phase Keywords: growth phase

DESIGN
For each of the two strains, six test samples and six reference samples were analyzed and averaged. The test sample being JR32 or rpoS- in stat phase and the reference sample being JR32 or rpoS- in log phase.
