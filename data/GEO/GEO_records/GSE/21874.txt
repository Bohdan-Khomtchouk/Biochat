TITLE
A direct role for cohesin in genome-wide gene regulation and Ecdysone-response in Drosophila salivary gland

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Developmental abnormalities observed in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) have been genetically linked to mutations in the cohesin machinery. These findings raise the possibility that cohesin, in addition to its canonical function of mediating sister chromatid cohesion, might also be involved in regulating gene expression. We report that cleavage of cohesinâ€™s kleisin subunit in post-mitotic Drosophila salivary glands induces major changes (both up and down) in the transcript levels of many genes. Kinetic analyses of changes in transcript levels upon cohesin cleavage reveal that a subset of genes responds to cohesin cleavage within a few hours. In addition, cohesin binds to most of these loci, suggesting that cohesin is directly regulating their expression. Amongst these genes are several that are regulated by the steroid hormone Ecdysone. Transcripts at EcR and Eip74EF, which encode an Ecdysone Receptor and an Ecdysone-regulated transcription factor, respectively, decline ten-fold within four hours of cohesin cleavage. Cytological visualization of transcription at selected Ecdysone-responsive genes reveals that puffing at Eip74EF ceases within an hour or two of cohesin cleavage, long before any decline in EcR associated with this locus. We conclude that cohesin regulates expression of a distinct set of genes, including those mediating the Ecdysone response

DESIGN
DamID experiments for Rad21 were performed on gDNA from drosophila salivary glands. Samples were hybridized to 380k NimbleGen arrays with 300 bp probe spacing. The experiment was done in duplicate in the reverse dye orientation.
