TITLE
Integration of BRCA1-mediated miRNA and mRNA signatures reveal miR-146a, miR-99b and miR-205 regulation of the TRAF2 and NFkB pathways (mRNA dataset)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BRCA1 deregulation is a frequent event in the pathogenesis of breast as well as other cancers. In addition to the DNA repair functions of BRCA1, it is involved in a wide range of cellular processes such as cell cycle, chromatin remodeling or transcription. However, the molecular events underlying BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis are still largely unknown. In order to deepen our understanding of BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis, we integrated data from mRNA and miRNA microarray experiments on the HCC1937 breast cancer cell line, and the isogenic HCC1937 stably expressing BRCA1, to obtain significant miRNA-mRNA relationships associated to the presence of the BRCA1 gene. Our results demonstrate that integration of mRNA and miRNA associated to BRCA1 expression was useful to discover new miRNA-gene interactions as molecular events underlying BRCA1-mediated tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of the BRCA1-null HCC1937 cell line and HCC1937 cells after stable transfection of BRCA1. Two-condition experiment: Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene, catalog #740000) (Cy3) vs. cell line (Cy5). Biological replicates: 3 HCC1937, 3 BRCA1-transfected HCC1937 cells.
