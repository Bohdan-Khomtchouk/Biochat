TITLE
Pituitary Gene Expression Profiles of Growing Beef Steers Grazing High versus Low Endophyte-Infected Tall Fescue Grass

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Neotyphodium coenophialum is an endophytic fungus that infects most tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) pastures that are commonly used in animal grazing systems in the United States. Beef cattle grazing such pastures are impaired in health and production performance, resulting in a large economic loss in US food-animal production systems. Based on clinical and biochemical blood analyte profiles, hepatic targeted gene and protein analyses, and hepatic transcriptomic profiling, microarray analysis using the BovGene-1_0-v1 array (Affymetrix) was conducted to determine if grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue pastures affects pituitary gene expression profiles of growing beef steers. The specific overall hypothesis tested was that grazing high endophyte-infected pasture would alter the pituitary genomic expression profiles of the same growing steers, especially genes involved in production and secretion of prolactin, growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone.

DESIGN
Sixteen steers were assigned to graze either a low toxic endophyte tall fescue-mixed grass (LE treatment, 5.7 ha, n = 8) or a high toxic endophyte infected tall fescue (HE treatment, 5.7 ha, n = 8) pasture located in the University of Kentucky Agricultural Research Center. All steers had ad libitum access to fresh water, an industry standard mineral-vitamin supplement, and grazed respective pastures for 89 to 105 days. Whole pituitaries were collected for RNA extraction and microarray analysis.
