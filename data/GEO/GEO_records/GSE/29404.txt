TITLE
Expression Data from Toxoplasma gondii-Infected Murine Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We wanted to determine how type II Toxoplasma GRA15 and type I ROP16 affect host gene expression. We infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from B6 mice with type II (Pru), type II +ROP16 I, type II Δgra15, or type II Δgra15 + ROP16I.
