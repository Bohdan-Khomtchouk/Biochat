TITLE
Gene expression profiles in islets from pancreatectomized mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To obtain comprehensive profile of gene expression following a pancreatectomy, we performed microarray analysis of genes expressed in islets of C57BL/6J mice 3 days after  60% pancreatectomy or sham operation.

DESIGN
gene expression in mouse pancreatic islets was measured at 3 days after 60% pancreatectomy or sham operation.
