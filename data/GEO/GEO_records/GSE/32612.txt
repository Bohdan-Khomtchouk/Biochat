TITLE
Gene expression comparison of L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 grown in a glucose-based media and a sucrose-based media

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus reuteri

SUMMARY
Gene expression comparison of L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 grown (stationary phase) in a defined media with either glucose or sucrose as the carbon source, in anaerobic conditions at 37C.

DESIGN
Includes 2 biological replicates and dye-swaps for each comparison. Reference time point is is L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 grown in a glucose-based media.
