TITLE
Non adherent macrophage of mafb null and WT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MafB is a member of the large Maf family of transcription factors that share similar basic region/leucine zipper DNA binding motifs and N-terminal activation domains.Although it is well known that MafB is specifically expressed in  macrophages, characterization of the null mutant phenotype in these tissues has not been previously reported. To investigate suspected MafB functions macrophages, we generated mafB/green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in null mutant mice. MafB deficiency was found to dramatically suppress F4/80 expression in nonadherent macrophages. To investigate detail function of MafB in nonadherent macrophages, we performed microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Macrophages were derived from	day	14.5	fetal	livers 	of	mafB- /- and WT	mice. 	Suspensions of single fetal liver cells were prepared by mechanical disruption . A total of 106 cells in suspension were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium  supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (heat inactivated), streptomycin and penicillin (100 units/ml), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (10 ng/ml) and then seeded either onto a nonadhesive dishes coated with hydrophilic polymers (Hydrocell; Cell Seed, Tokyo). The culture medium was not changed throughout the experiment. M-CSF (final concentration, 10 ng/ml) was added every day from day 4 onwards. One, 2, 4, and 6 days after seeding, the cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. After 6 day culture, macrophages of Mafb-/- and WT were use microarray analysis .
