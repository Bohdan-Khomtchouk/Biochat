TITLE
Transcriptome analyses of narrow sheath shoot apical meristem (SAM) vs non-mutant SAM

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Loss of function mutations in the narrow sheath (ns) duplicate genes (ns1 and ns2) cause the deletion of a mediolateral domain from maize leaves. The ns genes encode duplicate WUSCHEL1-like homeobox (WOX) putative transcription factors that function redundantly and non-cell autonomously to direct recruitment of leaf founder cell-initials in a lateral domain of the shoot apex. In order to investigate the genetic mechanisms of NS1 gene function, SAM-specific transcriptional profiling of narrow sheath mutant1-R comparing to that of nonmutant using laser microdissection microarray. Whole SAMs were laser-microdissected from ns1-R mutant and non-mutant seedlings grown under the same controlled conditions. Microarray profiles were generated for 37,662 maize cDNAs contained on gene chips SAM 1.1, SAM 2.0 and SAM 3.0 (For details, see the the Iowa State University Center for Plant Genomics website). Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
