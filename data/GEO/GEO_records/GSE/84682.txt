TITLE
Effects of Long-term Exercise on Age-related Hearing Loss in Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regular exercise significantly slowed age-related hearing loss (AHL) and cochlear degeneration in a well- established murine model.

DESIGN
We examined the effects of long-term voluntary wheel running on age-related hearing loss in CBA/CaJ mice, a well-established model of AHL. The CBA/CaJ mouse strain displays late-onset age-related hearing loss by 18-20 months of age and is a widely used model of AHL
