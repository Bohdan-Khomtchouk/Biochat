TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Drosophila Wild Type and Sox21a-/- intestinal progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) of intestinal progenitor cells in Drosophila wild type and Sox21a mutant midgut. Methods: mRNA profiles of intestinal progenitor cells isolated from 7-day-old wild-type (WT) and Sox21a knockout (Sox21a−/−) Drosophila midgut were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 4000. Results: Each sequencing experiment generated an average 11.18 million raw reads, and 86% was successfully mapped for each experiment. 7608 transcripts were identified in the progenitor cells of WT and Sox21a−/− Drosophila midgut with TopHat workflow. 389 genes of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and Sox21a−/− progenitor cells, with a fold change ≥2.0 and p value < 0.05.  Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes uncovered several as yet uncharacterized genes that may contribute to intestinal function.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of intestinal progenitor cells isolated from 10-day-old wild-type (WT) and Sox21a knockout (Sox21a−/−) Drosophila adult midgut were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 4000.
