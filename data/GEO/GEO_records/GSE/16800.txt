TITLE
The function of OsCERK1 in the chitin elicitor signaling in Rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To see the function of OsCERK1 receptor-like kinase in the chitin elicitor signaling in Rice, we compared the gene expression profiles in the chitin oligosaccharide treated cultured rice cells of vector control and OsCERK1 knock-down mutant (RNAi). Keywords: Defense response

DESIGN
1,Chitin oligosaccharide treatment (vector control), 2,Chitin oligosaccharide treatment (vector control) color swap, 3,Chitin oligosaccharide treatment (OsCERK1 RNAi), 4,Chitin oligosaccharide treatment (OsCERK1 RNAi) color swap

PLATFORM
GPL6864 Agilent-015241 Rice Gene Expression 4x44K Microarray (Feature Number version)
