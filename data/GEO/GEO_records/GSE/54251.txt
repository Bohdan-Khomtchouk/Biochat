TITLE
Ammopiptanthus mongolicus leaf gene expression under drought and cold stress

ORGANISM
Ammopiptanthus mongolicus

SUMMARY
To undersand the machanism underlying the drought and cold srress tolerance of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus,we investigate the gene expression profile of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus leaves under drought stress(1hours,24hours,72hours) and low temperature (1hours,72hours ).

DESIGN
Mesophyll mRNA profiles of  wild type (WT) Ammopiptanthus mongolicus leaf (normal,drought stress,cold stress)  were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx.
