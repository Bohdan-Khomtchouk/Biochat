TITLE
Cell intrinsic changes in transcription of naïve CD4 T cells upon S1pr1 deletion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Naïve CD4 cells (CD45.2+CD4+,CD62L high,CD44 low) isolated from lymph nodes of mixed bone marrow chimeras 5 days after induced S1pr1 deletion.

DESIGN
CD45.1+ mice were reconstituted with a mix of BM from WT UBC:GFP mice and BM from S1pr1f/fUBC-CreERT2 CD45.2+ mice or littermate controls. S1pr1 was deleted by tamoxifen injection for 5 days. Naïve CD4+ CD62L high CD44 low CD45.2+ GFP- cells were sorted 5 days after last tamoxifen injection.

PLATFORM
