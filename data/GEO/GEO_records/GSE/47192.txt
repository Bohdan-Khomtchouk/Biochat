TITLE
Tissue-specific pioneer factors associate with androgen receptor cistromes and transcription programs. [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We report the in vivo androgen receptor (AR) binding sites in murine prostate, epididymis and kidney in response to physiological androgen testosterone using ChIP-sequencing and gene expression profiling by microarray. From AR cistrome analysis, we identified tissue-specific collaborating factors i.e. FoxA1 in prostate, Hnf4a in kidney and AP2a in epididymis and validated by ChIP-seq. The ChIP experiments have been performed using antibodies specific to AR, FoxA1, Hnf4a, AP-2a and IgG non-specific antibody as a negative control.

DESIGN
Examination of AR binding sites in murine androgen-responsive tissues prostate, epididymis and kidney using ChIP-seq. Further analysis of AR cistromes led to identification of tissue-specific collaborating factors and these collaborating factors are validated by ChIP-seq from the same tissues. Two parallel IgG samples were sequenced, merged together and used as a control data set. Parallel ChIP-seq samples were sequenced and merged for each replicate wherever required to contain approximately the same amount of reads across all tissues and conditions. All ChIP-seq experiments are performed in biological duplicates except for the castrated conditions.
