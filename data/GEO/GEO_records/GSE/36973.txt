TITLE
Gene expression profiling of MCF-7 cells treated with 6-shogaol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 18 genes were up-regulated and 11 genes were down-regulated > 2-fold following 6-shogaol treatment

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed in duplicate as follows: MCF-7 cells were treated with 10 uM of 6-shogaol or control vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 48 h. Total RNA from cells was extracted using Qiagen RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturersâ€™ protocol. RNA purity was examined by spectrophotometric determination at 260/280 nm. The microarray hybridizations were carried out using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
