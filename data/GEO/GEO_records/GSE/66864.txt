TITLE
Transcriptomic study on the impact of Temporomandibular joint Internal derangement in the Condylar Cartilage of Rabbits

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
Internal derangement (ID) in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) compromises a group of clinical problems, and holds a relative high prevalence in populations. However, the temporal change in gene expression of condylar cartilage during continous ID remains unclear. The aim of current study is investigating the differential expressed gene pattern in condylar cartilage of rabbits with ID from 1 to 8 weeks. Immunohistochemical results indicated that abnormal collagen fiber arrangements, fragmentation of fibrils, inflammatory cells infiltration were detected from 1 week to 4 week in joint disc specimens, while newly formed vessels, mucoid degeneration, meniscal tears, osteoclasts and osteoblasts were observed later. The microarray analysis showed 6478 genes have more than two-fold changes among all the tested transcripts. The inflammation gene group including ACE and IL1βincreased rapidly in the early stage while decrease later. On the contrary, the bone construction related genes showed a low level at first and increased at later period in the ID progression. Besides, the current study found some genes such as HLA2G, which had never been reported, might be relevant with ID. Our findings might provide useful insights into the pathological mechanism of ID in TMJ.

DESIGN
All the rabbits had free access to tap water and a standard diet for one week before the experiment. Four rabbits served as the control group (without any treatment), whereas sixteen rabbits’ left joints subjected to TMJ ID were treatment groups. The sixteen rabbits were divided randomly into four treatment groups, and each group were used for histological analysis, RNA microarray analysis and real-time PCR at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks respectively.
