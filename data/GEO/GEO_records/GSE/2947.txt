TITLE
Thiouracil Pulse-chase, Tachyzoites and Bradyzoites mRNA stability data

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
Pulse chase measurements using thiouracil (DTU) labeling via UPRT and chasing with uracil  Data from tachyzoites is labeled " DTU Pulse Chase " .  Two independent pulse chase experiments were performed in tachyzoites, pulse chase 1 and 2.  Duplicate arrays at each timepoint were performed for pulse chase 2 (2 a and b).  Data from bradyzoites are labeled " DTU Bradyzoite Pulse Chase " .  Two independent pulse chase experiments were performed in bradyzoites and a single set of arrays were performed for each experiment.  Just one chase timepoint was used in the bradyzoite experiments, the 2 hour chase. An RNA stablity experiment design type examines stability and/or decay of RNA transcripts.
