TITLE
oocyte miRNA profiling by array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study compares miRNA expression profiles in mouse oocytes as young oocytes vs aged oocytes, and growing oocytes vs small oocytes from primordial follicles.

DESIGN
Oocytes were derived from the ovary of young (6-8 week-old) C57BL/6 mice and aged (41-43 week-old) mice and pooled according to whether they were 20 to 50 um or 60 to 80 um in diameter. Of oocytes with the diameter of more than 60um, oocyte from young mice are called ‘young oocytes’ and those from aged mice near the end of their reproductive life span are called ‘aged oocytes’ to analyze the miRNA profiling associated with aging. They were also each called ‘small oocytes’ or ‘large oocytes’ from the size of 60um so as to investigate miRNA profiling associated with growing. Total RNA from oocytes was isolated using mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems). MiRNA expression was profiled using Agilent's Mouse miRNA Microarray Kit (G4472A) annotated against the Sanger miRBASE 10.1 database of miRNAs. This miRNA microarray was provided by Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA). Each sample was run in duplicate.
