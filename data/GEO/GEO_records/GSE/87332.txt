TITLE
In vivo gene expression profiling of mouse tumor progenitor cells with differences in EGFRvIII activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine gliomblastoma tumor progenitor cells TPCs with high and low EGFRvIII activity, pEGFR-Hi and pEGFR-Lo, showed differences in proliferation, differentiation, and invasion. Zs-Green-expressing TPCs were injected intracranially into immune-competent FVB mouse and tumor cells isolated at median survival +/-1 day by FACS followed by RNA isolation.

DESIGN
Expression analysis of FACS-isolated Green-expressing tumor cell from in vivo tumors
