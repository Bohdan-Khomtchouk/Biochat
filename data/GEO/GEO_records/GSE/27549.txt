TITLE
Genomic dna hybridizations of 10 Spring annual accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
These data provide a basis for the detection of sequence based polymorphisms between 10 Spring annual accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana.  The experimental data provides an initial characterization of differences among the accessions, as well as a means for improving gene expression studies with the filtering of SFP from arrays studies. Recent studies have documented remarkable genetic variation among Arabidopsis thaliana accessions collected from diverse habitats and across its geographical range.  Of particular interest are accessions with putatively locally adapted phenotypes â€“ i.e., accessions with attributes that are likely adaptive under the climatic or habitat conditions of their sites of origin.  These genotypes are especially valuable as they may provide insight into the genetic basis of adaptive evolution as well as allow the discovery of genes of ecological importance. The gene expression studies were conducted under two levels of soil moisture and accompanied by physiological measurements to characterize early responses to soil moisture deficit.

DESIGN
Each accession has 3 replicates, single channel on the ATH1 array.  Samples were processed in two balanced batches (bioprime random labeling, hybridization,scanning).  A total of 30 arrays
