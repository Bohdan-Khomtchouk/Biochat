TITLE
Expression data from murine hearts exposed to ischemic preconditioning comparing A2BAR null and wildtype BL6/C57 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genetically targeted mice with deficiency for the A2BAR show increased susceptibility to acute myocardial ischemia and are not protected by IP, a powerful strategy for cardioprotection, where short and repeated episodes of ischemia and reperfusion prior to myocardial infarction result in attenuation of infarct size. The purpose of this study was to identify genes that are potentially under the control of the cardiac A2B adenosine receptor

DESIGN
Untreated wildtype and A2BAR-/- mice were compared to wildtype and A2BAR-/- mice with IP treatment following a 2 hours reperfusion period
