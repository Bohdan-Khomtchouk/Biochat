TITLE
Cell death and regenerative proliferation pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma: The effect of furan on B6C3F1 mouse global gene expression in liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Furan is a mouse and rat hepatocarcinogen. We sought to determine the dose-dependent changes in gene expression upon exposure of B6C3F1 mice to furan in order to better understand furanâ€™s mode of action. Adult female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 1, 2, 4 or 8 mg/kg bw furan or vehicle control (corn oil) for three weeks and sacrificed four hours after the final exposure.

DESIGN
In this study we examined the transcriptional response in liver tissue of female B6C3F1 mice exposed to furan for 3 weeks at four different doses: 1, 2, 4 or 8 mg/kg bw furan (or vehicle control) and sacrificed four hours after the final exposure.  Each dose group had 4-5 biological replicates. There were a total of 25 samples included in the final analysis. We used a two-colour reference design and SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K microarrays (Agilent).
