TITLE
Liver Transcriptomics data from mouse model with Features of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have used a social defeat (SD) mouse model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that is based on a brief exposure of a mouse to the aggressor mice for either 5 d or 10 d stress periods. Mice simulating aspects of posttraumatic stress disorder exhibit behavioral changes, body weight gain, increased body temperature, and inflammatory and fibrotic histopathologies and transcriptomic changes of heart tissue. Liver tissue of these mice was subjected to mRNA analysis. Transcriptomic analysis of liver indicated chronic toxicities and metabolic alterations in aggressor-exposed mice that possibly contributed to the persistent metabolic disturbance

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, C57BL6/J mice Biological replicates: 4-6 control replicates, 5-6 stressed replicates.
