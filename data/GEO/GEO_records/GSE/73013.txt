TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation change due to lncRNA H19 knockdown in myotubes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used Methyl-MiniSeq platform from Zymo Research company to identify genome-wide methylation changes affected by lncRNA H19 knockdown in myotubes. Following H19 knockdown, we observed extensive genome-wide mthylation pattern changes relative to siCon cells, with some genes showing incresed methylation, others showing decreased methylation, and a third group with no significant change.

DESIGN
Myotubes differentiated from mouse C3H myoblasts were transfected with either control siRNA or siH19, 48h later, cellular genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to genome-scale DNA methylation mapping using the platform of an improved version of Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS).

PLATFORM
GPL18480 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Mus musculus)
