TITLE
Replication timing of siRNA control and siRNA PolQRKO cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human A-family DNA polymerase Î¸ (Pol q) is a large, multidomain enzyme whose physiological function is still unclear despite its in vitro translesion synthesis capacity in front of DNA damage and its involvement in some features of DNA repair after external stress. Here we present evidence that Pol q holds a novel role in the absence of external stress as a critical determinant of the replication timing program in human cells. Pol q binds to chromatin at early G1 and is required for proper formation of pre-replicative complexe and replication origin activation. Pol q-depleted cells show modified spatial organization of chromatin-loop structures at replication factories. Genome-wide analysis of replication timing shows delayed replication of a part of early replicating domains and advanced replication of a part of late replicating domains following Pol q depletion. Our results identify Pol q as one of the first critical human factors discovered in the replication timing programme.

DESIGN
