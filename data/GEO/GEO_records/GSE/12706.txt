TITLE
Tissue specific profiling of the human pathogen Schistosoma japonicum

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
Key tissues of the adult female parasite involved in nutritional uptake and reproduction were examined using a novel gene discovery approach that combined laser microdissection microscopy and microarray analyses. Gastrodermis, vitelline glands and ovary were microdissected from unfixed, frozen sections of the Asian species, Schistosoma japonicum.  Total RNA was isolated from the enriched tissue preparations and microarray analyses undertaken to generate tissue specific gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
Single colour adult female schistosome laser microdissection microarray data with technical replicates in duplicate: Gastrodermis (gut); vitelline glands (vitelline); ovary; and whole section (control).
