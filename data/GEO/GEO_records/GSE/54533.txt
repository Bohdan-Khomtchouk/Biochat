TITLE
Dual transcriptomic analysis of the interaction between the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor S238N and soil Collimonas fungivorans Ter331

ORGANISM
Collimonas fungivorans

SUMMARY
In order to get insights into the ability of ectomycorrhizal fungi to perceive their biotic environment as well as into the mechanisms of the interactions between ectomycorrhizal fungi and soil bacteria, we analysed the transcriptomic response of the ectomycorrhizal fungus L. bicolor and one detrimental bacterial strain during their interactions in vitro.

DESIGN
We performed hybridizations (whole genome array) with samples derived from Collimonas fungivorans Ter331cultivated alone or with Laccaria bicolor S238N in vitro (2 control biological replicates and 2 biological replicates with L. bicolor)

PLATFORM
GPL18236 Nimblegen Collimonas fungivorans Ter331 array
