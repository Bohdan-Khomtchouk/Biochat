TITLE
The comparison of gene expression profile in the amygdalae between the wild-type and neuropsin knock-out mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Extracellular proteolysis contributes to fear-associated responses by facilitating neuronal plasticity at the neuron-matrix interface. A serine protease neuropsin is critical for stress-related plasticity in the amygdala by regulating the strength of EphB2/NMDA receptor interaction controlling the expression of fear-related genes and anxiety-like behavior. To look for downstream effects of neuropsin-mediated disassembly of the EphB2/NR1 complex we analyzed gene expression in the amygdalae of wild-type and neuropsin-/- mice.

DESIGN
Wild-type control and neuropsin-/- mice were anaesthetised and perfused transcardially with ice cold PBS. The brains were removed and dissected using a vibrating microtome. Amygdalae were dissected from a coronal slice and were stored in RNAlater until processed. The amygdalae have been isolated from 15 brains of neuropsin-/- and 15 wild-type control animals. RNA pulled from 3 animals has been reverse transcribed and hybridized with GeneChip Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Affymetrix Array.
