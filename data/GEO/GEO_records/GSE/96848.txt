TITLE
Identification of HDA15-PIF1 as a Key Repression Module Directing the Transcriptional Network of Seed Germination in the Dark

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
our analysis uncovered the role of histone deacetylation in light-regulated seed germination process and identified that HDA15-PIF1 as a key repression module directing the transcription network of seed germination

DESIGN
whole genomic transcriptome analysis of wild type(Col) and hda15 mutant in FR(Dark) conditions,in triplicate, using an mRNA Seq Kit (Illumina).

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
