TITLE
DNA methylation of human colorectal cancer and HeLa sample

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and tumor colorectal cancer samples, HCT116 DKO (DNMT1 (-/-) and DNMT3b (-/-)), M.sssI treated DKO cell lines, and human cervical cancer cell line HeLa. The Illumina Infinium Human DNA methylation EPIC Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 85,000 CpGs in the above samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 8 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips

PLATFORM
GPL21145 Infinium MethylationEPIC
