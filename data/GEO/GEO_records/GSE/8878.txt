TITLE
water stress-Identification of targets of the transcription factor hahb-4 in relation to abiotic stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs04-09_hahb4 - water stress - We want to know which genes are over-expressed or down regulated in Arabidopsis plants transformed with the sunflower hahb-4 homeodomain transcription factor with respect to non transformed ones in control and water stress conditions. This gene, hahb4, confers drought tolerance to transgenic Arabidopsis plants. - Overexpression of the hahb4 gene vs vector transformed control Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic),treated vs untreated comparison
