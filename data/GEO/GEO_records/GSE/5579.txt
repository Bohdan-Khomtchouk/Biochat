TITLE
Hypoxia and lymphatic endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lymphatic endothelial cells were grown under normoxia, hypoxia (1% 0xygen) and conditioned medio from NSLCN growth under normoxia or hypoxia. Gene expression was measured and comparition between samples performed Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
