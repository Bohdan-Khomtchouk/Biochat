SUMMARY
RNASeq data for mPB or CB-derived CD34+ exposed to UM171

DESIGN
human mobilized peripheral blood or cord blood-derived CD34(+) cells were cultured for 16 hours with vehicle (DMSO),  dose response of UM171 [11.9nM, 19nM, 30.5nM, 48.8nM, 78.1nM and 125nM], SR1 [500nM] and combination of( UM171  [48.8nM]+SR1 [500nM])
