TITLE
Expression analysis of picloram responsive genes preceding cell elongation in Arabidopsis hypocotyls.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In this study we profile expression of target genes downstream of auxin signaling in Arabidopsis hypocotyls elongating in response to auxin. The synthetic auxin picloram is used in order to take advantage of the picloram-resistant auxin receptor mutant afb5-5, which fails to elongate in response to picloram.

DESIGN
A 4-plex chip was used for analyzing the transcriptome in hypocotyls dissected from wild-type seedlings following a 30min and 2hr picloram or solvent control treatment.  Three biological replicate samples were analyzed, each containing roughly 400 hypocotyls. A 12-plex chip was used for analyzing mRNA from hypocotyls dissected from wild-type and afb5-5 (SALK_110643) mutant seedlings following a 2hr picloram or solvent control treatment.  Three biological replicates were analyzed, each containing roughly 700 hypocotyls.
