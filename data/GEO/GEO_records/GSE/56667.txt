TITLE
Differential Gene Expression in PARP13 Knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase-13 (PARP13/ZAP/ZC3HAV1) is an antiviral factor, active against specific RNA viruses such as MLV, SINV and HIV. During infection PARP13 binds viral RNA via its 4 CCCH-type zinc finger domains and targets it for degradation by recruiting cellular mRNA decay factors such as the exosome complex and XRN1. Here we show that PARP13 binds to and regulates cellular mRNA under physiological conditions. Knock-down of PARP13 via RNAi results in the misregulation of hundreds of transcripts with an enrichment in signal peptide containing proteins. Among the most upregulated transcripts is TRILR4
