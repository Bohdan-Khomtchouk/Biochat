TITLE
Microarray analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing the Hsp90 mutant hsc82-W296A

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Altered mRNA levels of HBT1 were observed in S. cerevisiae cells expressing hsc82-W296A compared to WT HSC82. We conducted microarray analysis to determine the extent of other changes in that strain.

DESIGN
The yeast strain used contained chromosomal deletions of HSC82 and HSP82. WT HSC82 or hsc82-W296A was supplied on a plasmid so that it was the only Hsp90 present in the cell. Yeast were grown overnight in rich media at 30Â° and harvested during exponential growth phase. RNA was harvested from three cultures expressing WT Hsc82 and 3 cultures expressing the Hsp90 mutant..
