TITLE
Target genes of BRG1 in human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BRG1-SWI/SNF complex is an important chromatin remodeling complex that involved in various biological processes. Here we described the genome-wide binding of histone acetylation upon BRG1 depletion in human embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
Human embryonic stem cells were treated with either scrambled siRNA or siRNA against BRG1 for 48 h, and each treatment has three replicates.
