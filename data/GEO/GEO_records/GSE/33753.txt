TITLE
Expression data from RU486 treated FVB wild-type and MMTV- PAX8PPARg mouse mammary tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine if RU-486 would be effective as a chemopreventive agent, microarrays were used to analyse global gene expression changes in wild-type vs. MMTV-PAX8PPARg mice to determine their differential response to RU486

DESIGN
RNA was isolated (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) from progestin/DMBA induced mammary tumors from wi transgenic and wild-type mice treated with placebo or 2.5mg RU486 60-day release pellets
