TITLE
Molecular Mediators of Cardiac Pathology in Cardiorenal Syndrome Type 4 [anti-miR-21]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the changes in left ventricle mRNA abundance in response to miR-21-5p suppression in 5/6 nephrectomized rats.

DESIGN
Ten week old male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to the excision model of 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) surgery.  LNA-anti-scrambled or LNA-anti-miR-21-5p was delivered intravenously in 3 daily doses of 1 mg/kg at 1 and 4 weels post-surgery.  Left ventricle tissue was collected for mRNA sequencing 7 weeks after surgery.

PLATFORM
GPL14844 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Rattus norvegicus)
