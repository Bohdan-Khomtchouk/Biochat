TITLE
ESC (HES2, MEL1 or H9) grown in various conditions and FACs sorted for GCTM-2 and CD9

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the following experiment, three different hESC cell lines (HES2, MEL1 and H9) were grown in the presence of KOSR, KOSR or mTESR containing media respectively. KOSR (Knockout serum replacement medium) is a standard media allowing the growth of hESC without the need for manual passaging - Enzymatic passaging is used instread.  mTESR (Ludwig et al., 2007) is a media allowing the growth of hESC on matrigel with enzymatic passaging.   At day 7 after passaging, these cells were FACs sorted for the presence of GCTM-2 and CD9 into 4 distinct fractions (p4: GCTM-2-neg, CD9-neg; p5: GCTM-2-low, CD9-low; p6: GCTM-2-medium, CD9-medium and p7: GCTM-2-high, CD9-high).   For each cell line-subfraction combination, RNA was harvested and subject to microarray. From each experiment (individual cell line), 4 samples were collected (p4, p5, p6 and p7) and these were subject to microarray.  In each case the experiment was performed in triplicate

DESIGN
Three independent experiments of three consecutive passages of ESC cells were grown and subject to FACs sorting, collection and microarray.  A total of 36 samples, (3 experiments of 3 replicates of 4 sorted populations of cells (p4, p5, p6, p7))
