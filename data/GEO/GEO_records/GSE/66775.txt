TITLE
Transcriptional response to aminoglycoside antibiotics in cochlear hair cells at 3 hour

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We purified Atoh1-GFP positive hair cells from organotypic cultures of P1 cochlea 3 hours after 0.5mM gentamicin treatment and performed RNA sequencing to profile the early transcriptional response of hair cells to aminoglycoside antibiotics.

DESIGN
Levels of mRNA in gentamicin-treated hair cells (three replicates) were compared to untreated hair cells (three replicates). GFP negative, non-hair cells populations from treated organs were compared to those from untreated organs (three replicates for each condition).
