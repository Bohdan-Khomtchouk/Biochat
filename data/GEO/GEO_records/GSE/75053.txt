TITLE
Expression analysis of the fungus Ustilago maydis WT strain FB2 (a2b2) at different pH values

ORGANISM
Ustilago maydis

SUMMARY
Elicidate the changes of the transcriptional program response of U. maydis WT strain (a2b2) when transfered from neutrality to acidic or alkaline medium The mutants strains CL211 and GP25 used as controls as well as the WT strain are described in Martínez-Espinoza et al., 1997; 2004;González-Prieto et al., 2014 and Banuett & Herskowitz, 1989 respectively.
