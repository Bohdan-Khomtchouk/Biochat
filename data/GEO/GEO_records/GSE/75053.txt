TITLE
Expression analysis of the fungus Ustilago maydis WT strain FB2 (a2b2) at different pH values

ORGANISM
Ustilago maydis 521

SUMMARY
Elicidate the changes of the transcriptional program response of U. maydis WT strain (a2b2) when transfered from neutrality to acidic or alkaline medium The mutants strains CL211 and GP25 used as controls as well as the WT strain are described in Martínez-Espinoza et al., 1997; 2004;González-Prieto et al., 2014 and Banuett & Herskowitz, 1989 respectively.

DESIGN
High density-one color arrays from Nimblegen were used according to a design from Scott Gold from University of Georgia. The design has five different oligonucleotides of 60 bp in lenght in duplicate, representing each one of the 6883 gene of the U. maydis genome.
