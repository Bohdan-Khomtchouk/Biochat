TITLE
Effects of TGF-beta on mature macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to identify the effects of TGF-beta on primary human macrophages maturated under different conditions. Keywords: time course, differentiation conditions, alternative activation

DESIGN
For the analysis of TGF-beta effects macrophages were differentiated in the presence of IL-4 or IL-4 in combination with dexamethasone. After 5 days differentiation mature macrophages were stimulated by TGF-beta for 24 hours. In the case of IL-4/dexamethasone stimulation an additional data point was taken. In this case macrophages were also stimulated by TGF-beta for 3 hours. For every group 5 independent donors were taken.
