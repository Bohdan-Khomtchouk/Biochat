TITLE
Transcriptomic signatures of Auger electron radioimmunotherapy using nuclear targeting 111In-trastuzumab for potential combination therapies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to identify targetable molecular signatures for enhancing the cytotoxic effects of In-111-trastuzumab-NLS using microarray technology.

DESIGN
Changes in gene expression in SKBR3 cells untreated or treated with unlabeled or In-111-labeled antibodies for 7 days were measured. Three independent experiments in each condition were performed.
