TITLE
Knockout of the Arp2/3 complex in epidermis causes a psoriasis-like disease hallmarked by hyperactivation of transcription factor Nrf2 [Keratinocytes ssRNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Arp2/3 complex assembles branched actin filaments key to many cellular processes, but its organismal roles remain poorly understood. Here we employed conditional arpc4 knockout mice to study the function of the Arp2/3 complex in the epidermis.We found that depletion of the Arp2/3 complex by knockout of arpc4 results in skin abnormalities at birth that evolve into a severe psoriasis-like disease hallmarked by hyperactivation of transcription factor Nrf2. Knockout of arpc4 in cultured keratinocytes was sufficient to induce nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, upregulation of Nrf2-target genes and decreased filamentous actin levels. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex unmasked the role of branched actin filaments in Nrf2 regulation. Consistently, we unveiled that Nrf2 associates with the actin cytoskeleton in cells and binds to filamentous actin in vitro Finally, we discovered that Arpc4 is downregulated in both human and mouse psoriatic epidermis. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex affects keratinocytes' shape and transcriptome through an actin-based cell-autonomous mechanism that influences epidermal morphogenesis and homeostasis.
