TITLE
Probing nucleosome function: A highly versatile library of synthetic histone H3 and H4 mutants

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The structural integrity of the nucleosome is central to regulation of DNA metabolism and transcription. We describe a library of 486 systematic histone H3 and H4 substitution and deletion mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that probe the contribution of each residue to nucleosome function and can be episomal or genomically integrated. We tagged each mutant histone gene with unique molecular barcodes, facilitating identification of mutant pools through barcode amplification, labeling, and microarray hybridization. We probed fitness contributions of each residue to chemical perturbagens of chromosome integrity and transcription, mapping global patterns of chemical sensitivities and requirements for three forms of transcriptional silencing onto the nucleosome surface. Lethal mutants were surprisingly rare and of distinct types; one set of mutations mapped precisely to the DNA interaction surface. The barcode microarrays were useful for scoring complex phenotypes such as competitive fitness in a chemostat, proficiency of DNA repair, and synthetic genetic interactions. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
These nine datasets characterize a microarray platform repurposed for profiling a barcoded comprehensive library of synthetic histone mutants. The first two datasets establish the wide dynamic range and high sensitivity and specificity of data from this platform. The other seven datasets demonstrate the usefulness of this technology for scoring subtle and complex phenotypes of the histone H3 and H4 alleles in this library.
