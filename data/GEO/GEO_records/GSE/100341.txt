TITLE
PGC-1a Provides a Transcriptional Framework for Synchronous Neurotransmitter Release from ParvalbuminPositive Interneurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PGC-1a is a master regulator for cell mitochondrial and metabolism function. In this experiment neurons were infected with a PGC-1a/GFP adenovirus to examine what genes were upregulated by over expression. Known targets related to mitochondrial health were confirmed while new neuron specific targets were discovered.

DESIGN
SHSY5Y cells were infected with an adenovirus containing either GFP or GFP and PGC-1a and then had their transcriptome hybridized to a microarray to observe what genes were affected.
