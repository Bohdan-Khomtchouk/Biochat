TITLE
Expression profile of maliganant mesothelioma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
transcriptional profiling of makignant mesothelioma cell lines comparing control one immortalized mesothelial cell line, MeT-5A, and 2 primary normal mesothelial cultures collected from ascites of non-cancer patients, OV-M1 and GAS-M1

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, mesothleioma  cells vs. normal mesothelial cells
