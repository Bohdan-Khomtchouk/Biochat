TITLE
Common activation of RAS_MAPK pathway in serous LMP tumours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profile of 30 LMP tumours and 60 Serous tumours were compared to identify the biolgical pathways specific to these groups. Genotyping was done to identify the mutations potentially causing these phenotypes

DESIGN
