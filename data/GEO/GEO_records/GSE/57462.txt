TITLE
Expression analysis of Streptococcus pyogenes isolate SF370 and its rgg2 mutant

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes M1 GAS

SUMMARY
Differences in gene expression between the wild-typ SF370 and its rgg2 mutant was identified with samples collected from mid-exponential and post-exponential phases of growth

DESIGN
Samples were collected from both the wild-type and rgg2 mutant at 2hrs and 5hrs of growth. RNA was extracted, amplified and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
