TITLE
Expression data from Control and Yorkie overexpression  pupal eye discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To probe mechanistic determinants of Yki function in mitochondrial biogenesis, we conducted a genome-wide microarray experiment, and specifically compared expression patterns of genes from control (GMR gal4) and Yorkie over-expressing (GMR gal4; UAS yki) pupal eye discs.

DESIGN
The above mentioned genotypes were grown at 29 deg C and at about 40 hrs after pupariation, the pupal eye discs were dissected. RNA was extracted from the pupal eye discs, purified and used to generate microarray probes that were hybridized to the Drosophila genome 2 arrays (Affymetrix). The Gene Chip Operating system (Affymetrix) and dCHIP program (Harvard University) were used to generate pairwise comparisons between the transcription profiles of control and Yorkie over-expressing discs.
