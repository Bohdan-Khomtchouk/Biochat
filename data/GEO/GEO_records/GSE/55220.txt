TITLE
Gene expression data from control and REPTOR KO larvae after 6h rapamycin treatment

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The first aim was to identify genes whose transcription is induced by rapamycin feeding in Drosophila larvae. Secondly, the goal was to find out which contribution the transcription factor REPTOR (=CG13624) has to the observed changes in expression. We thus compared gene epxression between rapamycin fed and control fed larvae in wild type larvae and in REPTOR KO larvae.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates from 4 conditions: control larvae plus/miuns rapamycin, KO larvae plus/minus rapamycin; overall 12 samples

PLATFORM
GPL16820 Agilent-021791 D. melanogaster (FruitFly) Oligo Microarray 4x44K v. 2 (Probe Name version)
