TITLE
miRNA profiling data of mouse bone marrow samples four days post 5-FU treatment versus untreated controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify miRNAs that regulate hematopoietic response after 5-FU-induced injury, we analyzed miRNA expression changes in bone marrow cells from mice with or without 5-FU treatment. Global miRNA expression profiling of the 5-FU and untreated cohorts showed that 92 miRNAs (among 168 that passed the detection threshold) were significantly upregulated or downregulated, with false discovery rates < 5%.

DESIGN
Female 6wk-old C57Bl6/J mice were left untreated or given a single dose of 5-FU (150mg/kg).  Four days post treatment whole bone marrow was isolated from each animal (n=3 for treated and n=5 for untreated controls) and lysed for total RNA using Trizol (Invitrogen).  Samples were profiled for miRNA expression using a bead-based profiling methodology (Lu et al., 2008). Profiling data were normalized assuming equal total miRNA expression across samples. Differential miRNA expression was analyzed by studentâ€™s t-test and then calculated for false discovery rate using the Benjamini and Hochberg method.
