TITLE
Integrated transcript and genome analyses reveal NKX2-1 and MEF2C as potential oncogenes in T-ALL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify novel oncogenic pathways in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we combined expression profiling of 117 pediatric patient samples and detailed molecular cytogenetic analyses including the Chromosome Conformation Capture on Chip (4C) method. Two T-ALL subtypes were identified that lacked rearrangements of known oncogenes. One subtype associated with cortical arrest, expression of cell cycle genes and ectopic NKX2-1 or NKX2-2 expression for which rearrangements were identified. The second subtype associated with immature T-cell development and high expression of the MEF2C transcription factor as consequence of rearrangements of MEF2C, transcription factors that target MEF2C or MEF2C-associated cofactors. We propose NKX2-1, NKX2-2 and MEF2C as T-ALL oncogenes that are activated by various rearrangements.

DESIGN
This study includes 117 pediatric T-ALL samples of which 92 samples are available at GSE10609. In addition, this study includes 7 normal bone marrow control samples
