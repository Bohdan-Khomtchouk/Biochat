TITLE
Comparative Transcriptomes Profiling of Photoperiod-sensitive Male Sterile Rice Nongken 58S between Short Day and Long Day Condition

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Nongken 58S is photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile (PGMS) rice. Its pollens are fully sterile when it is treated with LD condition from glume primordium differentiation stage to pistil/stamen primordium forming stage, and its pollens are fertile when treated with SD condition during these stages. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of leaf gene expression under LD and SD condition for investigating the transcriptomes in the male sterility transition in PGMS rice to find out the genes related to this transition

DESIGN
We compared the transcriptomes of Nongken 58S under shortday (SD) and longday (LD) at the glume primordium differentiation stage and pistil/stamen primordium forming stage, respectively. 12 samples were analyzed, and each treatment had biological triplicates. Supplementary files: SD vs LD during the glume primordium differentiation stage and the pistil/stamen primordium forming stage.
