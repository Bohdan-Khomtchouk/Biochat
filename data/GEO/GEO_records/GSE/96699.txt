TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state and abundance of transcription factors IRF1 and IRF4 in Th9 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to to compare changes in chromatin status evoked by IFN-g signalling in Th9 cells. Furthermore, the binding of transcription factors IRF1 and IRF4 in Th9 cells were analysed to analyse whether IRF4 abundance is affected by IFN-g-induced IRF1 binding at regulatory regions in Th9 cells.

DESIGN
H3K27Ac, IRF1 and IRF4 binding profiles were generated in Th9 cells in the presence or abesence of IFN-g.
