TITLE
Ultra-fast transcriptional responses in plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptome of plants exposed to 0, 20 and 60 sec light stress was analyzed using Illumina HiSeq2000. We found that mRNA accumulation of more than 700 transcripts in plants occurs as early as 20-60 sec following light stress application

DESIGN
Three independent biological replicates, each composed of leaves pooled from at least 30 different plants, were used per experimental condition (0, 20 and 60 sec high light)

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
