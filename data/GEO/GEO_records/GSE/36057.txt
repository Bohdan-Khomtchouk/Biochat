TITLE
Lung Natural Helper cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Natural Helper cells constitute a unique lineage of Th2-cytokine producting innate lymphocytes, here we characterize the gene expression profile of non-stimulated or PMA/ionomycin-stimulated Natural Helper cells from naive C57Bl/6 mouse lungs. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression profile of stimulated and unstimulated lung Natural Helper cells in mice.

DESIGN
Lineage(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(-/low)CD127(+)CD25(+) Lung Natural Helper cells were purified from naive 6-8 week old B6 mice by FACS.  RNA was extracted immediately from un-stimulated Natural Helper cells after FACS. Stimulated Natural Helper cells were cultured with PMA/ionomycin for 3 days followed by RNA extraction.
