TITLE
Global gene expression profile of mouse ESC-2i, EpiSC-CHIR/XAV and EpiSC-FGF2/activin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The requirements for self-renewal differ between EpiSCs and ES cells and the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Here we show that mouse EpiSCs can be efficiently derived and robustly propagated even from single cells, using two small-molecule inhibitors: CHIR99021 and XAV939. The whole-genome microarray analyses is performed to confirm the identity of EpiSC maintained in CHIR/XAV by comparing the expression profile in EpiSC-CHIR/XAV to those in ESC maintained in 2i and EpiSC maintained in FGF2/activin.

DESIGN
Total RNA from ESC-2i, EpiSC-CHIR/XAV, and EpiSC-FGF2/activin were extracted for microarray analisys
