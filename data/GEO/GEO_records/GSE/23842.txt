TITLE
TEL-AML1 regulation of survivin and apoptosis via miRNA-494 and miRNA-320a

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is increasing evidence that microRNA and transcription factors interact in an instructive fashion in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.  We explored the impact of TEL-AML1 (ETV6-RUNX1), the most common fusion protein in childhood leukemia, on miRNA expression and the leukemic phenotype.  Using RNA interference, miRNA expression arrays, and quantitative PCR, we identified miRNA-494 and miRNA-320a to be upregulated upon TEL-AML1 silencing independently of TEL expression.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis identified miRNA-494 as a direct miRNA target of the fusion protein TEL-AML1.    Using bioinformatic analysis as well as functional luciferase experiments we demonstrate that survivin is a target of the two miRNAs.   MiRNA-494 and -320a were introduced to the cells by transfection and survivin expression determined by western blot analysis.  These miRNAs blocked survivin expression and resulted in apoptosis in a similar manner as TEL-AML1 silencing by itself; this silencing was also shown to be DICER-dependent.  MiRNAs-494 and -320a are expressed at lower levels in TEL-AML1+ leukemias compared to immunophenotype-matched non-TEL-AML1 ALL subtypes, and within TEL-AML1+ leukemias their expression is correlated to survivin levels.  In summary our data suggest that TEL-AML1 might exert its anti-apoptotic action at least in part by suppressing miRNA-494 and miRNA-320a, lowering their expression causing enhanced survivin expression.

DESIGN
DNAs from REH cells were pulled down using ChIP antibodies to TEL and hybridized to microRNA promoter tiling arrays.
