TITLE
Investigating the role of Lef1 in mouse embryonic stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in piggybac empty vector and  piggybac-lef1 transfected mouse embryonic stem cells (46C mouse ESCs) Analysis of genes regulated by lef1, and we found that lef1 acts biphasically in mouse embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from empty vector (PB)-transfected 46 ESCs or different states (passage 2 and passage 5)  of lef1-transfected (PB-Lef1 P2, PB-Lef1 P5) 46C mouse ESCs.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
