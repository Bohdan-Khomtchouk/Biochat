TITLE
Apoptosis-associated transcriptome profiles in peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy volunteers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Refer to the SuperSeries

DESIGN
This series is the set of microarray measurements of transcriptome profiles in peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy volunteers for identifying potentially clinically relevant  mRNAs. The set is intended for comparisons with the acute stage groups and the reconvalescent groups presented in the other series in the superseries. The splicing-sensitive microarray (platform GPL23086) covers 221 genes, each microarray encompasses 4 identical probe-containing areas. Blood samples obtained from 6 healthy volunteers were included in the series.
