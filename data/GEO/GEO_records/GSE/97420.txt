TITLE
Epigenetic silencing of triple negative breast cancer hallmarks by Withaferin A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by poor prognosis and a DNA hypomethylation profile. Withaferin A (WA) is a plant derived steroidal lactone which holds promise as a therapeutic agent for treatment of breast cancer (BC).  We determined genome-wide DNA methylation changes in weakly-metastatic and  aggressive, metastatic BC cell lines, following 72h treatment to a subcytotoxic  concentration of WA. In contrast to the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2â€™-  deoxycytidine (DAC), WA treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells rather tackles an epigenetic  cancer network through gene-specific DNA hypermethylation of tumor promoting  genes including ADAM metallopeptidase domain 8 (ADAM8), urokinase-type  plasminogen activator (PLAU), tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member  12 (TNFSF12), and genes related to detoxification (glutathione S-transferase mu 1,  GSTM1), or mitochondrial metabolism (malic enzyme 3, ME3). Gene expression and  pathway enrichment analysis further reveals epigenetic suppression of multiple cancer  hallmarks associated with cell cycle regulation, cell death, cancer cell metabolism,  cell motility and metastasis. Remarkably, DNA hypermethylation of corresponding  CpG sites in PLAU, ADAM8, TNSF12, GSTM1 and ME3 genes correlates with receptor  tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 amplification (HER2)/estrogen receptor (ESR)/  progesterone receptor (PR) status in primary BC tumors. Moreover, upon comparing  differentially methylated WA responsive target genes with DNA methylation changes in  different clinical subtypes of breast cancer patients in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA),  we found that WA silences HER2/PR/ESR-dependent gene expression programs to  suppress aggressive TNBC characteristics in favor of luminal BC hallmarks, with an  improved therapeutic sensitivity. In this respect, WA may represent a novel and  attractive phyto-pharmaceutical for TNBC treatment.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, left untreated or exposed for 72h to Withaferin A were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
