TITLE
Selection of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae promoters available for xylose cultivation and fermentation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To select candidate promoters that function in the presence of xylose, we performed comprehensive gene expression analyses using xylose-utilizing yeast strains both during xylose and glucose fermentation.

DESIGN
Samples were taken after 9 h in fermentation medium containing 50g /L xylose or after 3 h in fermentation medium containing 50 g/L glucose, respectively. Each samples were triplicated resulting in total of 6 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL9294 Agilent-015072 Yeast Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Probe Name version)
