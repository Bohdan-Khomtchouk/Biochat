TITLE
PNAs-A15 effects on cervical cancer cells line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profile of HeLa and C33A cervical cancer cells line treated with PNAs-A15 for 6 hours. PNAs-A15 is peptide nucleic acid of A-repeats length 15 bp that can suppress up-regulated A-repeats containing genes in cervical cancer cells line.

DESIGN
The cervical cancer cell line HeLa and C33A  was maintained at 37C in 5% CO2  under sterile conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with PNAs-A15 in 6-well microplates for 6 h. Total RNA was isolated and hybridized on the HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip. The RNA expressions were evaluated and compared with 2 repeats of controlled experiments.
