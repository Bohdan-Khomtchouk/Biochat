TITLE
RNAs enriched at protrusions of control or APC knockdown fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used a fractionation scheme to isolate protrusions and cell bodies from control or APC knockdown fibroblasts, which were induced to extend protrusions in response to addition of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Four replicate protrusion and cell body samples for each cell type were analyzed by RNA-Seq. To identify RNAs enriched in protrusions, a protrusion/cell body ratio was calculated. We find that ca. 7% of detected RNAs were enriched in protrusions of control cells. Knockdown of APC reduced the protrusion enrichement of a subset of these RNAs, indicating that they are dependent on APC for their localization. Localization of the remaining RNAs was not significantly affected upon APC knockdown suggesting that their localization is mediated by an APC-independent mechanism.

DESIGN
RNA-seq profiles of protrusions and cell bodies from cells transfected with control siRNAs or with siRNAs against APC. Four replicates were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
