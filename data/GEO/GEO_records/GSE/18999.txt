TITLE
Effects of exercise on miRNA expression level in human neutrophils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exercise leads to a rapid change in the profile of gene expression in circulating neutrophils. We hypothesized that miRNA expression in circulating neutrophils would also be affected by brief exercise.

DESIGN
Eleven healthy men (19-30 yr old) performed 10 2-min bouts of cycle ergometer exercise interspersed with 1-min rest at a constant work equivalent to about 76% of VO2max. A baseline blood sample was taken before the and immediately after the exercise. Neutrophils were isolated using OptiPrep Density Gradient Medium (SIGMA). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzolÂ®. For this study we used Agilent Human miRNA microarrays V2 (total of 22 chips).
