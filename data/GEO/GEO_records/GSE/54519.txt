TITLE
Mouse male and female astrocytoma cells stably transfected with shRNA targeting Cdca7l

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cdca7l is expressed higher in male astrocytoma/GBM than female tumors or normal cells, and knockdown of Cdca7l blocks growth of male tumor cells, but not female tumor cells. We stably depleted Cdca7l in mouse astrocytoma cells and compared gene expression to control astrocytoma cells expressing non-targeting scrambled shRNA in male and female cells and to wild type primary astrocytes to identify gene expression differences between male and female cells and between Cdca7l-depleted, scrambled shRNA control cells and wild type primary astrocytes.

DESIGN
Independent established cell lines taken from mouse male and female C57BL/6J (B6) mice with astrocytoma were stably transfected with either shRNA targeting Cdca7l or non-targeting scrambled shRNA control. For astrocytoma cells, two independent mouse male astrocytoma cell lines and two independent mouse female astrocytoma cell lines were used: male K4820 astrocytoma cells, male K1861 astrocytoma cells, female K2797 astrocytoma cells, and female K5001 astrocytoma cells (2 technical replicates per each cell line except for K5001). For astrocytes, 3 biological replicates were used for each of 2 groups: C57BL/6J (B6) male astrocytes, C57BL/6J (B6) female astrocytes.
