TITLE
Genome wide array analysis of endosseous implant adherent cellular phenotypes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Objective: to identify the early molecular processes involved in osseointegration associated with a micro roughened and nanosurface featured implants.

DESIGN
Thirty-two titanium implants with surface topographies exhibiting nanoscale features (AT-I) and microrough surface without nanoscale features (AT-II) were placed in the tibiae of 8 rats and subsequently harvested at 2 and 4 days after placement. Total RNA was isolated from cells adherent to retrieved implants. A whole genome microarray using the Affymetrix Rat gene 1.1 ST Array  was used to describe the gene expression profiles that were differentially regulated by the implant surfaces.
