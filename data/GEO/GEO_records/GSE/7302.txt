TITLE
Expression data from bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell CD34 Flt3 subfractions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lineage negativ Sca1+ Kit+ bone marrow cells (containing putative hematopoietic stem cells) subfractionation based on CD34 and FLT3 identifies three functionally destinc subpopulations (LSKCD34-FLT3-, LSKCD34+FLT3- & LSKCD34+FLT3+). Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Lineage negativ Kit+ Sca1+ (LSK) hematopoietic stem cell subpopulations were FACS sorted based on their CD34/FLT3 expression. Subsequently RNA was extracted, labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain expression pattern changes that might explain the difference in function between the functionally destinct LSK subpopulations.
