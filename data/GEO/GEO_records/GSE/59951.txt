TITLE
Expression analysis of KHR and KR oral tumors with intact or deficient Notch1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
KHR and KR tumors grow faster when deficient for Notch1. The hypothesis was to test for differences in gene expression between KHR and KHR oral tumors with intact or deficient Notch1 haplotypes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated for KHR (n=5), KHR-N+/- (n=4), KHR-N-/- (n=5), KR-N+/- (n=5), KR-N-/- (n=4) oral tumors. Expression profiling was performed using the Illumina MouseRef-8 v2 (GPL6885) array. Studies were conducted using tumors from C57BL/6 mice.

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
