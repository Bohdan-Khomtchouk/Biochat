TITLE
A gDNA microarray for genotyping Salvia species

ORGANISM
Salvia

SUMMARY
Salvia is an important genus from the Lamiaceae with approximately 1000 species distributed globally. Several Salvia species are commercially important because of their medicinal and culinary properties. We report the construction of the first fingerprinting array for Salvia species enriched with polymorphic and divergent DNA sequences and demonstrate the potential of this array for fingerprinting several economically important members of this genus.
