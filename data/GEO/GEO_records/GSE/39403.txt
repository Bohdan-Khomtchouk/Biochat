TITLE
A gDNA microarray for genotyping Salvia species

ORGANISM
Salvia officinalis ; Salvia sclarea ; Salvia lavandulifolia ; Salvia miltiorrhiza ; Salvia fruticosa ; Salvia lyrata ; Salvia microphylla ; Salvia przewalskii ; Salvia elegans ; Salvia sinica ; Salvia mexicana ; Salvia runcinata ; Salvia lanceolata

SUMMARY
Salvia is an important genus from the Lamiaceae with approximately 1000 species distributed globally. Several Salvia species are commercially important because of their medicinal and culinary properties. We report the construction of the first fingerprinting array for Salvia species enriched with polymorphic and divergent DNA sequences and demonstrate the potential of this array for fingerprinting several economically important members of this genus.

DESIGN
In order to generate the Salvia Subtracted Diversity Array (SDA), a Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) was performed between a pool of ten Salvia species and a pool of non-angiosperm and angiosperms (excluding the Lamiaceae) to selectively isolate Salvia-specific sequences. A total of 285 subtracted genomic DNA (gDNA) fragments were amplified and arrayed. DNA fingerprints were obtained for fifteen Salvia genotypes including three that were not part of the original subtraction pool. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that the Salvia-specific SDA was capable of differentiating closely related species of S. officinalis and S. miltiorrhiza and was also able to reveal genetic relationships consistent with geographical origins. Species-specific features were also found for S. elegans, S. officinalis, S. sclarea, S. przewalskii and S. runcinata.
