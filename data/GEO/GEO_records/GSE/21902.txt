TITLE
Expression Data from chemical induced tumors obtained from NDR1+/+, NDR1+/- and NDR1-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss and heterozygosity for NDR1 predisposes mice to T-cell lymphoma development. To analyze mechanisms of tumor development in these mice chemically (ENU)-induced tumors were collected and RNA was extracted.

DESIGN
Tumors were collected from mice upon tumor development or 9 months after ENU treatment. Tumors were flash frozen and parts of the tumors were analyzed for RNA, proteins and histology.
