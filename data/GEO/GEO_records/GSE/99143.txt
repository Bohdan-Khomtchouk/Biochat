TITLE
Plasma MicroRNA alterations between EGFR-activating mutational NSCLC patients with and without primary resistance to TKI

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the present study was to examine differentially expressed miRNAs in plasma between EGFR-TKIs sensitive and EGFR-TKIs primary resistance patients.

DESIGN
MiRNA microarray of plasma from patients’ blood identified 16 differentially expressed miRNAs of which 15 (hsv2-miR-H19, hsa-miR-744-5p, hsa-miR-3196, hsa-miR-3153, hsa-miR-4791, hsa-miR-4803, hsa-miR-4796-3p, hsa-miR-372-5p, hsa-miR-138-2-3p, hsa-miR-16-1-3p, hsa-miR-1469, hsa-miR-585-3p, ebv-miR-BART14-5p, hsa-miR-769-3p, hsa-miR-548aq-5p) were down regulated while only hsa-miR-503-3p was up regulated in primary resistant patients’ plasma. Volcano plot and hierarchical clustering were performed to examine the accuracy of the miRNAs. Then validation with quantitative real-time PCR was performed and the result was in accordance with the array data. Functional analysis of these differentially expressed miRNAs with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed a common signaling network including MYC, CCND1, IGF1 and RELA.
