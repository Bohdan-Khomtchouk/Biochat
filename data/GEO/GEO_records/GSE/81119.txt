TITLE
Major differences between human atopic dermatitis and murine models as determined by global genomic profiling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study we applied genomic profiling to evaluate the transcriptomic differences between murine models ot atopic dermatitis. We evaluated the expression data of five models and their respective controls, and one previously published murine dataset (GSE50400). The included models were groupe 1 (Lesional: Flaky tail and FLG mutant; Control: C57BL/6NCrSlc), Group 2 (Lesional: NC/Nga(+mite); Control: NC/Nga(-mite)), Group 3 (Lesional: OVA-ODT 24h; Control: C57BL/6NCrSlc), and Group 4 (Lesional: OXA 2h; Control: BALB/c,Acetone).

DESIGN
Expression profiles for mice with five murine models were contrasted to their respective controls.
