TITLE
RNAseq of T-ALL upon long non coding rna purturbation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T cell leukemia cell lines transciptome changes upon long non coding RNA knockdown by CRISPR and ASO. The target lncRNA is a novel lncRNA called " lnrCXCR4 " . The sequence of this lncRNA is available at the foot of this page.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptome changes of T cell leukemia cell lines upon CRISPR modification or ASO of novel lncRNA lnrCXCR4.

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
