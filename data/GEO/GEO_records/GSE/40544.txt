TITLE
Expression analysis of Arabidopsis plants infected with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pto) strains

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI) and Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI) are well-defined modes of plant immunity triggered by recognition of pathogen effector proteins and microbe-associated molecular patterns, respectively. While ETI and PTI network extensively share signaling components, the shared components are used in different ways, resulting in distinct network properties in the model plant Arabidopsis: immunity is highly robust against network perturbations in ETI but relatively sensitive in PTI. However, the molecular mechanism how the shared network leads to the different properties is not known. Here we show that salicylic acid (SA) reponsive genes can respond in the absense of SA during ETI.

DESIGN
A 24 DNA microarray study using total RNA from Arabidopsis wildtype Col-0 and sid2-2 mutant infected with Pto hrcC-, Pto EV, Pto AvrRpt2 or water.
