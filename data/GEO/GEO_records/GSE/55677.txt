TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of Hepatic cell lines infected with HCV

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
huh7.5 hepatic cell lines were infected with HCV. RNA and Protein were extract after 72 hours and The Human Adipogenesis RT² Profiler™ PCR Array was used to compare the gene expression in the two group.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. HCV infected hepatic cells vs uninfected hepatocyte. Equal amount total RNA from each samples were used
