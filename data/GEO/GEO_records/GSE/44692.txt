TITLE
MiR-155 promotes blood-brain barrier dysfunction in neuroinflammation (part 1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here, we investigated the time-course changes in the pattern of microRNA (miRNA) expression of TNFα and IFNγ-stimulated and unstimulated hCMEC/D3 cells,  an immortalized human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line.

DESIGN
In order to investigate pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced changes in miRNA  levels in hCMEC/D3 cells, we challenged brain endothelial cells with TNFα and IFNγ (100 ng/ml) for 2 h, 6 h and 24 h and determined microRNA expression in cytokine-stimulated and unstimulated cells
