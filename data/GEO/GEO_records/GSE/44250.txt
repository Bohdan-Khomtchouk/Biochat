TITLE
Gene expression analysis of rice seedling under potassium deprivation

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Potassium is one of the essential macronutrients required for plant growth and development. It plays a major role in different physiological processes like cell elongation, stomatal movement, turgor regulation, osmotic adjustment, and signal transduction by acting as a major osmolyte and component of the ionic environment in the cytosol and subcellular organelles. We used whole genome microarrays to determine the transcriptomic profile of rice seedlings exposed to short-term K+ deficiency followed by K+ resupply.
