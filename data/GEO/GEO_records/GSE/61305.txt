TITLE
Expression profile of control, Drosha or Dicer deleted LSKs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine genes regulated independently of microRNAs in early haematopoietic progenitors (LSKs) we compared the expression profiles of Drosha or Dicer deficient LSKs and control. Those genes differentially expressed between Drosha or Dicer deficient LSKs are likely regulated indepedently of microRNAs as either Drosha or Dicer deletion will lead to a complete and equivalent loss of microRNAs.

DESIGN
LSKs were sorted from control, Drosha fl/fl of Dicer fl/fl mice.These cells were activated in vitro for 72 hours to induce total and equivalent deletion of Drosha or Dicer. RNA was extracted after 72 hours.3 repeats of the three groups were analyzed.
