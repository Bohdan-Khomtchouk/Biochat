TITLE
BMSC gene expression in co-culture with endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this experiment human Bone Marrow Stem Cells (hBMSCs) are grown in co-culture with Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) for 5 days, HUVECs are removed by trypsination before call harvest. In parallel hBMSCs are grown in monoculture as a control for 5 days, and a sham trypsination performed before harvesting of the cells. The aim for the project is to analyze the gene expression alteration in hBMSCs resulting from BMSCs being co-cultured with HUVECs.

DESIGN
The microarray platform chosen is Illumina, which is a one-channel system, and this experiment uses HumanWG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChips. The 1-channel nature of the platform yields the simple design of 1 sample hybridized to 1 array on a microarray slide. This particular chip has 6 arrays on each slide.  At each time points there were 6 samples in the co-culture (T) group and 6 samples in the control (C) group, all together 12 samples. Samples came from 6 different donors denoted D1-D6, and the sample from donor X in the co-culture group is paired with the sample from donor X in the control group.
