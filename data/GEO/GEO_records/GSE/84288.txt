TITLE
Nutrigenomic effects of glucosinolates on liver, muscle and distal kidney of Atlantic salmon

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Glucosinolates (GLs) present in plants from the Brassica family hold promise in the biological control of the skin parasite salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) in farmed Atlantic salmon. We recently reported significantly reduced lice infestation in fish fed GLs. However, their wider application requires better knowledge of GLsâ€™ actions, including positive and adverse effects that may occur under the overexposure. Microarray analyses performed in the liver, muscle and distal kidney of salmon under high dose of GLs suggested massive tissue remodeling and reduction of cellular proliferation in skeletal muscle and liver. In the distal kidney, gene expression profiles induced under the high dose of GLs pointed to activation of anti-fibrotic responses. At the same time, prevalent activation of genes from the Phase-2 detoxification pathways could be considered part of beneficial effects. Multiple gene expression evidence suggested GLs-mediated iron/heme withdrawal response, including increase in heme degradation in muscle (up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1), decrease of its synthesis in liver (down-regulation of porphobilinogen deaminase) and increase in iron sequestration from blood (hepatic induction of hepcidin-1 and renal induction of intracellular storage protein ferritin). This could be beneficial upon encounter with the parasite, which depends on the provision of iron/heme by the host.
