TITLE
Effect of day-length shortening on gene expression on pea aphid heads

ORGANISM
Acyrthosiphon pisum

SUMMARY
Seasonal photoperiodism is responsable in aphid for the switch from asexual to sexual reproduction. In order to identify genes regulating the photoperiodic response, a cDNA microarray from the pea aphid was used to compare RNA populations from short- and long-day reared aphids. Analyses revealed that 64 different transcripts were significantly regulated, with a strong biological signature for cuticular proteins and proteins involved in cellular signalling or signal transduction. Quantitative PCR experiments performed on 5 transcripts confirmed microarray results. Complementary experiments eliminated moulting and circadian rhythms as putative confounding effects.
