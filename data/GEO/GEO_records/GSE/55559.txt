TITLE
Analysis of Liver Progenitor Cells Generated from Yap Expression [Set 2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hippo signaling is highly associated with activity in the stem cell compartment of many epithelial tissues.  In this study, we examined if Hippo signaling inhibition (by inducing Yap expression) could convert differentiated cells into a progenitor like phenotype. Rosa26-lsl-YFP mice had recombination induced and cells were FACS sorted using YFP as a marker at either 1 week or 6 weeks after recombination.  YFP expression is a surrogate for Yap expression  (our protein of interest) and time was varied in vivo.  RNA was immediately extracted after sorting and labeled to be hybridized to the array.

DESIGN
FACS sorted Yap expressing liver cells were sorted one or six weeks after induction and compared to fetal liver samples as controls The control data from fetal liver samples have been previously published and is available in the GEO database as GSE12117 (GSM305568, GSM305569, GSM305570). The complete dataset representing: Yap Expressiong Liver samples and the fetal liver control Samples from Series GSE12117 (re-processed in this study), is linked below as a supplementary file.
