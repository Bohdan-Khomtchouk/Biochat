TITLE
affy_med_2011_09-Analysis of Medicago truncatula root transcriptome in response to mycorrhization by Glomus intraradices under phosphate and nitrogen limitation

ORGANISM
Sinorhizobium meliloti

SUMMARY
affy_med_2011_09: In natural ecosystems most vascular plants develop symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi which help them acquire nutrients such as phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). P has long been known to control AM symbiosis which takes place only when P is limiting. For N, however, its role in controlling mycorrhization is less clear. We have chosen the model plant Medicago truncatula to analyze the impact of P limitation and both P and N limitation on Medicago root transcriptome in response to the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis (formerly Glomus intraradices (BEG141)). These analyses may help us uncover signaling events involved in the interaction between these symbionts as well as genes encoding transporters potentially important for nutrient exchanges in these conditions. --We will compare the root transcriptome of Medicago truncatula plants inoculated with Rhizophagus irregularis to that of non-inoculated plants grown under P limitation (or both P and N limitation) after 4 weeks of culture
