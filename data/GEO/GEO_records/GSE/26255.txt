TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Staphyloccoccus aureus USA300 vs USA400.

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
In the community and clinical settings MRSA infections are more commonly caused by a USA300 strain vs a USA400 strain. The study aims to compare gene expression patterns of Staphyloccoccus aureus USA300(reference) vs USA400(query) and to determine why USA400 is being replaced by a USA300 strain.

DESIGN
The USA300 and USA400 isolates were grown in TSA media to early log, mid log, late log and stationary phase. RNA samples were extracted and samples were hybridized on aminosilane coated slides with 70-mer oligos. Differential gene expression patterns were compared between the two strains.

PLATFORM
GPL10597 JCVI PFGRC Staphylococcus aureus 16K v9 array designed primarily based on strain USA300
