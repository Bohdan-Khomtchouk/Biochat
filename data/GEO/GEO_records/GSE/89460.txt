TITLE
Activity-dependent gene expression in the mammalian olfactory epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We access the activity-dependent genes in olfactory neuron cells with unilateral naris occlusion model with mouse.

DESIGN
mRNA profile of olfactory epithelia between closed and open sides of mice naris was compared

PLATFORM
