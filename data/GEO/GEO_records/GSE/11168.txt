TITLE
Ago2 stable cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Our genome wide analyses of microRNA expression profiles involve the hybridization of fluorescently labeled RNA samples to custom made, DNA microarrays based on the GAPSII coated slides.  We describe the differences in genome wide miRNA expressions between wild type 293 T  mammalian cells and Ago2 transformed stable cell lines. Keywords: Expression

DESIGN
Comparing one control and three Ago2-overexpressing stable cell lines (A, B, C). One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL6741 University of Minnesota multi-species miRNA 480
