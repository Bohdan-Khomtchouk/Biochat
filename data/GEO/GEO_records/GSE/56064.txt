TITLE
PRDM11 ChIP in U2932 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The PR-domain family e(PRDMs) encodes transcriptional regulators, several of which are deregulated in cancer. We found that loss of Prdm11 accelerates MYC-driven lymphomagenesis in the EÂµ-Myc mouse model. Moreover, we show that patients with PRDM11-deficient diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) have poorer overall survival and belong to the non-Germinal Center B cell (GCB)-like subtype. Mechanistically, genome-wide mapping of PRDM11 binding sites coupled with transcriptome sequencing in human DLBCL cells evidenced that PRDM11 associates with transcriptional start sites of target genes and regulates important oncogenes such as FOS and JUN.  Hence, we characterize PRDM11 as a novel tumor suppressor controlling the expression of key oncogenes and add new mechanistic insight into B-cell lymphomagenesis.
