TITLE
Expression data from Brakeless mutant Drosophila embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The Brakeless protein performs many important functions during Drosophila development, but how it controls gene expression is not understood. We previously showed that Brakeless can function as a transcriptional co-repressor. Here, we report transcriptional profiling of brakeless mutant embryos to identify additional target genes. We used microarrays to identify gene expression changes in brakeless mutant early Drosophila embryos.

DESIGN
Drosophila germline clones of the strong brakeless 278 allele (lab stock B97) were generated and compared to control germline clones generated with the original unmutagenized chromosome (FRT G13). Two-four hour old embryos from these females were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
