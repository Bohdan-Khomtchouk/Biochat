TITLE
Expression data from 5 IFN type I-derived Dendritic Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Type I interferon (IFN) is a family of 15 cytokines (in human 13α, 1β,1ω) which exert several cellular functions through the binding to a common receptor. Despite the initial activation of the same Jak/Stat signalling pathway, the cellular response may be different depending on the type I IFN subtype. We investigated the activity of different type I IFN subtypes - IFNα1, α2, α8, α21, ω and β- on the differentiation of DC. Transcriptome analyses identified two distinct groups, the IFNα/ω-DC and the IFNβ-DC. 78 genes, 7 chemokines and expression levels of cell surface markers characteristic of DC distinguished IFNα-DC and IFNβ-DC. These differences are unlikely to impact the efficacy of T cell functional response since IFNα2-DC and IFNβ-DC were equipotent in inducing the proliferation and the polarization of allogenic naïve CD4 T cells into Th1 cells and in stimulating autologous memory CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, IFNα2-DC were found to be more efficient than IFNβ-DC in the phagocytic uptake of dead cells.

DESIGN
Human blood monocytes were differentiated in DC by using 5 differents IFN type I (IFNα2, α1, α8, α21 and β). After 3 days of differentiation RNA were extracted and analyzed by affymetrix microarray.
