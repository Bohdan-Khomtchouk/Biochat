TITLE
Expression data for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells following chemotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms behind drug resistance and sensitivity in breast cancers relies on complex signalling pathways that involve the up or downregulation of certain genes. Many of these genes are involved in adhesion, growth, epithelial/mesenchymal transitions, and apoptosis. We used microarrays to assess differences in gene expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells in response  to treatment.

DESIGN
We examined the triple-negative human cell line HCC1806 treated with docetaxel or control DMSO. The purpose is to find out the early drug induced changes in this cell line.
