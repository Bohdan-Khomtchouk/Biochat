TITLE
Methylation profiles of MCF-10A cells infected with MBD2 lentivirus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylated DNA binding protein 2 (MBD2) has been shown to bind specific methylated promoters and suppress transcription. Here we systematically investigate MBD2 suppression by overexpressing MBD2 in MCF-10A cells and generating genome-wide promoter methylation profiles in order to identify methylation changes likely to affect gene expression levels.

DESIGN
MCF-10A cells were infected with MBD2 lentivirus in order to increase MBD2 expression. DNA was extracted from both infected and non-infected cells and enriched for methylated DNA through the method of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP). Enriched and total DNA was hybridized in different channels to 244K custom microarrays (Agilent Technologies) that contained probes covering at 100bp-spacing all transcription start sites from -800bp to 200bp (human, Ensembl v44) and all microRNAs in miRBase from 250bp before to 250bp after the microRNA. Three technical replicates were hybridized for infected and non-infected cells.
