TITLE
Finding missing proteins from epigenetically manipulated human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed transcriptome sequencing to assess the genes turn on in the cell under epigenetically manipulation. MHCC97H, A549 and HCT116 were treated by GSK126, S2101 and TSA respectively. We detected the missing proteins in the cells under epigenetically manipulation.

DESIGN
A549 and MHCC97H cells were cultured in the complete DMEM medium and epigenetically manipulation (1 μM TSA, 50 μM GSK126 and 100μM S2101 respectively); HCT116 cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium and epigenetically manipulation (1 μM TSA, 50 μM GSK126 and 100μM S2101 respectively). We detected and analyzed the missing protein with transcriptome and proteome.
