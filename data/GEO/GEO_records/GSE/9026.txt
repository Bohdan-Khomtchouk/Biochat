TITLE
New target genes controlled by the Bradyrhizobium japonicum two-component regulatory system RegSR

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium japonicum

SUMMARY
Analysis of a mutant in the Bradyrhizobium japonicum response regulator RegR. RegR is known to control expression of the gene encoding the key regulator of nitrogen fixation NifA. This study provides insights into the RegR regulon under free-living conditions and during symbiosis. Cells of the regR mutant and the wild type were grown to mid-exponential phase in full medium (PSY) under different oxygen conditions (aerobic and microaerobic) in culture. Nodules from soybean plant infected with the regR mutant or the wild type were collected 13 and 21 days post inoculation To determine genes under control of RegR during symbiosis. This study includes also the samples GSM210238 to GSM210286. Keywords: genetic modification, time course, growth conditions

DESIGN
Comparison analyis of the B. japonicum regR mutant and the wild type grown under different oxygen conditions in culture and during symbiosis with soybean.
