TITLE
BIRC6-targeting as potential therapy for advanced, enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
New transplantable patient-derived xenograft (PDX) CRPC model with intrinsic ENZ-Resistance were used to access therapeutic efficacy of BIRC6 targeting antisense oligonucleotide (ASO-6w2). Molecular pathways associated with the inhibitory effect of ASO-6w2 vs control Scrb ASO were examined by gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
Patient-derived xenograft tumors from the LTL313BR xenograft lineage (PMID: 24356420) after treatment with BIRC6 targeting ASO or control ASO for 3 weeks (5 day on, 2 day off)
