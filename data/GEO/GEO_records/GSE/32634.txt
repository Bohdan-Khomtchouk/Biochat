TITLE
Jasmonic acid-responsive genes in rice leaves

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Jasmonic acid (JA) is involved in various developmental processes and defense responses against abiotic and biotic stresses. We identified JA-responsive genes in rice leaves 6-48 h after treatment using rice 44k microarray.

DESIGN
Expression profiling in rice leaves treated with JA for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h was compared with that in the corresponding mock control using two-color method with two biological replicates.
