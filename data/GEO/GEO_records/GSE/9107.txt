TITLE
Expression data of Drosophila 3rd instar larval wing discs taken from strains selected for wing shape.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We measured gene expression across the whole genome in a panel of lines selected for a wing shape trait (angular offset).  The lines were created in separate experiments, originating from two widely separated populations, and including multiple replicates of one population, but all were created using the same selection regime and trait.  Here we evaluate the data with two objectives: 1) to identify candidate wing shape genes for future testing and validation, and 2) to assess variation among lines in the outcome of identical selection regimes We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the phenotypic differences among strains selected for wing shape angular offset. Keywords: strain comparison
