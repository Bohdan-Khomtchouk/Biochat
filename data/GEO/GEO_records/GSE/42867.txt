TITLE
Gene expression changes in subclones of a Burkitt lymphoma cell line with different patterns of EBV latent infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we have investigated the gene expression profiles of three different types of subclone all generated by single cell cloning of the same parental EBV positive Burkitt lymphoma cell line Awia-BL. These included  EBV negative clones which have lost the virus episome, EBV positive clones with a conventional Latency I form of infection and EBV positive clones with an atypical Wp-restricted form of infection.

DESIGN
Gene expression was compared between two different EBV negative clones (both performed in biological duplicate), four different Latency I clones and four different Wp-restricted clones using HG U133 Plus 2.0 gene chip arrays.
