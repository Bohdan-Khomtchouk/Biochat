TITLE
Screen glycosyltransferase ST6GalNAc2 KO mice and B4GalNT1/B4GalNT2 double KO mice relative to C75 Wild Type controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment is to respond to the NIGMS mandate to screen Core F generated glycosyltransferase KO mice in Core E and Core C. The goal is to screen several tissues for gene expression changes in ST6GalNAc2 KO mice and B4GalNT1/B4GalNT2 double KO mice relative to C75 Wild Type controls. Tissues for Core E analysis were selected by mining public databases including the NIH GEO database for tissues that expressed the KO genes at moderate to high levels.

DESIGN
Results from Core E gene expression analysis are then used to help Core C select tissues to follow up with glycan analysis on in each of the KO mice. For the ST6GalNAc2 KO mouse we selected: Brain, Small Intestine, Lymph Node and Thyroid for analysis. For the B4GalNT1/B4GalNT2 double KO mouse we selected: Kidney, Mammary Gland, Thymus and Testes for analysis. Wild type tissues were analyzed in parellel.
