TITLE
Expression data from S. cerevisiae following tRNA gene deletion

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We created a comprehensive tRNA deletion library in yeast and characterized the phenotypic and further characterized the molecular changes in a subset of deletion strains

DESIGN
Each tRNA deletion strain was created using homologous recombination by introduction of an antibiotic cassette. Each strain was grown at 30Â°C in rich medium to mid log phase from which mRNA was extracted
