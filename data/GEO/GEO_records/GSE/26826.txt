TITLE
Targeted bisulfite sequencing by solution hybrid selection and massively parallel sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied the solution hybrid selection approach to the enrichment of CpG islands (CGIs) and promoter sequences from the human genome for targeted high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. A single lane of Illumina sequences allowed accurate and quantitative analysis of 1 million CpGs in more than 21,408 CGIs and 15,946 transcriptional regulatory regions. More than 85% of capture probes successfully yielded quantitative DNA methylation information of targeted regions. In this study, we generated genome-wide, single-base resolution DNA methylation maps in three of the most commonly used breast cancer cell lines.Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified in the 5?-end regulatory regions, as well as the intra- and intergenic regions, particularly in the X chromosome among the three cell lines. The single CpG resolution methylation maps of many known tumor suppressor genes were also established in the three cell lines.

DESIGN
Here we present a novel approach that combines solution-phase hybrid selection and massively parallel bisulfite sequencing to profile DNA methylation in targeted CGI and promoter regions. We designed 51,466 single strand DNA oligonucleotides (160-mer) which target 23,441 CGIs and the transcription start sites of 19,369 known genes in the human genome. The synthetic long DNA oligonucleotides were converted into biotinylated RNA probes for solution-phase hybridization capture of target DNA. The captured genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite, amplified by PCR and sequenced using Illumina GA IIx sequencer.
