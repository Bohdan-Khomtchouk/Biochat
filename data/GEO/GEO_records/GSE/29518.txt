TITLE
ChIP-chip from dissected Drosophila egg chambers using antibody recognizing RNAPII

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation of RNAPII followed by hybridization to genome-wide tiling microarrays demonstrated that RNAPII localizes to all six Drosophila amplicons in follicle cells (DAFC) as well as other non-amplified genomic loci

DESIGN
Localization of RNAPII in stage 10 egg chambers with the nurse cells manually removed
