TITLE
Effect of polymeric formula on inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of HT-29 cells co-cultured with tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) in the presence or absence of polymeric formula as used for Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) therapy. Results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of polymeric formula on intestinal epithelium.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 9 samples of HT-29 cells. Six samples were treated with TNF-a in the presence (3 samples) or absence (3 samples) of Polymeric Formula. Three samples were untreated and used as a control.
