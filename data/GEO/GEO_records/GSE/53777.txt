TITLE
Multicellular spheroids treated with the compound VLX600

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray based mRNA profiling was used to charactarize the response to the compound VLX600 in cells grown as spheroids. Cells used was colon cancer cells HCT116 and HCT116HIF1a knock-out.

DESIGN
We identify the small molecule VLX600 as a drug that is preferentially active against quiescent cells in colon cancer 3-D microtissues. The anticancer activity is associated with reduced mitochondrial respiration, leading to a bioenergetic catastrophe and tumor cell death. VLX600 shows enhanced cytotoxic activity under conditions of nutrient starvation. Microarray based mRNA profiling was used to charactarize the response to the compound VLX600 in cells grown as spheroids. Cells used was colon cancer cells HCT116 and HCT116HIF1a knock-out cells.
