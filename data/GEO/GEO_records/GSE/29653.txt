TITLE
GmMPK4 is a negative regulator of SA-mediated defense response

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
GmMPK4 silencing was performed in Glycine max (Williams 82) using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) mediated by Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV). Microarray analysis was performed to compare the transcriptional profile of GmMPK4-silenced plants vs vector control plants.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Jianzhong Liu.
