TITLE
Different gene expression between CDK5 knocking down and control colorectal cancer cell line HCT116

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to find out the molecular mechanism of CDK5 displayed in colorectal cancer. Microarray experiments were carried out to identify different gene expression between CDK5-knockdown HCT116 cell lines and Scramble HCT116 cell lines.

DESIGN
Lentiviral expression vector of CDK5 short hairpin RNA and the control group of scramble sequence was both used to infect the HCT116 cell line. Total RNA was  extracted and analyzed by the Agilent 4x44K whole human genome oligo microarray with triple replication.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
