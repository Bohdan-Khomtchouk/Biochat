SUMMARY
Advanced ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Currently patients are treated by surgical cytoreductive surgery with the aim of reducing tumor burden to microscopic disease followed by adjuvant combined treatment with a platinum and taxane containing chemotherapy, which affords 80% of patients an initial complete response. However, Abdominal and pelvic recurrence rates are high and response to further chemotherapy is limited.  Attempts at introducing biologic therapeutic agents to improve outcome in this disease are ongoing, while prognostic or predictive biomarkers that can stratify patients for treatment are still lacking. Using transcriptome profiling of microdissected tissue samples from high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients, we identified a cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) specific gene signature. Versican, which encodes a extracellular matrix protein, was one of the identified genes which demonstrated up-regulation in cancer stroma. To investigate the function roles, signaling machanism and the effect of versican treatment on ovarian cancer cells, transcriptome profiling of versican treated OVCA433 high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells was performed.

DESIGN
High grade serous ovarian cancer cell line OVCA433 was used. Total RNA was isolated from control samples and versican treated cancer cell samples at 48 hours post-treatment followed by cDNA synthesis, IVT and biotin labeling. Samples were then hybridized onto Affymetrix Human genome U133 plus 2.0 microarrays. For each treatment group, three independent samples were prepared for the microarray experiment.
