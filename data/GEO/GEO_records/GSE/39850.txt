TITLE
5 Day Oral Study of A-998679 in Male Sprague Dawley Rats (Jejunum)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Male Sprague-Dawley rats [Crl:CD®(SD)IGS BR], weighing ~250 g at study initiation were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA).  Rats were housed singly in ventilated, stainless steel, wire-bottom hanging cages and fed non-certified Rodent Chow (Harlan Labs, Madison, WI) and water ad libitum and acclimated for at least 5 days after arrival.  Rats were randomly assigned to various treatment groups (3 rats/group) and were dosed once daily by oral gavage with vehicle (0.2% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose at a dose volume of 10 ml/kg) or with 30, 100, or 200 mg/kg of A-998679.  All rats were fasted overnight after their last dose, weighed and sacrificed under isoflurane anesthesia. Liver and small intestine (jejunum) were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until processing for gene expression profiling on the Affymetrix platform.

DESIGN
total of 11 samples, 3 biological replicates (rats) from each of 3 treatments groups 1. vehicle control  2. 30mg/kg A-998679 3. 100mg/kg A-998679  and 2 biological replicates from treatment group 4.  200mg/kg A-998679
