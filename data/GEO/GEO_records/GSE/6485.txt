TITLE
Expression data from olfactory epithelium of Harlequin mutant mice compared to littermate controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of gene expression in the olfactory epithelium of Harlequin mouse as a model of oxidative-stress induced neurodegeneration of olfactory sensory neurons Keywords: comparison of gene expression level in unperturbed tissue of mutant vs. control mouse

DESIGN
Olfactory epithelium from Harlequin mutant mice and littermate control mice was microdissected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We compared levels of gene expression in 6-month old mice to begin to identify mechanisms of oxidative-stress induced neurodegeneration and to correlate the cellular changes that we observed in the olfactory epithelium by using histology and immunohistochemistry with gene expression changes.
