TITLE
Genes regulated by PMK-1 and DAF-16 in a daf-2(e1368) background.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Analysis of genes differentially expressed between daf-2(e1368) and daf-2(e1368);pmk-1(km25) and between daf-2(e1368) and daf-2(e1368);daf-16(mgDf47).  These studies identified genes upregulated by wild-type PMK-1 and wild-type DAF-16. Keywords: genetic modification
