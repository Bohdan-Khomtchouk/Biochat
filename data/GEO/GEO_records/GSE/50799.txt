TITLE
Genome-wide effects of maternal undernutrition

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
A comparison of the liver transcriptomes of 1 day old rats that are born to mothers fed with three different diets during gestation. The first animal group was fed with a normal diet (control); second group received much less protein than normal and slightly more carbs (low protein); third group diet was same as low protein but with an extra dosage of folic acid (lowp.+f). All diets were matched for energy.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from rat livers of 4 offsprings per animal group (4 biological replicates x group)
