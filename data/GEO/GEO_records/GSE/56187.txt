TITLE
Differentiation of human neural precursor cells from pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pluripotent stem cells were differentiated using a 4 factor differentiation method to neural precursor cells (NPCs) The objective of this study is to find similar gene expression patterns in hNPCs derived from different cell lines through a single technique.

DESIGN
10 Samples were analyzed in this study. This included 5 hNPC lines 4 hPSC lines and one sample of human dermal fibroblasts.
