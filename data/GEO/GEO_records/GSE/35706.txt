TITLE
Genome-wide identification and analysis of microRNA expression in mouse neuroblastoma cells (NA) and BV-2, a murine microglial cell line, infected with rabies virus CVS-11 (Challenge virus standard)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rabies virus (RABV) infection led to alteration of microRNA expression in NA and microglia.

DESIGN
A sixteen-chip study was performed using total RNA isolated from NA and microglia infected with rabies virus CVS-11 (Challenge virus standard) or mock infected as a control. RNA was isolated from microglia at 12, 24, or 48 hpi and from NA at 24 hpi.

PLATFORM
GPL15216 LC_MRA-1002_miRMouse_18 (miRNA ID version)
