TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' in its psyllid vector, Bactericera cockerelli

ORGANISM
Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum

SUMMARY
We seqeunced mRNA from the bacterial pathogen 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum " during its association with the psyllid vector Bactericera cockerelli.

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from psyllids,  insect and bacterial rRNAs were depleted. PolyA RNA was purified using Dynabeads. PolyA purified RNA and depleted RNA were sequenced.

PLATFORM
GPL18710 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum)
