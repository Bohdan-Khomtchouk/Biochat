TITLE
Expression data from human HSPC with O/E TAL1 or KD/TAL1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analyses of the consequences of up- and down-regulating SCL/TAL1 in human enriched hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs). We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression program of human cord blood HSPCs (CD34+CD38-lowCD34RA-CD90+) in which SCL/TAL1 expression is either up- or down-regulated.

DESIGN
We have used lentiviral vector transduction of human cord blood HSPCs to overexpress (O/E) or knock down (KD) SCL/TAL1. Cells were lysed 24 hours after the end of transduction.
