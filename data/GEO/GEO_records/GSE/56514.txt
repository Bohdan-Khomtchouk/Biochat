TITLE
Gene expression changes in CD4+ thymocytes upon removal of Cullin3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report gene expression changes in Cul3 deficient thymic CD4+ T cells We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression changes upon removal of Cul3 during thymic development

DESIGN
CD25-, CD1dPBS57-, gdTCR - CD4+ Single positive cells from thymocytes of CD4Cre-Cul3fl/fl (LM) and CD4 Cre+Cul3fl/fl (KO) were sort purified and total RNA was extracted using Trizol and analysed by microarray.
