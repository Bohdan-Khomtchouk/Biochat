TITLE
RhoGDIbeta-responsive genes in MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RhoGDIbeta (ARHGDIB) is often expressed in tumor cells. It negatively regulates Rho-GTPases, but may have other functions as well. To analyze its effect on gene expression, RhoGDIbeta was suppressed by RNA interference in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and changes in gene expression monitored by cDNA microarrays. Keywords: siRNA knock-down analysis
