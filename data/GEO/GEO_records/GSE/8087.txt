TITLE
RhoGDIbeta-responsive genes in MDA-MB-231 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RhoGDIbeta (ARHGDIB) is often expressed in tumor cells. It negatively regulates Rho-GTPases, but may have other functions as well. To analyze its effect on gene expression, RhoGDIbeta was suppressed by RNA interference in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and changes in gene expression monitored by cDNA microarrays. Keywords: siRNA knock-down analysis

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were either transfected with a RhoGDIbeta-specific siRNA or a control siRNA (siLuc), grown for three days, harvested and lysed for total RNA isolation. RNA was subjected to cDNA microarray analysis by using Affymetrix chip HG-U133A. A total of three independent transfection experiments were performed. The samples obtained from experiments 1, 2 and 3 were designated as siLuc_rep1, siLuc_rep2, siLuc_rep3 (siLuc transfected) and siARH_rep1, siARH_rep2, siARH_rep3 (siRhoGDIbeta transfected), respectively.
