TITLE
Expression data from Rb family (Rb, p130 and p107) deficient Hematopoietic stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of Rb family in HSCs results in a severe phenotype, such as enhanced proliferation and increase in stem cell number. In addition, HSCs were higly mobilized but failed to transplant. Rb family deficient mice rapidly exhibit a myeloproliferative disease with eosinophilic characteristics. Meanwhile, the lymphoid compartment was severely decreased, due to high apoptotic activity in this lineage. Keywords: unpaired WT versus Rb family deficient KLS

DESIGN
We used mice that harbor floxed alleles for the Rb family and we induced the recombination by 6 weeks of age. KLS (c-Kit+ Lin - Sca-1+) cells were sorted 2 months after the recombination. Total of 6 hybridizations done.  One Sample was excluded from our analysis based on high background and anomalous control probeset values.
