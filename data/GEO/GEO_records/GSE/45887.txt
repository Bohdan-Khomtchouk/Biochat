TITLE
The gene expression analysis of paracrine/autocrine factors in patients with spermatogenetic failure compared to normal spermatogenesis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of paracrine/autocrine factors in inflammation, immune response and tumor development is well established. There is also an evidence that some of the cytokines there involved may participate in the regulation of the male gonads. However, their  involvement in pathogenesis of male infertility has not been well defined yet. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression levels of  IL-1 family members, IL-6, IL-10, TNF family, SCF and c-kit in infertile patients with idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) compared to men with normal spermatogenesis

DESIGN
We analyzed testicular biopsy specimens obtained from 16 patients with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) and 4 with normal spermatogenesis using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST.
