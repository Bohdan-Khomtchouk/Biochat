TITLE
Etiology matters - Comparing Genomic DNA Methylation Patterns in Three Rat Models of Acquired Epilepsy (Amygdala stimulation – mRNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Explore DNA methylation in focal amygdala stimulation model of epilepsy and its relationship to gene expression.

DESIGN
Examination of expression changes in stimulated rats compared to sham operated animals in focal amygdala stimulation model of epilpesy.
