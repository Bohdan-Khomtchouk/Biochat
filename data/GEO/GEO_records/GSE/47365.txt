TITLE
Xenorhabdus nematophila FliZ regulon identification by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Xenorhabdus nematophila

SUMMARY
A fliZ mutant in the entomopathogenic bacterium X. nematophila is attenuated in virulence in the insect. The goal of this study is to compare transcriptomes of the fliZ mutant and wild type strain to identify the FliZ regulon.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates of total RNA from exponential cultures of WT strain and fliZ mutant were analysed by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
