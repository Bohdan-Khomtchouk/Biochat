TITLE
ERRalpha mediates metabolic adaptations that drive lapatinib resistance in breast cancer (ERRalpha binding profiles in breast cancer cells by ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ablation of ERRalpha significantly delays ERBB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis and ERRalpha regulates genes of the ERBB2 amplicon. To further investigate the relationship between ERRalpha activity and RTK signaling, we mapped ERRalpha binding sites in SKBr3 cells upon EGF treatment or heregulin treatment. Inhibition of ERBB2 signaling using the RTK inhibitor lapatinib impacts on ERRalpha stability, while cells resistant to lapatinib treatment exhibit restored ERRalpha expression. We therefore mapped ERRalpha binding sites in parental (sensitive) cells (pSKBr3) as well as in lapatinib-resistant cells (LRSKBr3).

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq analysis of ERRalpha binding profile in SKBr3 or BT-474 breast cancer cells.
