TITLE
Fibroblast VEGF-receptor 1 expression as molecular target in periodontitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify gene expression profiles in those periodontitis-associated fibroblasts (PAFs) versus normal gingival fibroblasts to determine their molecular repertoire, and exploit it for therapeutic intervention.

DESIGN
We collected RNA from 4 paired PAF and non PAF from patients with periodontitis
