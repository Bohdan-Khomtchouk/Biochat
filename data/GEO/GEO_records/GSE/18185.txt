TITLE
Ca2+/calcineurin/CRZ1 dependent gene expression in Magnaporthe oryzae

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe oryzae

SUMMARY
The Ca2+/calcineurin signaling pathway is a central conduit regulating growth, development, and virulence of fungal pathogens infecting plants and human. We have analyzed global gene expression profiles during Ca2+ treatment in the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. An immunosuppressive drug, FK506, and the knock-out mutant of a transcription factor, MoCRZ1, were included to analyze calcineurin- and/or CRZ1-dependent gene expression, respectively. About 1,400 genes were up or down regulated by Ca2+ treatment, while about 200 genes seemed to be up-regulated in a calcineurin/CRZ1-dependent manner.

DESIGN
This study analyzes global gene expression dynamics during Ca2+ treatment in the rice blast fungus. We have used Agilent M. grisea 2.0 4Ã—44K Microarrays using a single channel hybridization design. An immunosuppressive drug, FK506, and the knock out mutant of a transcription factor, MoCRZ1, were included to analyze calcineurin- and/or CRZ1-dependent gene expression, respectively. To know the time point at which the gene expression fluctuates most significantly, we treated mycelia with CaCl2 for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. PMC1 expression level was checked by RT-PCR with the highest expression at 30 min time point. Four biological replicates of wild type and mutant mycelia were harvested after 30 min treatment with chemicals. Pairwise comparisons between Ca2+ treated vs. control and Ca2+ vs. Ca2+/FK506 in wild type (WT), and Ca2+ treated in WT vs. in mutant were conducted.
