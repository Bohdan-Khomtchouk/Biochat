TITLE
A genomic approach to bud mutation in sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) fruit

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Bud mutations arise often in citrus. The selection of mutants is one of the most important breeding methods in citrus. However, the molecular bases of bud mutation have rarely been studied. To identify the potential important or novel genes involved in bud mutation, different transcriptomic techniques combing suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and microarray were performed between a lycopene accumulated mutant, ‘Hong Anliu’ sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck), and its wild-type during fruit maturation. Microarray analysis revealed that differentially expressed clones are extensively coordinated with the initiation of lycopene accumulation. After sequencing of the differentially expressed clones, a total of 267 non-redundant transcripts were obtained, 182 (68.2%) of which share homology (E-value ≤ 1×10-10) with known gene products or known protein domains. A list of candidate genes which involved in cellular metabolic process, primary metabolic process, localization, macromolecular metabolic process was obtained. Out of these genes, 12 share homology with previously described signal transduction or transcription factors, suggesting complex regulatory control. These results demonstrate profound effect on gene expression of bud mutation in citrus fruits and provide new insights into the molecular basis of bud mutation. Keywords: bud mutation, candidate genes, Citrus, cNDA microarray, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH)

DESIGN
Fruits from the mutant and its wild type were collected at five time points from August to December. Total RNA extracted from the mutant was hybridized to the array together with RNA from the wild type. Each hybridization was performed in duplicate by dye swap.
