TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) infected with blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Rice blast is one of the most serious diseases and is caused by Magnaporthe grisea. SHZ-2, an indica cultivar with broad spectrum resistance to multiple races of the blast pathogen, was crossed to TXZ-13, a blast susceptible but high-quality variety, to produce one BC3 line, BC10 line, which showed strong to moderate blast resistance over eight cropping seasons in the field. In this study, we compared the transcription between blast-resistant and -susceptive lines by custom microarray. Keywords: time course, blast infection, disease response

DESIGN
Comparison between blast- and mock-infected rice. Biological replicates: 3 control (mock) and 3 blast-infected at each time point, independently grown and harvested at 24 and 48 hours after inoculation. Each sample was prepared with whole plant 5 cm above ground and was pooled from 5 plants grown under the same conditions.

PLATFORM
GPL7252 Custom GER rice oligoarray
