TITLE
Next-generation sequencing reveals HIV-1-mediated suppression of T cell activation and RNA processing and the regulation of non-coding RNA expression in a CD4+ T cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced the total mRNA from infected cells and detected differences in the expression of both host mRNA. We detected a small but significant suppression of T cell activation-related genes at 12 hpi. This suppression persisted and expanded by 24 hpi providing new possible markers of virus-induced T cell cytopathology. By 24 hpi the expression of over 50% of detectable host loci was also altered indicating widespread alteration of host processes including RNA processing, splicing, and transport to an extent not previously reported. In addition next-generation sequencing provided insights into the expression of non-coding RNAs including microRNA host genes.

DESIGN
We isolated polyadenylated RNA from SUPT1 cells infected with HIV-1 strain LAI at 12 and 24 hours post-infection (3 replicates for each time point). As controls we isolated polyadenylated RNA from mock-infected cells at 12 and 24 hours post-infection (2 replicates at 12 hours post-infection, 3 replicates at 24 hours post-infection).
