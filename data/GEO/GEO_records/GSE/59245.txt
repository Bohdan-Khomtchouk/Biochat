TITLE
Long noncoding RNAs expression patterns associated with chemo response to cisplatin based chemotherapy in lung squamous cell carcinoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There is large variability among lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients in response to treatment with cisplatin based chemotherapy. LncRNAs is potentional a new type of predictive marker that can identify subgroups of patients who benefit from chemotherapy and it will have great value for treatment guidance.

DESIGN
Differentially expressed LncRNAs were identified using microarray profiling of tumors with partial response (PR) vs. with progressive disease (PD) from advanced lung SCC patients treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy and validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Results: Compared with the PD samples, 953 lncRNAs were consistently overregulated and 749 lncRNAs
