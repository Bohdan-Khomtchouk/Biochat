TITLE
Sex-specific gene expression in the human left ventricle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study cDNA microarrays were used to identify genes with sex-biased expression in the human left ventricle of two age classes ( < 40 years and 50-65 years of age). Keywords: cDNA microarray hybridization, sex-specific expression

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from human left ventricular myocardial tissue from explanted hearts of < 40 years old women (n=3), < 40 years old men (n=4), 50-65 years old women (n=5) and 50-65 years old men (n=5). Total RNAs were pooled according to sex and age and hybridized on Agilent cDNA microarrays (age-matched, male vs. female or vice versa). Four technical replicates were carried out with exchanged dye-labelled RNA probes (dye-swap) on two of them.
