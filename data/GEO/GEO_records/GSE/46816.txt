TITLE
Gene expression data from 8 pairs of CD138+/- myeloma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
8 pairs of myeloma cell lines were sorted by MACS CD138-microbead, and the each cell lines were divided into two fraction CD138+ and CD138-. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in these 8 pairs of CD138+/- myeloma cell lines

DESIGN
CD138- fraction in myeloma are thought to be myeloma stem cells fraction, and we compared the gene expression profile between CD138- and CD138+ fraction.
