TITLE
training induced gene expression in arrhythmogenic plakogloin (+/-) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Endurance training accelerated development of right ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias in plakoglobin+/- mice. Histology and electron microscopy did not identify right ventricular abnormalities. To identify differences in the transcriptional response to training gene expression profiling was performed. Keywords: expression response of plakoglobin (+/-) to training

DESIGN
Gene expressson analyses were performed in 5 pairs of plakoglobin (+/-) mice and their wildtype littermates. Four pairs of trained mice and one pair of old untrained mice were studied. Training induced expression of several hypertrophy associated genes such as ANP but no differences between the trained plakoglobin (+/-) mice and wt mice was seen.
