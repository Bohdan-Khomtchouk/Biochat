TITLE
HSF4 microarray gene expression analysis in the newborn mouse lens.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential expression of HSF4 in null newborn mouse and wildtype lenses was examined to identify putative downstream targets of HSF4. To examine roles of Brg1 in mouse lens development, a dnBrg1 transgenic construct was expressed using the lens-specific aA-crystallin promoter in postmitotic lens fiber cells. Morphological studies revealed abnormal lens fiber cell differentiation in transgenic lenses resulting in cataract. Electron microscopic studies showed abnormal lens suture formation and incomplete karyolysis (denucleation) of lens fiber cells. To identify genes regulated by Brg1, RNA expression profiling was performed in E15.5 embryonic wild type and dnBrg1 transgenic lenses. In addition, comparisons between differentially expressed genes in dnBrg1 transgenic, Pax6 heterozygous, and Hsf4 homozygous lenses identified multiple genes co-regulated by Brg1, Hsf4 and Pax6. Among them DNase IIb, a key enzyme required for lens fiber cell denucleation, was found downregulated in each of the Pax6, Brg1 and Hsf4 model systems. Lens-specific deletion of Brg1 using conditional gene targeting demonstrated that Brg1 was required for lens fiber cell differentiation and indirectly for retinal development but was not essential for lens lineage formation. Keywords: Differential mRNA Expression

DESIGN
Three biological replicate experiments were performed with HSF null and wildtype lenses.
