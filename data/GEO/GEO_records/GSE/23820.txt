TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of CAX1/CAX3 double mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
As part of a larger study on Cell-specific vacuolar calcium compartmentation regulates apoplastic calcium concentration, gas exchange and plant productivity we compared the transcriptome of 40day old CAX1/CAX3 double mutants to Col-0 wildtype plants.

DESIGN
comparative: mutant versus wild-type
