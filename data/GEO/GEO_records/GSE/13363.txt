TITLE
Fetal liver development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hepatoblasts emerging at E8.5 from the foregut endoderm proliferate vigorously and differentiate to hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells. To find genes important for hepatocyte differentiation during development, we compared gene expression profiles of hepatoblasts/immature hepatocytes at E12.5 and E17.5.  As Dlk, also known as Pref-1, is expressed in hepatoblasts/immature hepatocytes, we performed a microarray analysis of the Dlk+ cells isolated from livers at E12.5 and E17.5. Keywords: fetal liver cells comparing

DESIGN
Mouse hepatoblasts were isolated from E12.5 and E17.5 fetal liver using anti-mouse Dlk monoclonal antibody (mAb) according to a previous report and dissolved in Trizol reagent. The cDNA samples synthesized from total RNA were used for a microarray analysis with the mouse GEM2 microarray. One array, no replicates.
