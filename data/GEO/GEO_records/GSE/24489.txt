TITLE
Effect of H11 Kinase/Hsp22 deletion in response to cardiac stress

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression of the small molecular weight heat shock protein (Hsp) H11 kinase/Hsp22 (Hsp22) is restricted to a limited number of tissues, including the heart and skeletal muscle, both in rodents and in humans. We generated a mouse knockout (KO) model, and investigated the role of Hsp22 in regulating cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload. We compared gene expression profiles between WT and KO mice in basal condition and three days pressure overload after transverse aortic constriction (TAC). These data illustrated a novel mechanism of Hsp22-related gene expression in response to cardiac stress.
