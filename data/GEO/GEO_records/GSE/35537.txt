TITLE
Identification of the Bacteroides fragilis EcfO regulon 2

ORGANISM
Bacteroides fragilis 638R

SUMMARY
Genome expression study of Bacteroides fragilis strain 638R comparing a EcfO null mutant with an empty vector to a anti-EcfO null mutant containing the EcfO gene on a plasmid under the control of an IPTG inducible promoter.

DESIGN
Two chip study with 8 technical replicates on each chip comparing the EcfO overexpressing strain in an anti-EcfO mutant to an empty vector control in a EcfO null mutant.
