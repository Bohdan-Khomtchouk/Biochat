TITLE
Gene expression profiling of cervical cancer tissues at progressive FIGO defined stages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is a study indented to investigate the alterations in the molecular profile of cervix uteri, as it progresses thorough various FIGO stages of carcinoma, by means of global gene expression profiling, in a cohort of Indian patients. In addition expresion profiles of early and advanced stage cervical cancer were compared to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the advanced stages.

DESIGN
Cervical cancer and non-malignant cervical tissues are obtained from consenting patients following hospital ethics committee approved protocols. The samples are profiled against universal Human reference RNA from Stratagene on 19K EST microarrays from Microarray Center, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada. Biological replicates: Normal = 4; Cervical cancer Stage I = 8; Cervical cancer Stage II = 9; Cervical cancer Stage III = 8. One replicate per array.
