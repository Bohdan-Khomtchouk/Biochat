TITLE
Expression data from human OC+BAP+ double positive versus OC-BAP- double negative cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Subpopulation of circulating monocyte/macrophage lineage cells show a calcifying ability in vivo and in vitro. These cells may contribute to intimal calcification within atherosclerotic lesions and may have pathophysiological clinical and therapeutic implication in vascular disorders. Such cells express Osteocalcin (OC) and Bone Alkaline Phosphatase (BAP). We analysed the expression profile of human OC+BAP+ cells versus OC-BAP- cells

DESIGN
We compared three biological repilcates of OC+BAP+ versus OC-BAP- (each population coming from the same donor), each of the three coming from different healthy non diabetic donors.
