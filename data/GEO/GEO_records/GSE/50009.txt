TITLE
Wnt signaling pathway gene expression profile in SW480 cells with/without hiNOS overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wnt signaling plays important roles in development and cancer. We found hiNOS is a wnt target gene. We tried to clarify the role of the so far iNOS in Wnt signaling in colorectal cancer.

DESIGN
We performed SuperArray limited gene array analysis of SW480 cells with/without hiNOS overexpression. Oligo GEArray expression array systems (cat#OHS-043) SuperArray, Bethesda, MD) consisted of spotted cDNA fragments encoding 114 genes involved in and downstream of Wnt signaling. Control sequences (PUC18, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and β-actin) were also included. These Superarrays were employed to compare wnt signaling genes expression between with iNOS and without iNOS. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol (Invitrogen) and processed for microarray hybridization following the manufacturer’s instructions. Arrays were visualized by autoradiography, and hybridization signals were scanned and analyzed for density in GEArray Expression Analysis Suite 2.0. The normalized value for each gene was calculated by dividing the value of each gene by the average value of the housekeeping genes GAPDH, and β-actin. To obtain a gene profile, analysis was performed on three separate RNA samples isolated from different SW480 cells, with replicate assays conducted on each RNA preparation.
