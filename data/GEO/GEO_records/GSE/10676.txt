carnitine effect-Effect of carnitine on the transcriptome of A. thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs07-01_carnitine - carnitine effect - Effect of carnitine on the transcriptome of A. thaliana - Our objective is the description of the existence of an intracellular transport depend on the carnitine at Arabidopsis thaliana. For that, we planned the study of the response of the transcriptome in the presence of exogenic L-carnitine. Seedlings WT are cultivated on medium MS, 6 independent times. At 144h, the seedlings are collected and pools are formed with 3 samples. We proceed in the same way for the seedlings which are cultivated on medium MS containing L-carnitine 5mM. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison

DESIGN
