TITLE
Cyclin D1 Transgenic Mice with Bim-deficient B-cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression analysis from a genetically engineered mouse model of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in fourteen mice that overexpress cyclin D1 and delete Bim in their B cells and that were stimulated with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and irradiation (I), pristane (P) or only SRBC weekly (A).  Mice that developed disease based on histopathologic criteria were compared to ones that did not.  An additional seven stimulated mice that only overexpressed cyclin D1 were used to estimate the data set variance.
