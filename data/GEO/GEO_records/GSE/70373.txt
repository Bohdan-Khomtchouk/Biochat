TITLE
Transcriptome-wide mapping of cut sites of the viral endoribonuclease SOX from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: identify sites in endogenous mRNAs that are cut by KSHV SOX; Method: parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE, following Zhai et al., 2014); Results: SOX cuts at discrete locations in mRNAs

DESIGN
human Xrn1 was knocked down in HEK293T cells by shRNAs or siRNAs to stabilize degradation fragments with free 5' ends; GFP-SOX or GFP were transfected for ~24 hrs; total RNA samples were collected and subjected to PARE protocol (Zhai et al., 2014)

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
