TITLE
Neuronal MeCP2 is expressed at near histone-octamer levels and globally alters the chromatin state

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of single molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput genom-wide mapping of MeCP2 binding and DNA methylation in mouse brain and cerebellum respectively. We find a good correlation between MeCP2 occupancy and methyl-CpG density and depletion of MeCP2 binding at CpG Islands, the majority of which are constitutively hypomethylated. This study provides a comprehensive characterisation of the genome wide distribution of MeCP2.

DESIGN
Examination of MeCP2 occupancy in mouse brain and the distribution of methylation in mouse cerebellum.
