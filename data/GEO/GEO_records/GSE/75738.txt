TITLE
RNA sequencing of small number germ cells including primordial germ cells (PGCs) collected from female embryonic 12.5 day (E12.5), Female germline stem cells (FGSCs), Germinal-stage oocytes (GV oocytes) and Meiosis II oocytes (MII oocytes)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammalian oogenesis is an intricate and coordinated process involving dramatic changes in the transcriptional architecture. Through the small number of cells RNA sequencing (RNA Seq), we comprehensively uncovered the transcriptome dynamics of the mouse PGCs, FGSCs, GV Oocytes and M II Oocytes using. These results would provide some valuable navigation for the mechanism research of mammalian FGSCs in the future.

DESIGN
Examination of RNA level in E12.5 PGCs, FGSCs, GV oocytes and MII oocytes

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
