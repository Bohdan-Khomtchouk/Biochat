TITLE
Human Calu-3 cell transcriptome response to a wild type infectious clone of H5N1 Influenza virus and mutant H5N1 viruses [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA, miRNA, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and histopathology analysis in human Calu-3 cells infected with wild-type A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1; 'VN1203'; derived by reverse genetics), PB2-K627E (627K is a mammalian-adapting mutation that increases polymerase replicatve activity; '627E' is typically found in avian species), and NS1-trunc124 (this 'NS1' protein has a 90 amino acid truncation at the C-terminus).

DESIGN
Human Calu-3 cells were seeded at  1 x 10^6 cells per well on 6 well plates 2 days before infection. Prior to infection, washed cells 2 times with PBS, and then infected with a multiplicity of infection of 1. Infected samples were collected in quintuplet; time-matched mocks were collected in quintuplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 0, 7, 12, and 24 hr post-infection.

PLATFORM
