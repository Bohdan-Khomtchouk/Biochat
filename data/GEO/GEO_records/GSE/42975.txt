TITLE
Novel dedifferentiated liposarcoma xenograft models reveal PTEN down regulation as a malignant signature and response to PI3K pathway inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma, exhibiting poor survival and a high recurrence rate.  Treatment is generally limited to surgery and radiation, emphasizing the need to understand this disease.  Because very few in vivo and in vitro models can reproducibly recapitulate the human disease, we generated several xenograft models from surgically resected human dedifferentiated liposarcoma.  Our study demonstrates that all xenografts recapitulate morphologic and gene expression characteristics of the patient tumors after continuous in vivo passages.  Importantly, xenograftability is directly correlated with disease specific survival of liposarcoma patients.  When treated with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor rapamycin alone or in combination with the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib, all xenografts responded with increased lipid content and a more differentiated gene expression profile.

DESIGN
One-color arrays: Vehicle vs combination (rapamycin & sorafenib) treatment for 2 separate dedifferentiated liposarcoma xenografts. Two-color arrays: Comparison of patient tumor, several passages of xenograft generated from that tumor, and cells cultured from xenografted tumors.
