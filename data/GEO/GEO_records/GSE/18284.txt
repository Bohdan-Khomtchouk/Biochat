TITLE
Genomic binding sites of non-metastatic 2 (NME2) across promoters in lung cancer A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-metastatic 2 (NME2) is one of the first discovered suppressors of metastases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its anti-metatsic activity remain insufficiently characterized. We hypothesized that large scale transcriptional potential of NME2 might be at the core of this function. Using a combination of gene expression meta-analysis, and high throughput genomic assays, we explored the transcriptional targets of NME2. Specifically, we found > 250 binding sites of NME2 across human gene promoters. Several of the novel targets identified in this way regulated cell adhesion and survival. We subsequently constructed NME2 target gene network which delineated a transcriptional program responsive to NME2 capable of restricting metastasis.

DESIGN
Three sets of ChIP vs. mock-ChIP experiments were done. pcDNA plasmid was transfected to lung cancer, A549 cells to express NME2 tagged with MYC epitope which was subsequently immunoprecipitated using anti-MYC antibodies (after 48 hours of transfection). Non-specific IgG was used for mock immunoprecipitation.
