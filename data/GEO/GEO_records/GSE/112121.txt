TITLE
Spatiotemporal transcriptome of the mouse dentate gyrus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of LCM samples isolated from the inner (subgranular zone-side, neurogenic site) and outer (molecular zone-side) granule cell layer of either young adult or senile dentate gyrus. Results provide insight into the molecular signatures of young and old granule cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression was analyzed in the laser captute miccrodissected (LCM) samples isolated from the inner (subgranular zone-side) and outer (molecular zone-side) granule cell layer of the dorsal dentate gyrus at the age of either 3-month-old (young adult) or 20-24-month-old (senile).  Each sample was pooled from 8 independent female mice .
