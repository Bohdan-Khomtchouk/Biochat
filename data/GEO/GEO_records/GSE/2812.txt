TITLE
Fetal mouse heart, TCDD dose-response series

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pregnant C57Bl6N mice were treated with 0 (corn oil), 1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 ug/kg TCDD on gd14.5.  Fetal hearts were collected on gd17.5.  Hearts from each litter were pooled onto one chip.  4 replicates of each condition were run on affymetrix MG_U74Av2 chips, using standard affymetrix protocols and controls. Keywords: dose-response, 3 doses plus corn oil control, 4 replicates

DESIGN
