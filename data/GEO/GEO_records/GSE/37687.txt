TITLE
Differences in gene expression between murine Fnip1-null pre-B cells and wild type pre-B cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in FACs-sorted pre-B cells derived from Fnip1-null and normal wildtype littermate mice.  3 arrays from 3 different mice per genotype were utilized to generate the expression data (mouse WG-6 v.2.0 beadchip (Illumina Inc, San Diego CA)) and statistics.  P-values are shown.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from sorted B220+CD43+ cell from Fnip1-/- and WT mice (n=3)
