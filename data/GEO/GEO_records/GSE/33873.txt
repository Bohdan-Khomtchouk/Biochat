TITLE
DamID data for SUUR binding in 12-14h Embryo, larval salivary glands and larval brain

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
SUUR protein was found to be a major component of three repressive chromatin states named BLACK, BLUE and GREEN chromatins. Here we addressed a question of developmental dynamics of these chromatin states using SUUR as a marker. SUUR binding in larval salivary glands, brains and 12-14 hours embryos was determined using DamID technique.

DESIGN
Comparison of Dam-SUUR binding to Dam-alone signal in duplicate for each sample type.
