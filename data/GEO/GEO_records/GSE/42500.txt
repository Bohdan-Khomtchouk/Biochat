TITLE
The Ciliated Cell Transcriptome: Ciliated Mouse Tracheal Epithelial Cells vs Control Non-ciliated Mouse Tracheal Epithelial Cells during in Vitro Differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of ciliating mouse tracheal epithelial cells compared to non-ciliating cells at two timepoints, ALI+4 and ALI+12, during differentiation in vitro.  These cells are obtained from a transgenic mouse expressing GFP from a human FOXJ1 promoter, so that cells destined to become ciliated can be sorted by FACS based on their expression of GFP.  Likewise, the control non-ciliated cells are identified by their lack of GFP expression.  Ciliated cells were compared to Universal Reference RNA, and non-ciliated cells were compared to Universal Reference RNA.

DESIGN
Two-color arrays were used to compare non-ciliated cells, or ciliated cell samples taken at 4 days or 12 days after establishment of the air-liquid interface (ALI), to a Universal Reference RNA. Ciliated cells vs. Universal Reference RNA or Non-ciliated cells vs. Universal Reference RNA.  3 biological replicates from independently grown and harvested cell cultures were performed for non-ciliated cells, 5 biological replicates were performed for a ciliated cell samples at ALI+12, and 3 biological replicates plus 2 technical replicates were performed for ciliated cell samples at ALI+4.
