TITLE
Acute (2 hr) response to rxLeptin injection in preoptic area/hypothalamus/pituitary of early prometamorphic (NF stage 54) Xenopus laevis tadpoles

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Leptin binding to the leptin receptor (LepR) causes rapid signaling to the nucleus. We investigated the early (2 hr) transcriptional response to acute leptin injection (intracerebroventricular) in the preoptic area/hypothalamus/pituitary of Xenopus tadpoles.

DESIGN
Tadpoles were given i.c.v. injections of 0.6% saline or recombinant X. laevis leptin (rxLeptin; 20 ng/g BW) and 2 hrs later killed and the preoptic area/hypothalamus/pituitary dissected.
