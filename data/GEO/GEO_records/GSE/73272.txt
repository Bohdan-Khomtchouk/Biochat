TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of mouse group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) cultured with IL-33, IFN-g, and IL-27

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: We found that IFN-g and IL-27 had suppressive effects on ILC2s cultured with IL-33. The goal of this study is to clarify the expressions of RNA induced by IFN-g and IL-27 in ILC2s. Methods: ILC2s were isolated from fat-asociated lymphid clusters (FALC) of wild-type mice. They were cultured with IL-33 (10ng/ml), IL-33 + IFN-g (10ng/ml), or IL-33 + IL-27 (10ng/ml) for 48hrs. RNA was isolated by Allprep DNA/RNA Micro Kit (QIAGEN), and cDNA libraries were prepared by TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kits v2 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s low sample protocol. A HiSeq 1500 system (Illumina) was used for 50 single-end bases (50SE)　sequencing. Results: Sequenced reads were trimmed for adaptor sequence, and masked for low-complexity or low-quality sequence, then mapped to the reference genome (mm9) using Bowtie2 v2.1.0 and TopHat2 v2.0.8. The transcript abundances were estimated as FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon million fragments mapped) value using Cufflinks v2.1.1. We found that both IL-27 and IFN-g upregulated the expression of STAT1 and IRF1 which are regulated downstream of IFN-g receptor signaling, but there was no difference in the expression of GATA3, a critical transcription factor for ILC2 functions. Conclusions: Our study represents the detailed differences of RNA expressions by RNA-seq technology.
