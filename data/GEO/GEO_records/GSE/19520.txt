TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana G protein subunit mutants in response to abscisic acid (ABA)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Heterotrimeric G proteins mediate crucial and diverse signaling pathways in eukaryotes. To gain insights into the regulatory modes of the G protein and the co-regulatory modes of the G protein and the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), we generated and analyzed gene expression in G protein subunit single and double mutants of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Through a Boolean modeling approach, our analysis reveals novel modes of heterotrimeric G protein action.   Keywords: transcriptome analysis; G protein subunit mutants;  abscisic acid (ABA)
