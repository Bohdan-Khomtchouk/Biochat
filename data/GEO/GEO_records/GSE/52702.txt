TITLE
Interactive effects of arsenic and a high-fat diet on hepatic gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) or a high-fat diet (HFD) can produce liver injury. However, the interactive molecular biological effects and mechanism of iAs and HFD are as of yet unclear. We used microarrays to detail the interactive effects of arsenic and a high-fat diet on hepatic gene expression.

DESIGN
The C57BL/6 Mice fed low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD were exposed to 3 mg/L iAs or deionized water for 10 weeks. Then, hepatic RNA were extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Differentially expressed genes in LFD+As, HFD, and HFD+As groups compared to LFD group were identified, and interactive molecular biological effects and mechanism of iAs and HFD were discussed.
