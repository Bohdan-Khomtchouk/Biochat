TITLE
Transcriptional responses in Arabidopsis seedlings after hydrogen peroxide treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause cellular stress through damage to all classes of macromolecules and result in cell death. However, ROS can also act as signaling molecules in various biological processes. In plants, ROS signaling has been documented in environmental stress perception, plant development and cell death amongst others. Knowledge on the regulatory events governing ROS signal transduction is however still scratching the surface. To further elucidate the transcriptional response and regulation upon ROS accumulation we supplemented Arabidopsis seedlings with a 10mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution to trigger oxidative stress.

DESIGN
After growth of 7 days, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was added to a final concentration of 10mM. Control plants were treated with the same volume of H2O. Seedlings were grown for 24h under the same controlled conditions. Design: 3 replicates x 2 conditions (7+1 day H2O or 7+1 day H2O2)
