TITLE
The role of the MfsR repressor on the transcriptome of the integrative and conjugative element ICEclc  in Pseudomonas putida UWC1

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida UWC1

SUMMARY
These transcriptomic data are used in two distinct but subsequent and complementary studies:(i) the role of the mfsR gene on the expression of the mfsABC operon as well as on its own promoter, (ii) the role of the mfsR operon on the activation of the core genes of ICEclc.

DESIGN
ICEclc-specific gene expression in Pseudomonas putida UWC1 was measured during exponential phase and the subsequent stationary phase (sole carbon and energy sources : 10mM 3-chlorobenzoate). 6 genotypes were tested: (i) wild type P. putida UWC1 ICEclc (strain n°2737) ; (ii) P. putida UWC1 ICEclc-KmR19033 (strain n°2961) ; (iii) P. putida UWC1 ICEclc∆'mfsR (strain n°4322) ; (iv) P. putida UWC1 ICEclc∆'orf17984 (strain n°4372) ; (v) P. putida UWC1 ICEclc∆'tciR (strain n°4321) ; (vi) P. putida UWC1 ICEclc∆mfsR-∆'orf17984 (strain n°3543). For each strain, in each phase, 3 or 4 replicates were used.
