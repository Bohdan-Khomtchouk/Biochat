TITLE
Expression data from NS398-treated and control HT29 colon adenocarcinoma cell line samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis of  NS398-treated HT29 colon adenocarcinoma cells samples can give an insight into global molecular background of selective COX2 inhibitor administration in order to find other target molecules and pathways influenced by NS398 selective COX2 inhibitor treatment in the epithelial cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from NS398-treated and control HT29 colon adenocarcinoma cells and hybridized on Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays
