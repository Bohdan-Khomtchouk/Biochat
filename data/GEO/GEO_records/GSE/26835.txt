TITLE
Genetic variation in radiation-induced cell death

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to measure the expression levels of genes in irradiated immortalized B cells, lymphoblastoid cells, from members of Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) Utah pedigrees. Data were collected for cells at baseline and 2 hours and 6 hours after exposure to 10 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR).

DESIGN
We measured the expression levels of genes in irradiated immortalized B cells, lymphoblastoid cells, from members of 30 Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) Utah pedigrees (CEPH 1331, 1332, 1333, 1341, 1344, 1346, 1347, 1349, 1354, 1356, 1357, 1358, 1362, 1408, 1413, 1416, 1418, 1420, 1421, 1423, 1424, 1444, 1447, 1451, 1454, 1456, 1458, 1463, 1477, 1582). Cells were irradiated at 10 Gy in a 137Cs irradiator. Cells were harvested prior to radiation and at 2 and 6 hours following exposure to IR.
