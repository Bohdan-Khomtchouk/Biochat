TITLE
Targeted disruption of the BCL9/beta-catenin complex in cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stabilized Alpha-Helix peptides of BCL9 HD2 (SAH-BCL9) block BCL9 and B9L interactions with beta-catenin and specifically downregulate Wnt target gene expression.

DESIGN
RNA from triplicate SAH-BCL9B- and vehicle-treated DLD1 samples (10 ÂµM each for 12 hours) was hybridized to Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 arrays to asses global gene expression changes.

PLATFORM
