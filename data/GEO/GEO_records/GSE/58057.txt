TITLE
Single-cell analysis reveals prominent classes within the planarian stem cell compartment

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
Single cell qPCR analysis identified two prominent expression signatures within the planarian stem cells, the neoblasts. RNAi against zinc finger protein zfp-1 results in elimination of one of the two classes.

DESIGN
Worms were treated with RNAi by feeding. X1 or X2 cells were isolated by FACS, or blastemas were dissected. mRNA libraries were sequenced.
