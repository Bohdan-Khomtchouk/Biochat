TITLE
Expression analysis of doxycycline inducible secondary fibroblasts reprogramming under adherent and suspension conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Samples of adherent and suspension cells undergoing reprogramming were collected at day 0, day2, day6, day15 (with doxycycline) and day25 (without doxycycline).

DESIGN
Reprogramming under adherent and suspension conditions was compared by PCC analysis, non-hierarchical clustering and by functional criteria for differentially expressed genes.
