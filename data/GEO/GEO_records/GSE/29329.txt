TITLE
Analysis of MicroRNA Expression in Embryonic Developmental Toxicity Induced by microcystin arginine arginine (MC-RR).

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In this study, we used zebrafish embryos as a model system to investigate the toxic effects of MC-RR on early development and try to elucidate the underlying developmental toxicological mechanisms in a global view at posttranscriptional level. Altered expression pattern of miRNAs in embryos treated with MC-RR was detected by miRNA microarray.

DESIGN
We examined microRNA expression profiling in paired MC-RR treated and control embroys of zebrafish. There are 4 biological replicates in MC-RR treated group and control group, respectively.
