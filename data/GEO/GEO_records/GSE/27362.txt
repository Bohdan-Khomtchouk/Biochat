TITLE
Expression data from parthenogenetic and WT iPS samples and their parental fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Three parthenogenetic induced pluripotent stem cell (PgHiPSCs) lines were generated from each of the ovarian teratoma cell lines (two distinct individuals).  Two normal iPS cell lines were generated from normal fibroblasts. Three biological replicates of normal embryonic stem cells (H9, HESCs) were perfomed. We used microarrays to study the gene expression profiles of the PgHiPSCs, and compared the expression of genes to both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell, to identify paternally expressed genes that are down-regulated in the PgHiPSC lines.

DESIGN
All parthenogenetic and normal iPS cell lines, were tested for pluripotency assays (inclusing, morphology, immuno stanings and qRT-PCR for known pluripotency markers, differentiation capacity in vivo and  in vitro)
