TITLE
Expression data from common myeloid progenitor cells (CMP) of C57BL6 mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Common myeloid progenitor cells from murine bone marrow were sorted according to ROS content using FACS with H2-DCFDA staining. We compared gene expression profile between CMP with low-ROS levels and those with high-ROS levels.

DESIGN
We analysed function of ROS in differentiation step from CMP to MEP.
