TITLE
Expression data of blood (BVEC) versus lymphatic (LVEC) vascular endothelial silenced for RhoB and VEZF1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RhoB null mice show decreases in pathological angiogenesis in the ischemic retina and reduces angiogenesis in response to cutaneous wounding, but enhances lymphangiogenesis following both dermal wounding and inflammatory challenge. We used microarrays to link these unique and opposing roles of RhoB in blood versus lymphatic vasculatures to RhoB/VEZF1-mediated gene regulation in primary human blood versus lymphatic endothelial cells.

DESIGN
Pure populations of human primary BVECs and LVECs silenced for RhoB or VEZF1 were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We extracted these cells from human male foreskins from at least four individuals and purified them using Dynabeads associated with vascular markers (CD31 and Podoplanin).
