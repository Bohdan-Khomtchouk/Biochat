TITLE
The histone demethylase KDM3A, and its downstream target MCAM, promote Ewing Sarcoma cell migration and metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ewing Sarcoma is the second most common solid pediatric malignant neoplasm of the bone and soft tissue. Driven by EWS/Ets, or rarely variant, oncogenic fusions, Ewing Sarcoma is a biologically and clinically aggressive disease with a high propensity for metastasis.  Our laboratory has previously identified the Jumonji-domain H3K9 me 1/2 histone demethylase KDM3A as a novel oncogene downstream of EWS/Fli1, the most common oncofusion in Ewing Sarcoma. Herein, we uncover a role for KDM3A in the promotion of Ewing Sarcoma metastasis. Using global gene expression profiling, we show that some of the most strongly regulated genes by KDM3A are those implicated in cell migration and metastasis, and demonstrate, using functional assays, that KDM3A promotes migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo. We further provide evidence that MCAM, one of the most strongly and consistently regulated genes by KDM3A, is an important effector of KDM3A pro-metastatic action. Our studies also show that KDM3A regulates MCAM expression both through a direct mechanism, involving modulation of H3K9 methylation at the MCAM promoter, and an indirect mechanism, via the Ets1 transcription factor.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates of A673 cells were stably transduced with Scrambled shRNA control, or 1 of 2 different KDM3A knockdown shRNA sequences (KDM3A sh1 or sh2) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
