TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of drug-tolerant cancer cell subpopulations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer relapse occurs even after curative treatment, suggesting the existence of undetectable cancer cell subpopulations and their drug-tolerant potential. We found that the number of drug-tolerant colonies (DTCs) was significantly suppressed by an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) inhibitor, alpha-amanitin (alpha-AMA). To identify potential molecular target of alpha-AMA, we performed transcriptional profiling by  Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray using untreated colonies and DTCs derived from MCF7. Among the top 2.5% of specifically induced genes in DTCs, we focused on TAF15 gene because its gene product binds RNAPII. A subsequent colony formation assay revealed that TAF15 knockdown suppressed the emergence of both DTCs and untreated colonies, suggesting that TAF15 is a crucial target of alpha-AMA in the context of DTC suppression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from two biological replicates of bulk untreated MCF7 colonies and MCF7 DTCs emerged in the presence of 0.8 ÂµM CIS. For identification of the TAF15 gene, gene ontology analysis was performed using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) software tools ( ).
