TITLE
FOXO1 regulates a subset of thyroid hormone target genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of thyroid hormone activated genes in euthyroid, hyperthyroid and FOXO1 knockdown hyperthyroid mouse liver tissues showed that FOXO1 regulates transcription of thyroid hormone-induced genes. FOXO1 and THRB1-ChIP-seq analysis suggested that the regulation required binding of either FOXO1 or THRB1 or both in a genes subset specific manner.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from liver tissues of euthyroid, hyperthyroid and FOXO1 knockdown hyperthyroid mouse. Mouse were treated with triiodothyronine (T3) for 3 days to make them hyperthyroid. FOXO1 was knocked down in liver using hydrodynamic tail vein injection of FOXO1 siRNA as previously described (Singh et al. J Biol Chem. 2013;288(42):30365-72).
