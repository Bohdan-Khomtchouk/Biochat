TITLE
DNA methylation of promoters plus CpG islands in mouse embryos at early neurulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To gain insights into the function of DNA methylation and its impact on gene expression, we measured methylation in 19,530 mouse promoters and CpG islands. Keywords: DNA methylation, MeDIP

DESIGN
The chosen array from NIMBLEGEN (2007-02-27_MM8_ CpG island _ promoter array) represents putative mouse promoters plus CpG islands, each covered by oligonucleotide probes spanning 1.3 kb upstream and 0.5 kb downstream of the transcription start site.
