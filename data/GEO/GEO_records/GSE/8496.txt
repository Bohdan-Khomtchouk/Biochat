TITLE
Examining the immediate early targets of Gata4 and Gata5.

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Gata factors are amongst the genes expressed early on in the process of cardiogenesis. We used microarrays to examine the immediate early targets of Gata4 and Gata5 in the Xenopus leavis animal cap cardiogenesis model. We hope to use these data to examine the roles of Gata4 and Gata5 in cardiogenesis and also to begin to dissect out the common and distinct targets of Gata4 and Gata5. Keywords: genetic modification, gene overexpresison.
