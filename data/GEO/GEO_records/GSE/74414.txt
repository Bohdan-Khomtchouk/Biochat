TITLE
Dexamethasone-stimulated DNA methylation of the epigenetic clock CpGs in peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole-genome DNA methylation (baseline and following GR-stimulation with 1.5 mg dexamethasone p.o.) were analysed to identify glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated changes in DNA methylation. Lifetime stress accelerates epigenetic aging.

DESIGN
DNA methylation was assessed in whole blood at baseline and 3 hours after stimulation with the selective GR agonist dexamethasone (1.5 mg p.o.). Blood was collected in EDTA vacuum tubes prior to extraction. DNA methylation was interrogated for each sample using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina). Supplementary files 'GSE74414_unmethylated_signals_353_CpG.txt', 'GSE74414_methylated_signals_353_CpG.txt', and 'GSE74414_detection.p.values_353_CpG.txt' include the raw data for the 353 CpGs used in the analysis in the associated manuscript. Supplementary file 'GSE74414_beta_values_353_CpG.txt' includes the processed data for the 353 CpGs used in the analysis in the associated manuscript. The raw and processed data for the remaining features included in Platform GPL13534 are embargoed.
