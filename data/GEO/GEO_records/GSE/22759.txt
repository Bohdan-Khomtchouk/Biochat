TITLE
Expression data from cell lines originating from patients with multiple myeloma, plasmacytoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A predictive gene list for response to high dose melphalan therapy in patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma is generated by combining results from dose response experiments and microarray data using a B-cell line panel and the introduction of multivariate regression techniques.

DESIGN
18 malignant B-cell lines were analyzed by gene expression microarrays and screened for melphalan median dose dependent growth inhibition. Results are used to build a predictive gene list for response to high dose melphalan therapy in multiple myeloma.
