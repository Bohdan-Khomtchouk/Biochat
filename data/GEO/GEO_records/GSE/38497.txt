TITLE
Muscleblind-Like 2 mediated alternative splicing in the developing bain by mRNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have identified Mbnl2 mediated splicing events and mRNA expression regulation by comparing WT and Mbnl2 ΔE2/ΔE2 mouse hippocampii using Affymetrix Mouse Exon Junction Array and mRNA sequencing. The splicing microarray data has already been submitted under GSE37908 which also includes a re-analysis of RNA-seq data. The TableS1.xls contains Splicing microarray analysis data of Mbnl2+/+ vs. MBNL2 ΔE2/ΔE2 knockout hippocampus. The TableS2.xls files contain RNA-Seq, Gene Ontology, HITS-CLIP and CIMS summary of Mbnl2+/+ vs. MBNL2 ΔE2/ΔE2 knockout hippocampus. The file contents are descibed in the 'TableS1_S2_readme.pdf' and data processing details are included in the 'data_processing_readme.pdf' file. The Mbnl2_TableS2.xls contains data from exon junction microarrays for splicing analysis between WT and Mbnl2 delta2 mice. It also contains RNA-seq based splicing analysis between WT and Mbnl2 delta2 mice. Mbnl2_TableS2 further contains common targets between the two analyses, Gene Ontology and finally the HITS-CLIP data. CLIP tag summary describes read numbers for the three biological replicates. CLIP sig peaks contains significant HITS-CLIP unique reads/peaks after processing the data (BED files). Finally, CIMS analysis describes the Mbnl2 binding motif.

DESIGN
9 total samples were analyzed; 6 for RNA-seq: brains from 3 WT and 3 MBNL2   E2/  E2 female mice, all 2-3 months of age, and 3 for HITS-CLIP: brains from 3 WT BL6 female mice, all 2-3 months of age.
