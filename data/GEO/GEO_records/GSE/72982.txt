TITLE
Identification of small RNA loci that are synthesized by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases1/2/6

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify RDR1/2/6 dependent small RNA loci of transcribed regions under 2hr drought stress- and untreated conditions, expression profiles of small RNA between rdr1/2/6 and wild-type using hi-seq 2000.

DESIGN
rdr1/2/6 and wild-type plants (Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia) were grown on MS medium for 2weeks. Then, their plants were transfered to dry plastic dish for 2 hours. small RNA fraction was s extracted from the sample using Ambion mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit. small RNA labrary was constructed using TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation Kits and applied to hi-seq 2000.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
