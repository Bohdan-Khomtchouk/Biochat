TITLE
Expression signatures of human HeLa cells with RNAi targetting A1 hnRNP, FUS, H hnRNP and p68-DDX5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of human HeLa cells (cervical cancer cell line) transfected with a plasmid expressing shRNAs cloned into the pSuper expression vector compared to emprty vector negative controls for transfection. Four different RNA interference treatments targetted: A1 hnRNP (HNRNPA1, Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1); FUS (fusion gene, involved in t(12;16) in malignant liposarcoma); H hnRNP (HNRNPH1); and p68 helicase (DDX5, DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 5). Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Five-condition experiment, where HNRNPA1, FUS, HNRNPH1 and DDX5 gene product levels were inhibited by siRNA transfection and compared to transfection with the negative control (scrambled siRNA). Biological replicates: 2 of each of the first three treatments and 3 of the treatment against DDX5, all independently grown and harvested. No technical replicates were performed.
