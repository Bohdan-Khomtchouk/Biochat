TITLE
Expression signatures of human HeLa cells with RNAi targetting A1 hnRNP, FUS, H hnRNP and p68-DDX5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of human HeLa cells (cervical cancer cell line) transfected with a plasmid expressing shRNAs cloned into the pSuper expression vector compared to emprty vector negative controls for transfection. Four different RNA interference treatments targetted: A1 hnRNP (HNRNPA1, Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1); FUS (fusion gene, involved in t(12;16) in malignant liposarcoma); H hnRNP (HNRNPH1); and p68 helicase (DDX5, DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 5). Keywords: genetic modification
