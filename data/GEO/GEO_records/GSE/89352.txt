TITLE
Phospholipase Cγ pathway-dependent mTOR signaling controls IL-7-mediated   early B cell development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the global gene expression profile of PLCγ1/PLCγ2 double-deficient CLPsand B cell progenitors by RNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
CLPs (Lin-IL-7R+) and B cell progenitors (B220+IgM-IL-7R+) were sorted from PLCγ1-/-PLCγ2-/- and control mice, and subjected to RNA-seq analysis. 3 repricates of each population from each genotype.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
