TITLE
Stimulation of Host Immune Defenses by a Small Molecule Protects C. elegans from Bacterial Infection

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers currently untapped potential for carrying out high-throughput, live-animal screens of low molecular weight compound libraries to identify molecules that target a variety of cellular processes.  We previously used a bacterial infection assay in C. elegans to identify 119 compounds that affect host-microbe interactions among 37,214 tested.  We subsequently found that one of these small molecules, RPW-24, protects C. elegans from bacterial infection by stimulating the host immune response of the nematode.  Using transcriptome profiling, epistasis pathway analyses with C. elegans mutants, and an RNAi screen, we showed that RPW-24 promotes resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection by inducing the transcription of a remarkably small number of C. elegans genes (~1.3% of all genes) in a manner that partially depends on the evolutionarily-conserved p38 MAP kinase pathway and the transcription factor ATF-7.  These data demonstrated that the immunostimulatory activity of RPW-24 is required for its efficacy and define a novel C. elegans-based strategy to identify compounds with activity against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens.  Here we present the microarray data that were used to define the genes that are differentially regulated in wild-type nematodes following exposure to RPW-24.

DESIGN
There are six samples total that comprise three biological replicates of wild-type animals exposed to either 70 μM RPW-24 or DMSO for 15 hours at 15°C.  For a given biological replicate, N2 C. elegans animals in the late L4 larval stage were exposed to RPW-24 or DMSO in parallel to each other.
