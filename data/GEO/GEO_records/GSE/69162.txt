TITLE
MLL4 prepares the enhancer landscape for FoxP3 induction via chromatin looping

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MLL4 is an essential subunit of the H3K4 methylation complexes. We report that Mll4 deficiency compromised Treg development and resulted in substantial decreases in H3K4me1 and chromatin interaction at putative enhancers, a remarkable portion of which were not direct targets of MLL4 but were interacting with Mll4-bound sites. The decrease in H3K4me1 and chromatin interaction at the MLL4-unbound enhancers correlated with MLL4 binding at distant interacting regions. Deletion of an upstream MLL4 binding site reduced H3K4me1 at the FoxP3 regulatory elements looped to the MLL4 binding site and compromised both tTreg and iTreg differentiation. We show that MLL4 catalyses H3K4 methylation at distant unbound enhancers via chromatin looping, thus providing a new mechanism of regulating T cell enhancer landscape and impacting Treg differentiation.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq profile of MLL4 binding in mouse Naive CD4+ T cells. ChIP-Seq of histone modification H3K4me1, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, RNA-Seq of gene expression, Hi-C of chromatin conformation capturing in control Naive CD4 T cells and Mll4 KO cells. Chip-Seq of H3K4me1 in control cells and Naive CD4+ T cells in which a MLL4-bound regulatory region upstream to the foxp3 gene were KO by the Crispr technique.
