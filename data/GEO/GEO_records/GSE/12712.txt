TITLE
Expression data from liver of adult mice that differ in expression of Regulator of sex-limitation genes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulator of sex-limitation (rsl) is a recessive mouse phenotype in which the otherwise male-specific sex-limited protein (Slp) gene is expressed in females. Positional cloning in rsl mice led to the identification of mutations in two neighboring KRAB zinc finger transcriptional repressors, Rsl1 and Rsl2, and BAC transgenic rescue experiements verified their ability to repress male-specific genes in the liver. Microarrays were used here to expand the list of Rsl-target genes in mouse liver. Enrichment of genes involved in intermediary metabolism among those responsive to Rsl suggest a role for Rsl1/2 in metabolic homeostasis in the mouse. Keywords: sex comparison and genetic modification
