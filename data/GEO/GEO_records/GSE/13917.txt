TITLE
Complement receptor 2/CD21– human naive B cells contain mostly autoreactive unresponsive clones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Complement receptor 2–negative (CR2/CD21–) B cells have been found enriched in patients with autoimmune diseases and in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) patients who are prone to autoimmunity. However, the physiology of CD21–/lo  B cells remains poorly characterized. We found that some rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients also display an increased frequency of CD21–/lo B cells in their blood. A majority of CD21–/lo B cells from RA and CVID patients expressed germline autoreactive antibodies, which recognized nuclear and cytoplasmic structures. In addition, these B cells were unable to induce calcium flux, become activated, or proliferate in response to B-cell receptor and/or CD40 triggering, suggesting that these autoreactive B cells may be anergic. Moreover, gene array analyses of CD21–/lo  B cells revealed molecules specifically expressed in these B  cells and that are likely to induce their unresponsive stage.  Thus, CD21–/lo B cells contain mostly autoreactive unresponsive clones, which express a specific set of molecules that may represent new biomarkers to identify anergic B cells in humans.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from batch sorted CD19+CD21+CD10-CD27- and CD19+CD21-CD10-CD27- naïve B cells isolated from donors using the Absolutely RNA microprep kit (Stratagene). 100-200 ng of RNA was obtained per sample, and the quality of the purified RNA was assessed by the Bioanalyzer from Agilent. Using the Ovation biotin system kit from Nugen, 30-50ng of RNA was amplified and labeled to produce cDNA. Labeled cDNA was hybridized on chips containing the whole human genome (Human Genome U133 2.0 from Affymetrix). Data from CD21+ and CD21- B cell populations were compared in order to determine the gene signature of the newly described CD21- B cells.
