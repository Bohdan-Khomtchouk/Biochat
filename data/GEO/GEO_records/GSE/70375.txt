TITLE
Whole genome tomato transcriptional response to tomato-adapted and non-adapted Tetranychus urticae herbivory

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Generalist arthropod herbivores rapidly adapt to a broad range of host plants. However, the extent of transcriptional reprogramming in the herbivore and its hosts associated with adaptation remains poorly understood. Using the spider mite Tetranychus urticae and tomato as models with available genomic resources, we investigated the reciprocal genome-wide transcriptional changes in both spider mite and tomato as a consequence of miteâ€™s adaptation to tomato We used microarray to assess global gene expression in Solanum lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker upon Tetranychus urticae attack by tomato-adapted and non-adapted spider mite lines.

DESIGN
1 month old tomato plants were subjected to Tetranychus urticae attack through application of 100 adult mites on a terminal leaflet of leaves 3 and 4 for 24 hours (200 mites per plant).
