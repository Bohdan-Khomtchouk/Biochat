TITLE
Genome-Wide Identification of microRNAs and Their Targets in Cold-Stored Potato Tubers by Deep Sequencing and Degradome Analysis

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Two small RNA libraries and 2 degradome libraries were constructed from potato tubers stored at room temperature or exposed to cold stress for deep sequencing. Through small RNA sequencing, 53 known miRNAs and 59 novel miRNAs were identified. Seventy genes were identified as miRNA targets by degradome sequencing.

DESIGN
Small RNA sequencing and degradome sequencing of control and cold treated Solanum tuberosum tubers
