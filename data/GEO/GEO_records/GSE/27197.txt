TITLE
Transcriptome Sequencing of the RamA Regulon

ORGANISM
Klebsiella pneumoniae

SUMMARY
We report the use of Illumina based transcriptome sequencing to determine the RamA Regulon in K. pneumoniae. This study has identified both genes and small RNAs that are upregulated in the presence of RamA.

DESIGN
Comparison of genetically modified mutants; TS67 (delta ramA) and TS68 (delta ramR, ramA overexpresser)

PLATFORM
GPL13148 Illumina Genome Analyzer Iix (Klebsiella pneumoniae)
