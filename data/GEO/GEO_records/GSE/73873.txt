TITLE
The CpxRA two-component system promotes intracellular survival and is a key regulator of virulence factors in Legionella pneumophila

ORGANISM
Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1

SUMMARY
The bacterium Legionella pneumophila is capable of intracellular replication within freshwater protozoa as well as human alveolar macrophages, the latter of which results in the serious pneumonia Legionnairesâ€™ disease. A primary factor involved in these host cell interactions is the Dot/Icm Type IV secretion system that is responsible for translocating effector proteins needed to establish and maintain the bacterial replicative niche. Several regulatory factors have been identified to control the expression of the Dot/Icm system and effectors, one of which is the CpxRA two-component system, suggesting essentiality for virulence. However, studies elsewhere have shown that L. pneumophila strains harboring mutated cpxRA genes have minimal to no impact on L. pneumophila intracellular growth in protozoa and macrophages. In this study, we generated L. pneumophila cpxR, cpxA, and cpxRA in-frame null mutant strains to further delineate the role of the CpxRA system in bacterial survival and virulence. Surprisingly, we found that cpxR and cpxRA are essential for intracellular replication within Acanthamoeba castellanii, but not in U937 macrophage-like cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that CpxRA regulates a large number of virulence-associated proteins including a number of Dot/Icm effectors as well as 14 Type II secreted substrates. Furthermore, the cpxR and cpxRA mutants were more sodium resistant than wildtype, and cpxRA expression reaches maximal levels during post-exponential phase. Taken together, our findings suggest the CpxRA system is a key contributor to L. pneumophila virulence via virulence factor regulation.
