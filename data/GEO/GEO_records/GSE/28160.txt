TITLE
Significant Effects of Antiretroviral Therapy on Global Gene Expression in Brain Tissues of Patients with HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced morbidity and mortality in HIV infection; however HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist despite treatment. We used microarray analysis in post-mortem brain tissues to determine ART effectiveness in the brain and to identify molecular signatures of HAND under ART.

DESIGN
We performed microarray analysis using Affymetrix Arrays in portmortem brain tissues from seven treated and eight untreated HAND patients and six uninfected controls.
