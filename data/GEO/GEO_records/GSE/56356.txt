TITLE
Effect of TTF-1/NKX2-1 expression on TGF-beta induced gene expression in A549 lung cancer cell line.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TTF-1/NKX2-1 was expressed by adenoviral vector and changes in gene expression were determined by RNA-sequencing.

DESIGN
A549 cells were infected with Ad-TTF-1 or Ad-LacZ vectors and stimulated with TGF-beta for 24 hours or left untreated. Expression of polyA RNA was determined.
