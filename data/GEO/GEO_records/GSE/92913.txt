TITLE
Single six hours sleep deprivation causes glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To assess the effect of sleep deprivation on glucose metabolism and elucidate the mechanism, we established the mouse model wth C57BL/6J that is useful for the intervention on sleep deprivation associated diabetes and evaluate the liver metabolism and gene expression. Single six hours sleep deprivation induced increased hepatic glucose production assessed by pyruvate tolerance test and the hepatic triglyceride content was significantly higher in the sleep deprivation group than freely sleeping control group. Liver metabolites such as ketone bodies were increased in sleep deprivation group. Some gene expressions which associated with lipogenesis were increased.

DESIGN
In order to disturb the sleep, the cage changing method, the water platform method and the gentle handling method was performed using the C57BL/6J male mice. Intraperitoreal glucose tolerance tests were performed with each model. Using the model which shown impaired glucose tolerance by sleep deprivation, the plasma glucose and insulin levels were evaluated. Triglyceride content assay, metabolomics analysis, gene expression analysis by real-time PCR and gene microarray were also performed with liver tissue.
