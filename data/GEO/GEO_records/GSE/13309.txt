TITLE
Tobacco Smoke Induces Polycomb-mediated Repression of Dickkopf-1 in Lung Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Polycomb-mediated repression of Dkk-1 activates Wnt signaling and enhances tumorigenic potential of lung cancer cells following tobacco smoke exposure Keywords: tobacco Smoke, lung cancer, epigenetics

DESIGN
microarray techniques were used to examine proliferation and gene expression in A549 and Calu-6 lung cancer cells cultured in normal media with or without tobacco smoke condensate (TSC)
