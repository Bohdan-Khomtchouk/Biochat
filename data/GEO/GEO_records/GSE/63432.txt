TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the TEC-specific Hipk2 gene knockout  in mouse medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the role of Hipk2 in regulating gene expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells. The whole genome gene signatures of purified mTEC subsets (CD80 low, CD80 high) from TEC-specific Hipk2 knockout mice were compared to mating wildtype control mice (floxed, Cre-). Results provide the up- or down-regulated genes, affected by the Hipk2 gene knockout.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated CD80 low and CD80 high mTECs of TEC-specific Hipk2 knockout mice compared to control mice mTEC subsets
