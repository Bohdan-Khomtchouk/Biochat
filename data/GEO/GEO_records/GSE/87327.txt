TITLE
Diverse Patterns of N6-methyladenosine mRNA Methylation in Porcine Liver of Postnatal Development Stages

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We profile transcriptome-wide m6A in porcine liver of three developmental stages: newborn, suckling and adult. Approximately one-third of the transcribed genes are modified by m6A, with a frequency of 1.47 to 1.56 m6A peaks per mRNA. m6A was distributed predominantly around stop codon. Consensus motif sequence ‘RRm6ACH’ has been observed in most m6A peaks. A negative correlation rate (average Pearson’s r = -0.450) was found between m6A methylation level and gene expression. Gene ontology analysis of transcripts persistently modified in three stages showed m6A modified genes relevant to critical functions, including regulation of growth and development, regulation of metabolic process and protein catabolic process. Genes with higher m6A methylation and lower expression of one certain stage are associated with the biological processes required for or unique to this stage. These results will provide a source for identifying adenosine methylation modified mRNA of porcine liver and extended our knowledge of the role of m6A in development and growth of mammalian organ.
