TITLE
Expression data from FOG1+/- (or FOG1+/+) and FOG1 ki/ki mouse megakaryocyte (Meg)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription co-factor FOG1 interacts with the chromatin remodeling complex NuRD to mediate gene activation and gene repression during hematopoiesis. We have generated mice with a targeted mutation in the endogenous Fog1 locus that results in an N-ternimal mutation in FOG1 that disrupts the interaction with NuRD. We used gene expression microarrays to explore the global transcriptional programs regulated by FOG1 and NuRD in megakaryocytic cells to aid in understanding its role during hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) gradient centrifugation was used to isolate maturated megakaryocutes from mouse
