TITLE
Leukocytes methylome of melanoma patients with and without CDKN2A mutations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated if the presence of germline CDKN2A mutations or the occurrence of cutaneous melanoma could induce constitutive genome-wide DNA methylation changes. We analyzed the leukocytesâ€™ methylomes of eight patients carrying CDKN2A mutations, eight sporadic melanoma patients  and compared them with healthy controls (n=8). The genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was obtained using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform (Illumina).

DESIGN
Illumina 450k methylation array profiling performed on melanoma patients carrying germline CDKN2A mutations (n=8), sporadic melanoma patients (n=8) and health individuals (n=8)

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
