TITLE
Gene expression comparison between histone H2A.Z WT and K102Q in MCF7 breast cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study aims to elucidate the effect of histone H2A.ZK102me2 on gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line.  Results provide insight into the role of H2A.ZK102me2 in breast cancer cell.

DESIGN
The H2A.ZWT and H2A.ZK102Q protein were stably overexpressed while endogenous H2A.Z was knocked down in MCF-7 cells. Their total RNA was isolated for genomic expression profiling with Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.
