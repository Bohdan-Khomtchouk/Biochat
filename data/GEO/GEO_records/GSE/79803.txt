TITLE
Analysis of glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), NFkb (p65 subunit), and RNA polymerase 2 (RNAP2) binding in Beas-2B airway epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine binding patterns for GR, 65 and RNAP2 in Beas-2B airway epithelial cells after treatment with dexamethasone (100 nm), TNF (20 ng/ml) or both for one hour.

DESIGN
This study utilized duplicate samples for each treatment condition and immunoprecipitation except for p65 immunoprcipitation of TNF treated samples, which was analyzed as a single sample.  Input from vehicle treated cells was used a control. Experimental comparisons were made between the following samples/ treatment conditions.  Duplicate samples of Beas-2B cells treated with ethanol (vehicle) were used for ChIP of GR, p65, and RNAP2 (2 samples each antibody). Duplicate samples of Beas-2B cells treated with dexamethasone were used for ChIP of GR and RNAP2 (2 samples each antibody).  Duplicate samples of Beas-2B cells treated with TNF were used for ChIP of p65 and RNAP2 (1 sample p65, 2 samples RNAP2). Duplicate samples of Beas-2B cells treated with dexamethasone + TNF were used for ChIP of GR, p65 and RNAP2 (2 samples each antibody).
