TITLE
Winter and fall gene expression in rainbow smelt liver

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) are freeze-resistant fish that accumulate glycerol and produce an antifreeze protein during winter.  Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) and subtractive hybridization studies have revealed a few genes in smelt liver to be differentially regulated in winter in comparison with the fall when water temperatures are warmer.  In order to further define the suite of processes that are regulated seasonally, we undertook a large-scale analysis of gene expression by hybridization of smelt cDNA to the salmonid 16K cGRASP cDNA microarray. These microarray experiments were conducted as a focused sieving exercise, which identified informative genes for further study in the microarray samples and over a seasonal sampling series using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR.
