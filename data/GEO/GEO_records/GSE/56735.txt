TITLE
HSF1 and HSF2 interactions with chromatin during the heat shock response in mouse spermatocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Heat shock transcription factors HSF1 and HSF2 both are  necessary for proper spermatogenesis, which is disrupted at elevated temperatures. We studied how HSF1 and HSF2 cooperate during the heat shock response in mouse spermatocytes. For this purpose we used ChIP-sequencing. ChIP-Seq analyses revealed that the temperature elevation induces remodeling of HSF1 and HSF2 binding to chromatin. The highest HSF1-chromatin binding was observed at 43째C, when HSF2-chromatin binding was reduced. Many promoters (mainly Hsp genes) were occupied by both heat shock factors at physiological temperature of testes and/or at 38째C. In contrary at  43째C only HSF1 was bound. Obtained results suggest that HSF1 and HSF2 could cooperate in regulation of the transcription of some genes only at physiological temperatures and/or at 38째C. Alteration in HSFs interactions and their binding to chromatin could be one of the reason of increased spermatogenic cell death observed after heat shock.

DESIGN
On Illumina platform we sequenced DNA immunoprecipitated from isolated spermatocytes using anti-HSF1 antibody or anti-HSF2 antibody. Cells were either untreated (control) or heat shocked for 5-20 minutes. Two PCR-verified ChIP replicates were collected per each sample, and three negative control samples with normal goat serum were included.
