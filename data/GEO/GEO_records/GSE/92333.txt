TITLE
Erk-dependent Epigenetic Reprogramming Underlies Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The series of events that allows for the conversion of adherent epithelial cells into migratory cells is collectively known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is involved in triggering neural crest migration during development and in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as cancer metastasis. Whereas Erk signalling is known to be essential for EMT, its influence on the epigenetic and transcriptional programme underlying EMT is poorly understood. Here, using a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of H3K27ac mark and gene expression in primary mammary epithelial cells undergoing EMT, we found that Erk signalling is essential for the epigenetic reprogramming underlying hallmark gene expression and phenotypic changes of EMT. We found that the chemical inhibition of Erk signalling during EMT prevents loss and gain of H3K27ac mark at regulatory regions of epithelial and mesenchymal genes, respectively, and results in a transcriptome and epigenome closer to those of epithelial cells. Further computational analyses identified a distinct set of transcription factor motifs enriched at distal regulatory regions that are epigenetically remodelled by Erk signalling. Altogether, our study reveal an Erk-dependent epigenetic remodelling of distal regulatory elements that results in a gene expression programme that is essential for driving EMT.

DESIGN
1) After treatment of NMuMG cells with TGF-beta, three timepoints viz. 0hr, 4hr, 24hr were captured. To inhibit Erk pathway, Erk inhibitor is administered to NMuMG cells 30 min prior to TGF-beta treatment and captured at 4hr and 24hr timepoints.  2) For each timepoint captured, RNAseq and H3K27ac ChIPseq was performed.
