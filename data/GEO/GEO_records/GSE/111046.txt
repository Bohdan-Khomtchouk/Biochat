TITLE
Transcriptomic response of Drosophila melanogaster whole bodies or dissected brains to Entomophthora muscae 'Berkeley'

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptional profiles from individual Drosophila melanogaster (whole bodies or dissected brains) to Entomophthora muscae at 24 time points following fungal exposure. In whole fruit fly bodies, a significant immune response is observed following exposure to the fungus. In brains, few differences are consistently observed between infected and uninfected animals.

DESIGN
Three mock vials and three exposure vials were started with 25 CantonS Wolbachia-free flies 0-1 days old (RT-PCR, whole flies) or 1-2 days old (dissected brains) with either zero (mock) or six (exposure) Entomophthora muscae-killed D. melanogaster cadavers. For whole bodies, three uninfected females were individually collected at 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours following mock exposure. Six exposed female flies were individually collected at each 24, 48 and 72 hours; three exposed females were collected at 96 hours and three fresh female cadavers were collected at each 96 and 120 hours. For dissected brains, three uninfected and three exposed female brains were individually collected at 24, 48 and 72 hours following mock exposure or exposure, respectively.
