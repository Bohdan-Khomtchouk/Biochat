TITLE
The pioneer factor PBX1 guides a distinct ERa signaling in breast cancer [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled global PBX1 binding in MCF7 cells. The hypothesis tested was that PBX1 binds regions that recruit ERa following estradiol stimulation.

DESIGN
Profiling of PBX1 cistrome in MCF7 breast cancer cells
