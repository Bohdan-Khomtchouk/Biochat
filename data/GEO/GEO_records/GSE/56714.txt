TITLE
Expression profile of bcl11b-/- preselected DP thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Review on the role of Bcl11b in thymus and periphery and impact on diseases

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from DP thymocytes of bcl11bf/fCd4cre/tcra-/- and tcra-/- mice. Tcra-/- mice only have preselected DP thymocytes. Such mice were used to determine the role of Bcl11b before selection, considering the defective positive selection in bcl11bf/fcd4cre mice. RNA was isolated and submitted for library generation and microarray analysis to determine expression profile of bcl11b-/- preselected DP thymocytes.
