TITLE
Gene expression comparison between two human cancer cell Lines: Oral squamous cell carcinoma SASL1m and adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SASL1 is highly metastatic to lymph nodes. ACC2 is not metastatic. We compared gene expression on cultured cells to identify genes associated to metastatic spread patterns.

DESIGN
SASL1m cells and ACC2 cells were cultured to confluence in 10 100mm dishes (5 per cell type). Total RNA was extracted (ISOGEN, Nippongene, Japan), purified by centrifugation, pooled and checked for quality (Eukaryote Total RNA Series II, Agilent, Sta Clara, USA) . Two samples of 2É¥g of Total RNA from SASL1m and ACC2 cells were labeled with biotin (3'IVT Labeling Kit, Affymetrix, USA) and hybridized (GeneAtlas Hybridization, Wash, and Stain Kit for 3' IVT Arrays, Affymetrix). The Microarray platform used was Affymetrix HG U219 Array Strip. The arrays were scanned in a GeneAtlas scanner controlled by GeneAtlas Software (Affymetrix, Sta. Clara, USA). No replicates were made. Genes were later filtered according to expression fold change (GeneSpring GX Software, Agilent, Sta Clara USA) and later organized in hypothetical networks (Ingenuity Pathway and Analysis Software, Ingenuity Systems, Redwood, USA). No control or reference samples were included. The expression of genes of interest was confirmed with qrt-PCR in the samples studied and four additional samples from cell cultures (Lightcycler, Roche, Switzerland).
