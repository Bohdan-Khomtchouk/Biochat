TITLE
chip in silencing suppressor plants or in mirna plants-Transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in Arabidopsis plants that constitutively express suppressors of RNA silencing

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
gen107_ptgs - chip in silencing suppressor plants or in mirna plants - What are the genes that are differentially regulated in various tissues derived from silencing suppressor plants or miRNA mutants? - How are the histone modifications and the chromatin structure in miRNA mutants or in silencing suppressor plants?

DESIGN
12 dye-swap - CHROMO4_2 arrays - ChIP-chip
