TITLE
Expression profiles and initial confirmation of long non-coding RNAs in Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
There are significant differences in the lncRNA expression profiles in Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. LncRNAs such as AK124939 may be anti-cancer factors related to the progress of pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

DESIGN
RNA extracted from three paired pulmonary adenocarcinoma tissue and adjacent normal lung tissue specimens was used to synthesize double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) after labeling and hybridization. The cDNA was labeled and hybridized to the lncRNA expression microarray, and array data were analyzed for hierarchical clustering. Gene coexpression networks were constructed to identify interactions among genes. To validate the microarray findings, we measured the relative expression levels of four random differentially expressed lncRNAs in the same tissue used for microarray using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The expression level of one lncRNA AK124939, in the paired pulmonary adenocarcinoma/adjacent normal lung tissue of another 30 patients was measured using qRT-PCR. The experimental data were further analyzed and compared with clinical features.
