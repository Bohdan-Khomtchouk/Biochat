TITLE
Expression data in HTETOP cells following tetracycline or dexrazoxane treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HTETOP cells, derived from the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, express human topoisomearse II α (TOP2A) exclusively from a tetracycline (TET)-regulated transgene, we used HTETOP cells to differentiate between TOP2A-dependent and –independent apoptotic effects of doxorubicin and dexrazoxane. We used microarrays to detect global transcriptional changes in HTETOP cells following tetracycline doxycycline or dexrazoxane treatment. Keywords: Drug treatment comparison

DESIGN
HTETOP cells were treated with 1 µg/ml doxycycline to inhibit TOP2A expression or vehicle for 24 hours, doxycycline-induced trascriptional changes were identified by comparison of the two groups. HTETOP cells were treated with 100 µM dexrazoxane to inhibit TOP2A activity or vehicle for 24 hours, global trascriptional changes were identified by comparison of the two groups.
