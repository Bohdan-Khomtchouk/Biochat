TITLE
Determination of the FarR regulon

ORGANISM
Neisseria meningitidis

SUMMARY
Whole genome DNA microarray of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain MC58 and the isogenic mutant strain deficient of the transcriptional regulator FarR, MC58 ∆farR.

DESIGN
Wild type MC58 and the farR deficient mutant strain MC58 ∆farR were grown to mid-exponential growth phase in three independent experiments. The bacterial RNA was extracted and transcribed to cDNA, which was, each with dye-swap pairs, hybridized to the microarray slides.
