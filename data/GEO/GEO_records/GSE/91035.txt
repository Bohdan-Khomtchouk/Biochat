TITLE
The gene expression signatures of human normal, benign and PDAC pancreatic tisssues.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the gene profile of 8 normal, 15 adjacent benign  and 27 PDAC pancreatic tissues of human, data was generated with Agilent G2565CA arrays. Results provide a global profile of over 56,000 genes in human normal, benign and tumorous pancreatic tissues, and comparison of the differentially expressed genes among these 3 groups.

DESIGN
Gene expression was profiled and compared among human normal, benign and PDAC pancreatic tissue samples globally, using Agilent array with design ID 039714.
