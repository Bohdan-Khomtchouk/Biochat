TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of small intestinal crypts from mice treated with Notch blocking antibodies or Notch blocking antibodies in combination with an Lrp6 blocking antibody.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify genes that are differentially expressed during a 24 hour Notch blockade and whether a Wnt antagonist (anti-Lrp6) could block this effect.

DESIGN
3 condition experiment, Control untreated compared to N1N2 treated, and N1N2 treated compared to N1N2_Lrp6 treated. 5 biological replicates per condition.
