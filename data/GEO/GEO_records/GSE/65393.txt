TITLE
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 differential gene expression in bqsR (PA14_29730) mutants

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Before and after anaerobic Fe(II) shocked WT and ∆bqsR of late stationary phase P. aeruginosa PA14 strains Associated publication: Kreamer NN, Costa F, Newman DK. 2015. The ferrous iron-responsive BqsRS two-component system activates genes that promote cationic stress tolerance. mBio 6(1):e02549-14. doi:10.1128/mBio.02549-14.

DESIGN
Expression profiles of rRNA-depleted total RNA from WT and ∆bqsR Fe(II)-shocked (before and after 30 min incubation with 200 µM ferrous ammonium sulfate ) cultures grown anaerobically to deep stationary phase (A500 = 0.8) in Fe-limited (1 µM ferrous ammonium sulfate) MOPS minimal medium containing succinate as the carbon source, in triplicate
