TITLE
Effect of artificial saliva on inflammatory response of oral fibroblasts in an in vitro study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of oral fibroblasts Fibroblasts (HGF-1) was exposed for 120 seconds to human saliva (HS) and two commercially available AS (AS I and AS II). One microgram of RNA was converted in cDNA using RT2 First Strand Kit. 84 genes were analyzed using inflammatory response & Autoimmunity Array RT2 profiler (Qiagen Sabiosciences, Valencia, CA, USA) with buffers supplied by the manufacturer

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. Fibroblasts (HGF-1) was exposed for 120 seconds to human saliva (HS) and two commercially available AS (AS I and AS II).The expression of cytokines was assessed by PCR array analysis, Real-Time PCR

PLATFORM
GPL21761 SABiosciences Human Dendritic and Antigen Presenting Cell PCR assay panel
