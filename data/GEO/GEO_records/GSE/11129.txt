TITLE
ler vs pop2-1: gaba over-accumulation effects-Transcriptomic analysis of pop2-1 mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au05-03_gaba - ler vs pop2-1: gaba over-accumulation effects - The analysis aims at identifying genes that are differentially regulated by the over-accumulation of GABA observed in the mutant pop2-1 in response to treatment with exogenous GABA and that may explain the singular phenotype of the mutant in this condition. Designed experiment consisted in comparison of transcriptomes of Arabidopsis thaliana Landsberg erecta ecotype and its mutant pop2-1 (impaired in GABA transaminase activity) during a kinetic of endogenous GABA accumulation. For this purpose, 10-day-old plants grown on half strength Hoagland's agar medium were transferred to agar plates supplemented with 1 mM GABA. We isolated RNA from plants treated for 0, 1 and 4 days. Treatments were made in duplicate. Keywords: gene knock-out, time course
