TITLE
Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) trans-activation of inflammatory AP-1 signaling: dependence on DNA sequence, MR conformation, and AP-1 family member expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) primarily promote cardiovascular inflammation by incompletely understood mechanisms. The differential effects of GR and MR on inflammatory signaling and their contextual dependencies are relevant to the design of next generation drugs with improved safety and efficacy While MR has been shown to weakly repress NFÎºB, its role in modulating AP-1 has not been established

DESIGN
HEK293 cells were transfected with MR treated with vehicle alone, DOC (100 nM), PMA (10 nM) or DOC plus PMA
