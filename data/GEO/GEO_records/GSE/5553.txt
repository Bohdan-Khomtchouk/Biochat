TITLE
H295R human adrenocortical cells treated with Angiotensin II, Potassium or Forskolin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H295R human adrenocortical cells were cultured in H295R complete media containing DMEM:F12 (1:1) supplemented with 2% Ultroser G (Biosepra, Villeneuve-la-Garenne, France), ITS-Plus (Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA) and an antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 175 cm2 flasks until subconfluente. Media was replaced with 40 ml fresh media containing different agents and cultured for 3 h. Treatments: Angiotensin II (100 nM), potassium (16 mM) and forskolin (10 uM). Total RNA extracted with RNAesy Midi Kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase digestion Keywords: Agent response
