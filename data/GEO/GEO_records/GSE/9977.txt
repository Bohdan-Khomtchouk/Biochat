TITLE
Expression data from NIH-3T3 cells treated with mock, 100 U/ml IFN alpha or 100 U/ml gamma for 1or 3h

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression caused by 1h and 3h of IFN alpha or gamma treatment was analyzed in total cellular RNA of NIH-3T3 cells compared to mock We used microarrays to analyze the effects of 1 and 3h of IFNalpha and gamma treatment in total cellular RNA Keywords: time course in total cellular RNA (tc-RNA)

DESIGN
NIH-3T3 cells ( 5th to 15th passage after thawing) were split from confluent plates 24h before start of the experiment. At the begin of the experiment about 80% confluency was reached. The experiment was started by applying fresh, prewarmed, CO2-equilibrated medium containing either mock, 100U/ml IFN alpha or 100 U/ml IFN gamma. Labeling was either started together with addition of IFN for 60 minutes or for 30 minutes starting 150 minutes after begin of treatment.
