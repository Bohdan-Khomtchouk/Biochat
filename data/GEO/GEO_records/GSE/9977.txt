TITLE
Expression data from NIH-3T3 cells treated with mock, 100 U/ml IFN alpha or 100 U/ml gamma for 1or 3h

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression caused by 1h and 3h of IFN alpha or gamma treatment was analyzed in total cellular RNA of NIH-3T3 cells compared to mock We used microarrays to analyze the effects of 1 and 3h of IFNalpha and gamma treatment in total cellular RNA Keywords: time course in total cellular RNA (tc-RNA)
