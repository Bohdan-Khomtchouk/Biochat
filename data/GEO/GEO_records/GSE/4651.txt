TITLE
gene expression profiling of mouse model of Helicobacter-induced gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have previously reported human gastrin overexpressing transgenic mice (=INS-GAS mice) and Helicobacter felis (=H.felis) infection synergistically accelerated gastric cancer in mice stomachs.  (Wang et al 2000)  Using this mouse model, we employed microarray analysis of gene expression profiling to identify gastric cancer-specific genes. Keywords: disease state analysis
