TITLE
Polycomb Repressor Complex2 and REST-associated histone deacetylases are independent pathways toward a mature neuronal phenotype

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that REST and Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 function cooperatively in undifferentiated ESCs. Our results show that H3K27me3-enriched genes show no de-repression in REST-/- ESCs, while REST target genes show significant de-repression.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed and analyzed using two biological replicates for each genotype, WT (N6) and REST-/- (N8) mouse embryonic stem cells.

PLATFORM
