TITLE
expression data in lung of mice bearing inducible FGF18 transgene

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Better understanding alveolarization mechanisms could help improving prevention and treatment of diseases characterized by reduced alveolar number, especially bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although signaling through fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors is essential for alveolarization, involved ligands are unidentified. FGF18 whose expression peaks during alveolar septation is likely to be involved. Herein, a mouse model of inducible, lung-targeted FGF18-transgene was used to advance the onset of FGF18 expression, and genome-wide expression changes were determined. keywords: transgenic mice, alveolarization, angiogenesis, fibrosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

DESIGN
Four pairs of simple and double transgenic pups issued from 4 different litters were selected on the basis of FGF18 transgene induction. RNA from the mice lung were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
