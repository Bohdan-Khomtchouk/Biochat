TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of Apple (Malus x domestica Borkh) Floral Induction in Shoot Apical Meristems

ORGANISM
Malus domestica

SUMMARY
Effect of the presence of fruits on the expression of genes possibly involved in floral induction in the terminal meristem of spur bourse shoot. Investigation on mecanisms involved in Biennial Bearing in mature apple trees cultivar Royal Gala.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment : 'ON' trees (unthinned control) & 'OFF' trees (deflowered) for comparison. Three comparisons at sampling dates : 28, 48 and 119 days after full bloom (DAFB). Two dye switch biological replicates for each treatment and sampling date.
