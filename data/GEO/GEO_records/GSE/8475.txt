TITLE
Transciptional profiling of Candida albicans wild-type strains with TRK1 gene modification

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
We built 3 strains from Candida albicans wild-type strains, mutant strain with one TRK1 gene deleted(one allele of two genes was deleted), overexpression strain(add one allele of the gene to rp10 locus), and restoration strain(add one allele of the gene to mutant strains). The goal is study the expression level change of genes among the three strains compared with wild-type strain on a genomic scale. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
Indirect balanced design Totally 12 samples/arrays. Three strains(mutant strain, overexpression strain and restoration strain) were hybrized to reference strain wild-type, each has four technical replicates, including 2 dye-swap replicates and 2 duplicate experiments.
