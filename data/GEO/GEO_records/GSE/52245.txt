TITLE
Time Course of Young Adults Vaccinated with Meningococcal MCV4 and MPSV4 Vaccines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed systems analyses of immune responses to the meningococcal polysaccharide (MPSV4) and conjugate (MCV4) vaccines in healthy adults. The goal was to identify innate gene signatures that correlate to antibody responses induced by these vaccines.

DESIGN
Healthy adult volunteers (18-45 years of age) were randomized to be vaccinated subcutaneously with MPSV4 (MenomuneÂ®, n=13) or intramuscularly with MCV4 (MenactraTM, n=17) (Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA). Whole blood samples were collected using CPT tubes at days 0, 3 and 7 post-vaccination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from fresh blood and used for DNA microarray experiments.
