TITLE
Mouse embryonic kidneys (E13.5): HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) treated vs. Control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of cultured CD1 mouse embryonic kidneys (E13.5) comparing  HDACi-treated kidneys with control drug-treated kidneys. Studies in our lab showed that pharmacological inhibition of HDAC activity in ex-vivo cultured metanephroi results in extensive defects in kidney development, including impaired UB branching, tubulogenesis, and glomerulogenesis, accompanied by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.The goal of the microarray analysis was to elucidate the morphogenetic pathways affected by HDACi.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, HDACi-treated E13.5 kidneys (Scriptaid 2.0 μg/ml x 6hrs) vs. Control drug-treated E13.5 kidneys (Nullscript 2.0 μg/ml x 6hrs). Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 HDACi-treated replicates. Two-color Agilent 4x44k chips with dye-swap on 2 of 4 arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
