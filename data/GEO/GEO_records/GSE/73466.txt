TITLE
Expression profiling of murine MYCN-driven  neuroendocrine tumor from LSL-MYCN;hGFAP-Cre mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MYCN overexpression is a hallmark of many tumors originating from neural cell precursors. We generated a transgenic mouse with Cre-conditional induction of MYCN in glial fibre acidic protein (GFAP) expressing cells resulting in the development of neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas and the brain.

DESIGN
The expression profiles of nine tumors from pancreas and three brain tumors were compared to non-malignant pancreas controls (GSM771025.CEL-GSM771027.CEL) from wildtype mice Expression profiles of tumors and controls were analysed using GSEA and ANOVA.
