TITLE
An epigenetic profile of early T-cell development from multipotent progenitors to committed T-cell descendants.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using a stromal cell free system, we described the gene expression and two genome wide epigenetic profiles of a unique population of undifferentiated bone marrow cells selectively driven towards the T cell differentiation pathway

DESIGN
Undifferentiated bone marrow cells, transduced with NUP98-HOXB4 fusion protein, in vitro expanded with IL6 and SCF represents the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC); when grown in the presence of  DLL4 (Notch1 ligand) and IL7, they are directed towards the T cell lineage (ProT); these in vitro generated ProT cells injected in a Rag2-/- mouse give rise to mature double positive T cells (DP). 2 replica for each population
