TITLE
Comparative gene expression analysis between virus-susceptible and -resistant rice lines (TW16-4 and -69)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Near-isogenic lines TW16-4 and TW16-69 were developed from the cross between TN1 (recurrent parent susceptible to rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV)) and Utri Merah (donor parent resistant to RTSV). TW16-4 is susceptible to RTSV, whereas TW16-69 is resistant to RTSV. In order to identify genes which are constitutively differentially expressed between TW16-4 and TW16-69, the gene expression in the two lines were compared at three different conditions (healthy, green leafhopper (GLH)-inoculated, and RTSV-inoculated). Keywords: Constitutive differential expression
