TITLE
Mouse Sirt6-/- TNF-alpha timecourse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We completed genome-wide microarray analysis in Sirt6 knockout (ko) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and control wildtype (wt) MEFs. Prior to RNA extraction, MEFs were treated with TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and amplified with Ambion Amino Allyl MessageAmp II Amplification kit. Amplified mouse Universal Reference RNA (Stratagene) was used as reference RNA for analysis. Array hybridization of mouse MEEBO arrays is as described (Hendrickson et al., PLoS ONE, 2008). Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series. Compound Based Treatment: 10 ng/ml TNF-alpha Keywords: time_series_design
