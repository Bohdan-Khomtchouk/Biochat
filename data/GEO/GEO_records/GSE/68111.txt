TITLE
Trancriptomic profiling of hepatocytes and mesenchymal cells of mice treated with phenobarbital for 2 weeks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conventional notion regards the action of non-genotoxic carcinogens (NGC) an autonomous process largely confined to parenchymal cells. Here we aim to elucidate the role of the hepatic mesenchyme for the action of a prototypical NGC, phenobarbital (PB), an anti-epileptic drug.

DESIGN
12 weeks old male C57BL/6N mice received 50 mg/kg/day Phenobarbital for 14 days. We profiled mRNA expression in hepatocytes and mesenchymal cells to assess the different effects of treatment with phenobarbital on different liver tissues. Time-matched control animals received vehicle (H2O).
