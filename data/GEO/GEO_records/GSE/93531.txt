TITLE
Analysis of the role for the transcription factor TgAP2IV-4 (TGGT1_318470) in regulating gene expression in Toxoplasma development

ORGANISM
Toxoplasma gondii

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression analysis of TgAP2IV-4 knockout parasites in type I RH diCRE (RHCre) and type II Prudku80 (PruQ) genetic background The gene regulatory role for TgAP2IV-4 was evaluated, in vitro, as tachyzoites (pH 7.0) in 8 strains: RHCre-AP2IV-4 floxed; RHCre-delta_ap2IV-4 clones 27 and 30, PSMB794 cosmid complemented RHCre-dAP2IV-4 populations;  PruQ-AP2IV-4 floxed; PruQ-delta_ap2IV-4 clones 10 and 34.

DESIGN
16 total samples.  Each condition presented as 2 biological replicates
