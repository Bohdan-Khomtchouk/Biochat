TITLE
Molecular subtyping of Triple negative Breast Cancer from Taiwanese

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
'Precision medicine' is a concept that by utilizing modern molecular diagnostics, an effective therapy is accurately applied for each cancer patient to improve their survival rates. The aim of this study was to compare the molecular subtypes of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) between Taiwanese and other datasets.

DESIGN
The study is designed to include GEO Datasets for nonunion (12 groups, n=1450) and Taiwanese (3 groups, n=465) female breast cancer samples, including 617 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) samples. Our 57 samples is included in Taiwanese dataset. The GE from these datasets were acquired, normalized and cluster analyzed. In total, 1915 human breast cancer samples were included and among these samples a total of 617 TNBCs were identified. Please note that the GEO accession numbers for the data included in the overall study are provided in the 'dataset_accns_included_in_the_study.txt'.
