TITLE
Murine Pancreatic Cancer Cells: KLF10 wild type vs KLF10 knockout

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse pancreatic cancer cells comparing Pdx-1Cre LSL-KrasG12D P53L/L cells with Pdx-1Cre LSL-KrasG12D KLF10L/L P53L/L cells, and to determine the effects of KLF10 deficiency on murine PDAC gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Pdx-1Cre LSL-KrasG12D P53L/L cells vs. Pdx-1Cre LSL-KrasG12D KLF10L/L P53L/L cells: 3 KLF10 wild type replicates, 3 KLF10 knockout replicates.
