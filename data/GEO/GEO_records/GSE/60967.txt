TITLE
Gcn5 and PCAF negatively regulate interferon Î² production through HAT-independent inhibition of TBK1 [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gcn5/PCAF dobule knockout (dKO) in MEFs leads to loss of the global H3K9ac, but only affect expression of a small nubmer of genes according to RNA-Seq data. To examine the function of H3K9ac on gene activation, H3K9ac ChIP-Seq was performed. We found that H3K9ac at Transcriptional Start sites (TSSs) of no-changed, up-regulated and down-regulated genes are all dramatially decreased in Gcn5/PCAF dKO cells, suggesting that H3K9ac is largely not required for gene activation.

DESIGN
PCAF-/-;Gcn5f/D MEFs were infected with retroviral Cre to delete Gcn5 to generate Gcn5/PCAF dKO cells, followed by H3K9ac ChIP-Seq analysis
