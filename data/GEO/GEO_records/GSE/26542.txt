TITLE
Upregulation of pro-apoptotic microRNA mir-125a following massive small bowel resection in rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Upregulation of mir-125a suppresses the pro-survival protein Mcl1, producing the increase in apoptosis known to accompany the proliferative changes characteristic of intestinal adaptation. Our data highlight a potential role for microRNAs as mediators of the adaptive process and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic options for short bowel syndrome.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: resected rat jejunum vs. pooled transected control, with dye-swaps.
