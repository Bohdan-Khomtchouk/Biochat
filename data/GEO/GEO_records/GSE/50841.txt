TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of colon cancer cell SW480_Control, _BOP1, _CKS2 and _NFIL3 treated with different inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SW480 cells overexpressing BOP1, CKS2 or NFIL3 migrated more actively compared to Control cells. Migration induced by BOP1, CKS2 or NFIL3 was repressed by interfering with distinct signaling systems using small- molecular-weight inhibitors, i.e., interference with PI3K, JNK and Notch in the case of BOP1, with PI3K and p38 MAPK in the case of CKS2, as well as with PI3K, p38 and mTOR in the case of NFIL3. Gene expression profilings suggest that BOP1, CKS2 and NFIL3 overexpression are associated functionally with a series of migration-related genes, which can be repressed transcriptionally by specific pathway inhibitors.

DESIGN
SW480 stable cells were grown in DMEM, 10% FCS, and treated for 24 hr with the following inhibitors or with solvent (DMSO): SW480_Control with DMSO; SW480_BOP1 with DMSO, LY294002 (3.3 uM), SP600125 (33.3 nM) and DAPT (667 nM); SW480_CKS2 with DMSO, LY294002 (3.3 uM) and SB203580 (3.3 uM); SW480_NFIL3 with DMSO, LY294002 (3.3 uM), SB203580 (3.3 uM) and Rapamycin (33.3 nM).
