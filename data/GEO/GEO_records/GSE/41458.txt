TITLE
Zic3 interacts with distant regulatory elements to regulate zebrafish developmental genes

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zic3 regulates early embryonic patterning in vertebrates. Its loss-of-function disrupts gastrulation, left-right patterning, and neurogenesis. We use the zebrafish as a model to study the developmental role of Zic3 in vivo. Using a combination of two genomics approaches â€“ ChIP-seq and microarray, we identified Zic3 targets, which include genes from the Nodal and Wnt pathways, and show for the first time cis-regulation of these genes by Zic3 using in vivo enhancer assay. We uncovered a previously unrecognized link between Zic3 and the non-canonical Wnt pathway in gastrulation and left-right patterning, and identified neural pre-pattern genes as Zic3 targets during the early steps of neural induction. Zic3 preferably binds to distal intergenic regions, some of which contain evolutionarily conserved functional enhancers. Our study establishes the zebrafish as an excellent model for genome-wide study of a transcription factor in vivo.

DESIGN
Zic3 ChIP of wild type and sqet33 transgenic
