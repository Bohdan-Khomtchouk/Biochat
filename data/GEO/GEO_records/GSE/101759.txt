TITLE
Comparing RNA expression profiles of KALori and KANSL mouse lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have reported that pulmonary infiltrating macrophages, which highly express inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2), play a critical role for driving spontaneous lung SCC development in a new mouse model (L-Ikka KA/KA; KA/KA) that mimics human lung SCC development. However, the role of NOS2 in lung SCC development is unknown. Our data suggests deletion of the gene iNOS prevents tumorogenesis in this mouse model. We use microarray data to compare levels of expression of genes associated with lung tumor development and prevention.

DESIGN
At 14 weeks of age, lungs were isolated from mice of each background, KALori and KANSL, to generate four total samples. RNA was then isolated by Trizol method and prepared for Microarray Affymetrix  performed by NCI-Genomics lab.
