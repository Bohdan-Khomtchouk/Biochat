TITLE
Gene expression profile in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected PBMC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analyzed the effects of HIV-1 (MN) and HIV-2 (ROD) infection on the expression of host factors in PBMC at the RNA level using the Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray.

DESIGN
RNA samples from PBMC isolated from 3 independent donors productively infected with HIV-1 MN or HIV-2 ROD were used to obtain gene expression data from Agilent microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL13497 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
