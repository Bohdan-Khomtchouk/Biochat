TITLE
Lamin b receptor regulates nuclear architecture and gene expression in olfactory neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene positioning and regulation of nuclear architecture are thought to influence gene   expression. Here, we show that in mouse olfactory neurons, silent olfactory receptor   (OR) genes from different chromosomes converge in a small number of heterochromatic   foci. These foci are OR-exclusive and form in a cell-type-specific and differentiation-   dependent manner. The aggregation of OR genes is developmentally synchronous with   the downregulation of Lamin b Receptor (LBR) and can be reversed by ectopic   expression of LBR in mature olfactory neurons. LBR-induced reorganization of nuclear   architecture and redistribution of OR loci results in misregulation of OR transcription and   disruption of the targeting specificity of the olfactory neurons. Our observations are   consistent with a model of spatial regulation of OR expression and provide evidence for   the instructive role of nuclear architecture and compartmentalization in gene regulation   and differentiation. A complex probe was made by array capture to label mouse olfactory receptor genes by DNA FISH; this microarray data verifies the composition of that probe.

DESIGN
Probe was made by array capture and elution from a custom olfactory receptor genomic region tiling array. Probe was verified on a chr1-4 tiling array.
