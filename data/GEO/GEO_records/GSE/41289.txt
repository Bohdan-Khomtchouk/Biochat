TITLE
Inter-individual variability in gene expression profiles in human hepatocytes and comparison with HepaRG cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Basal transcriptomic profiling of primary human hepatocytes and HepaRG cells We have analysed basal gene expression profiles in 6 primary human hepatocytes (2 technical replicates) and in 2 HepaRG cell passages (3 batches, 4 technical replicates)

DESIGN
6 primary human hepatocytes donors and 2 HepaRG cell passages
