TITLE
Expression analysis of the first-generation offspring of irradiated male mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in kidney, brain, liver and spleen of the offspring of CBA/Ca and BALB/c male mice exposed to 1 Gy of acute X-rays The pattern of gene expression of a number of circadian rhythm genes in the offspring of irradiated males is compromised

DESIGN
A twenty-two 12x135K chip study using total RNA extracted from kidney, brain, liver and spleen of control CBA/Ca and BALB/c male mice and the first-generation offspring of male mice exposed to 1 Gy of acute X-rays. The expression of 42,575 genes was measured with two-fold technical redundancy.
