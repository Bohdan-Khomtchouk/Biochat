TITLE
Human monocyte-derived macrophages polarized by GM-CSF or M-CSF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of genes differentially expressed between human monocyte-macrophages generated in the presence of either GM-CSF (termed M1) or M-CSF (termed M2)

DESIGN
Human peripheral blood monocytes from three independent healthy donors (#1, #2 and #3) were isolated by anti-CD14-labeled magnetic microbeads. CD14+ monocytes were cultured for 7 days in RPMI 10% FCS containing either GM-CSF or M-CSF. Total RNA from each condition was extracted and purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Labelled RNA was used as hybridization probes on human Codelink Whole genome Bioarray. All experimental procedures were performed following manufacturer instructions. Microarrays were scanned with a GenePix 4000B (Axon Instruments) scanner. Scanned images and raw data were processed using the Codelink Expression Software.
