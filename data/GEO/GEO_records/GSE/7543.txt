TITLE
Differential gene expression between individuals exposed to different levels of air pollution

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of genome-wide gene expression between humans living in areas of high levels of air pollution and less polluted areas. Keywords: Comparison of genome-wide gene expression between different conditions

DESIGN
The study investigated differential gene expression in peripheral blood from 23 children and 12 adults from a region of residence with high levels of air pollution as compared to 24 children and 12 adults from a less-polluted area.Two conditions: living in the polluted or in the less-polluted area. One individual per array, hybridized against a common reference sample
