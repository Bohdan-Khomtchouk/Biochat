TITLE
Differential gene expression in ap2-g and ap2-g2 mutants of Plasmodium berghei

ORGANISM
Plasmodium berghei

SUMMARY
Commitment to and completion of sexual development are essential for malaria parasites to be transmitted through mosquitoes. The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for these processes however, remain largely unknown. We have identified two transcription factors (both belonging to the AP2 family) essential for gametocytogenesis. AP2-G mutants are characterised by a complete inability to produce gametocytes. In AP2-G2 mutants the gametocytaemia is very significantly reduced but not completely abolished. We have performed the microarray experiments in order to cokmpare the transcriptomes of these mutantnts to the WT parasites and between each other. As P.berghei parasites are characterised by asynchronous development in the rodent host, the different stage composition of the sample would impact the analysis. Therefore parasites were harvested and matured in in vitro to the schizont stage

DESIGN
Pairwaise comparison between the mutants and parental line was performed. 3 biological replicates of each condition were used.
