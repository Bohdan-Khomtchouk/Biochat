TITLE
Expression data from Zeb1 knockdown NM18 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differentiation of epithelial cells is strongly affected by transcription factors related to epithelial to mesenchymal-like progression. We used gene expression profiling to identify genes that are differentially regulated upon repression of the transcription factor Zeb1 (deltaEF1/Areb6).

DESIGN
NM18 cells were transfected with non-silencing siRNA (ns-siRNA) or siRNA targeting Zeb1 (Zeb1 siRNA) for 48h. Experiments were performed as independent biological triplicate. Three non-silencing siRNA samples (GSM1322708, GSM1322709, and GSM1322710) were originally deposited in Series GSE54715. The samples were reanalyzed with the Zeb1 siRNA samples and the data is linked at the bottom of the Series record.
