TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of embryonic zebrafish expressing a mutant TNNT2

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of embryonic zebrafish injected with a control morpholino or a morpholino that causes exclusion of TNNT2 exon 13.

DESIGN
Zebrafish embryos were injected with a antisense morpholino oligo that induced missplicing of exon 13 of TNNT2 (TNNT2sp) or a control morpholino. At 96hpf these embryos were euthanized and RNA was collected.
