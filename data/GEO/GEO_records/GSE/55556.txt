TITLE
Transcription factor Runx1 cooperates with MyoD and c-Jun to regulate the balance of myoblast proliferation/differentiation [Expression Study]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Runx1 is expressed in regenrating muscle, specifically in the muscle adult stem cells- the satellite cells. Its exact role and target genes were yet to be identified This experiment aimed at determining the Runx1 regulated genes in muscle regeneration, specifically in Satellite cells

DESIGN
To elucidate the Runx1-mediated transcriptional program involved in early stages of muscle regeneration, we compared gene expression profiles in WT and Runx1f/f primary myobalsts (PM). PM were purified from both genotypes , Total RNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix MoGene 1.0 ST  DNA array.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
