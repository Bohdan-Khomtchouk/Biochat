TITLE
Comparative miRNA Expression Profiles in Individuals with Latent and Active Tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the role of miRNAs in the transition from latent to active TB and to discover candidate biomarkers that may help predict TB progression, we have employed miRNA microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to probe the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with active TB, latent TB infection (LTBI), and healthy donors.Patients were recruited at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre (Shanghai, China) from December, 2008 to May, 2009. The diagnosis of active TB was based on clinical presentation, chest radiography, and acid-fast stain of sputum smear.All the patients were HIV negative, as diagnosed by the Livzon Anti-HIV1/2 EIA Kit (Livzon Pharmaceutical Group Inc., Guangdong, China). Additional tests were also performed to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) by using the Abbott AxSYM anti-HBsAg and HCV 3.0 antibody assay kit (Abbott Laboratories, Illinois) to exclude HBV- and HCV-positive patients (these 2 diseases are highly prevalent in China). Patients with a diabetes history were also excluded because diabetes could increase the risk of TB. Peripheral venous blood was drawn before treatment. Subjects with LTBI and healthy donors both without a history of clinical TB or other infectious diseases were recruited from the staff at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre. TST and IGRA (T-SPOTÂ®.TB, Oxford Immunuotec, Oxfordshire, U.K) results were used to distinguish the two groups. The LTBI group was TST-positive (TST > 10 mm) and IGRA-positive while the healthy donors were TST-negative (TST < 5 mm) and IGRA-negative.

DESIGN
RNA of PBMC from 6 patients with active TB, 6 donors with Latent TB, and 3 healthy controls (total of 15 biologically independent samples) were used to perform Agilent Human miRNA (version 3) microarray , No replicates were included
