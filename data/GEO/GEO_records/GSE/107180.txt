TITLE
Comprehensive analysis of Long non-coding RNA expression in dorsal root ganglion reveals cell type specificity and dysregulation following nerve injury [rodent DRG]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons provide connectivity between peripheral tissues and spinal cord. Transcriptional plasticity within DRG sensory neurons after peripheral nerve injury contributes to nerve repair but also leads to maladaptive plasticity, including the development of neuropathic pain. This study presents tissue and neuron specific expression profiling of both known and novel Long Non-Coding RNAs (LncRNAs) in rodent DRG following nerve injury. We have identified a large number of novel LncRNAs expressed within rodent DRG, a minority of which were syntenically conserved between mouse and rat and which including both- intergenic and antisense LncRNAs. We have also identified neuron type-specific LncRNAs in mouse DRG, and LncRNAs that are expressed in human IPS cell-derived sensory neurons. We show significant plasticity in LncRNA expression following nerve injury, which in mouse is strain dependant. This resource is publicly available and will aid future studies of DRG neuron identity and the transcriptional landscape in both na√Øve and injured DRG.
