TITLE
Dissection of the cis-2-decenoic signaling network in Pseudomonas aeruginosa using microarray technique

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
To identify the components of CDA signaling pathway in this pathogen, a comparative transcritpome analysis was conducted, in the presence and absence of CDA. Thereby, we identified 671 differentially expressed genes that were used to construct a gene regulatory network. GO analysis revealed that in P. aeruginosa, CDA mediates dispersion of biofilms through signaling pathways including enhanced virulence, persistence at different temperatures as well as multidrug and oxidative stress resistances.

DESIGN
Two onditions; Â±100 nmol CDA; One array with three hybridization blocks (3 technical repeats)

PLATFORM
GPL18681 CAT-3x20K-Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_PAO1-gene-layout-C3
