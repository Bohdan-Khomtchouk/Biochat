TITLE
A six-gene signature predicting breast cancer lung metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The lungs are a frequent target of metastatic breast cancer cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. All existing data were obtained either using statistical association between gene expression measurements found in primary tumors and clinical outcome, or using experimentally derived signatures from mouse tumor models. Here, we describe a distinct approach that consists to utilize tissue surgically resected from lung metastatic lesions and compare their gene expression profiles with those from non-pulmonary sites, all coming from breast cancer patients. We demonstrate that the gene expression profiles of organ-specific metastatic lesions can be used to predict lung metastasis in breast cancer. We identified a set of 21 lung metastasis-associated genes. Using a cohort of 72 lymph node-negative breast cancer patients, we developed a six-gene prognostic classifier that discriminated breast primary cancers with a significantly higher risk of lung metastasis. We then validated the predictive ability of the six-gene signature in 3 independent cohorts of breast cancers consisting of a total of 721 patients. Finally, we demonstrated that the signature improves risk stratification independently of known standard clinical parameters and a previously established lung metastasis signature based on an experimental breast cancer metastasis model. Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
We used microarrays to identify lung metastasis-related genes in a series of 23 patients with breast cancer metastases. No replicate, no reference sample.
