TITLE
Gene expression profile of healthy-donor peripheral monocytes, glioblastoma-patient peripheral monocytes, and glioblastoma-infiltrating myeloid cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression profile between healthy-donor peripheral monocytes and glioblastoma-patient peripheral monocytes as well as glioblastoma-patient peripheral monocytes with matched tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, 12 samples, including peripheral monocyte samples from 4 healthy donors, peripheral monocytes from 4 GBM patients and matched tumor-infiltrating macrophages extracted from the glioblastoma microenvironment, were used to acquire the mRNA expression (30,275 human genes) via the Phalanx Human Whole Genome OneArray Microarray v5.1 Platform.
