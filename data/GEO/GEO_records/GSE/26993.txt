TITLE
Comparable mRNA expression of pluripotency-related genes in SNUhES3 cells cultured on autofeeder or xenofeeder system

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
I developed a new culture system for hES cells; this system does not require supplementation with bFGF to obtain hES cells that are suitable for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. This culture system employed mesenchymal stem cells derived from hES cells (hESC-MSCs) as autologous human feeder cells in the absence of bFGF. For pluripotency-related gene expression profiling, a cDNA microarray analysis was performed

DESIGN
SNUhES3 cultured on the autofeeder hESC-MSCs layer maintained the undifferentiated state for 30 passages in a manner similar to the SNUhES3 cells on xenofeeder STO cell layer. To compare the pluripotency-related genes in SNUhES3 cells cultured on autofeeder or xenofeeder system, I used agilent one-color array. Two independant experiment performed.
