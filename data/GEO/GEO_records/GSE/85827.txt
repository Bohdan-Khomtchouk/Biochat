TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of OsFBK1 rice transgenics

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Rice transgenic plants of the F-box encoding gene, OsFBK1, in the Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1) variety have been found to display differences in the anther and root phenotypes. In order to elucidate changes at the transcriptome level, microarray of the roots of 14-day-old seedlings of over-expresseion (OE) and knock-down (KD) lines along with vector control (VC) and wild type (WT) were carried out.

DESIGN
Seedlings of OsFBK1-OE, OsFBK1-KD, VC and WT grown for fourteen days at 28Â±1oC . RNA from the roots were extracted from each sample and hybridized on rice Affymetrix microarrays. Two biological replicates of each sample were used for microarray analysis. Overall, eight samples were analyzed representing the transgenic lines and wild type.
