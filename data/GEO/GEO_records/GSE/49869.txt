TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of HL60 cells after 24h pulse of 10nM vincristine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of HL60 response to low-dose vincristine at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that population heterogeneity has functional consequences in drug response. Since the presence of discrete efflux^High and efflux^Low subpopulations may reflect transitions between distinct stable cellular states (attractor states), we measured the transcriptomes when the cell population exhibited a stable bimodal distribution. We also measured the transcriptomes for 17 days after washing the drug (samples 5 - 9).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HL60 cells untreated (sample 3), treated for 24h (sample 4) and sorted after 24h treatment for Calcein AM efflux low (sample 1) and high (sample 2). Sample 5 corresponds to total RNA of untreated cells, sample 6 to total RNA after 24h treatment with 10nM vincristine and samples 7 to 9 to total RNA after washing the drug.
