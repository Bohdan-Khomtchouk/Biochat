TITLE
Elimination of mitochondrial DNA variants by nuclear genome transfer in human oocytes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nuclear genome exchange between different oocytes results in efficient development and stem cell derivation. No differences in homozgyous CNVs were found between swaPS and pES lines. No differences in total copy number variations were found between the swaPS and pES lines.

DESIGN
DNA was isolated from cultured cells. Affymetrix SNP arrays were used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Copy number analysis was performed using NEXUS 6.0.
