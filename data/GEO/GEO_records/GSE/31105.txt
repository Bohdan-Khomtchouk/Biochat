TITLE
Chromatin Conformation Capture in two biological replicates of K562 cells to identify interactions between tRNA genes in human cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
tRNA genes are believed to form clusters in three-dimensional space in smaller eukaryotes (yeasts). In the course of investigating a cluster of tRNA genes for insulator activity in humans, we addressed whether these tRNA genes clustered with other tRNA genes. We used an anchor point to generate 4C material from a tRNA cluster located on chromosome 17 (hg18 7.962400 MB). We identify interactions occurring within the 300kb region of this point, but only extending in one direction and suggesting these interactions occur between this tRNA cluster and other tRNA gene clusters from this locus. We did not observed any specific interactions outside of this region or on other chromsomes, perhaps due to an low number of mappable reads from our samples.
