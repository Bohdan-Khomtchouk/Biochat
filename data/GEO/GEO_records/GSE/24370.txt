TITLE
Secreted Factors from Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm and Planktonic Cultures Differentially Impact Human Keratinocytes in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Interactions between human keratinocytes and secreted factors from Staphylococcus aureus biofilm were investigated using microarray analysis. Relative to control cells, biofilm-secreted factors upregulated cytokine and chemokine genes in keratinocytes. Genes associated with DNA damage and oxidative stress were also induced in keratinocytes treated with secreted factors from S. aureus. Here we show that secreted factors from S. aureus biofilm cultures differentially impact several aspects of wound healing processes.

DESIGN
Human keratinocytes were grown in co-culture with mature S. aureus biofilms for 24 hours.  Keratinocytes exposed to S. aureus biofilm were analyzed in quadruplicate. Control cells were also analyzed in quadruplicate. Dye-swaps were performed.
