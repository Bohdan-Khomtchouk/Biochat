TITLE
Arabidopsis ult1-3 mutant restored LFYasEMF1's phenotype

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis ult1-3 mutant was shown to rescue the phenotype of LFYasEMF1 to that of WT. We performed microarray analysis of 7-d-old and 15-d-old seedlings of WT, LFYasEMF1, ult1-3 and LFYasEMF1/ult1-3 grown under short day to study the underlie mechanism of this phenotypic rescuing.

DESIGN
Gene expression of 7 and 15 day old WT, LFYasEMF1, ult1-3 and LFYasEMF1/ult1-3 seedlings grown under short day condition were performed and compared.
