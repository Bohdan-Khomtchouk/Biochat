TITLE
C2C12 Myotubes in response to Palmitate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify mediators of obesity-linked reductions in PGC-1, we tested the effects of cellular nutrients in C2C12 myotubes.  While overnight exposure to high insulin, glucose, glucosamine, or amino acids had no effect, saturated fatty acids (FA) potently reduced PGC-1a and b mRNA expression. Keywords: Nutrient Effect
