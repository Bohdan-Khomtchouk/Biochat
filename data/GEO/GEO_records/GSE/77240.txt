TITLE
Metabolite and transcript profiling of VvERF045 OE transgenic lines elucidate the role of this transcription factor in the grapevine ripening physiology

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
We report the transcriptomic profile of L15, a transgenic line overexpressing VvERF045, and the WT as a reference. The main aim is to understand the function of this transcription factor in the  overall plant though the differences in the transcript abundance (RNA-seq)  and metabolite production. Total RNA from L15 and WT was sequenced with an average genome coverage of more than 100X.  Transcripts representing very different biological processes were grouped into ten major categories: protein phosphorilation, wax biosynthesis process, response to andogenous stimulus, cotyledonal vascular tissue/pattern formation, drug transmembrane transport stress, jasmonic acid biosynthesis, response to salt stress, defense response to bacterium, negative regulation. This transcription factor regulates genes involved in many different responses such as drought, sanility and defense suggesting it covers a key role into the plant, moreover into those processes also typical in ripening.

DESIGN
Total RNA profile of WT and overexpressing VvERF045 transgenic line were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate paired end with IlluminaHiSep2000. Each biological replicate is derived from pools from five independent in vitro grapevine plants.
