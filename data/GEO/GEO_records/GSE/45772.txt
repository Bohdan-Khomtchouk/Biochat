TITLE
Expression data from wild-type Vibrio fischeri and a flrA deletion mutant.

ORGANISM
Aliivibrio fischeri

SUMMARY
The marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri requires flagellar motility to undergo symbiotic initiation with its host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes. We sought to identify the genes activated by the sigma54-dependent flagellar master regulator, FlrA, in V. fischeri, thereby determining the flagellar regulon in this model symbiont.

DESIGN
We performed microarray analysis on wild-type Vibrio fischeri ES114 and a flrA deletion mutant, DM159, grown to mid-log phase in seawater tryptone, a condition in which cells are highly motile (two biological replicates per condition).

PLATFORM
