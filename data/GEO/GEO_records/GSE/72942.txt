TITLE
Global transcriptome profiling of the 482N1 mouse metastasis-derived cell line, with or without Arntl2 knockdown

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to determine the role of the transcription factor Arntl2 in regulating metastatic ability and identify Arntl2-dependent transcriptonal targets in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, we sequenced the mRNA from 3 mouse metastasis cell lines. Each of these cell lines (482N1shLuciferase, 482N1shArntl2#1, and 482N1shArntl2#2) were derived from the same parental cell line, 482N1. 482N1 was derived from a lymph node metastasis of a Kras LSL G12D, p53 flox/flox 129S1/SvlmJ mouse model of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. A comparison of shLuciferase and shArntl2 cell lines reveals Arntl2-dependent changes in the metastatic transcriptome.

DESIGN
This study includes 6 samples: 2 biological replicates of 482N1 shLuciferase, 2 biological replicates of 482N1 shArntl2#1, and 2 biological replicates of 482N1shArntl2#2. Poly-A RNA was isolated and prepared for sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq RNA kit (v2) to generate 100bp paired end reads. Reads were aligned to mm10.
