TITLE
Expression data from E. coli O157

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7

SUMMARY
Minimal processing using chlorinated water washes is a common practice in the fresh produce industry to reduce the microbial load and bacterial pathogens attached on produce surfaces. To evaluate if E. coli O157:H7 strains with different phyllogenetic backgrounds are equally sensitive or display variable resistance to chlorine treatment, we studied the expression profile of Sakai and one 2006 spinach outbreak strain (TW 14359) in response to chlorine and hydrogen peroxide treatment.

DESIGN
2 E. coli O157 strains are incubated with or without chlorine or H2O2 for 30 min for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to compare the expression profile between the 2 strains with or without oxidative stress.
