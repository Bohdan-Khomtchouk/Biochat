TITLE
Expression data from E. coli O157

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Minimal processing using chlorinated water washes is a common practice in the fresh produce industry to reduce the microbial load and bacterial pathogens attached on produce surfaces. To evaluate if E. coli O157:H7 strains with different phyllogenetic backgrounds are equally sensitive or display variable resistance to chlorine treatment, we studied the expression profile of Sakai and one 2006 spinach outbreak strain (TW 14359) in response to chlorine and hydrogen peroxide treatment.
