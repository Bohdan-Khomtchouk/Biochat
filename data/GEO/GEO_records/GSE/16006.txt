TITLE
MicroRNAs regulated by DAC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Aberrant expression of microRNA (miRNA) has been reported in various cancers. To clarify the role of miRNA in gastric carcinogenesis, we performed miRNA microarray analysis and investigated expressional changes of miRNAs in a 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC)-treated gastric cancer cell line, KATO-ІІІ.

DESIGN
A gastric cancer cell line KATO-III was daily treated with DAC for 72 h. MiRNAs up- or down-regulated by DAC was compared with unteated KATO-III. The list of all up-regulated miRNAs in KATO-III by drug treatment can be found in supplementary file, GSE16006_miRNA_list.txt, below.
