TITLE
HIGHLY DIVERSE TCRalpha CHAIN REPERTOIRE OF PRE-IMMUNE CD8+ T CELLS REVEALS NEW INSIGHTS IN GENE RECOMBINATION

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By sequencing tens of millions of TCRα chain transcripts from naïve mouse CD8+ T cells, we observed a hugely diverse repertoire, comprising nearly all possible TRAV-TRAJ combinations. Our findings are not compatible with sequential coordinate gene recombination, but rather with a model in which contraction and DNA looping in the TCRαδ locus provide equal access to TRAV and TRAJ gene segments, similar to that demonstrated for IgH gene recombination

DESIGN
High-throughput sequencing of entire TCRa repertoire from C57Bl/6 mice

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
