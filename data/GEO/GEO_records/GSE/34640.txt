TITLE
Gene expression changes in hepatic stellate cells in response to fibrogenic agents.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of hepatic stellate cells exposed to fetal bovine serum (FBS) (cultured alone and in the presence of Kupffer cells) activated and CCl4 exposure and Bile-duct ligation is characterized. Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 gene expression measurements were used to characterize the transcriptomic basis of the effects of the above treatments and genotypes on firbrogenesis.

DESIGN
Gene expression of mouse hepatic stellate cells was characterized under the following conditions: A. Quiescent (n=5). B. Activated by FBS (n=3). C. Cocultured with Kupffer cells and activated by FBS (n=3). D. Activate by bile-duct ligation (n=3). E. Activated by CCl4 (n=3).
