TITLE
Expression data from hMSC-TERT4 cells after during osteoblast differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentiation of human skeletal stem cells (hMSC) into osteoblasts is regulated by a few well described transcription factors. Our study used clustering and gene expression data to identify a novel transcription factor. ZNF25, which we showed is involved in osteoblast differentiation.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to study gene expression of hMSC-TERT4 cells after induction of osteoblast differentiation. Samples were taken at 0, 1, 7 and 13 days post induction of osteoblast differentiation.
