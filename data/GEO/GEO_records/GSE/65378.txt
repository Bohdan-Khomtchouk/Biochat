TITLE
Selective coregulator function for different steroid receptors and restriction of steroid receptor chromatin occupancy by Hic-5 (ER)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The estrogen receptor (ER) recruits many coregulators but not as well as GR? We investigate the relationship between ER and Hic5 and identify classes of genes that respond differently when cells are induced with hormone and when Hic5 is knocked down

DESIGN
We knock down Hic-5 (TGFB1I1) in U2OS cells using siRNA (siHic5) along with nonspecific siRNA (shNS) and assay gene expression changes at 3 different time points of hormone treatment.
