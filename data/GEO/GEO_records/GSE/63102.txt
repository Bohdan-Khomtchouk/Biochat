TITLE
MiRNA Expression Analysis of Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMNs) of the Pancreas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To discover a panel of mi(cro)RNAs that accurately differentiate between high-risk IPMN tissue (from pathologically-confirmed invasive or high-grade IPMN cases) and low-risk IPMN tissue (from pathologically-confirmed low-or moderate-grade IPMN cases).

DESIGN
In a discovery phase, genome-wide miRNA expression profiling was performed on 28 surgically-resected, pathologically-confirmed IPMNs (19 high-risk, 9 low-risk) using Taqman Low Density Arrays.  A validation phase was performed in 21 independent IPMNs (13 high-risk, 8 low-risk).  We also explored genes regulated by the identified miRNAs by integrating microarray expression data from 23 IPMNs.
