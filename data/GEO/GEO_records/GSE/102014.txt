TITLE
Gene co-expression networks identify Trem2 and Tyrobp as major hubs in human APOE expressing mice following traumatic brain injury.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine if there is an APOE isoform-specific response to TBI we performed controlled cortical impact on 3-month-old mice expressing human APOE3 or APOE4 isoforms. Following injury, we used several behavior paradigms to test for anxiety and learning and found that APOE3 and APOE4 targeted replacement mice demonstrate cognitive impairments following moderate TBI. Transcriptional profiling 14Â days following injury revealed a significant effect of TBI, which was similar in both genotypes.

DESIGN
Examination of the effectes of TBI on APOE expressing mice

PLATFORM
