TITLE
Sf9 induction with methoxyfenozide and methoprene

ORGANISM
Spodoptera frugiperda

SUMMARY
published at http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025708 Effect of hormone agonists on Sf9 cells : methoxyfenozide (Mtfz) and methoprene (Mtp)

DESIGN
We have 12 microarrays corresponding to 6 dye swaps , there is 3 biological replicates for each comparison. 6 microarrays: dye swap of 3 biological replicates corresponding to the comparison between Sf9 cell lines treatment with methoprene (Mtp) versus DMSO control treatment. And 6 microarrays: dye swap of 3 biological replicates corresponding to the comparison between Sf9 cell lines treatment with methoxyfenozide(mtfz) versus DMSO control treatment
