TITLE
Aging, microglia and cytoskeletal regulation are key factors in the pathological evolution of the APP23 mouse model for Alzheimerâ€™s disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aging is a key factor in Alzheimer's disease, but it's correlation with the pathology and pathological factors like amyloid-beta remains unclear In our study we aimed to provide an extensive characterisation of age-related changes in the gene expression profile of APP23 mice and controls and correlate these changes to pathological and symptomatic features of the model We found a clear biphasic expression profile with a developmental and aging phase. The second phase, particularly, displays aging features and similarties with the progression of Alzheimer pathology in human patients Processes involved in microglial activation, lysosomal processing, neuronal differantion and cytoskeletal regulation appear key factors in this stage. Interestingly, the changes in the gene expression profile of APP23 mice also seem to occur in control animals, but at a later age. The changes appear accelerated and/or exacerbated in APP23 mice.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of APP23 mice and wild-type control littermates aged 1.5, 6, 18 or 24 months. For all the age groups, samples of 3 mice of each genotype were analyzed
