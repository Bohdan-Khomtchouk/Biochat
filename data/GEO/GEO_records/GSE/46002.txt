TITLE
The response of Streptococcus pneumoniae to replication stress on the transcriptome of a wild-type strain

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae D39

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify the response of S. pneumoniae to HPUra-induced replication stress on transcriptional level in a wild type strain.

DESIGN
Two cultures were compared to each other. One treated with HPUra and one untreated. A dye-swap was included, and both the dye-swap and original labeling were repeated once as a technical replicate. The slide configuration also contained 3 replicate spots for each gene. This makes a total of 4 slides with 3 replicate spots per slide.
