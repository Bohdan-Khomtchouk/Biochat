TITLE
H3K27ac ChIP-Seq in REH and 697

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H3K27ac ChIP-Seq data of the B-ALL cell lines REH and 697 were obtained to find active regions in the genome and to correlate that with expression profiling  of lncRNAs in these cell lines.

DESIGN
ChIP-sequencing data was generated for H3K27ac in two B-ALL cell lines REH and 697.

PLATFORM
GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
