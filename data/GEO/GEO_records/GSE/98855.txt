TITLE
Immune repertoire after immunization as seen by next generation sequencing and proteomics

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We study the repertoire of immunoglobulin sequences after immunization in a cohort of rats. Animals were immunized with dinitrophenol modified KLH or with recombinant human HuD. In the immune reprtoire, and also in the matching proteomics data, we observe that the  animals produce a repertoire that has many shared motifs for those immunized with the same antigen. Cluster analysis allows the samples to be segregated according to the immunogen used.

DESIGN
5 animals were immunized with DNP-KLH and 5 animals were immunized with human recombinant HuD. The immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain was amplified from splenocyte cDNA, and sequenced with a 2x300bp paired end method
