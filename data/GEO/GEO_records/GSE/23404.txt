TITLE
Instability of Acetate Kinase Mutants and Their Effects on Acetyl Phosphate and ATP Amounts in Streptococcus pneumoniae

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pneumoniae

SUMMARY
Acetyl phosphate (AcP) is a small-molecule metabolite that can act as a phosphoryl group donor for response regulators of two-component regulatory systems (TCSs). Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) synthesizes AcP by the conventional pathway involving the phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase enzymes encoded by the pta and ackA genes, respectively. In addition, pneumococcus synthesizes copious amounts of AcP and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the pyruvate oxidase enzyme encoded by spxB. To access possible roles of AcP in pneumococcal TCS regulation and metabolism, we constructed combinations of spxB, pta, and ackA mutants and determined their ATP, AcP, and H2O2 production. Epistasis and microarray experiments were consistent with a role for the AcP biosynthetic pathway in basal-level phosphorylation of WalRSpn and possibly other response regulators involved in sensing cell wall status. However, this basal phosphorylation likely does not play an active physiological role in sensing in S. pneumoniae.
