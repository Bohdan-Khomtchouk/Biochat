TITLE
miRNA expression data from human cell lines (Panc1 cells)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The experiment aims to identify miRNAs that are regulated in response to TRAIL R1 si-RNA and TRAIL R2 si-RNA. The overall aim of the study was to identify mechanisms by which TRAIL death receptors may contribute to malignancy via inhibition of let-7 maturation.
