TITLE
Basal Epidermis from UVB-irradiated Mc1r and Kit mutants

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total RNA was extracted from the basal epidermis derived from UVB-irradiated P2.5 normal (Mc1r+/Mc1r+; Kit+/Kit+), Mc1r-mutant (Mc1re/Mc1re) and Kit-mutant (Kit/W-v/Kit/W-v) mice. Biological replicates (cy5) were labelled and co-hybridized with a reference RNA sample (cy3) to a 35K mouse cDNA microarray. A reference experiement design type is where all samples are compared to a common reference. Keywords: reference_design
