TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of histone modifications in   latently HIV-1 infected T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The epigenetic mechanisms established by histone modifications may affect the transcriptional silencing  of HIV-1 and viral latency. A systematic epigenome profiling could be applicable to develop new epigenetic diagnostic markers for detecting HIV-1 latency. In this study, histone modification profiles of HIV-1 latency cell lines were compared with those of uninfected CD4+ T cell line. The HIV-1 latency gave rise to differential histone modification regions. The differential enrichment patterns helped us to define potential effector genes leading to the viral latency.

DESIGN
The histone H3K4me3 and H3K9ac profiles were obtained from the HIV-1 latency cell lines (NCHA1, NCHA2, and ACH2) and control CD4+ T cell line (A3.01)
