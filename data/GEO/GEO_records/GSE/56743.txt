TITLE
RNA-seq profiling of microdissected rat renal tubule segments

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNAs from glomeruli and 14 different rat renal tubule segments collected by hand microdissection.

DESIGN
Collagenase-digested rat renal tubule segments were collected by hand microdissection. Poly(A)-mRNAs were captured from cell lysate and sequenced using paired-end protocol.
