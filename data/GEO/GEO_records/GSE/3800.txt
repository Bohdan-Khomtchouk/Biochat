TITLE
Comparison between na誰ve, tolerant and memory CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate transcriptional differences between na誰ve, tolerant and memory CD8+ T cells, genome-wide gene expression profiling was performed.  The indicated cell populations were purified from immunized or na誰ve Rag-/- TCR mice by cell sorting and RNA was extracted labeled and hybridized to an Affymetrix custom mouse array GNF1M GeneChip.  RNA from sorted samples was prepared, split into two aliquots prior to making labeled cDNA, so that two arrays were used for each cell population.Alterations in transcript levels were determined through pair wise comparisons of na誰ve cells to either memory or tolerant CD8+ T cells. Keywords: cell type

DESIGN
duplicates consisted of replicate aliquots of the same total RNA
