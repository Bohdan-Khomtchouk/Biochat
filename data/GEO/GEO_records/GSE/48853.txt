TITLE
Expression data of PGR isoforms, PRA and PRB, regulated genes in differentiating human endometrial stromal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
gene expression at 6h of differentiation of Human endometrial stromal cell expressing either or both of PRA and PRB

DESIGN
Endogenous PGR expression is silenced with siRNA mediated knockdown. Then, cells are transduced with adenovirus exressing flag tagged PRA or flag tagged PRB. Human endometrial stromal cell expressing one or both isoforms are treated with differentiation cocktail for 6h.
