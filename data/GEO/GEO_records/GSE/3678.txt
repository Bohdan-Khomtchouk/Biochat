TITLE
PTC versus paired normal thyroid tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we analyzed the gene expression profiles of 7 PTC samples compared to 7 paired normal samples using Affymetrix tools and dChip software. The objective was to find potential molecular markers for this disease Keywords: gene expression analysis

DESIGN
we used 7 PTC samples(tumor group) and 7 paired normal thyroid tissue samples (normal group)
