TITLE
Whole-genome hypothalamic transcriptome data collected from wild-type and ob/ob Pdyn-eGFP-RPL10a mice using BAC TRAP procedure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Prodynorphine-expressing neurons were targeted by eGFP-RPL10a, a transgene that is expressed under the control of the Pdyn promoter in a BAC containing the Pdyn backbone. Trangenic mice were made with FvB embryos via pro-nuclear injection. Transgene-positive progenies were bred to C57BL/6J for more than five generations before being used in the current experiment. Triplicates of 6-8 hypothalami were collected per sample from wild-type and ob/ob adult mice. Polysomal IP RNA and total Input RNA were purified from each sample.

DESIGN
Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse 430 2.0 arrays (900495) were used to identify transcripts that are specifically expressed in Pdyn neurons with a fold change (IP vs. Input) of > =2 in wild-type mice.  The same microarrays were also used to identify Pdyn-specific transcripts that are differentially regulated transcriptionally by leptin deficiency with a fold change (ob IP vs. wt IP) of > =1.5.
