TITLE
LncRNAs expression profiling in adipose tissues and during brown adipocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Brown and beige fats generate heat via uncoupled respiration to defend against cold, mechanistically, through the action of a network of transcription factors and cofactors. Here we globally profiled long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) gene expression during thermogenic adipocyte formation and identified Brown fat lncRNA 1 (Blnc1) as a novel nuclear lncRNA that promotes brown and beige adipocyte differentiation and function by forming a feedforward regulatory loop with EBF2 to drive adipogenesis toward thermogenic phenotype.

DESIGN
LncRNAs expression were measured in BAT and WAT from mice injected saline/CL and during brown adipocyte differentiation with two replicates using Arraystar Mouse LncRNA microarray V2.0
