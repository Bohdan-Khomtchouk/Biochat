TITLE
DNaseI sensitivity/hypersensitivity Part II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNaseI sensitivity/hypersensitivity using  DNase-array method (Sabo et al Nature Methods 3:511-18, 2006) on Affymetrix whole-genome tiling DNA microarrays.  Background:  Focal alteration in chromatin structure in vivo, detectable through hypersensitivity to DNaseI and other nucleases, is the sine qua non of diverse transcriptional regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, and locus control regions. Keywords: genomic
