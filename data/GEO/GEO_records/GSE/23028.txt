Analysis of Ppif-/- hearts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify differences in gene expression between peptidylprolyl isomerase F (cyclophilin D; Ppif)-null hearts and WT control hearts.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from mice 8 weeks of age to discover gene changes prior to myocardial dysfunction. Three replicates each of Ppif-/- and WT mice.
