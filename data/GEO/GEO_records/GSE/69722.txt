TITLE
piwi mutations and c-Fos overexpression on Drosophila ovarian germline

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This project aims to identify molecular effects of piwi mutations and c-Fos overexpression on the formation of Drosophila ovarian germline RNA-seq was utilized to compare transcript levels between wild type, piwi mutant, and c-Fos over-expressing ovarian tissues

DESIGN
Three biological replicate samples from wild type, piwi mutant, and c-Fos over-expression, were used.
