TITLE
Allele-specific mRNA expression experiment in lactis-wickerhamii and lactis-marxianus interespecies hybrids

ORGANISM
Kluyveromyces marxianus ; Kluyveromyces lactis ; Kluyveromyces wickerhamii ; Kluyveromyces lactis x Kluyveromyces wickerhamii ; Kluyveromyces lactis x Kluyveromyces marxianus

SUMMARY
This experiment was performed to measure differences in pathway-level evolution of cis-regulation between closely related Kluyveromyces species. Sequencing of mRNA as well as DNA was performed in hybrids of Kl. lactis with two other species, Kl. wickerhamii and Kl. marxianus. Cells were grown overnight for DNA sequencing and for 4-8h to an OD600=0.7-1.0 for mRNA sequencing. DNA and mRNA reads were mapped to hybrid genomes, multimapping reads discarded, and allele-specific expression ratio for each gene was calculated after first normalizing mRNA reads to the number of DNA reads for each gene in each species. We found that the ribosomal protein genes showed pathway-level allele-specific expression differences between species in both interspecies hybrids.
