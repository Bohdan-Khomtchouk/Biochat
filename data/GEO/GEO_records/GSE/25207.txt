TITLE
RIP-Chip Analysis of hnRNP K in Xenopus juvenile brain

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Cells use their wide variety of RNPs to integrate the expression of functionally inter-related proteins by forming RNP complexes with cis-elements that are shared among co-regulated RNAs. In this study, we identified the the associated mRNAs that co-precipitated with hnRNP K in developing juvenile frog brain.

DESIGN
three replicates of immunoprecipitation experiments for both hnRNP K and beta-galactosidase(control)
