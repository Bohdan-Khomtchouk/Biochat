TITLE
Epigenetic profiling of well differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma identifies H3K9me3 and Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) as determinants of aggressiveness in sarcoma (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the epigenomics of liposarcoma (LPS).  Here, we profiled the global expression of 9 epigenetic marks in well differentiated (WD) and dedifferentiated (DD) LPS from 151 patients and found increased H3K9me3 among DDLPS tumors.  We performed ChIP-seqÂ and gene expression profiling of patient derived cell lines to discover functionally significant regions of differential H3K9me3 enrichment between WDLPS and DDLPS associated with concomitant gene expression changes.

DESIGN
We performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of H3K9me3 in dedifferentiated liposarcoma DDLPS and well differentiated liposarcoma WDLPS cell lines.
