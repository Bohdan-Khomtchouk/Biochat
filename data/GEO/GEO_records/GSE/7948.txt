TITLE
In vitro modeling of primordial germ cell development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenic StellaGFP ESCs were used to derive primordial germ cells during embryoid body (EB) differentiation, and microarry analysis used to compared FACS sorted Stella-positive cells of day 7 Ebs with the parental ESCs and Stella-negative cells of day 7 Ebs. Keywords: in vitro, primordial germ cells, embryonic stem cells, stella

DESIGN
Four replicates of Stella-positive day 7 cells were compared to two replicates of stella-negative day 7 cells.  Also, there were three replicated of FACS sorted Stella-negative ESCs, two replicated of FACS-sorted Stella-postive ESCs, and two replicates of unsorted StellaGFP ESCs.
