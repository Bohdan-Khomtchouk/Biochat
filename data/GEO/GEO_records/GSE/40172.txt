TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Streptococcus mutans biofilms in response to cranberry proanthocyanidins

ORGANISM
Streptococcus mutans UA159

SUMMARY
The influence of cranberry proanthocyanidins on the transcriptomic responses of Streptococcus mutans during biofilm formation was investigated.

DESIGN
Treatment regimens simulating topical exposures experienced clinically (twice-daily, 60 s each) were used over saliva-coated hydroxyapatite biofilm model. Cranberry proanthocyanidins (1.5 mg/ml) in 15% ethanol was used to treat the biofilms. Four biological replicates each for the treatment and vehicle control were used for RNA extraction and microarray.
