TITLE
Effect of mir-210 over-expression on the miRNAome of human umbilical vein endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein-coding RNAs that are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and inhibit gene expression by regulating the stability and/or the translational efficiency of target mRNAs. miR-210 can be considered a master miRNA of hypoxic response and is currently regarded as a promising novel non-invasive tumor hypoxia marker. The targets identified to date indicate that miR-210 plays a role in cell cycle regulation, differentiation, mitochondrial metabolism repression, DNA repair and apoptosis. In order to identify miRNAs sub-sequentely modulated by miR-210, miRNA expression profiles of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) over-expressing miR-210 were generated, allowing the identification of miRNAs modulated upon miR-210 up-regulation.
