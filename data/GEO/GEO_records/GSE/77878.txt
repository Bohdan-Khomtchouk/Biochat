TITLE
Differential gene expression of T-cell lymphomas (TCL) upon engagement of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. GSE77875; GSE77876; GSE77877;

DESIGN
To study differential gene expression of TCLs upon TCR signaling, three TCL primary cells and one TCL cell line T8ML1 were chosen for this study. The prmiary TCL cells consist of TCL1 and TCL2 (sezary patients) and TCL3 (PTCL, NOS patient). The TCR signaling was engaged by anti-CD3/CD28 treatment in vitro. The TCL cells were treated without/with anti-CD3/CD28 for different time periods in vitro in cell culture. The total RNA was isolated from the TCLs and subjected to affimetry microarray (GPL17692) analysis. The differential gene expression of individual TCL was identified as well as a set of common genes invloved in TCR signaling in TCLs. The subject for this study includes pirmary cells isolated from three TCL patients [two sezary patients (TCL1 & TCL2) and one PTCL, NOS patient (TCL3)] and cells from a TCL cell line (T8ML1). The purity of isolated primary cells is > 93% as idnetified by flow cytometry. The TCLs were treated with/without anti-CD3/CD28 for different time points, with 2-3 replicates for each time point. Gene expression value was presented as Log2 transformed. Differntial expressed genes were identified by âˆ†log2x > 1 in comparison to no anti-CD3/CD28 treatment.
