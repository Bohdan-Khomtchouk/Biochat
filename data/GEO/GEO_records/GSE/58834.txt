TITLE
Widespread genetic epistasis among cancer genes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed NGS-based transcript profiling (RNA-seq) to profile transcripts that are expressed in MCF10A cells.  12,332 genes with FPKM > 1 were considered as expressed in MCF10A cells.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of MCF10A cells were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq 2000.
