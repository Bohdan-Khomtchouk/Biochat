TITLE
Expression analysis of circadian light response in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Light is a strong environmental cue that resets the circadian clock rhythm. We have used Affymetrix microarrays to profile the Drosophila  head transcriptome response following a brief light pulse during the early night. Comparison of control (un-pulsed) and experimental flies reveal large number of differentially expressed transcripts underlying the process of light entrainment of the clock.

DESIGN
Wild type flies exposed to light pulse at ZT15 compared to control group (no pulse)

PLATFORM
GPL1322 [Drosophila_2] Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 Array
