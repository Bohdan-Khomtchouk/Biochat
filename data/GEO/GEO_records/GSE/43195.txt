TITLE
Global expression analysis of miR-32/455/181a/181b overexpression or PI3K knockdown in KYSE30 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of the miRNA set (miR-32/455/181a/181b) on global gene expression. The hypothesis tested was that overexpression of these miRNAs would produce changes in gene expression similar to changes caused by PI3K knockdown. Data provided insight into genes that are disrupted with either individual miRNA and siRNA or the combination of miRNAs or siRNAs.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from KYSE30 cells transfected with either miRNA or siRNA for global expression analysis.
