TITLE
miRNA expression data from rhesus macaque testes: time course

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Small RNA including microRNA (miRNA) and Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) play important roles in germline maintenance and maturation in wide variety of species. Relatively little however is known about role played by miRNA in male germline maturation in humans and closely related primate species. Here we focused on rhesus macaques as a model species closely related to humans to study small RNA expression in testis samples throughout postnatal development and maturation. We observe clear transition in miRNA and piRNA expression resulting in the overall increase of piRNA expression levels and corresponding decrease in miRNA expression. Unexpectedly, this transition takes place at approximately one year of age – far earlier then rhesus macaque sexual maturation occurring at 4-5 years of age. Notably, contradictory to the overall trend of expression decline, a group of 29 miRNA showed marked expression increase in macaque testis at approximately five years of age – the time interval associated with sexual maturation.  Keywords: miRNA  piRNA Age Series

DESIGN
Rhesus macaque post-mortem testicle samples were collected. The age ranges of the indibiual in rhesus macaque covered the  whole life span fom newborn to death.
