TITLE
Transcriptional profile of aging human muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed expression of 81 normal muscle samples from humans of varying ages, and have identified a molecular profile for aging consisting of 250 age-regulated genes. This molecular profile correlates not only with chronological age but also with a measure of physiological age. We compared the transcriptional profile of muscle aging to previous transcriptional profiles of aging in kidney and brain, and found a common signature for aging in these diverse human tissues. The common aging signature consists of six genetic pathways; four pathways increase expression with age (genes in the extracellular matrix, genes involved in cell growth, genes encoding factors involved in complement activation, and genes encoding components of the cytosolic ribosome), while two pathways decrease expression with age (genes involved in chloride transport and genes encoding subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain). We also compared transcriptional profiles of aging in human to those of the mouse and fly, and found that the electron transport chain pathway decreases expression with age in all three organisms, suggesting that this may be a public marker for aging across species. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Human skeletal muscle samples of various ages (spanning 16-89 years) were surgically removed from patients and gene expression changes with age profiled using Affymetrix HU-133 2.0 arrays.  62 muscles were taken from the rectus abdominis; 19 were taken from various other regions of the anatomy.
