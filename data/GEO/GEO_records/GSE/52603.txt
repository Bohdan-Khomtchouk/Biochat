TITLE
Expression data from Control diet, Western diet and Western diet + DHA fed rats.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
LV hypertrophy is associated with Western diet consumption, while intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with anti-hypertrophic effects.  We treated rats for 12 weeks with either a Control diet, a Western diet or a Western + DHA diet.  For each of the 3 dietary treatments there were 2 pooled samples of heart tissue (with each pooled sample representing 5 rats) for a total of 6 arrays.  Microarray analysis identified 66 differentially expressed transcripts. Pathways were identified using Ingenuity and DAVID software. Array results from two pooled samples (5 rats in each pool) for n=10 per treatment group were used for comparisons.  Comparisons between Western vs. Control, Western + DHA vs. Control and Western + DHA vs. Western diets was subjected to analysis to generate log fold changes.

DESIGN
A dietary treatment of 12 weeks was used in an effort to produce LVH while limiting the development of comorbidities.  Microarray analysis was performed on pooled samples, followed by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Groups were Control, Western and Western + DHA. Comparisons between groups are expressed as LogFC (i.e. LogFC_WESvCTRL, LogFC_DHAVCTRL, LogFC_DHAvWES), available in Series supplementary files.
