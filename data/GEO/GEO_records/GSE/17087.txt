TITLE
SelT knockdown mouse fibroblast cells vs control cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in NIH 3T3 cells stably knockdown for Selt (GenBank accession number NM_001040396) using vector based siRNA technique in comparison to gene expression of vector transfected NIH 3T3 cells.

DESIGN
siSelT-1 construct (spanning nucleotides 205-224 of Selt, GenBank accession number NM_001040396) vs vector control; siSelT-5 construct (spanning nucleotides 971-989 of Selt, GenBank accession number NM_001040396) vs vector control; Two replicates per array for each oligos were carried out at different time points using RNA from different cultures of knockdown cells.
