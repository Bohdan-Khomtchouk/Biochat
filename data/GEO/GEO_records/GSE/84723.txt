TITLE
Expression analysis of ovarian cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this analysis is  searching the target gene of miR-135a-3p in ovarian cancer cell line. The gene expression of cell line with overexpressed miR-blank or miR-135a-3p was compared.

DESIGN
Three ovarian cancer cell lines were enrolled this study. Those cells were transfected with miR-blank as control or miR-135a-3p.
