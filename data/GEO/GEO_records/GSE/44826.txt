TITLE
MicroRNA sequence and expression analysis of rat liver tissue exposed to aflatoxin B1 by deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We report the application of illumina deep sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of microRNA in aflatoxin B1 treated rat liver tissue, as well as normal liver tissue. miRNAs of miR-17-92 cluster, thought to be tumor activating miRNAs, were down-regulated. miR-34a, considered to be a tumor suppressor, was up-regulated.Novel miRNAs and miRNA base alteration caused by SNP or editing were predicted and summarized.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 microRNA profiles in 2 liver tissues under different treatments.
