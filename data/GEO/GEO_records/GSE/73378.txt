TITLE
Whole blood gene expression profiles of patients with a past aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression profiles in blood of previous aSAH patients, aiming to gain insight into the pathogenesis of IA and aSAH, and to make a first step towards improvement of aSAH risk prediction. The results indicate that no gene expression differences are present in blood of previous aSAH patients compared to controls, besides one differentially co-expressed gene network without a clear relevant biological function.

DESIGN
We collected peripheral blood of 119 patients with aSAH at least two years prior, and 118 controls. We determined gene expression profiles using Illumina HumanHT-12v4 BeadChips. After quality control, we divided the dataset in a discovery (2/3) and replication set (1/3), identified differentially expressed genes, and applied (co-)differential co-expression to identify disease-related gene networks.
