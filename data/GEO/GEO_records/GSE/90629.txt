TITLE
Isolation of Mex3a / Lgr5 cell population in mouse small intestine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Proximal mouse small intestine from mice bearing the Lgr5 GFP/+ and Mex3a Tom/+ alleles were used to obtain single cell preparations. Cells were selected for GFP expression and different levels of tdTomato were defined. Sorted cells were lysed and processed for transcriptomic analysis

DESIGN
6 populations (Mex3a-high Lgr5-high; Mex3a-low Lgr5-high; Mex3a-neg Lgr5-high; Mex3a-high Lgr5-low; Mex3a-low Lgr5-low; Mex3a-neg Lgr5-low) were obtained from two biological replicates for analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL11180 [HT_MG-430_PM] Affymetrix HT MG-430 PM Array Plate
