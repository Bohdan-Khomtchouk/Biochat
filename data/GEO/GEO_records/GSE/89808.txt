TITLE
Sorting zebrafish thrombocyte lineage cells with a Cd41 monoclonal antibody enriches hematopoietic stem cell activity

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The goal of the experiment was to determine the transcriptional expression profile of zebrafish thrombocytes in order to enable comparison with mouse and human platelets.

DESIGN
Thrombocyte isolation from Tg(cd41:EGFP) zebrafish peripheral blood was performed using a novel monoclonal antibody (3H9) to Cd41
