TITLE
Expression data from H295R cells in basal conditions/overexpressing SF-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SF-1 is a nuclear receptor transcription factor playing a key role in adrenogonadal development and in adrenocortical tumorigenesis when overexpressed. We studied gene expression profiles using Affymetrix microarrays in the H295R/TR SF-1 adrenocortical cancer cell line, where SF-1 expression can be increased in a doxycycline-dependent manner (Mol. Endocrinol. 21: 2968â€“2987, 2007)

DESIGN
H295R/TR SF-1 cells were cultured either in basal conditions or with doxycycline (Dox) added to the culture medium for 72 hours. RNA was extracted and hybridized to HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix microarrays.
