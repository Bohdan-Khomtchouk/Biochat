TITLE
Transcriptome signature of WT and C3ar1-/-C5ar1-/- splenic DCs in response to CpG

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our  group showed that DC-instrinsic C3ar1/C5ar1 signals are required for TLR-initiated DC maturation in vivo. To more broadly analyze how local complement signaling affects DC maturation process in response to TLR9 stimulation, WT  or C3ar1-/-C5ar1-/- mice were stimulated with CpG (i.v. 100 micrograms) or vehicle control. 4hrs later, splenic CD11c+DCs were isolated and RNAs from the cells were purified for microarray analyses.

DESIGN
The experiment include samples from WT unstimulated DCs (n=2), WT CpG-stimulated DCs (n=3), C3ar1-/-C5ar1-/- unstimulated DCs (n=2), and C3ar1-/-C5ar1-/- CpG-stimulated DCs (n=3).
