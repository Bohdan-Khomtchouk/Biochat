TITLE
RNA-seq profiling of lung adenocarcinoma and paired normal tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze transcriptome data for the mouse xenograft cells derived from a human lung adenocarcinoma patient, reference RNA-seq data were generated for the tracking of gene expression changes associated with the xeno-engraftment and culture.

DESIGN
RNA-seq data were generated as a supplementary to GSE69405. The data include RNA-seq of patient normal tissue (matched normal, mN) and of mouse xenograft tissue (xenoT) of the lung adenocarcinoma.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
