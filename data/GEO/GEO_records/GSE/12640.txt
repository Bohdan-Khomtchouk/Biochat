TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of small RNA transcriptomes in Locusta migratoria

ORGANISM
Locusta migratoria

SUMMARY
All the reports on insect small RNAs come from holometabolous insects. However, small RNAs of hemimetabolous insects have not yet been investigated.Study of hemimetabolous insect small RNAs could provide more insights into evolution and function of small RNAs in hemi- and holometabolous insects. The locust is an important, economically harmful hemimetabolous insect and its phase changes is an interesting phenomenon.Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to characterize and compare the small RNA transcriptomes of gregarious and solitary phases in locusts. We found abundant small RNAs and their different expression profiles in the two phases.

DESIGN
Small RNAs were sequenced from gregarious and solitary phases of Locusta migratoria,respectively.
