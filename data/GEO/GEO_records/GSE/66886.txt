TITLE
The INO80 chromatin remodeling complex regulates the gene expression (no stress)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA micro array analyses were performed using Arp5-, Arp8-knockout and Arp8-over expression Nalm-6 cells. As a result, various gene were up- or down-regulated in both Arp5- and Arp8-knockout cells. Because of these Arps are essential and specific component of the INO80 complex, it was quite possible that the INO80 complex was related to these gene expression.

DESIGN
The gene locus of Arp5 and Arp8 were disrupted by homologous recombination. In the case of Arp8-knockout cells, Arp8 over expression was caused by tetracycline-regulated (Tet-Off) system incorporation. Total RNAs were extracted and subjected to microarray analysis.
