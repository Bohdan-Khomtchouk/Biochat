TITLE
Expression data from rat lung-resident mesenchymal stem cells and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat lung-resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR-MSCs) were isolated via bronchoalveolar lavage from fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10) pretreated lungs. We characterized the similarity and diversity between LR-MSCs and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) by transcriptional profiling of these two types of cells. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from LR-MSCs and BM-MSCs cultured under similar conditions at passage 5. These data are used to obtain genes that are differentially expressed by these two types of cells.

DESIGN
6 Total samples were analyzed. Both LR-MSCs and BM-MSCs are in three replicates.
