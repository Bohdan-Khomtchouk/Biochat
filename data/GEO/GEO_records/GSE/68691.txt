TITLE
Human TNBC Cells 72h Treatment with 4.5nM OTSSP167 MELK Inhibitor vs. DMSO Control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray comparing TNBC cells treated for 72 hours with OTSSP167 MELK Inhibitor and control (DMSO)

DESIGN
Two-condition arrays: MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with either 4.5nM OTSSP167 MELK Inhibitor or 0.045% DMSO for 72h. Two biological replicates, one per array, with a dye swap (technical replicate).
