TITLE
Gene expression analysis in human colon cancer cells and liver cancer cells with FoxA knockdown.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FoxA transcription factors are involved in development and tumorigenesis of the gastrointestinal tract. However, the downstream programs controlled by FoxA factors remain poorly understood. The goal of this study is to understand the transcriptional responses regulated by FoxA proteins in liver and colon cancer cells.

DESIGN
Human liver cancer cell line HepG2 and colon cancer cell line LS174T infected with lentivirus expressing shRNAs targeting human FoxA1 and FoxA2.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
