TITLE
Frozen tumour samples of 131 gastric cancer patients [array CGH]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sought to illustrate molecular subtypes associated with clinical prognosis and to identify genetic aberrations for potential targeted therapeutics through comprehensive whole-genome analysis of 131 Chinese gastric cancer tissue specimens using whole-genome array CGH.

DESIGN
We profiled 131 Chinese gastric cancer genomes using Agilent 244K array CGH technology.   70 samples Among them were further profiled by Affymetrix Hu133Plus2 arrays for mRNA expression.
