TITLE
Gene array analysis of primary mouse calvaria osteoblasts without differentiation, with differentiation, or with differentiation plus cabozantinib (XL184)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed a gene array analysis using RNAs prepared from undifferentiated, differentiated, or differentiated + cabozantinib (XL184) treated osteoblasts.

DESIGN
Calvarial mouse osteoblasts were prepared from 2-5 day old newborn mice. Osteoblasts were cultured in MEM+10% FBS until confluence (undifferentiated osteoblasts, samples C1 and C2).  Confluent osteoblasts were cultured in differentiation medium for 30 days (differentiated osteoblasts, samples D1 and D2). Confluent osteoblasts were cultured in differentiation medium plus cabozantinib (XL184) for 30 days (sample X1 and X2).
