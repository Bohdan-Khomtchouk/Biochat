TITLE
Assessing the mutagenic and estrogenic effect potential of pharmaceuticals and of their transformation products. Implications in the gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mixtures of diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and ofloxacin and their photolysed mixtures were evaluated for their mutagenicity and estrogenicity. Implications in the gene expression profiling were evaluated as well Microarrays were used to understand the effects of exposure to mixtures of pharmaceuticals as contaminants of emerging concern

DESIGN
For a better understanding of photolabile pharmaceuticals, human breast cancer cells T47D-KBluc were exposed to a mixture of diclofenac (50uM), sulfamethoxazole (50uM) and ofloxacin (50uM). A part of the setup was irradiated with UV-Light for 15 minutes to test the reaction of possible created products.
