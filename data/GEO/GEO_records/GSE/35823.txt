TITLE
Expression data from Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) Tax-transfected HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) Tax is a transcriptional activator of viral replication and a key contributor to oncogenic potential. We previously identified interesting mutant forms of Tax with elevated (TaxD247G) or reduced (TaxS240P)  transactivation effects on BLV replication and propagation. In this study, to identify genes that play a role in the cascade of signal events regulated by wild-type and mutant Tax proteins, we used a large-scale host cell gene-profiling approach.

DESIGN
HeLa cells transiently transfected with the pCAGGS vector for the control sample was compared with HeLa cells transiently transfected with the pCAGGS-Tax-FLAG vector. These cells were incubated for 30h after transfection and total RNA was isolated.
