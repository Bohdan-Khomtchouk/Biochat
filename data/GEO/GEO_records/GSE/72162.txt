TITLE
Gene expression data from Zeb2WT, Zeb2KO, T-betWT and T-betKO effector CD8+ T cells during infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ZEB2 is a multi-zinc-finger transcription factor known to play a significant role in early neurogenesis and in EMT-dependent tumor metastasis. While the function of ZEB2 in T lymphocytes is unknown, activity of the closely related family member ZEB1 has been implicated in lymphocyte development. Here, we find that ZEB2 expression is upregulated by activated T cells, specifically in the KLRG1hi effector CD8+ T cell subset. Loss of ZEB2 expression results in a significant loss of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells following primary and secondary infection with a severe impairment in the generation of the KLRG1hi effector-memory cell population. We show that ZEB2, which can bind DNA at tandem, consensus E-box sites, regulates gene expression of several E-protein targets and may directly repress CD127 and IL-2 in CD8+ T cells responding to infection.  Furthermore, we find that T-bet binds to highly conserved T-box-sites in the ZEB2 gene and that T-bet and ZEB2 regulate similar gene-expression programs in effector T cells, suggesting that T-bet acts upstream and through regulation of ZEB2. Taken together, we place ZEB2 in a larger transcriptional network that is responsible for the balance between terminal differentiation and formation of memory CD8+ T cells.

DESIGN
Zeb2WT, Zeb2KO, T-betWT and T-betKO effector CD8+ T cells were sorted into Trizol at day 6 of infection. Two or more replicates per sample were analyzed
