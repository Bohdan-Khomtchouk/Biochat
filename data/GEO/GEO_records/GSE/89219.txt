TITLE
Global transcriptional profiling of HEK293 cells transfected with ATFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and mouse iPS cells derived with artificial transcription factors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We tested various architectures of artificial transcription factors (ATFs) in HEK293 cells to test the contribution of the interaction domain, nuclear localization domain, size of DNA-binding domain, and activation domain. Then we made a genome-scale ATF library and tested it in reprogramming mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Three combinations of ATFs (C2, C3, and C4) could induce pluripotency when expressed with Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. We harvested polyadenylated RNAs from 11 cell types derived with different sets of factors. The transcriptional profiles of ATF-induced iPS cells are similar to that of iPS cells induced with Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc and mouse embryonic stem cells, exhibiting up-regulation of pluripotency markers and down-regulation of fibroblast markers. Comparisons of cells undergoing reprogramming at an intermediate stage before becoming fully reprogrammed suggest that ATFs activate a different set of genes than the set activated by Oct4. This study provides a proof-of-principle that a gene-activating ATF library can be used to identify cell fate-defining transcriptional networks in an unbiased manner.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from HEK293 cells from 5 different conditions (n=1), and poly-adenylated transcripts were sequenced. Total RNA was collected from 11 different mouse conditions (n=3 or 4), and poly-adenylated transcripts were sequenced.
