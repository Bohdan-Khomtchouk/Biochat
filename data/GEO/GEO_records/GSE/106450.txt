TITLE
Histone exchange assay in loss of DOT1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Strain background is Saccharomyces cerevisiae wzy42 histone mutant strain with pWZ403 Myc-HHT2-HHF2 plasmid and pGAL1/10 FLAG-HHT1-HHF1 integrated gene. Cells were grown in YP+2% raffinose until mid-log (OD600=0.5) and arrested with alpha factor. When most of Cells were in G1 phase, added galactose (final conc. 2%) and harvested cells after 1 hour. Fixed cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 Celcius degrees and the cell pellets were washed by 15mL of pH7.5 TBS buffer per a conical tube. ChIP cells were disrupted by glass bead vortexing in ChIP lysis buffer and sonicated by Sonic Dismembrator Model 500, Fisher Scientific. Sonicated soluble lysate were immunoprecipiated by FLAG antibody (F1804; Sigma).

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq, mRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and MNase-seq samples in wild-type (WT) and various mutants were prepared using Saccaromyces cerevisiae.

PLATFORM
GPL17342 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
