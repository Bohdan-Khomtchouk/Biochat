TITLE
Evolution at two regulatory levels in yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Saccharomyces paradoxus ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces paradoxus

SUMMARY
Ribosome profiling performed on interspecific hybrids of Sacharromyces cerevisiae and S. paradoxus in order to identify allele-specific expression indicative of cis-regulatory divergence at the level of mRNA abundance and protein translation.

DESIGN
Two biological replicate libraries sequenced from ribosome protected fragments as well as poly-A-selected mRNA of hybrids in addition to one biological replicate library of poly-A selected mRNA from each parental strain.
