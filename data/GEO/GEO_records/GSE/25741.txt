TITLE
Gene expression profile of FOXM1 with Doxorubicin in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription factors (TFs) play a crucial role in diverse cellular physiology by controlling down-stream target genes. It has been well recognized that TFs are attractive target for treating human cancer since transcriptional activity or gene expression level of TFs can be directly modulated. To explore which TF functions as survival factor in human breast cancer, we applied gene expression data sets for survival analysis. We identified that FOXM1 is a potent oncogenic survival factor out of eleven TFs. Loss of FOXM1 function leads to breast cancer cells more sensitized to Doxorubicin (Dox). To investigate how FOXM1 sensitizes cancer cell in the presence of Dox, we carried out gene expression array experiment to monitor how down-stream target genes are changed by FOXM1. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with siLuc or siFOXM1. Thirty six hours later, cells were incubated with Dox (5micro mol) for 36 hrs.
