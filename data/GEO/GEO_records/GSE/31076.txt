TITLE
L. plantarum grown in a variety of different fermentation conditions

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum

SUMMARY
Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 was differentially fermented in 29 different fermentations according to a factorial, combinatorial scheme that included variations in growth temperature (28 or 37C), NaCl concentration (0 or 0.3M), pH (5.2, 5.8, 6.4), as well as oxygen (N2 or air) and amino acid availability (1.1 or 2x concentration).

DESIGN
Samples were hybridized in a star design using five samples in the center all connected to each other. The remaining samples were linked (evenly distributed) to the samples in the inner circle in a loop design with additional links (shortcuts) to the center sample. All samples were hybridized in duplicate (at minimum) using each of the two dyes (Cy3/Cy5) at least once per sample.
