TITLE
Gene expression profiling of HDAC3-depleted mouse liver rescued with wild-type exogenous HDAC3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have shown that intravenous injection of HDAC3 floxed mice with adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing Cre depletes hepatic HDAC3, upregulates lipogenic gene expression, and causes fatty liver. When AAV-Flag-HDAC3 wild-type (WT) is co-injected along with AAV-Cre, the exogenous HDAC3 is expressed at endogenous levels and can completely rescue fatty liver phenotype. Here we profile transcriptome of the rescued WT livers in comparison with HDAC3-depleted (KO) livers.

DESIGN
4-months old C57BL/6 male mice were co-injected with AAV-Cre or AAV-Cre plus AAV-Flag-HDAC3. Mice were fed ad libitum and harvested at 5 pm (ZT10) at 2-weeks post-injection. Liver total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0ST array.
