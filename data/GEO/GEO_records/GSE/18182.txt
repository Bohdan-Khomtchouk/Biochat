TITLE
Expression profile of lung adenocarcinoma, A549 cells following targeted depletion of non metastatic 2 (NME2/NM23 H2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-metastatic 2 (NME2) is an established metastases suppressor in multiple human cancer types. However, the molecular mechanisms of NME2 action remain insufficiently resolved. We recently validated the transcription regulatory activity of NME2 with respect to control of proto-oncogene c-MYC expression. We hypothesized that large scale transcriptional potential of NME2 may be at the core of metastases suppression by NME2. Using a combination of high throughput genomic assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to promoter array hybridization (ChIP-chip) and gene expression profiling, we characterized the transcriptional roles of NME2. Specifically, we found a set of NME2 target genes which changed expression upon selective depletion of NME2 in a lung cancer cell line, A549. The analysis of gene expression suggested control of various biological pathways esp. cell adhesion and apoptosis by NME2 target genes which could be important in regulation of metastases.

DESIGN
For transcriptome analysis, total RNA was purified from A549 cells transiently silenced for NME2 (siRNA duplex against NME2/ NM23 H2(Santa Cruz)) or transfected with control siRNA duplexes. Isolated RNA was converted to cDNA, transcribed in vitro to synthesize biotinylated cRNA, and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip oligonucleotide microarrays, according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Three biological replicates were averaged and significance analysis performed using GCOS (P < 0.005 of fold change).
