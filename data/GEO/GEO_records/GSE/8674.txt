TITLE
Influence of nalidixic acid on gene expression of Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The intention of this study is to analyse the effect of antibiotics on the gene expression of Escherichia coli. Shaking-flask cultivations of Escherichia coli K12GFP-UTL2 were carried out with a medium containing nalidixic acid. Cultures with antibiotic-free medium, which were run in an identical way, served as reference. Samples were taken at different times during the cultivations, the RNA was isolated and hybridised on whole genome yeast microarrays. Keywords: Influence of toxins on gene expression in E. coli

DESIGN
A timeserial experiment of the influence of nalidixic acid on the gene expression in Escherichia coli was performed. Effects of the growth curve were eliminated by bionformatic methods.

PLATFORM
GPL534 MWG E. coli K12 Array
