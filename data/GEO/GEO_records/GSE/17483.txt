TITLE
Stat5-regulated gene expression in human prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription factor Stat5 is constitutively active in human prostate cancer but not in normal prostate epithelium. Stat5 activation is associated with prostate cancer lesions of high histological grades, and is present in the majority of castration-resistant recurrent human prostate cancers. The molecular mechnisms underlying constitutive activation of Stat5 in primary and recurrent human prostate cancer are currently unclear. We used microarrays to detail gene expression regulated by Stat5 in human prostate cancer cells.

DESIGN
DU145 human prostate cancer cells were transfected with Stat5a/b siRNA or scramble siRNA as control. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and total RNA was prepared for Affymetrix microarrays.
