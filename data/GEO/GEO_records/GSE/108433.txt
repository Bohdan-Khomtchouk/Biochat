TITLE
PRMT5 mediated H4R3sme2 confers cell differentiation in Pediatric Acute B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of PRMT5 in human leukemic cells, microarray analysis was performed in NALM6 cell. Upon PRMT5 knockdown, 40 genes were highly expressed and 18 genes were downregulated (cut off fold induction > 0.8 or < -0.8, P < 0.05). Potential target genes of PRMT5 were screened in B-ALL cells by microarray, and identified  in B-ALL cells by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and chromatin immunoprecipitation.

DESIGN
To identify genes that are regulated by PRMT5 in B-ALL cells, we performed microarray analysis in NALM6 cells with PRMT5 knockdown (sh-PRMT5) by sh-RNA transiently transfected, and sh-Luc was used as control.  n = 3 for each condition.
