TITLE
Total RNA sequencing of ovary tissues at 49 days post coitus in Large White and Meishan pigs.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We collected the ovary samples at 49 days post coitus in Large White and Meishan adult female pigs, identified the differentially expressed protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs between these two breeds. three individuals of each breed were harvested as biological replicates.

DESIGN
Identification of differentially expressed protein-coding genes and long non-coding RNAs in ovary at 49 days post coitus between Large White and Meishan pigs.
