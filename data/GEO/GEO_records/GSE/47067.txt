TITLE
In Vivo Endothelial Cell Heterogeneity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Endothelial cells from nine steady state tissues and two regenerating tissues (bone marrow and liver) were intravitally labeld, isolated via flow sorting, and immediately processed for RNA extraction. When of sufficient quality, the RNA was amplified and hybridized.  For comparison, Human Emybryonic Stem Cell-derived Endothelial cells (hESC-ECs) were differentiated and isolated based on similarities to the adult mouse counterparts.

DESIGN
Endothelial cells were labeled via intravitally labeling of the vascular bed 8 minutes prior to sacrifice with minimally three markers to identify endothelial cells followed by flow sorting.
