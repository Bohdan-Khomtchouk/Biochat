TITLE
Blood Gene Expression Signatures Predict Invasive Candidiasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Focusing on host response to infection, we utilized a murine model to develop a  blood gene expression signature that accurately classified mice with candidemia and distinguished candidemia from S. aureus bacteremia.  Validation of the signature was achieved in an independent cohort of mice.

DESIGN
BALB/c male mice were injected with either normal saline, C.albicans, or S.aureus and sacrificed at pre-set time points of 24, 48, 72-96 hrs (Infection Duration).  Blood was placed in RNA Later (R) for RNA expression analysis and the right kidney collected for analysis of pathogen burden.
