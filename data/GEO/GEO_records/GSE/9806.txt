TITLE
A Time Course Analysis of the Effects of Marinobufagenin in Human Dermal Fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of the effets of marinobufagenin in a time-course study (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 24 hrs) to examine the temporal changes in gene expression in a human dermal fibroblast cell line. Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Cells were treated with 10 nM of marinobufagenin (MBG) for the following times: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 24 hrs, and then cells were harvested for RNA isolation for gene expression analysis.
