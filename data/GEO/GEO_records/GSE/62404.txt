TITLE
Profiling of serum microRNAs in children with atopic dermatitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease in children characterized by dermatitis and pruritus. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown as great potential biomarkers for disease fingerprints to predict prognostics. We aimed to identify miRNA signature from serum and urine for the prognosis of AD patient by genome-wide miRNA profiling analysis.

DESIGN
Serum from 8 children with AD and 8 healthy children were collected

PLATFORM
GPL9460 Applied Biosystems Human TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA, v1.0)
