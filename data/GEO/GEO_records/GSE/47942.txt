TITLE
Dispersal, flight metabolism and gene expression in the Glanville fritillary butterfly

ORGANISM
Melitaea cinxia

SUMMARY
We have measured flight effect in gene expression using individual-based RNA-seq data from two regional populations of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). Largest number of differentially expressed genes were between populations (3840 genes) and between males and females (1622 genes). 801 genes had significant flight effect. Enriched GO and KEGG categories among these genes included hypoxia, glycolysis, and TCA cycle.

DESIGN
RNA-seq from thorax, 85 individuals from two populations in four groups (Flight and Control at two time points 1h and 20h). Populations 'AL' and 'PT' refer to two islands in Baltic Sea. 'AL' stands for Ã...land and 'PT' stands for Pikku TytÃ¤rsaari.
