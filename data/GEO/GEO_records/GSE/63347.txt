TITLE
DNA methylation profiles of brain samples from Down Syndrome subjects and controls.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 486,000 CpGs. Dataset included 71 samples from multiple brain regions (cerebellum, temporal/occipital/frontal cortex). The goal was to evalute the effect of trisomy 21 on DNA methylation levels and epigenetic age. Explanation of characteristics variables in supplementary file Explanation_of_characteristic_variables2.docx

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 71 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome status) was related to CpGs.
