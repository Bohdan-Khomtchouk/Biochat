TITLE
Gene expression profiling associated with knockdown of RNF20 in human normal and malignant lung epithelial cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to display differential gene expression profiling in one lung epithelial cell BEAS2-B, and three lung cancer cell lines A549, H1299, H460 cells upon knockdown of RNF20, by using RNAseq technology.

DESIGN
RNF20 was first attenuated in duplicated normal lung epithelial cell BEAS2-B, and three lung cancer cell lines A549, H1299, H460 by siRNA-mediated knockdown. Total RNA was extracted from duplicated cancers cells transfected with two independent control siRNA (Ctrl1/2) and RNF20 specific siRNAs (RNF1/2) at 72h post-transfection for RNAseq analysis. Differentially expressed genes in RNF20-attenuated lung epithelial cells were identified in comparison to that in cells transfected with control siRNA.
