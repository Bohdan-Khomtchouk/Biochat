TITLE
Characterization of gene expression of tumor infiltrating T cells (TILs) in previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) compared with those of tonsils

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It has been shown that tumor infiltrating immune cells have a profound impact on the outcome of FL. To find mechanisms whereby TILs are altered gene expession analysis of highly pure TILs were performed.

DESIGN
The study is composed of 4 groups, FL CD4 (n=12), FL CD8 (n=9), Tonsil CD4 (n=7) and Tonsil CD8 (n=7). All FL patients were treatment naive. Cells were flowsorted from cryopreserved single cell suspensions and purity of cells were at least 95%.
