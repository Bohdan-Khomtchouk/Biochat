TITLE
MODD mediates deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 to negatively regulate ABA signaling and drought resistance in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Responses to drought in rice are regulated by transcription factor OsbZIP46 via ABA signaling. This work characterizes a protein MODD that negatively regulates OsbZIP46 activity and stability through HDAC-related chromatin remodeling and OsPUB70-mediated ubiquitination, respectively, to fine tune ABA signaling and drought resistance.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in modd mutants and wild type plants under normal condition.
