TITLE
Analysis of Pro-Inflammatory Gene Activation and RNA Processing by RNAseq of Nascent Transcripts [supplement]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Note: These datasets are in supplement to, but separate from, Geo GSE32916. We examined pro-inflammatory gene activation in activated wildtype and IFNAR-/- murine macrophages by performing RNA-Seq with poly(A) enriched transcripts. This experimental strategy allowed a global, high-resolution analysis of the transcriptional regulation of diverse classes of co-expressed genes and allowed us to identify co-expressed gene classes that may depend on IFN-signaling for its expression. The results provide quantitative insights into the relationship between transcription and distinct promoter and chromatin properties.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of poly(A) enriched RNA from five stimulation time-points in wildtype and IFNAR-/- macrophages

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
