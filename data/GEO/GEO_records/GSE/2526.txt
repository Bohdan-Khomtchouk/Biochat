TITLE
30MPa, temp25,16h

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Series containes 4 independent experiments and high and low power scanns for each independent experiment. Genome-wide mRNA expression profiles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae growing under hydrostatic pressure were characterized.  We selected a hydrostatic pressure of 30 MPa at 25Â°C because yeast cells were able to grow under these conditions, while cell size and complexity were increased after decompression.  Functional characterization of pressure-induced genes suggests that genes involved in protein metabolism and membrane metabolism were induced. The response to 30 MPa was significantly different from that observed under lethal conditions because protein degradation was not activated under 30 MPa pressure.  Strongly induced genes included those that contribute to membrane metabolism and which are also induced by detergents, oils, and membrane stabilizers. Keywords: repeat sample
