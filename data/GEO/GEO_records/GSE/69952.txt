TITLE
Calorie restriction suppresses age-dependent hippocampal transcriptional signatures.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Calorie restriction (CR) enhances longevity and mitigates aging phenotypes in numerous species. Physiological responses to CR are cell-type specific and variable throughout the lifespan; however, the mosaic of molecular changes responsible CR benefits remain unclear, particularly in brain regions susceptible to deterioration throughout aging. Thus, we examined the influence of long-term CR on the CA1 hippocampal region, a key learning and memory brain area that is vulnerable to age-related pathologies, such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). Through mRNA sequencing and NanoString nCounter analysis, we demonstrate that one year of CR feeding suppresses an age-dependent signature of 882 genes functionally associated with synaptic transmission-related pathways, including calcium signaling, long-term potentiation (LTP), and Creb signaling in wild-type mice. By comparing the influence of CR on hippocampal CA1 region transcriptional profiles at younger- (5 months) and older-adult (15 months) timepoints, we identify conserved upregulation of proteome quality control and calcium buffering genes, including heat shock 70 kDa proteins 1b and 5 (Hspa1b and Hspa5), protein disulfide isomerase family A members 4 and 6 (Pdia4 and Pdia6), and calreticulin (Calr). Expression levels of putative neuroprotective factors, klotho (Kl) and transthyretin (Ttr), are also elevated by CR throughout adulthood, although the global CR-specific expression profiles at young and older timepoints are highly divergent. At a previously unachieved resolution, our results demonstrate conserved activation of neuroprotective gene signatures and broad CR-suppression of age-dependent hippocampal CA1 region expression changes, indicating that CR functionally maintains a more youthful transcriptional state within hippocampal CA1 throughout aging.

DESIGN
Hippocampal CA1 region mRNA profiles of younger- (5 months) and older-adult (15 months) mice on calorie-restricted (CR) and normal (AD) diets were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
