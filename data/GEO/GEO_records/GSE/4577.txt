TITLE
Early pig response to experimental infection with Actinobacillus pleuropneomuniae

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify porcine genes which expression was affected by experimental infection with A. pleuropneumoniae within 24 hours after experimental challenge. Microarray experiments were conducted to reveal genes being significantly differentially expressed in infected versus non-infected lung tissue and in liver and lung lymph node tissue from three challenged versus two non-challenged animals. Keywords: Host response

DESIGN
Three comparisons were done: - infected versus non-infected lung tissue sampled from three challenged pigs - liver tissue from three challenged versus two non-challenged animals - lung lymph node tissue from three challenged versus two non-challenged animals All experiments were conducted as common reference design.
