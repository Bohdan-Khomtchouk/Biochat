TITLE
Addition of Exogenous AI-2 to C. jejuni 11168 Wild Type and LuxS01.

ORGANISM
Campylobacter jejuni

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 wild type and LuxS01 mutant strains comparing the effects of exogenously added in vitro-produced autoinducer 2 (AI-2) versus a control buffer to both strains.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, addition of exogenous AI-2 to both the parent and mutant 11168 strains. Control microarrays included comparing 11168 with AI-2 free buffer vs 11168 with AI-2-free buffer and mutant with AI-2 free buffer versus mutant with AI-2 free buffer used for analyses. 3 biological replicates for each, independently grown and harvested.

PLATFORM
GPL4869 Campylobacter NCTC 11168 ORF-based array printed at IFR (third type)
