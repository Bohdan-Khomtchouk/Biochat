TITLE
Expression data in polysomal and total RNA from perinatal rat lung

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
During the peri-partum period, the lung must respond to many factors with potential to impact protein synthesis via regulation of translation initiation.  Microarray analysis of polysomal versus total RNA from fetal day (FD) 19, FD22 and postnatal day 1 (P1) rat lungs was used to identify genes whose association with large polysomes changed either pre- or postnatally. Keywords: development

DESIGN
Using three independent litters at each developmental time point, we prepared lysates from FD19, FD22 and P1 (5 h after birth) rat lungs (total 9 lysates).  An aliquot of each lysate was used to prepare total RNA.  Remaining lysate was subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation to isolate large polysomes ( n > 7 ribosomes/mRNA) from which we isolated polysomal RNA.  Matched total and polysomal RNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix expression arrays (total 18 chips).
