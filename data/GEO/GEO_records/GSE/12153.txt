TITLE
Expression data in polysomal and total RNA from perinatal rat lung

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
During the peri-partum period, the lung must respond to many factors with potential to impact protein synthesis via regulation of translation initiation.  Microarray analysis of polysomal versus total RNA from fetal day (FD) 19, FD22 and postnatal day 1 (P1) rat lungs was used to identify genes whose association with large polysomes changed either pre- or postnatally. Keywords: development
