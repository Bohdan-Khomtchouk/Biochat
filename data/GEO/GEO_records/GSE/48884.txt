TITLE
Cyclin D1 determines estrogen depependent signaling in mouse mammary gland.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ovariectomized virgin Ccnd1-/- and Ccnd1+/+ mice (5 weeks of age) were allowed to recuperate for 2 weeks. The mice were assigned to either replacement pellets containing E2 (0.75 mg, 60-day release) or pellet containing placebo. Mice were sacrificed at day 7 after pellet implantation. RNA extracted from mammary glands (3 each group) was labeled and used to probe Affymetrix 430_2.0 arrays.

DESIGN
Six separate control Ccnd1+/+ C57BL/6 were compared to six Ccnd1-/- C57BL/6 mice. 3 mice in each group treated with placebo and three mice treated with E2
