TITLE
Whole-transcript expression data of BRD4 inhibition in uveal melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
G protein alpha q and 11 are mutated in 80% of uveal melanoma. We observed that treatment with the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 resulted in different phenotypic responses in G-protein mutant uveal melanoma cell lines and wild type uveal melanoma cell lines. We used microarrarys to profile the gene expression changes occuring in wild type and mutant cell lines in response to treament with JQ1

DESIGN
Uveal melanoma cells were profiled in triplicate on Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array arrays per manufacturer's instructions
