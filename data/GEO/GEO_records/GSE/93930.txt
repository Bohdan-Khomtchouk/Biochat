TITLE
Transcriptomic response in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) liver exposed to gold nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Sparus aurata

SUMMARY
Explore the underlying mechanisms-of-action after short-term (24 h) waterborne exposure to low (0.5 μg/L) and high (50 μg/L) gold nanoparticles (AuNP) concentrations in gilthead sea bream.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic analysis was conducted in S. aurata livers exposed to 0, 0.5 or 50 μg/L AuNP for 24 h (n=9 per condition: N total=27 fish) in order to determine the differences on gene expression level between these two concentrations at systemic level. The experimental design included three conditions: (1) non-exposed fish (control); (2) fish exposed to 0.5 μg/L AuNP; (3) fish exposed to 50 μg/L AuNP. Total RNA were extracted invidually and then total RNA samples were grouped into 3 pools of 3 fish for each condition (non-treated fish, 0.5 μg/L, 50 μg/L). The transcriptomic analysis was done following a reference design using the control as reference group.
