TITLE
In vitro transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells by diesel exhaust particles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The potential of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) to transform human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC3) was investigated and a stably transformed cell line (T2-HBEC3) was established. Short-term DEP exposure experiments adds information of immunomodulatory effect markers and differences in susceptibility between normal and sensitized bronhial epithelial cells of the human lung.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from HBEC3 and T2-HBEC3 exposed to DEP in dose-response  and time-course experiments.
