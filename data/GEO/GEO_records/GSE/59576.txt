TITLE
ATM deficiency in the absence of T cells promotes the development of NF-kB-dependent B cell lymphomas [Gene Expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our model removes T cells as targets for lymphomagenesis as well as eliminating T cell-dependent immune surveillance. These mice  exclusively develop early onset IgM+ B cell lymphomas that histologically and genetically resemble the activated B cell-like (ABC) subset of human diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). This dataset includes the comparison of B-cell lymphomas (tumors) from ATMKO.CD3eKO RNA expression levels with normal spleens from both ATMKO.CD3eKO and ATMWT.CD3eKO non-tumor bearing mice.

DESIGN
Ten ATMKO.CD3ÎµKO B cell lymphoma cell lines were established from tumor-bearing spleen cells. As per comparison to normal tissue, seven spleens from  ATMWT.CD3eKO mice and six non-tumor bearing spleens from a ATMKO.CD3eKO mice were used. RNA quality was assessed by Bioanalyzer and only those samples with RIN higher than 8 were used.
