TITLE
Zbtb16 Has a Role in Brown Adipocyte Bioenergetics

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Study designed to identify genes that are induced in both BAT and skeletal muscle during acute adaptive thermogenesis in mouse using gene expression microarray.  Animal studies were performed under approved UCLA animal research protocols and according to guidelines established in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. C57BL/6J mice were maintained in 12-h light/dark conditions and fed a regular chow diet (Purina 50010, Lab Diet, USA). Cold exposure was performed as described. After euthanasia, tissues were collected and frozen until use.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues by extraction with TRIzol from either brown adipose tissue (BAT) or skeletal muscle (quadriceps) after exposure to cold (4 degrees C for 4 hours).  The mice were of the C57BL/6J strain and were maintained in 12-h light/dark conditions and fed a laboratory chow diet that consisted of 4.5% fat, 50% carbohydrate by weight (Lab Diet, Purina 50010).
