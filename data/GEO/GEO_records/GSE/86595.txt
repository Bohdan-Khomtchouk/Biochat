TITLE
Identification of gene expression changes in RGC neurons treated with synaptogenic proteins

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Astrocyte-secreted proteins induce synapse formation between isolated retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons in culture. We asked whether 2 of these proteins, glypican 4 (Gpc4) or thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) induce synapse formation by regulating gene expression in RGCs.

DESIGN
6 samples. 3 conditions, 2 biological replicates per condition. Alone (untreated) RGCs; plus Gpc4 treatment 12 hours; plus TSP1 treatment 12 hours.
