TITLE
Gene expression of rhabdomyosarcoma cells infected with cytolytic and non-cytolytic variants of coxsackievirus B2 Ohio

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Coxsackievirus B2 (strain Ohio-1)

SUMMARY
In this study the gene expression in cells infected with lytic and non-lytic variants of coxsackievirus B2 Ohio (CVB2O) were analyzed using next generation sequencing. This approach was selected with the purpose of elucidating the effects of lytic and non-lytic viruses on host cell transcription. Total RNA was extracted from infected cells, next generation sequencing was performed, and the reads were subsequently mapped against the human and CVB2O genomes. The amount of intracellular virions was measured, showing a relative amount of virus RNA 13 times higher in the cells infected with the lytic variant, vVP1Q164K, compared to cells infected by the non-lytic CVB2Owt. Furthermore, differential gene expression in the cells infected with the two viruses was identified and a number of genes singled out as possible keys to the answer of how the viruses interact with the host cells, resulting in lytic or non-lytic infections.

DESIGN
4 samples, two samples of one strain, one sample of a different strain, and one control sample
