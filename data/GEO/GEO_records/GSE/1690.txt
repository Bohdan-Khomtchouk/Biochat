TITLE
Comparison of Drosophila melanogaster Malpighian tubule v whole fly

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is an affymetrix array experiment comparing the transcriptome of the Malpighian tubule (or renal tubule) of 7-day adult Oregon R strain Drosophila melanogaster with matched whole fly samples. There are five tubule samples (each derived from approx 1000 tubules (!)), and 5 matched whole-fly samples. i.e. tubule 2 is dissected from the same vial as WholeFly2. As the tubule is probably the premier tissue for true physiology in Drosophila, the dataset can usefully be interrogated in conjunction with the detailed physiological understanding of the tissue: see http://fly.to/tubules
