TITLE
Tea tree oil induced transcriptional alterations in Staphylococcus aureus

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
S. aureus and MRSA are susceptible to TTO and are therefore targeted in nascent TTO clinical trails. We now report the alterations in the transcriptome of a S. aureus exposed to a growth inhibitory concentration of TTO. These efforts have uncovered additional mechanisms by which this membrane active antimicrobial substance inhibits bacterial growth.
