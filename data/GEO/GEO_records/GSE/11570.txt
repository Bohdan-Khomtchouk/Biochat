TITLE
Expression responses of lineage I and II Listeria monocytogenes strains to low pH and sodium diacetate

ORGANISM
Listeria monocytogenes

SUMMARY
Cultivation based analyses were used to determine the resistance of a set of 140 Listeria monocytogenes strains to weak organic acids. Strains of lineage I tended to exhibit greater overall resistant to four different organic acids compared to lineage II strains. Resistant strains also possessed higher survival levels following challenge to pH 2.4 compared to sensitive strains. Transcriptomic analyses were performed to determine genetic responses relevant to growth at mildly acidic conditions (pH 5.0) and to the presence of sodium diacetate. Lineage I and II strain representatives, clinical strain ATCC 19115 and food isolate FW04/0023, were found to exhibit similar transcriptomic changes when habituated to pH 5.0 in brain heart infusion broth (BHIB) relative to growth at pH 7.2 though considerably more divergent responses were detected when 21 mM sodium diacetate was present. Homogeneity in acid habituation-related gene expression was reflected in relatively homogenous SigB, PrfA, HrCA and CodY regulon expression responses. In the presence of sodium diacetate, SigB and PrfA regulon genes found to be upregulated in sigB and prfA null mutants were overall repressed but SigB dependent-gene activation was not evident. L. monocytogenes strains responses to sodium diacetate were observed in different expression trends amongst various functionally-related gene sets and in particular the expression of the PrfA, Atp, Kdp, Cob, Pdu, Eut and Dlt operons; iron transporter and heat shock-related proteins. The results suggest there is diversity in the specific responses to weak organic acids and subsequent cytosolic acidification amongst L. monocytogenes strains though the acid tolerance response itself manifests as a more conserved set of expression responses.
