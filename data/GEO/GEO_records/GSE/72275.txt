TITLE
Mapping Replication Stress-Dependent Transcriptional Events Dependent on ATM or ATMIN by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The cellular response to replication stress requires the DNA-damage responsive kinase ATM and its co-factor ATMIN, however the roles of this signaling pathway following replication stress are unclear. RNA-seq and subsequent differential expression analyses were utilized to identify the functions of ATM and ATMIN in response to replication stress induced by Aphidcolin (APH).

DESIGN
Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) deleted for ATM or ATMIN were treated with 1ÂµM APH or DMSO as a control. Two different wild-type MEF cell lines (wtATM, wtATMIN) served as controls. RNA-seq was performed in duplicates, in a total of 32 samples, with an average of  31.1M aligned readsobtained  per group,with 15.5M reads obtained per replicate.
