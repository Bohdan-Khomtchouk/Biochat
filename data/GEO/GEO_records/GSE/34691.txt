TITLE
Expression data from murine fibroblasts overexpressing Fbxl10

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Posttranslational modifications on histone tails control gene expresssion levels in an either positive or negative way. Therefore enzymes which modifiy the modifications on the histon tails, like histone demethylases, are able to strictly regulate the transcriptom. To analyse the regulatory role of histone demethylase Fbxl10 we generated a stable cell line permanently overexpressing HA-tagged Fbxl10 and identified the transcriptome changes compared to untransfected control cell line by microarray.

DESIGN
Tet-off Mefs were transfected with a plasmid containing HA-Fbxl10 cDNA and a Hygromycin resistence plasmid and cell clones were selected for HA-Fbxl10 expression. Three independent RNA samples were generated from untransfected Tet-off Mef cells (C1-C3) and from Tet-off Mef HA-Fbxl10 (D1-D3) and hybridisated on Affymetrix microarray.
