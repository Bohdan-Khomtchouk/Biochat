TITLE
ABA or GA calli treatment

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The callus used for total RNA extraction was derived from the scutellum of the japonica rice variety Nipponbare and cultivated in Murashige and Skoog medium* containing 10 microM 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Such callus maintains the ability to develop roots and leaves. After the calli had been cultured in the medium for 30 d, they were transferred to a medium containing either ABA or GA (Gibberellin) plant hormones and cultured for 3 d. The concentration of the plant hormone was adjusted to 50 microM. After culturing, we used an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan) to extract total RNA from the hormone-treated calli and from the controls. Messenger RNA (mRNA) was isolated with an Oligotex-dt30 (Super) mRNA purification kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). Purified mRNA was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the NIAS RICE 22K oligonucleotide array ver1 according to the manufacturer. Keywords: other
