TITLE
Human retinal and photoreceptor gene expression profile

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression profile between an 96 day human retina and photoreceptors present around the same time. We used the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array to compare their expression profiles.

DESIGN
Retina from 96 and 90 day human retina was isolated and either directly used for RNA extraction or cultured with IRBP-GFP lentivirus and then the GFP expressing cells were FACS out and used for RNA extraction.
