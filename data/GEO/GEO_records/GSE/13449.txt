TITLE
Expression analysis upon NAMPT knockdown in MCF-7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
NAMPT is an enzyme in the mammalian NAD+ salvage pathway. Expression microarray analysis was used to study the effect of NAMPT knockdown on gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
Stable knockdown of NAMPT was achieved using a retroviral shRNA construct. An shRNA directed against Luciferase was used to generate the Luc control cells.  Three independent biological replicates with matching Luc controls were analyzed using Affymetrix U133 A2.0 microarrays.
