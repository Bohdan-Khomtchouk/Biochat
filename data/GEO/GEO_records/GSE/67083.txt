TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and rea1 mutant total and polysome-bound Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Analysis of  gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that rea1 mutant influence the translation level of translation and nucleosome assembly associated genes. Results provide important information of the gene translation level regulation of ribosome proteins, elongation factors, histones and genes associated with other biological processes.

DESIGN
Endosperm total and polysome-bound mRNA profiles of 15DAP wild type (WT) and rea1 mutant were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500 (Zea mays).
