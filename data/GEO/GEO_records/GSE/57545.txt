TITLE
Complement Roles Revealed by Immune Gene Profiling in Endometriosis and Endometriosis-Associated Ovarian Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mechanisms of immune dysregulation against established tumors are relatively well understood. Much less is known about the role of immune effectors against cancer precursor lesions. Endometrioid and clear cell ovarian tumors may partly derive from endometriosis, a commonly diagnosed chronic inflammatory disease. We performed here the most comprehensive immune gene expression analysis of pelvic inflammation in endometriosis and endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer (EAOC).

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 120 paraffin tissue blocks comprising of normal endometrium (n=32), benign endometriosis (n=30), atypical endometriosis (n=15) and EAOC (n=43). Serous tumors (n=15) were included as non-endometriosis associated controls. The immune microenvironment was profiled using Nanostring and the nCounterÂ® GX Human Immunology Kit, comprising probes for a total of 511 immune genes. Please note that 3 normal endometrium samples did not pass the array quality filtering and therefore excluded in the data analyses.
