TITLE
Expression profile of LNCaP prostate cancer cell line treated with DMSO or BP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
N-butylidenephthalide (BP) exhibits its antitumor effect in a variety of cancer cell lines. However, little is known about its effects on prostate cancer. The objective of this study was to obtain additional insights into the mechanisms involved in BP induced cell death in human prostate cancer cells. To determine the mechanisms of BP-induced growth arrest and cell death in prostate cancer cell lines, we performed a microarray study to identify alterations in gene expression induced by treatment with BP in the LNCaP cells.

DESIGN
LNCaP cellss were selected to treated with BP for 3 or 24hr for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
