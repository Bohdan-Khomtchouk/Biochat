TITLE
Differentially expressed miRNAs between T29H and T29 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNAs are small regulatory non-coding RNA molecules that influence a wide range of biological and pathological processes. Piling evidence has shown that miRNAs regulate the expression of various genes pivotal for tumor onset, progression and metastasis. Here we compared the miRNA profiling between T29(human ovarian epithelial cell immortalized with SV40T/t antigens and the human telomerase catalytic subunit) and T29H (T29 transformed with the oncogenic H-RASv12) cell lines.

DESIGN
T29H vs.T29

PLATFORM
