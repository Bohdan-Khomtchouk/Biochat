TITLE
Expression data from Huh7.5 hepatoma cells transfected with 100 nM miR-7 mimic

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our work demonstrated that PPAR-Î± regulates miR-7, a microRNA which regulates SREBP1 signaling. We used microarrays to detail the effect of miR-7 on hepatic gene expression, and, within activated genes, identified an enrichment for genes with SREBP1 binding sites in their promoters.

DESIGN
Huh7.5 cells were transfected with miR-7 or control mimics (100 nM), and total RNA was isolated 72 hours post-transfection.
