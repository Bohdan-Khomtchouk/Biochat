TITLE
A diet-sensitive epigenetic pathway links hepatic bile acid metabolism to cholesterol absorption and atherosclerosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dietary nutrients interact with the gene networks to orchestrate adaptive responses during metabolic stress. Tissue metabolic reprogramming is frequently linked to induction of pathways with pathophysiological consequences. Here we identified Baf60a as a diet-sensitive subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes in the liver that links the consumption of fat- and cholesterol-rich diet to elevated plasma cholesterol levels. The expression of Baf60a in the liver was elevated following western diet feeding. Hepatocyte-specific inactivation of Baf60a reduced bile acid production and intestinal cholesterol absorption, and attenuated diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in mice. At the mechanistic level, Baf60a stimulates the expression of hepatic genes involved in bile acid synthesis, modification, and transport through a CAR/Baf60a feedforward regulatory loop. Baf60a is required for the recruitment of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes to facilitate an activating epigenetic switch on the CAR target genes. These studies elucidate an unexpected regulatory pathway that mediates the hyperlipidemic and atherogenic effects of western diet consumption. We used microarrays to elucidate the role of hepatic Baf60a in the regulation of lipid metabolism.

DESIGN
Wild type and Baf60a Liver specific knockout (Baf60a LKO) mice were fed high-fat diet (Research Diets D12492) for 10 weeks. Livers were harvested after overnight starvation for RNA isolation and microarray hybridization using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. Two independent pool RNA samples from WT and Baf60a LKO mouse livers were included in the study.
