TITLE
Expression data from rat livers - Naproxen and NO-Naproxen treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To characterize naproxen and NO-naproxen, their effects on gene expression in livers of treated rats was examined. We have previously worked with liver and could therefore identify a moderate to strong antioxidant response element signature. There were two goals to this study: 1) to determine whether naproxen and NO-naproxen yield similar gene expression profiles, which would imply that their effects are mediated by the parent NSAID, and 2) to determine whether NO-naproxen, due to the release of NO, might cause increases in expression of genes associated with the antioxidant response element (ARE). In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from liver of untreated rats and rats treated with naproxen (400mg/kg diet) or NO-naproxen (550mg/kg diet) for 7 days.

DESIGN
Total 12 samples were analyzed. We generated the following comparisons: NO-Naproxen vs. Control and Naproxen vs. Control.  Genes with a p-value < 0.05 and a fold-change â‰¥1.5 were selected.
