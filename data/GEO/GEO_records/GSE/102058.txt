TITLE
Characteristics and localization of prospective fibroblast subpopulations isolated from the mouse lung

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we classified lung fibroblasts highly expressing Pdgfra into three subpopulations, Sca-1highThy-1low (A-type), Sca-1highThy-1high (B-type), and Sca-1lowThy-1low (C-type). We then performed microarray analysis to identify specific genes for each subpopulation.

DESIGN
To obtain fibroblast subpopulations, pulmonary single cells (Pu) were incubated with antibodies against lineage-specific cell surface markers (CD31, CD45, CD146, Lyve-1, TER119, and E-Cadherin), Pdgfra, Sca-1, and Thy-1. 50,000 cells of subpopulations (A-, B-, and C-type fibroblasts) in addition to Pu were isolated, and then RNA was extracted from each population and amplified for the gene expression comparison.
