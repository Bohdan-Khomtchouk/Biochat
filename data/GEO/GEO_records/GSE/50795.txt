TITLE
Effect of Sunitinib treatment withdrawal on Immunodeficient mice bearing MDA-MB231 tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Immunodeficient RAG1-/- mice bearing MDA-MB231-LUC+ tumors of 50-70 mm3 were daily administrated by gavage with vehicle (containing, 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose, 1.8 % NaCl, 0.4 % Tween-80, 0.9 %. benzyl alcohol, and ultrapure water adjusted to pH 6.0) or sunitinib (40mg/kg/day) for 30 days followed by treatment withdrawal for 3-4 weeks to allow the tumor regrowth until reaching the same volume as that of the vehicle treated group. Mice were sacrificed when tumor reached the volume of 350-400 mm3 and RNAs of two tumors from two different mice treated with sunitinib or vehicle were extracted.

DESIGN
One color experiment with 2  experimental conditions: Sunitinib vs Vehicle (n=2), corresponding to a total of 4 samples.
