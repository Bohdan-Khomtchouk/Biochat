TITLE
Estrogen Receptor binding site mapping by ChIP-on-chip

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with estradiol and then chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to isolate estrogen receptor and associated genomic DNA binding sites. Keywords: ChIP-on-chip samples

DESIGN
ChIP DNA fragments were end-labeled with biotinylated nucleotides and then labeled with Cy3-avidin and hybridized to human promoter arrays to detect estrogen receptor binding sites.

PLATFORM
GPL4040 NimbleGen Human Promoter Array
