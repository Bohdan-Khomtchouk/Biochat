TITLE
Genes differentially expressed as a result of Candida albicans SC5314 exposure to pterostilbene

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Candida albicans comparing pterostilbene treated cells with untreated cells

DESIGN
Wild type Candida albicans strain SC5314 was selected to carry out the expression profile microarray. Two-condition experiment, pterostilbene treated vs. untreated cells. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 pterostilbene treated, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
