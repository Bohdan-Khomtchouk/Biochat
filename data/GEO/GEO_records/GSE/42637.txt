TITLE
LEF1 in Burkitt lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recently global gene expression profiling of patients samples lead to a molecular definition of Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) with lymphocyte enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) as a signature gene. Here we report the discovery of nucleic LEF1 in a very high proportion of BL cases (15/18) and LEF1 target genes. Germinal center B cells were devoid of detectable nuclear LEF1 expression as mantle cell lymphoma (0/5), marginal zone lymphoma (0/6), follicular lymphoma (0/12) or diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (1/31). Using whole genome gene expression profiling after transient knockdown of LEF1 in BL cell lines, new LEF1 target genes were identified. The joint expression of these genes in primary BL samples shows that LEF1 is not only expressed aberrantly in BL but also transcriptionally active. Our study identified aberrantly expressed LEF1 and its target genes suggesting an important functional role in BLs.

DESIGN
