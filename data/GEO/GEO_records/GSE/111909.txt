TITLE
Acquired paternal inheritance fatty liver transcriptomes induced by high-fat diet

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Many acquired traits related to fat metabolism are inherited, and nutritional factors can induce fatty liver in chickens. We found that the paternal fatty livers induced by high-fat diet in Jingxing-Huang chickens were inherited, but the molecular mechanisms of inherited fatty liver in chickens are far from clear. The goals of this study are to compare liver transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) in F1 generation to screen candidate genes for acquired fatty liver. Compared to birds without fatty liver in the control group, the paternal group exhibited altered hepatic gene expression profiles, including up-regulation of several key genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism (ACACA, FASN, SCD, ACSL5, FADS2, FABP1, APOA4 and ME1). This study uniquely revealed that acquired fatty liver in cocks can be inherited. The hepatic gene expression profiles were altered in chickens with the inherited phenotype of acquired paternal fatty liver and several genes could be candidate biomarkers.

DESIGN
Liver mRNA profiles for paternal inheritance group and control group of F1 generation were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
