TITLE
Comparison of normalized signal intensities of various miRNAs in the exsosomes isolated by Exoquick or ultracentrifugation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small (18–22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs, suppress the translation of target mRNAs by binding to their 3′ untranslated region. Evidence suggests that miRNAs are key regulators of several cellular processes, including angiogenesis. Recent findings indicate that Secreted miRNAs enclosed in exosomes also play an important role in cell–cell communication. To elucidate whether miRNAs secreted from neoplastic cells transfer into endothelial cells and are functionally active in the recipient cells, we investigated the interaction of a leukemia cell line and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

DESIGN
The culture medium was collected and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-µm PVDF filter (Millipore). The appropriate volume of Exoquick Exosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA) was added to the filtered culture medium and mixed well by inverting. After refrigeration for 12 h, the mixture was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 30 min and all supernatant was removed by aspiration. Exosome pellets were resuspended with 500 µl of the serum-free AIM V medium (Invitrogen).   K562 cells or K562/Cy3-miR-92a cells (K562 cells transfected with Cy3-labeled pre-miR-92a) were pre-cultured in serum-free AIM V medium (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured in 200 ml of AIM V medium (twenty 100 mm culture dishes). For exosome preparation, the culture media were collected and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature, then the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 70 min at 4 ºC. The pellets were washed with PBS, after ultracentrifugation, they were used for Microarray analysis.
