TITLE
miRNA gene expression profiles from osteosarcoma samples and cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although the introduction of combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy has significantly prolonged the survival, the outcome of OS patients with poor response to chemotherapy is still unfavorable. To develop new therapeutics the elucidation of the entire molecular pathway regulating OS cell proliferation is warranted. We analysed the expression levels of 933 miRNA probes in surgical 24 samples and 8 cell lines of osteosarcoma with 3D-Gene human miRNA oligo chips.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 24 fresh frozen tumour specimens and 8 OS cell lines. We analysed the global miRNA exprssion profiles of these osteosarcoma cases in order to find new novel potential targets for the development of therapeutic targeting OS.
