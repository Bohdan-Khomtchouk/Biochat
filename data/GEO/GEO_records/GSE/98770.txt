TITLE
Gene expression profiling of acute type A aortic dissection combined with in vitro assessment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chronic inflammation characterized by MMP-TIMP dysregulation, increased VEGFA expression, and TGF-Î² signaling in the development of aortic dissection.

DESIGN
Total RNA, including microRNA (miRNA), was isolated from the intima-media layer of dissected ascending aorta obtained intraoperatively from acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) patients without familial thoracic aortic disease (n = 6) and that of non-dissected ascending aorta obtained from transplant donors (n = 5). Gene expression profiling was performed with mRNA and miRNA microarrays, and results were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Target genes and miRNA were identified by gene ontology analysis (GOA) and a literature search.
