TITLE
Mouse bone marrow stromal cells: before or after total body irradiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comprehensive gene expression analysis in BM-resident stromal cells was performed for an overview of BM environmental change caused by total body irradiation (TBI). Total RNA samples collected from BM-resident stromal cells with or without TBI were subjected to high sensitivity DNA microarray assays

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: Unirradiated, 1 day after TBI and 3 days after TBI. Bone marrow stromal cells were obtained from C57BL/6 mice (n = 6) either non-irradiated or after 9.5 Gy irradiation at indicated times.

PLATFORM
