TITLE
Expression profiling in silencing suppressor plants or in mirna mutants-Transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in Arabidopsis plants that constitutively express suppressors of RNA silencing

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
gen107_ptgs - gene profiling in silencing suppressor plants or in mirna mutants - What are the genes that are differentially regulated in various tissues derived from silencing suppressor plants or miRNA mutants? - HcPro, P15, P19, CHS-RNAi (control), were grown on MS solid medium, and tissues were harvested at different developmental stages. dcl1-9, hen1-1 and La-er (control) were grown on MS solid medium, and tissues harvested at different developmental stages. Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic),gene knock out

DESIGN
40 dye-swap - Chromochip Arabidopsis thaliana 21.7K CHROMO4_1
