TITLE
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal breast, normal adjacent and breast cancer tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 480,000 CpGs in a total of 407 samples, including  50 normal samples from healthy women, 42 matched normal-adjacent breast cancer pairs (84 samples), 263 unmatched breast cancers, 7 normal samples from BRCA1 carriers and 4 BRCA1 breast cancers. ***WARNING: incomplete metadata supplied for this study***

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 407 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL16304 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip [UBC enhanced annotation v1.0]
