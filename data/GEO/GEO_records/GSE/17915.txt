TITLE
Mouse cardiac tissue: Vehicle treated control vs. 25mg/kg DMNQ

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse cardiac tissue treated with 25mg/kg DMNQ in 10 ml/kg arachis oil over an acute time course (5 minutes-120 hours) compared to time matached control animals treated with 10ml/kg arachis oil

DESIGN
Two colour microarrays with time matched controls against 25mg/kg DMNQ cardiac tissue.  Time points studied were 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 12, 24, 120 hours following dosing, biological replicates n= > 2 independent animals at each time point, technical replicate n > 1 with reverse labelling at each time point.  One array printed onto two slides (A and B), one replicate per array.
