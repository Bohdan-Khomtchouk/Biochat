TITLE
Interaction of Snf1 with TORC1 in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Snf1 and TORC1 are two global regulators that sense the nutrient availability and regulate the cell growth in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we undertook a systems biology approach to study the effect of deletion of these genes and investigate the interaction between Snf1 and TORC1 in regulation of gene expression and cell metabolism.

DESIGN
3 mutant strains (snf1Δ, tor1Δ, snf1Δtor1Δ) together with 1 reference strain grown under both glucose-limited or amonia-limited defined media with three biological replicates for each strain
