TITLE
Glucose Shortens the Lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans by Down-Regulating Aquaporin Gene Expression

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Many studies have addressed the effect of dietary glycemic index on obesity and diabetes, but little is known about its effect on lifespan itself.   We found that adding a small amount of glucose to the medium (0.1-2%) shortened the lifespan of C. elegans.  Glucose shortened lifespan by inhibiting the activities of lifespan-extending transcription factors that are also inhibited by insulin signaling: the FOXO family member DAF-16 and the heat shock factor HSF-1.  This effect involved the down-regulation of an aquaporin glycerol channel, aqp-1.  We show that changes in glycerol metabolism are likely to underlie the lifespan-shortening effect of glucose, and that aqp-1 may act cell non-autonomously as a feedback regulator in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway.  Insulin down-regulates similar glycerol channels in mammals, suggesting that this glucose-responsive pathway might be conserved evolutionarily.  Together these findings raise the possibility that a low-sugar diet might have beneficial effects on lifespan in higher organisms. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
