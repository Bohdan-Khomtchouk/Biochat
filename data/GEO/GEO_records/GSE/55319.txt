TITLE
Whole Blood Gene Expression Profiling Predicts Therapeutic Response in Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis at 4 Months

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine whether gene expression profiles from peripheral whole blood could be used to determine therapeutic outcome in a cohort of children with newly diagnosed polyarticular JIA.

DESIGN
19 samples were obtained from healthy childhood controls and 93 samples from patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. For patient samples, they were collected prior to treatment (month 0) or 4 months after treatment.
