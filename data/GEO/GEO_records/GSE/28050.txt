TITLE
Expression data from knockdown of BACH1 in HEK 293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) is a heme-binding transcription factor repressing the transcription from a subset of MAF recognition elements (MAREs) at low intracellular heme levels. Upon heme binding, BACH1 is released from the MAREs, resulting in increased expression of antioxidant response genes. To systematically address the gene regulatory networks involving BACH1, we performed knock-down of BACH1 in HEK 293T cells using three independent types of small interfering RNAs followed by transcriptome profiling using microarrays.

DESIGN
Knockdown of BACH1 in HEK 293T cells was carried out with three different types of siRNA molecules (esiRNA = e, siRNA1 SI00309876 from Qiagen = q and Stealth siRNA2 HSS100910 from Invitrogen = s), followed by RNA extraction after 24h and 72h of knockdown and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. For each siRNA type, we performed the experiments in triplicates, with four control replicates (mock transfections without siRNA) at 24h and three control replicates at 72h, resulting in nine samples and four controls at 24h and nine samples and three controls at 72h. Samples at 24h of knockdown: e_1_24, e_2_24, e_3_24, q_1_24, q_2_24, q_3_24, s_1_24, s_2_24, s_3_24. Controls at 24h: m_1_24, m_2_24, m_3_24, m_4_72. Samples at 72h of knockdown: e_1_72, e_2_72, e_3_72, q_1_72, q_2_72, q_3_72, s_1_72, s_2_72, s_3_72. Controls at 72h: m_1_72, m_2_72, m_3_72. REPEATS: biological replicate: BACH1_e_1_24, BACH1_e_2_24, BACH1_e_3_24 biological replicate: BACH1_q_1_24, BACH1_q_2_24, BACH1_q_3_24 biological replicate: BACH1_s_1_24, BACH1_s_2_24, BACH1_s_3_24 biological replicate: BACH1_m_1_24, BACH1_m_2_24, BACH1_m_3_24, BACH1_m_4_24 biological replicate: BACH1_e_1_72, BACH1_e_2_72, BACH1_e_3_72 biological replicate: BACH1_q_1_72, BACH1_q_2_72, BACH1_q_3_72 biological replicate: BACH1_s_1_72, BACH1_s_2_72, BACH1_s_3_72 biological replicate: BACH1_m_1_72, BACH1_m_2_72, BACH1_m_3_72
