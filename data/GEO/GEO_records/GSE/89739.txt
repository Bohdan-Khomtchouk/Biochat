TITLE
Array comparative genomic hybridization of tumor tissue developed in TH-MYCN (hemizygote) mice [Agilent-015028]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to investigate the chromosomal alterations (gains or losses) of tumor tissuees developed in TH-MYCN mice, a neuroblastoma model, we carried out array comparative genomic hybridization. We investigated whether chromosomal alterations occured in the tumor tissues developed in the abdomen of TH-MYCN hemizygote mice.

DESIGN
Eleven biological replicates of tumor tissues developed in abdomen of TH-MYCN mice were subjected to array CGH.
