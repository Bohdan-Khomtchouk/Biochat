TITLE
Genome-wide expression of the leukemic cells with different sensitivity to AraC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine the molecular alterations in cells with different sensitivity, genome-wide expression of the leukemic cells was profiled, revealing that overall 366 and 212 genes became upregulated or downregulated, respectively, in the resistant cells. Many of these genes are involved in the regulation of cell cycle, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis.

DESIGN
gene expression of myeloid leukemic cell

PLATFORM
GPL13692 Phalanx Mouse OneArrayÂ® v2
