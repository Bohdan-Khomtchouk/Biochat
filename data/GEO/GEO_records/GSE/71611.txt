TITLE
Genome-wide RNA expression analysis of mouse spleens in parent-into-F1 lupus immune response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole spleen tissue expression signature in divergent responses from two parent-into-F1 lupus mouse model systems.  The hypothesis is that strain differences of CD4 T cells exhibit difference lupus-inducing proclivity.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from recipient mouse spleen at day 14 post-engraftment were profiled by Illumina BeadArray expression analysis

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
