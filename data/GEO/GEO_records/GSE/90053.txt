TITLE
Species-Specific Developmental Timing is Maintained by Pluripotent Stem Cells Ex Utero

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed whole transcriptome RNA sequencing experiments on two sets of differentiation time course starting from human ES cells (EGFP-H1) and mouse EGFP-EpiS cells: (1) in vitro neural differentiation, and (2) teratoma formation

DESIGN
In vitro differentiation time courses were sampled every day for the first 8 days, then every other day over 3 weeks for mouse cells and 6 weeks for human cells (day 28 was missed).  Mouse teratomas were sampled on days 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16 ,18, and 21; human teratomas on days 2, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 28, 36, and 42
