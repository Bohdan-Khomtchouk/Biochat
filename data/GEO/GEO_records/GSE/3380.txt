TITLE
Solanaceae comparative gene expression profiling

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Six different Solanaceae species, Potato (Solanum tubersosum), Tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum), Pepper (Capsicum annuum), Tobacco (Nicotiana tabaccum), Petunia and Nicotiana benthiamana were grown at 25C, 16h light and 8h darkness. Mature leaves were harvested after 4-6 weeks. RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy. Tomato, pepper, petunia, tobacco and N. benthamiana samples were hybridized against potato samples. Keywords: Solanaceae comparative gene expression profiling
