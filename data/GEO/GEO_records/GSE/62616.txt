TITLE
G9a, ZNF644 and WIZ ChIP-seq results

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The G9a mediates mono- and dimethylation of Lys9 of histone H3 at specific gene loci, which is associated with transcriptional repression. ZNF644 and WIZ contain multiple zinc finger motifs that recognize consensus DNA sequences.

DESIGN
The molecular mechanism by which the G9a is targeted to the specific gene loci for H3K9 methylation is unclear, as G9a can't specifically recognize genomic DNA. Here, with unbiased protein affinity purification, we found that ZNF644 and WIZ are two binding proteins of G9a. Both ZNF644 and WIZ contain multiple zinc finger motifs that recognize consensus DNA sequences. Thus, ZNF644 and WIZ target G9a to the chromatin, and mediate the G9/GLP complex-dependent H3K9 methylation as well as gene repression. Please note that the data files (both raw and processed) have been updated on Sep 22, 2016.
