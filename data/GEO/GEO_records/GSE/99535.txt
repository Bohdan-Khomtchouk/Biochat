TITLE
Genomic profiles of oxidative stress-induced renal cell carcinomas developed in Mutyh deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Intraperitoneal administration of ferric nitrilotriacetate initiates Fenton reaction in the renal proximal tubules in rodents that ultimately leads to a high incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after repeated treatment. We performed high-resolution microarray comparative genomic hybridization to identify characteristics in the genomic profiles of oxidative stress-induced RCCs and simultaneously developed malignant lymphomas in the mice. The results highlighted a substantial difference in the predisposition to chromosomal changes between animal species.

DESIGN
The carcinogenesis protocol was performed for two groups of wild type mice and Mutyh deficient mice. Genomes of 4 renal cell carcinomas and 5 malignant lymphomas from the treated groups were profiled on Agilent 180K mouse genome CGH microarrays. Three spontaneous malignant lymphomas from the untreated control groups were also analyzed with the same Agilent CGH microarrays.
