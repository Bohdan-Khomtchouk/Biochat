TITLE
HOX A13 Expression in Hepatocellular Carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HOX A13 over expression represents: i) a novel molecular marker of hepatocellular carcinomas; ii) a sign of epithelial-endothelial transition accounting for tumor independent angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Keywords: cancer; disease-state analysis

DESIGN
Genomic analysis of high HOX A13 expressing pairs (HCC/non tumorous liver tissues) to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased expression of HOX A13 in liver cancers and to identify potential HOX A13 targets.
