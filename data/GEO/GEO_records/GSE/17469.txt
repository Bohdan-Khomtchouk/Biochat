TITLE
Gene expression profiling in wMelPop-infected Aedes aegypti

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
Whole genome transcriptional profiling comparing  Ae. aegypti infected with Wolbachia sp. wMelPop (PGYP1) to an uninfected Ae. aegypti control line (PGYP1.tet). The objective of the experiment was to identify genes that may be involved in the life shortening phenotype associated with wMelPop infection.

DESIGN
Two-colour experiment; infected vs. uninfected Ae. aegypti; 4 biological replicates; 2 dye swaps.

PLATFORM
GPL8972 Agilent Aedes aegypti 16K transcripts (VectorBase build 1.0)
