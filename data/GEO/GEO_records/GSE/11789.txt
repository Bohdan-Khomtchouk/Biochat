TITLE
Expression data from MatDp(dist2) and PatDp(dist2) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression levels between MatDp(dist2) and PatDp(dist2) mice (newborn whole head). Identification of highly differentially expressed transcripts.

DESIGN
Pairwise array comparative analyses were performed using MAS5/GCOS where the sample genotype varied between the compared arrays: MatDp(dist2) vs PatDp(dist2), distal T(2:9)11H translocation breakpoint.
