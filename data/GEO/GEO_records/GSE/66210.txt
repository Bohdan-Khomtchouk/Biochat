TITLE
Epigenome analysis of first trimester CVS samples from normal and Trisomy 13,18,21 pregnancies, and maternal whole blood samples.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and trisomic placentas, and maternal blood cell DNA. The aim of this study was to search for methylation differences between maternal and fetal(placenta) cell free DNA, and between normal and trisomic placentas for an optimized methylation based noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aberations.   The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in DNA samples from Chorionic villus samples(CVS)  and DNA samples from whole blood. Samples included 12 Maternal blood cell samples from normal pregnancies, 12 normal CVS, 12 Trisomy 21 CVS, 12 trisomy 18 CVS and 6  trisomy 13 CVS samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 54 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
