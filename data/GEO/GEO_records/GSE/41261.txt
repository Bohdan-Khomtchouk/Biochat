TITLE
Exploring the larval transcriptome of the common sole (Solea solea L.)

ORGANISM
Solea solea

SUMMARY
A microarray platform for Solea solea was developed to study gene expression profiles of common sole developmental stages.

DESIGN
Characterization of the transcriptome of S. solea, focusing on larval and juvenile stages. After transcriptome sequencing and annotation [TSA accession number GAAQ00000000], an oligo-DNA microarray for the detection of 12,836 unique transcripts was developed and applied to the study of gene expression profiles during larval-to-juvenile transition. For microarray experiments, pooled samples of 10â€“5 individuals (depending on larval age) were sampled and RNA extracted at 1, 4, 6, 11, 13, 18, 24 and 33 days post-hatching (dph). The number of biological replicates was four for each sampling point.
