TITLE
Expression data from Northeastern Indigenous and Large White longissimus dorsi

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To understand the molecular basis of distinct pork quality in Chinese indigenous and Western breed, longissimus dorsi samples were collected from three adult Northeastern Indigenous and from three adult Large White. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to porcine Affymetrix Genechip. The study helps to elucidate the genetic mechnism of divergent pork quality and provide the theory basis for selection and genetic improvement of meat quality traits in porcine.

DESIGN
Six longissimus dorsi samples were collected from three Northeastern Indigenous and from three Large White. Three Large White were control samples. Total RNA was extracted from each sample.Gene-expression profiling was performed for each RNA sample separately on the GeneChipÂ® Porcine Genome Array at CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China).
