TITLE
IL-4-primed bone marrow macrophages isolated from  C57Bl6/J or Balb/cAnNCrl mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the expression profile of differentiated mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMM) in response to IL-4, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling. For this purpose, bone marrow cells were isolated from 8 to 12 weeks old C57BL6/J and Balb/cAnNCrl mice and cultured in the presence of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). After seven days of culture, IL-4 was added for 4 and 18 hours. Keywords: Mice strain comparison; Gene expression profiling

DESIGN
IL-4 induced gene expression was investigated in mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMM) of C57BL6/J and Balb/cAnNCrl mice. Differentiated BMM were incubated with mouse recombinant IL-4 for 4 or 18 hours or without for 18 hours. Two independent experiments were performed at each time (mock, 4 and 18 hours) using different mice littermates for each experiment.
