TITLE
MicroRNA Expression Profile of serum exosomes from Bortezomib-resistant and Bortezomib-response patients in multiple myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA microarray profilling analysis was performed on exosomes derived from serum in patients with myeloma in two conditions of therapeutic efficacy, Bortezomib resistance and Bortezomib response. Bortezomib is approved and widely used treating myeloma.

DESIGN
Two kinds of sample were analyzed. MicroRNA microarray profilling analysis (using miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 7th generation REV - hsa, mmu & rno, mirBase release 18, ProductNumber=208520,208521,208522) was performed on exosomes derived from serum in patients with myeloma in two conditions of therapeutic efficacy, Bortezomib resistance and Bortezomib response.
