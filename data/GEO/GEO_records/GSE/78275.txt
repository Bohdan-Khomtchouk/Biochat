TITLE
Oxidative stress related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit a poor interspecies conservation and often show spatial- and temporal-specific expression patterns. What, if any, role they have in oxidative stress remains unknown. To identify potential roles for lncRNAs, we examined their expression in normal and H2O2-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Oxidative stress related lncRNAs were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500 platform. Sequencing of the cDNA libraries from H2O2-treated HUVECs generated 12.5 million uniquely valid reads, meanwhile, 10.2 million valid fragments were obtained from control group in our experiment. A total of 10, 765 known and 30, 629 novel putative lncRNAs were identified according to RNA-Seq. Among them, 2, 091 of known and 25, 800 of novel lncRNAs were differentially expressed in H2O2-treated HUVECs compared with control HUVECs, and 12 of these were validated with qRTâ€“PCR. Taken together, our findings provide evidence differentially expressed lncRNAs were mediated by oxidative stress in HUVECs, it is, therefore, likely that aberrant expression of lncRNAs, at least in part, participate in the process of endothelial injury caused by oxidative stress.
