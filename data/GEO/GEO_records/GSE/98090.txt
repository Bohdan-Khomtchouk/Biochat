TITLE
Identification of a human clonogenic progenitor with strict monocyte differentiation potential - a counterpart of mouse cMoPs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages cause a variety of inflammatory disorders. Kawamura and colleagues identified human cMoPs, a monocyte-restricted progenitor, in umbilical-cord blood and bone marrow, increasing our understanding of human monocyte differentiation and insight for therapies targeting cMoPs and monocytes.

DESIGN
The PB-Mo (N=3), cMoP-Mo (N=3), preMo (N=3), cMoPs (N=3), rGMPs (N=3), and CMPs (N=3) were sorted from at least 20 UCB samples and pooled for one experiment.
