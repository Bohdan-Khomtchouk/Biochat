TITLE
Expression data from HT-1080 cells incubated or not in the presence of laminin111 coiled-coiled recombinant fragment (rLCC111)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Laminins are large heterotrimeric cross-shaped extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins with terminal globular domains and a coiled-coil region. We have produced for the first time a recombinant laminin coiled-coil domain and studied the transcriptional profile of cells incubated in coiled-coil-coated wells.

DESIGN
Cells were incubated in 24w plates, onto coiled-coil-coated wells or control BSA-coated wells (one each), 24h

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
