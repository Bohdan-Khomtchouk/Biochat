TITLE
Comparison of transcriptome profile between wild-type and dao mutant plants

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
We identified and characterized that the rice Dioxygenase for Auxin Oxidation (dao) mutant displays pleiotropic phenotypes, including indehiscent anthers, sterile pollens, and increased free IAA levels in anthers.We conclude that DAO-mediated auxin catabolism is essential for auxin homeostasis and later stages of plant reproductive development, including anther dehiscence, and pollen viability. We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in dao.

DESIGN
For genome-wide expression analysis of dao, three replicates of WT and dao samples (RNA from mature anthers) were analyzed on Affymetrix Genechip® Rice Genome arrays by an Affymetrix service facility (CapitalBio Corporation) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Genes showing a 2-fold change with a q-value ≤ 0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed.
