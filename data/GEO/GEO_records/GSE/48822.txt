TITLE
Effect of IUGR on postnatal day 14 pancreatic islets

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
IUGR is a common complication of pregnancy. We have created a rat model of IUGR which mimics placental insufficiency. Surgery is performed at embryonic day 18 and dams are allowed to deleiver spontaneously. At postnatal day 14, we isolate pancreatic islets and have compared their gene expression with that of control (sham) surgery animals.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs IUGR pancreatic islets. Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 IUGR replicates.
