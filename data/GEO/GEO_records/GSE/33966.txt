TITLE
Deep sequencing analysis of small non-coding RNAs reveals the diversity of microRNAs and piRNAs in the human epididymis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The epididymis in male reproductive system plays a crucial role in regulating the development of sperm motility and fertilizing capacity. Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), especially microRNAs (miRNAs), can participate in the regulation of various physiological pathways. However, their abundance and whether they are involved in the regulation of gene expression in the human epididymis are unknown. By adopting the Solexa deep sequencing approach, we systematically investigated the sncRNAs in the adult human epididymis. A total of 4,903 unique reads representing 527 known miRNA were discovered. Eighteen novel miRNA genes encoding 23 mature miRNAs were also identified, suggesting a complicated miRNA regulatory network. The expression of some of the novel miRNA was confirmed by qRT-PCR. The presence of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in the library also adds to the diversity of sncRNA population in the human epididymis. This research lays the foundation for the functional study of sncRNAs in huamn reproductive system.

DESIGN
The epididymis from a  26-year-old male who is healthy and fertile was deep-sequenced.
