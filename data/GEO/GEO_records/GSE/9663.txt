TITLE
Terbutyl stress TR

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription rate (TR) analysis of W303-1a yeast strain growing in exponential phase in YPD subjected to terbutyl stress Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Transcription rate analysis by means of GRO of three independent replicates the yeast strain growing in exponential phase. Each time point replicate has been hybridized on a different macroarray (F5-F10). A single DNA genomic hybridization from the same labeling reaction was done on the same macroarrays for normalization.
