TITLE
Guselkumab (interleukin-23-specific monoclonal antibody) demonstrates clinical and molecular response in moderate-to-severe psoriasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A gene expression profiling study was conducted in which skin biopsy samples were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization to microarrays from patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who participated in the phase 1, guselkumab first-in-human randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. At week 12, significant reductions in psoriasis gene expression were observed in guselkumab-treated patients.

DESIGN
Skin biopsy samples (n=59, LS: lesion, NL: non-lesion) were collected at baseline, weeks 1 and 12 following guselkumab treatment from patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis for RNA extraction and microarray analysis.
