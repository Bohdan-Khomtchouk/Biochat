TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of recombinant Synechocystis sp. 6803 provides important insights for understanding polyhydroxyalkanoate production in cyanobacteria under photoautotrophic conditions

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
The direct photosynthetic production of polyhydroxyalkanoate in cyanobacteria was improved by increasing carbon flux to biosynthetic pathway and introducing enzyme with higher activity. To understand the global transcriptional changes under photoautotrophic PHA biosynthesis conditions, RNA-seq analysis was performed.

DESIGN
Transcriptomes of recombinant Synechocystis sp. with different PHA-producing potential (three strains, two biological replicates for each strain) were analyzed.
