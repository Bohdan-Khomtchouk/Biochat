TITLE
Differential gene expressions of human pluripotent stem cells derived cells in different culture system

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human pluripotent stem cells (H9s) were differentiated into endothelial cells (ECs), neural stem cells (NSCs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in 2 dimentional, 3 dimensional PEG hydrogel and alginate hydrogel culture system, and we compared their differential gene expression in different culture system, respectively.

DESIGN
RNA deep sequencing H9s were maintained in E8 medium for routine culture. Then H9s were differentiated into ECs, NSCs and VSMCs in 2D, 3D PEG hydrogel and alginate hydrogel cell culture system according to their differentiation protocol. mRNAs were sequenced.
