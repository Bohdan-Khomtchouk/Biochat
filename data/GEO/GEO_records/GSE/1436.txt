TITLE
CEA_SGF:E00011#FGF6_effect

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
By using Hoechst staining techniques, we have previously shown that the C2C12 myogenic cell line contains a Side Population (SP) (Benchaouir et al, Exp Cell res, 2004) which is largely increased in the presence of FGF6 (Israeli et al, J Cellular Physiol, 2004). The experiment, compared transcriptional profiles from SP and MP (Main Population) cells from either C2C12 or FGF6-expressing C2C12.
