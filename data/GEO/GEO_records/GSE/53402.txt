TITLE
Hypoxic conditioned medium from human amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells accelerates skin wound healing through TGF-ÃŸ/SMAD and PI3K/Akt pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AF-MSCs) comparing normal condition-cultured AF-MSCs with hypoxia condition-culture AF-MSCs ES cells. The latter improves the proliferation and survival of AF-MSCs, and makes AF-MSCs secret more growth factors. Goal was to determine the effects of hypoxia condition on global AF-MSCs gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Nor AF-MSCs vs. Hypo AF-MSCs. Experimantal replicates: 2 (1-1 vs. 1-2; 2-1 vs. 2-2). Biological replicates: 2 normal replicates, 2 treated replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL13497 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
