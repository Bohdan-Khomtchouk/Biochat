TITLE
Small RNA-seq reveals miRNAs that may regulate pupal diapause in the flesh fly, Sarcophaga bullata

ORGANISM
Neobellieria bullata

SUMMARY
Small RNA-seq was used to identify miRNAs in pupal stage Sarcophaga bullata and to assess differences in the abundance of miRNAs in developing and diapause (i.e. dormant) pupae.

DESIGN
miRNA profiles in diapausing and nondiapausing pupae of the flesh fly, Sarcophaga bullata were discovered with RNA-seq using Illumina GAIIx. Six samples were sequenced with 3 relicate samples for nondiapause (NDH_LD) and 3 diapause (NDH_SD) replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL23019 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Neobellieria bullata)
