TITLE
Proteogenomic characterization of developmental defects in the forebrain resulting from hyperactivated mTOR signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hyperactivated mTOR signaling in the developing brain has been implicated in multiple forms of pathology including tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Here, we present an integrated analysis of transcriptomes and proteomes generated from wild-type and TSC1/Emx1-Cre forebrains. This led to comprehensive lists of genes and proteins whose expression levels were altered by hyperactivated mTOR signaling.

DESIGN
Comparative analyses of data from wild-type (WT) and TSC1/Emx1-Cre forebrains revealed sets of genes and proteins altered by TSC1 knockout.
