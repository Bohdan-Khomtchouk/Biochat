TITLE
Gene expression signatures of HaCaT cell lines transfected with mutant TRPV3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified a number of affected pathways through transcriptome analysis on the skin biopsy samples of the FPPK patients. Our findings suggest that TRPV3 dysfunction may increase apoptotic activity, inhibit keratinocyte differentiation and disturb the intricate balance between proliferation and differentiation state of keratinocytes in the skin.

DESIGN
To understand the effect of TRPV3 mutation, transcriptome of HaCaT cell lines transfected with mutant TRPV3 were profiled in time-course manner (16, 24 and 40hr).
