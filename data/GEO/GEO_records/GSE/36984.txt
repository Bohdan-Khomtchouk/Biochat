TITLE
Expression Profiling of Primary Human Fetal and Adult Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs) and Differentiating Proerythroblasts (ProEs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To facilitate comparative genomic analyses of human fetal and adult cells undergoing erythropoiesis, we employed a serum-free two-phase liquid culture system to expand and differentiate primary human CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) ex vivo. In this experimental context, highly enriched populations of stage-matched, differentiating, primary proerythroblasts (ProEs) were generated. We selected four time points (day 0, CD34+ HSPCs; day 3, 5, and 7, differentiating ProEs) that represented similar stages differentiation for gene expression profiling using microarrays.

DESIGN
Primary maturing fetal or adult erythroblasts were generated ex vivo from CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) using a serum-free two-phase liquid culture system. Total RNA from primary fetal and adult HSPCs (day 0) and differentiating proerythroblasts (ProEs; day 3, 5, and 7) were extracted and used to hybridize to Affymetrix expression arrays using the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform.
