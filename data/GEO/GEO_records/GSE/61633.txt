TITLE
Expression data from citrus embryogenic calli with engineered carotenoid accumulation

ORGANISM
Citrus x paradisi ; Citrus x tangelo

SUMMARY
Carotenoids have been demonstrated to be indispensable plant secondary metabolites that are involved in photosynthesis, antioxidation, and phytohormone biosynthesis. Carotenoids are likely involved in other biological functions that have yet to be discovered. In this study, we utilized genomic expression investigation to gain a deep insight into the carotenoid-related biological processes in the citrus calli overexpressing CrtB.

DESIGN
Abortive ovule embryogenic calli from four citrus genotypes were used in this study. They were derived from Star Ruby grapefruit (C. paradise Macf.), Marsh grapefruit (C. paradise Macf.), and Sunburst mandarin [Citrus reticulata Blanco × (C. paradisi Macf. × C. reticulata)], designated as RB, M, and SBT, respectively. Engineered cell models (ECMs) were established by over-expressing 35S::CrtB (tp–rbcS–CrtB) [CrtB protein, phytoene synthase from Erwinia herbicola (now known as Pantoea agglomerans), containing a Pea rbcS transit peptide] in citrus embryogenic calli. Twenty-day-old calli were harvested and used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
