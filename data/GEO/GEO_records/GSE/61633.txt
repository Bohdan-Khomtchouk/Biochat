TITLE
Expression data from citrus embryogenic calli with engineered carotenoid accumulation

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Carotenoids have been demonstrated to be indispensable plant secondary metabolites that are involved in photosynthesis, antioxidation, and phytohormone biosynthesis. Carotenoids are likely involved in other biological functions that have yet to be discovered. In this study, we utilized genomic expression investigation to gain a deep insight into the carotenoid-related biological processes in the citrus calli overexpressing CrtB.
