TITLE
miRNA and mRNA profiling of tumor-educated macrophages (miRNA 2)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled miRNA and mRNA expression of in vitro tumor-educated macrophages (TEM) by indirectly co-culturing with estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates of untreated and co-cultured macrophages, parallel analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression

PLATFORM
GPL14767 Agilent-021827 Human miRNA Microarray G4470C (Feature Number version)
