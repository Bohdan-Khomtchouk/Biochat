TITLE
Next generation sequencing analysis of epididymal adipose tissue (III)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyze the contribution of alternative splicing to the transcriptional complexity in adipose tissue and the development of diet-induced obesity.

DESIGN
We use Next generation sequencing analysis of eWAT from control and Nova1 and Nova2-deficient mice fed with a high fat diet.
