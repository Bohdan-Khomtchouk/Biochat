TITLE
Gestational taurine supplementation of mice: effect on offspring gene expression in liver and skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Taurine is known to be important for fetal well being and to be able to prevent effects of a low birthweight phenotype when supplemented to pregnant dams. We hypothesized that gestational taurine supplementation would affect gene expression level in 4w offspring liver and skeletal muscle.

DESIGN
Pregnant mouse dams were subjected to different diet schemes from day 1 of pregnancy until birth. Pups were killed at 4 weeks of age and liver and quadriceps skeletal muscle taken out and frozen at -80C until analysis. Diet schemes: Normal Protein (20% casein; NP), Normal Protein + taurine (1% taurine supplementation in water ad libitum; NP+tau). The liver and muscle samples were normalized separately.
