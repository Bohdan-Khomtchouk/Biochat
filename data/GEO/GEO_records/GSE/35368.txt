TITLE
Deep-sequencing influences the results obtained in small-RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study presents a comparison of small RNA sequencing libraries generated from the same cell lines but using different sequencing platforms and protocols. The samples were analyzed and compared at the level of miRNAs expression and as a population of small RNAs derived from repetitive elements. Despite a good correlation between sequencing platforms, there are qualitative and quantitative variations in the results depending on the protocol used.

DESIGN
10 samples were examined: 6 from the ES E14 XY cell type: 1 454, 2 SOLiD from 2 technological versions, and 3 SOLEXA from 3 different protocols, and 4 samples from ES PGK XX cells: 1 454 and 1 SOLEXA sample, and 2 SOLiD samples from 2 technological versions.
