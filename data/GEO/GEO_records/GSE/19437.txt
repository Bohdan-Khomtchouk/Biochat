TITLE
Identification of Exposure Biomarkers for Mutagenic Carcinogens in Complex Environmental Matrices

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated an in vitro experimental exposure model of the MutaMouse flat epithelial (FE1) cells exposed to a complex mixture of carcinogenic PAHs known as coal tar (SRM 1597a) using an Agilent 22k, oligo mouse array platform. Keywords: Toxicology, biomarkers discovery, stress response, complex mixture of carcinogens, PAHs

DESIGN
The FE1 cells were exposed to two different sub-toxic concentrations of coal tar (SRM 1597a): 1 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml in a serum free media. After 6h exposure, the cells were washed twice with PBS and re-incubated in fresh media without coal tar. After 4h and 8h incubation, the media were collected for proteomic experiment and the cells were collected from the petri dishes for RNA extraction.

PLATFORM
GPL2881 Agilent-013326 Mouse Oligo Microarray (V2) G4121B (Feature Number version)
