TITLE
Identification of Exposure Biomarkers for Mutagenic Carcinogens in Complex Environmental Matrices

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated an in vitro experimental exposure model of the MutaMouse flat epithelial (FE1) cells exposed to a complex mixture of carcinogenic PAHs known as coal tar (SRM 1597a) using an Agilent 22k, oligo mouse array platform. Keywords: Toxicology, biomarkers discovery, stress response, complex mixture of carcinogens, PAHs
