TITLE
Transcriptional responses of human synovial fibroblasts to TNF and TNF+IL-17

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identify transcriptional factors responsible for cytokine and chemokine production by fibroblasts Genes whose expression levels after TNF + IL-17 stimulation were more than 2 fold over TNF alone, across all four fibroblasts lines, include four transcription factors, namely EHF, ELF3, CEBPD and STAT4.

DESIGN
Four primary human fibroblast lines were used, two were derived from osteoarthritis (OA) and the other two were from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. As TNF and IL-17 combined stimulation resulted in a significantly enhanced production of IL-6 compared to TNF alone, we hypothesized that some transcription factors involved in IL-6 expression would likely have higher expression levels under the TNF + IL-17 combined stimulation.
