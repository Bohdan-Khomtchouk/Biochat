TITLE
Expression data from 35S:miR396b plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcript profile of  apices of 20 days-old Arabidopsis plants over expressing miR396b. We used ATH1 Affymetrics microarrays to obtain the transcription profile of plants overexpressing miR396b.

DESIGN
We compared the transcriptome of 35S:miR396b plants vs wild-type plants (Col-0 accession), using ATH1 Affymetrics microarrays. For these experiments we collected vegetative apices together with the leaf primordia from plants of 20 days growth in short-day. For each genotype (Col-0, 35S:miR396b)  we collected two samples.
