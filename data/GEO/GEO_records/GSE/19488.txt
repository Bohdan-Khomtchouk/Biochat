TITLE
Down-regulated Genes in Mouse Dental Papillae and Pulp

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goal of experiment: Identify genes down-regulated between pre- and post-natal stages in mouse dental papillae. Epithelial-mesenchymal interaction is very important during tooth development, and many genes are associated with odontogenesis.  The capacity for odontogenesis in mouse dental papillae disappears between the pre- and post-natal stages.  We hypothesized that genes involved in odontogenesis were down-regulated in dental papillae between these stages.  To test this hypothesis, we investigated and compared gene profiles in pre- and post-natal stage dental papillae with the GeneChipÂ® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.

DESIGN
Experimental factors: tooth development (odontogenesis)
