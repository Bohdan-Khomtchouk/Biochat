TITLE
Adenine-induced chronic renal failure causes decreased aortic relaxation rate and altered expression of genes involved in excitation-contraction coupling in vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rats with adenine-induced chronic renal failure (A-CRF) develop a reduction in the rate of relaxation of the thoracic aorta. The primary aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this abnormality. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received either chow containing adenine or were pair-fed with normal chow (controls). After 8-14 weeks arterial functions were analyzed ex vivo using wire myography and the thoracic aorta was analyzed by DNA microarray. Plasma creatinine levels were elevated ~8-fold in A-CRF rats. The rate of vascular relaxation following wash-out of KCl was reduced in A-CRF rats vs. controls in the thoracic aorta (P < 0.01), abdominal aorta (P < 0.05), and common carotid artery (P < 0.05), but not in the common femoral artery. Endothelial denudation exaggerated the impairment in relaxation of thoracic aortas. Relaxation rates of thoracic aortas increased (P < 0.01), but were not normalized, in response to wash-out of KCl with Ca2+-free buffer. Microarray and qRT-PCR analyses revealed altered gene expression levels for a number of genes involved in vascular smooth muscle cell excitation-contraction coupling in aortas of A-CRF rats. In conclusion, rats with A-CRF show a marked reduction in the rate of relaxation of larger conduit arteries localized proximal to the common femoral artery. This abnormality may be caused by reduced cytosolic Ca2+ clearance in vascular smooth muscle cells secondary to dysregulation of genes involved in excitation-contraction coupling.
