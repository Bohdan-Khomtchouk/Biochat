TITLE
C/EBPα poises B cells for rapid reprogramming into iPS cells [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C/EBPα induces transdifferentiation of B cells into macrophages at high efficiencies and enhances reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) when co-expressed with Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and Myc (OSKM). However, how C/EBPα accomplishes these effects is unclear. We now found that transient C/EBPα expression followed by OSKM activation induces a 100 fold increase in iPSC reprogramming efficiency, involving 95% of the cells. During this conversion pluripotency and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes become dramatically up-regulated and 60% of the cells express Oct4 within 2 days. C/EBPα acts as a pathbreaker since it transiently makes the chromatin of pluripotency genes more accessible to DNase I. It also induces the expression of the dioxygenase Tet2 and promotes its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to regulatory regions of pluripotency genes that become demethylated following OSKM induction. In line with these findings, overexpression of Tet2 enhances OSKM‐induced B cell reprogramming. Since the enzyme is also required for efficient C/EBPα-induced immune cell conversion, our data suggest that Tet2 provides a mechanistic link between iPSC reprogramming and B cell transdifferentiation. The rapid iPS reprogramming approach described should help to fully elucidate the process and has potential clinical applications.
