TITLE
Analyzing the cytoskeletal transcriptome: sex differences in rat hypothalamus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The transcriptomes of young male and (in estrus) female hypothalami were profiled and compared to learn about the sex dichotomy of the cytoskeletal genomic fabric(CGF), defined as the most inter-coordinately and stably expressed gene web whose encoding proteins form the intracellular scaffolding.

DESIGN
RNA samples collected from hypothalami of 4 young rat males and 4 (in estrus) females were hybridized with Agilent rat (4x44k 60 mer features, 4 microarrays per slide) gene expression chips. Novel analytical tools were used to reveal hidden features of the cytoskeletal transcriptome

PLATFORM
GPL14745 Agilent-028282 Whole Rat Genome Microarray 4x44K v3 (Feature Number version)
