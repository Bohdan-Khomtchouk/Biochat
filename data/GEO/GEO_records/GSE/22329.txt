TITLE
Innate signature induced in human mDCs by dengue vaccine candidates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sanofi Pasteur is developing a tetravalent YFV 17D vaccine-based chimeric dengue vaccine (TV CYD), which is currently in clinical phase 3 development. DNA microarrays were used to assess the innate gene signature in human mDCs infected with the four CYDs alone or in combination, with a wild type dengue serotype 3 virus, or with a classically attenuated serotype 3 virus (VDV3) shown to be reactogenic in humans. We observed a very reproducible signature for each of the 4 CYDs, involving stimulation of Type I IFN genes and associated genes, together with genes encoding chemokines and other mediators involved in the initiation of adaptive responses. In contrast, the wt DEN3 virus induced a predominantly inflammatory profile, while VDV3 appeared to induce a blunted response, which may have contributed to its clinical outcome.

DESIGN
All oligochip experiments were performed in dye swap. For each experiment, the gene expression profile of infected cells was compared with the corresponding profile of uninfected cells. 2 biologicals replicates were performed for each virus.
