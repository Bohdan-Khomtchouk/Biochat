TITLE
Expression data from CTL and Tc17 cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goal of this study was to compare transcriptional changes in CTL cells compared to Tc17 cells We used microarray to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying CTL and Tc17 cell differentiation and identified distinct classes of upregulated genes thereby

DESIGN
WT naive CD8+ T cells were isolated and differentiated for 2 days towards CTL or Tc17 phenotype. Thereafter RNA was isolated and hybridised on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
