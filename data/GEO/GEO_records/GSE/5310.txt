TITLE
hGRβ: Elucidation of its Role in Transcriptional Regulation and Identification of a Ligand

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is expressed as two alternately spliced Cterminal isoforms: α and β. In contrast to the canonical hGRα, hGRβ is constitutively nuclear, is not thought to bind ligand, and is believed to affect gene transcription only by acting as a dominant negative to hGRα.   Microarray analysis indicated that hGRβ, expressed in the absence of hGRα, can regulate gene expression, and furthermore, occupation of hGRβ with the antagonist RU-486 diminishes that capacity. Keywords: cell type comparison
