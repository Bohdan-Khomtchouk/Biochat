TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis of alveolar macrophages from normal and fibrotic mouse lungs

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profiling of alveolar macrophages from mice that were intratracheally instilled with saline or bleomycin. We identified a number of differentially expressed genes in the two groups of cells.

DESIGN
