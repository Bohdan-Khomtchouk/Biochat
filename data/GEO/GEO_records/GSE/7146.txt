TITLE
Effect of insulin infusion on human skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify insulin responsive genes in humans, in the first protocol, skeletal muscle biopsies from six non-diabetic subjects were obtained before and after a two-hour of hyperinsulinaemic (infusion rate 40 mU/m2/min) euglycemic clamp. A variable infusion of glucose (180 g/l) enriched with tritiated glucose (100 Î¼Ci/500 ml) maintained euglycemia during insulin infusion, with monitoring of plasma glucose concentration every 5 to 10 min during the basal and clamp periods using an automated glucose oxidation method (Glucose Analyzer 2, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). In the second protocol, skeletal muscle biopsies from six non-diabetic subjects were obtained before and after a 3-hour hyperinsulinemic (infusion rate 40 mU/m2/min) euglycemic clamp in order to increase the effects of insulin on gene expression. A variable infusion of glucose (180 g/l) was used to maintain euglycemia during insulin infusion with monitoring of plasma glucose concentration every 5 to 10 min using an automated glucose oxidation method (Glucose Analyzer 2, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Keywords: dose response

DESIGN
The muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle under local anesthesia before and after hyperinsulinaemic (infusion rate 40 mU/m2/min) euglycemic clamp
