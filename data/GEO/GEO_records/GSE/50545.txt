TITLE
Embelin induced differential gene expression in A549 lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Embelin (15 uM) induced alterations in the gene expression profile was studied in A549 lung cancer cells during the initial stages of apoptosis  (4h following treatment)

DESIGN
As embelin (15 uM) induces apoptosis as early as 4h time period, we performed  microarray analysis to study embelin-induced differential gene expression as early as 4h to identify the responsible pathways.
