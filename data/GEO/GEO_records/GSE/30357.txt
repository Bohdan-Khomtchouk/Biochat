TITLE
Chip-chip from human diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines with IRF8

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IRF8, a transcriptional factor, has the heightened expression in germinal center(GC) B cell and GC-origin B cell lymphoma. To identify IRF8 direct targets in GC B cells, ChIP-chip ananlysis was done in three different GC-origin diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines. IRF8-negative cell lines, MMS1, was also used as a negatvie control.

DESIGN
IRF8 ChIP in three different cell lines (ODH1, VAL and LY1:high level of IRF8) and in one negative control cell lines (MMS1:negatvie for IRF8). Total four different samples. One sample per a set of two arrays (promoter1 and promoter2).
