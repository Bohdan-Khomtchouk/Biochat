TITLE
The mechanism of elevated S100A6 (Calcyclin) Enhances Tumorigenesis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Among all types of urological cancers, the clear cell renal cell carcinoma is the second leading cause of death in adults. This is mainly due to lack of promising prognosis or predictors, and effective target therapy. S100A6 (calcyclin), a member of S100 family of proteins, is reported to be elevated in many types of cancers. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of S100A6 in mRNA, in proteins and tissues. The mechanism of enhancing tumorigenesis was studied to understand the role of S100A6 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma tumorigenesis. Microarray and bioinformatic analyses were performed in the stable transfection of overexpression and knockdown of S100A6, comparing with each empty vector control in order to find the different expression genes and explore the mechanism. The microarray analysis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma 786-O cell line treated with overexpression and knockdown S100A6.

DESIGN
Four samples: overexpression S100A6 sample and vector control sample, knockdown S100A6 and vector control sample, each sample had three replicates.
