TITLE
Expression data from 9-day-old rat Sertoli cells and MBP-treated rat Sertoli cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Low-dose MBP can stimulated 9-day-old Sertoli cells proliferation and activated proliferation related signal pathway. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Rat Sertoli cell were selected from rat testis for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the differentially expressed genes and miRNAs in 0.1mM MBP and  solvent treated Sertoli cells, respectively.
