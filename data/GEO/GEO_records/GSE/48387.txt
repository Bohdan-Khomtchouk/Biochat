TITLE
Comparison of KRas;Atg5fl/+ and KRas;Atg5fl/fl pneumocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Primary pneumocytes from KRas;Atg5fl/+ and KRas;Atg5fl/fl littermates were cultured for 48 hours and infected with AdCre-GFP to induce expression of the KrasG12D oncogene and concomitant Atg5 deletion. The transcriptional profile of those cells was determined by mRNA sequencing and uncovered differential expression in cellular movement, inflammatory response and oxidative stress response.
