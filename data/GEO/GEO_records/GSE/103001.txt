TITLE
Stranded RNASeq of human mammary primary tumors ER+ and paired adjacent healthy tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) represent at least 1/5 of the mammalian transcript amount, and about 90% of the genome length is actively transcribed. Many ncRNAs have been demonstrated to play a role in cancer. Among them, natural antisense transcripts (NAT) are RNA sequences which are complementary and overlapping to those of protein-coding transcripts (PCT). NATs were punctually described as regulating gene expression, and are expected to act more frequently in cis than other ncRNAs that commonly function in trans. In this work, 22 breast cancers expressing estrogen receptors and their paired healthy tissues were analyzed by strand-specific RNA sequencing to highlight the potential role of NATs in gene regulations occurring in breast cancer.

DESIGN
22 primary invasive breast cancer carcinoma expressing estrogen receptors and their paired adjacent mammary healthy tissues were analyzed by strand-specific RNA sequencing on a Illumina HiSeq.
