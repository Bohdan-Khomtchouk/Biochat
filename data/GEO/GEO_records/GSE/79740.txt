TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of signet ring cell colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of molecular subtypes of colorectal signet ring cell carcinoma based on differences in DNA methylation.

DESIGN
Using discovery (n=26) and validation (n=18) cohorts, a comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation was carried out using Illumina infinium450k arrays.
