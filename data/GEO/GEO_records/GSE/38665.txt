TITLE
Dynamic profile of gene expression in rice panicle under high temperature

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To comprehend the profile of rice gene expression at reproductive stage under high temperature, Agilent 4Ã—44k rice oligo microarray experiments were carried out using rice panicle of developmental stage 7-9 at 0min, 20min, 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, and 8hr after the treatment of 40 degree centigrade, and the significantly expressed genes mainly involved in transcriptional regulation, transport, cellular homeostasis, and stress response were identified. Among them, the predominant transcription factor gene families were Hsf, NAC, AP2/ERF, WRKY, MYB, and C2H2. KMC analysis discovered the time-dependent gene expression pattern under heat. The results of motif co-occurrence on the promoters of genes from an early up-regulated cluster showed the important roles of GCC box, HSE, ABRE, and CE3, and unraveled the possible cross-talk mechanism during heating. The response model central to ROS combined with transcriptome data indicated the great importance to maintain ROS balance in heat response in rice panicle and the wide existing of cross-talks.

DESIGN
Heat shock induced gene expression in rice panicle of developmental stage 7-9 was measured at 0min, 20min, 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, and 8hr after the treatment of 40 degree centigrade in plant growth chamber. Two independent replicate experiments were performed at each time point.
