TITLE
Expression profiles of field-grown wheat expressing the Pm3 allele and null segregants

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
It has been demonstrated that wheat overexpressing Pm3b, an allele of the R gene Pm3, has enhanced resistance against powdery mildew under field conditions. A gene expression profile study using GeneChipÂ® Wheat Genome Array was performed to obtain insights into the mode of action of Pm3b and to elucidate the molecular basis of pleiotropic effects observed in three out of four independent transgenic events tested under field conditions.

DESIGN
24 samples were analyzed. Three biological replicates of each sample were included. Two independent transformation events and respective null segregants as control treated with fungicide or artificially inoculated with powdery mildew.

PLATFORM
