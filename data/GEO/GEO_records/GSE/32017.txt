TITLE
Molecular profiling of human mammary gland links breast cancer risk to a p27+ cell population with progenitor characteristics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression, DNA and histone methylation profiles were performed on multiple cell types purified from normal human nulliparous and parous breast tissue using SAGE-seq, MSDK-seq and ChIP-seq [GSE26141].

DESIGN
SAGE-seq, MSDK-seq and ChIP-seq libraries were made from individual cell types and integrated to find a comprehensive view of parity associated changes.
