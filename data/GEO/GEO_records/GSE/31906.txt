TITLE
Genome wide gene expression profiles of distal colon from 5% DSS-treated mice after administration of various siRNA against TNFa.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression assessed in siTNF-OMe-P treated animals showed significant correlation between improved colon integrity and clinical parameters of colitis with reduced TLR activation, tissue regeneration and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, as compared to all treatment groups. This data shows the changes in gene expression profile associated with effective silencing of TNFa by a chemically-modified siRNA in the colon of colitic mice.

DESIGN
We performed genome-wide gene expression profiling of 5% DSS-treated mice after intrarectal administration of a)siRNA against TNFa (siTNF), b)siRNA against TNFa modified with O-Methyl nucleotides (siTNF-OMe), c)siRNA against TNFa modified with O-Methyl-propanediol nucleotides (siTNF-OMe-P) and d) siControl (scrambled siRNA).
