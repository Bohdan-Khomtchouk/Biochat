TITLE
GM-CSF-mediated granulopoiesis is regulated by the transcription factor STAT5A/B

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GM-CSF controls the development of granulocytes but little is known about the contribution of the downstream mediating transcription factor STAT5A/B.  To elucidate this pathway, we generated mice lacking the Stat5a and 5b genes in blood cells.  Peripheral neutrophils were decreased and administration of 5-FU and GM-CSF failed to induce granulopoiesis in Stat5a/b-mutant mice. GMPs were isolated and cultured with GM-CSF.  Both the number and size of STAT5A/B-null colonies were reduced and GM-CSF-induced survival of mature STAT5A/B-null neutrophils was impaired.  Time-lapse cinematography and single cell tracking of GMPs revealed that STAT5A/B-null cells were characterized by a longer generation time and an increased cell death.  Gene expression profiling experiments suggested that STAT5A/B directs GM-CSF signaling through the regulation of cell survival genes.

DESIGN
Mice lacking or with  the Stat5a and 5b genes in blood cells, which were treated w/o GMP
