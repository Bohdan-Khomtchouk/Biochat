TITLE
Gene expression in failing and non-failing atrial canine myocardium

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Gene expression in right atrial myocardium was compared between non-failing control and tachypaced dogs (heart failure was induced by tachycardic pacing for 6 weeks).

DESIGN
Dyssynchronous heart failure (DHF): One week after ablation of the left bundle branch, animals were paced at 200 beats per minute for 6 weeks from the right atrium (via epicardial pacing leads). Control dogs (NF): No heart failure, no pacing, no left bundle branch block.

PLATFORM
GPL7543 Agilent-013807 C. familiaris (Dog) Oligo Microarray G2519A option 004
