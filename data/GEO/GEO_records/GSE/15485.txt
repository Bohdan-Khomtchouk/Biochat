TITLE
RamA as a global regulator for gene expression in Salmonella Typhimurium

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
RamA, a 113-amino-acid regulatory protein, belongs to the AraC-XylS transcriptional activator family. Here, the network of genes regulated by RamA was investigated by determining changes in transcript profiles when ramA gene was knocked out from wild type LTL strain, which expresses ramA constitutively.

DESIGN
Analysis used aerobic log-phase state RNA from S. Typhimurium strain LTL (ciprofloxacin MIC: 4 Âµg/ml) derived from S. Typhimurium LT2 by in vitro-induction using ciprofloxacin as control samples for comparison to the experimental samples taken from its mutant strain, LTLvramA with ramA-deletion. Six biological replicates were used for the experiment.Two replicates for each sample. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL5869 JCVI PFGRC Salmonella typhimurium 25K v5 array designed primarily based on strain CT18
