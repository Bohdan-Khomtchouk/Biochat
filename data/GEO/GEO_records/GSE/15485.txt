TITLE
RamA as a global regulator for gene expression in Salmonella Typhimurium

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium

SUMMARY
RamA, a 113-amino-acid regulatory protein, belongs to the AraC-XylS transcriptional activator family. Here, the network of genes regulated by RamA was investigated by determining changes in transcript profiles when ramA gene was knocked out from wild type LTL strain, which expresses ramA constitutively.
