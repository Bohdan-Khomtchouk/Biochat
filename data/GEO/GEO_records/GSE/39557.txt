TITLE
Expression data from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
3 Cell lines from Apc, p53 (AP) GEMMs were compared to 12 cell lines from Apc, Kras, p53 (AKP) GEMMs. Mouse 430 2.0 arrays were used to determine genomic expression differences between the two genotypes (AP and AKP).

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 3 AP and 10 AKP cell lines using the Qiagen RNEasy kit, and hybridized to individual Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 chips as per manufacturer's instructions

PLATFORM
