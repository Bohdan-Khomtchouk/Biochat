TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic profiling of unstimulated and inflamed HUVEC exposed to apple procyanidin oligomers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate changes in gene expression of human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to an apple extract enriched in procyanidins of low-medium molecular weight (dp3.9) to determine possible protective effects induced by these plant derived compounds on the endothelial cells. Keywords: Comparative gene expression, Control vs Treated cells (response to exposure with xenobiotics plant polyphenols)
