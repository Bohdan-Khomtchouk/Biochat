TITLE
Expression data from GLUT4 overexpression in FaDu head and neck cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that GLUT4 up-regulation significantly increased cell migration and invasion in lower magligance head and neck cancer cell lines in vitro. We used microarrays to analyze the GLUT4 regulated gene expression underlying invasion-metastasis cascade.

DESIGN
FaDu head and neck squamous cancer cells with GLUT4 overexpression were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
