TITLE
BioProject PRJNA381064: Convergent origination of a Drosophila-like dosage compensation mechanism in a reptile lineage (Allelic Gene Expression in Anolis carolinensis, single-cell RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Anolis carolinensis

SUMMARY
In order to rule out the presence of random X inactivation in A. carolinensis females we generated scRNA-Seq from liver cells and genome sequence data from liver.

DESIGN
Call of heterozygous SNPs of exonic regions in genomic DNA (liver); call of expressed (allelic) SNPs from 6 liver cells of the same specimen.

PLATFORM
GPL15001 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Anolis carolinensis) GPL23678 Illumina MiSeq (Anolis carolinensis)
