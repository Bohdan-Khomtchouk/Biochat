TITLE
Evolution of microRNA expression at the onset of drosophila metamorphosis by mRNA

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We found two lines of evidence suggesting that miRNA abundance has been shaped by different evolutionary regimes at the two developmental stages attributed to functional constraints, which points to mechanisms more subtle and diverse than previously thought.

DESIGN
4 genotypes and 2 developmental states were investigated in this study, each with 3 biological replicates, so a total of 24 (4x2x3) hybridizations were conducted. Differential analysis between genotypes or sexes were analyzed.
