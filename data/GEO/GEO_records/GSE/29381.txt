TITLE
Chip-chip from Human Pulmonary Fibroblasts with H3K9me2 antibody

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone modification H3K9me2 is associated heterochromatin and gene silencing, but the relationship between DNA methylation and H9K9me2 havenâ€™t been checked in a genome-wide scale. This dataset was generated to compare with genome-wide DNA methylation data.

DESIGN
Genome-wide distribution of H3K9me2 in human fibroblasts was mapped using ChIP-chip.
