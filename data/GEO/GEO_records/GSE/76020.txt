TITLE
Expression data of cDNA from the ACHN control and Kindlin-2-depleting cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Kindlin-2, an integrin-interacting FERM-domain-containing protein, has been known to play critical roles for tumor progression. However, the role of Kindlin-2 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progression has not been reported. We aim to investigate the role of Kindlin-2 in the progression of RCC and the underlying mechanisms. To uncover the related pathway in which Kindlin-2 is involved to promote clear cell renal cell carcinoma progression, ACHN control and Kindlin-2-depleting cells were analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.

DESIGN
ACHN cells were transfected with control short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or Kindlin-2 shRNA. ACHN control and Kindlin-2-depleting cells cDNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Data were analyzed by Expression Console 1.4.1.
