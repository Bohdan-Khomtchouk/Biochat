TITLE
Global transcript analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with meat tenderness in pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 32 muscles (n=16 semimembranosus,n=16 longisimus dorsi) of two pig breeds (Pu≈Çawska and Polish Landrace), which are differing in firmness. The differences between pig groups with respect to shear force of coocked meat were significant and amounted to 64.88 N (P < 0.01) in longisimus dorsi and 14.8 N (P < 0.05) for semimembranosus.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels between pig breeds differing in shear force. Project ID: 217776 founded National Science Centre (NCN), title: Application of targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) in the identification of genetic markers associated with the pork quality

PLATFORM
GPL21186 Illumina HiScanSQ (Sus scrofa)
