TITLE
Genome-scale DNA methylation maps of mouse chromaffin cells with or without Sdhb knock-out.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the analysis of DNA methylation in mouse chromaffin cell lines using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). We compared DNA methylation profiles of cell lines with or without a knock-out of Sdhb gene, showing that Sdhb disruption results in a hypermethylator phenotype.

DESIGN
Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of 4 mouse chromaffin cell samples (2 Sdhb wild-type and 2 Sdhb knock-out).

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
