TITLE
Degradome analysis in Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana

ORGANISM
Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana

SUMMARY
We performed one degradome sequencing for identification and characterization of novel microRNAs in Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana. Plant tissues of leaves, stalk, and flower buds frozen in liquid nitrogen were ground to fine powder using a mortar and pestle, respectively. Total RNA extraction was freshly prepared using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. About 50 μg of leaves with or without low temperature treatment, stalks and flower buds were taken separately and then mixed. The degradome library was constructed by the Genomics BioSci & Tech. Company following the manufactoring protocol. In brief, 200 μg of total RNA was passed though polyA column using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen). The 5'-RNA adapter containing a Mme I recognition site was ligated by T4 RNA ligase and further reverse transcribed to amplify the templates. After digesting with Mme I then ligated to a 3'-double DNA adapter, the products were amplified by additional PCR cycles and gel-purified for Illumina sequencing. The files contain the raw data of degradome sequencing.
