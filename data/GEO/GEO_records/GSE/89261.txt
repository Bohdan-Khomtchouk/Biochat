TITLE
Transcriptional response of small-intestinal lamina propria CD4+ T cells to bacterial colonization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptional profile of small-intestinal lamina propria (SI-LP) CD4+ T cells isolated from germ-free and mice monocolonized with Bifidobacterium adolescentis, SFB, and Nexabiotic (a 23-strain, Th17-inducing, probiotic mix).

DESIGN
CD4+ T cells were double-sorted from mice directly into lysis buffer.
