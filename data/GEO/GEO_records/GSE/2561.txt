TITLE
Mtb Rv2869c mutant/WT +/- detergent

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment is to examine gene expression controlled by Rv2869c in the presence or absence of detergent (Tween 80) in the culture medium. Keywords: parallel sample

DESIGN
Wild type Mtb and the Rv2869c mutant were grown either with or without the detergent Tween 80 in the culture medium. Each hybridization is wild type versus mutant with three biologic replicates (+Tw) or Two biologic replicates (-Tw). Each array contains two spots for each gene. Each condition (+/-Tw) contains one dye swap (WTCy3).
