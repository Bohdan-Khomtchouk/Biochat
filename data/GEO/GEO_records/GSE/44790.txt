TITLE
Transcription analysis of E. coli O103:H25 in co-culture with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron CCUG 10774

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O103:H25

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in E. coli O103:H25 in co-culture with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron CCUG 10774 compared to when E. coli is cultured individually.

DESIGN
A study using total RNA recovered from three separate co-cultures (E. coli O103:H25 and B. thetaiotaomicron 1:100) at OD=0.5, compared to when E. coli is cultured individually (5 separate samples including 1-3 technical replicates of each sample). Three separate samples are also recovered when E. coli is cultured in supernatant from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron at OD=0.5 compared to when E coli is cultured alone. A comparison is also done after treatment with Mitomycin C (MMC). MMC is added at OD=0.5. There are 3 separate samples from each group that are compared (co-culture versus E. coli grown individually, E. coli in supernatant from B. thetaiotaomicron versus E. coli grown individually).
