TITLE
Expression profile of porcine alveolar macrophages after in vitro stimulation with LPS from Salmonella typhimurium

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify porcine genes which expression was affected in vitro stimulation with LPS from Salmonella typhimurium. Microarray experiment was conducted to reveal genes being significantly differentially expressed in LPS stimulated versus unstimulated porcine alveolar macrophages from two from healthy pigs

DESIGN
The comparison was done LPS alveolar macrophages versus unstimulated alveolar macrophages sampled from two healthy pigs. The experiment was conducted as common reference design.
