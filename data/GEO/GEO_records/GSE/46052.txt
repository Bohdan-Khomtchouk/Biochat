TITLE
miR-17~92 Regulates Effector and Memory CD8 T cell Fates by Modulating Proliferation in Response to Infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling of Db-GP33-41 specific murine CD8 T cells following infection with LCMV Armstrong

DESIGN
Various in-vivo subsets of antigen-specific CD8 T cells were FACS sorted and analyzed for miRNA expression profiling. Samples were purified from either uninfected animals or after days 4.5, 9 and > 60 post infection with LCMV Armstrong.
