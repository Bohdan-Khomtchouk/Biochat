TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of naive and Listeria monocytogenes-specific CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The histone methyltransferase Suv39h1 silences transcriptional programs during CD8+-T cell differentiation The study explores the role of gene silencing by Suv39h1, a histone methyltransferase, that plays a critical role in heterochromatin dynamics.

DESIGN
Na√Øve littermate and Suv39h1-KO CD8+ T cells, and day 7 p.i. Kb-OVA+ CD8+ T cells (from Listeria m.-OVA infected mice), were isolated by FACS. RNA was isolated and analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays. microarrays (three mice per condition were analyzed).
