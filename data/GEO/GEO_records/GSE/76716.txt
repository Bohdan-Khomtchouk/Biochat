TITLE
Global transcriptome changes after nitrogen replenishment following a rapamycin treatment in S288c yeast strain

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C

SUMMARY
The study on the effect of nitrogen replenishment on the gene expression following a rapamycin treatment showed that the down-regulation of the glycolytic transcripts was generally suppressed after this treatment. This indicated that the TOR signaling pathway likely controls the expression of the glycolytic gene under these conditions.

DESIGN
Analysis used RNA collected at 30 min of the beginning of the alcoholic fermentation of S288C with NH4 addition and S288C with H2O addition (control) following supplementation with rapamycin (50 mM, addition 60 min before nitrogen or H2O addition). Experiments made in duplicates - dye-swap design
