TITLE
Celastrol treatment on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Celastrol has been shown to sensitize leptin receptor signaling and reduce ER stress. Current microarray data provide the gene expression profile in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) after Celastrol treatment compared with control.

DESIGN
Affymetrix microarray transcriptome analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) after Celastrol treatment

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
