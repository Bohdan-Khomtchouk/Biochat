TITLE
DNA methylation signatures of illicit drug injection and hepatitis C are associated with HIV frailty II

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset is used as replication set for Illumina 450k. Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of IDU+/HCV+ and IDV-/HCV- individuals for DNA samples extracted from peripheral blood. The Illumina Infinium Human DNA methylation 450 Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 480,000 CpGs. Samples included 216 IDU+/HCV+ and 170 IDU-/HCV- individuals. The goal was to identify genome-wide differentially methylated CpG sites between IDU+/HCV+ and IDU-/HCV- samples.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 405 DNA samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip. The samples were extracted from whole blood. The subjects including 100 IDU+/HCV+ and 305 IDU-/HCV- were recruited from the Veteran Aging Cohort Study. All subjects were inform consented and the study protocol was approved by Connecticut Veteran Affair Healthcare System IRB and Yale Human Research Protection Program at Yale University.
