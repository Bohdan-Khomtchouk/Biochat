TITLE
Modulators of Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation and Viability Identified by Short-Hairpin RNA Library Screening

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recovery of hairpins targeting a known prostate cancer pathway testing the utility of shRNA library screening in prostate cancer as a broad strategy to identify new candidate drug targets.

DESIGN
Two cell lines assayed  for 4 time points with a control and 2 experimental conditions.  Two to four replicates of each instance are provided.
