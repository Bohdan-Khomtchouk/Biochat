TITLE
Major Patterns of B Cell Gene Expression Changes in Response to Short-Term Stimulation with 33 Single Ligands

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the major patterns of changes in gene expression in mouse splenic B cells in response to stimulation with 33 single ligands for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h. We found that ligands known to directly induce or costimulate proliferation, namely, anti-IgM (anti-Ig), anti-CD40 (CD40L), LPS, and, to a lesser extent, IL-4 and CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG), induced significant expression changes in a large number of genes. The remaining 28 single ligands produced changes in relatively few genes, even though they elicited measurable elevations in intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP concentration and/or protein phosphorylation, including cytokines, chemokines, and other ligands that interact with G protein-coupled receptors. A detailed comparison of gene expression responses to anti-Ig, CD40L, LPS, IL-4, and CpG indicates that while many genes had similar temporal patterns of change in expression in response to these ligands, subsets of genes showed unique expression patterns in response to IL-4, anti-Ig, and CD40L.
