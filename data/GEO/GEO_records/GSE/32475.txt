TITLE
Hypothalamic DNA methylation changes during mouse suckling period

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigate the genome-wide DNA methylation changes in the mouse hypothalamus during the suckling period.

DESIGN
Hypothalami were collected from new born (P0) mice, or mice of 21 day-old (P21). Two-color experiment was performed as paired comparison of P21 vs. P0 with two biological replicates. Genome-wide DNA methylation changes from P0 to P21 were detected by MSAM. As a brief description of the MSAM: 500ng of genomic DNA was serially digested with SmaI and XmaI followed by an adaptor ligation and adaptor mediated PCR amplification and then cohybridization.
