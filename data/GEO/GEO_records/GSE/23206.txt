TITLE
NSCLC cells treated with Gefitinib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
About 10% of all NSCLC patients respond to gefitnib treatment and all of these patients will acquire resistance to the EGFR TKI. We used microarray to look at global gene expression changes in untreated cells vs gefitinib treated cells to identify key characters for the acquisition of resistance.

DESIGN
NSCLC cells, H322c, were cultured 4 days in media containing 1Î¼M gefitinib or 0.1% DMSO as a control.  On day 4, RNA was extracted and submitted for microarray hybridization.
