TITLE
RNA-Seq of SLNCR1 over-expression in the melanoma cell line A375

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq was used to profile transcriptional changes induced by overexpression of the long non-coding RNA SLNCR1, as well as mutant version SLNCR1 delta conserved and SLNCR1 conserved.

DESIGN
The A375 melanoma cell line was transfected with pcDNA3.1 (-) expressing either full length SLNCR1, SLNCR1 delta conserved, or SLNCR1 conserved.

PLATFORM
