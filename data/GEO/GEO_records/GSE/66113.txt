TITLE
siRNA induced silencing of CITED1 in HT144 human melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the function of CITED1 in melanoma, its expression was transiently down regulated using CITED1-targeting siRNA. The HT144 melanoma cell line was chosen as it had a relatively high level of detectable CITED1 mRNA and protein expression.

DESIGN
HT144 melanoma cells were transfected with 2 siRNAs targeting CITED1 (4 replicates each) and a negative control non-targeting siRNA (4 replicates). RNA was harvested at 48 h post-transfection.
