TITLE
MS2-affinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing (MAPS) reveals S. aureus RsaA sRNA targetome

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
The virulon of Staphyloccocus aureus is controlled by intricate connections between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators including proteins and small non coding RNAs (sRNAs). Most of the sRNAs regulate gene expression through base-pairings with mRNAs. Here, we have applied and adapted the MS2-affinity purification approach coupled to RNA sequencing (MAPS) to determine the targetome of RsaA sRNA of S. aureus, known to repress the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator MgrA. Several mRNAs were enriched with RsaA expanding its regulatory network. Besides mgrA, several of these mRNAs encode a family of SsaA-like enzymes involved in peptidoglycan metabolism and the secreted anti-inflammatory FLIPr protein. Thus RsaA behaves as an attenuator of acute infections and shows that MAPS can also be easily applied in Gram-positive bacteria for the identification of sRNA targetome.

DESIGN
Affinity purification of in vivo regulatory complexes coupled with high throughput RNA sequencing methodology or MAPS standing for “MS2 affinity purification coupled to RNA sequencing”. Identification of RNAs co-purified with MS2-RsaA in a S. aureus ΔRsaA strain. MS2 alone was used as control.
