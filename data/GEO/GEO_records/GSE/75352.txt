TITLE
A zebrafish melanoma model reveals emergence of neural crest identity during melanoma initiation [human cell line ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the distribution of H3K27Ac histone marks in multiple human melanoma cell lines with the aim of identifying super-enhancer regions and regions of interest.  Also performed ChipSeq for H3K4Me1 to identify active enhancers in a representative human melanoma cell line, A375.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K27Ac chromatin mark in 6 human melanoma lines. Examination of H3K4Me1 in one human melanoma cell line.
