TITLE
Transcriptional changes induced by bevacizumab combination therapy in responding and non-responding recurrent glioblastoma patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To identify transcriptional changes by RNA-seq in tumor samples, before bevacizumab combination treatment and after bevacizumab combination treatment in both responding and non-responding recurrent glioblastoma patients

DESIGN
Three comparison analyses were further performed: 1.) Paired analysis of pre- and post-treated samples from responding patients; 2.) Comparison of pre-treated samples of responders vs. non-responders; 3.) Paired analysis of pre- and post-treated samples from non-responding patients The sample 'characteristics: batch' represents a combination of the RNA-extraction date and the library-preparation date for each sample.
