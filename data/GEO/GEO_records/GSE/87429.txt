TITLE
Expression data from HCT116 cells following CTNNB1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression following CTNNB1 knockdown in HCT116 cells

DESIGN
We treated HCT116 cells with CTNNB1 siRNA for 48 hr, and collected RNAs for gene expression profiling.
