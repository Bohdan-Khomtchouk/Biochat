TITLE
Identification of candidate genes involved in SOD1G93A glial toxicity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand how the expression of a mutant gene that causes ALS can perturb the normal phenotype of astrocytes, and to identify genes that may have a role in their toxic effect on motor neurons, we used oligonucleotide arrays to compare the global gene expression profiles of glia overexpressing the mutant SOD1G93A protein with two different sets of controls: non-transgenic glia and glia overexpressing the wild type form of the human SOD1 protein (P < 0.001) .
