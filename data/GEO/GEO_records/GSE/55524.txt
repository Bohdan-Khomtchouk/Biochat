TITLE
Expression analysis of maize (Zea mays L.) genes in continuous light

ORGANISM
Zea mays subsp. mays

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in maize plants (standard maize line B73) in controlled conditions under continuous light. Tissues of the leaf elongation zone were sampled from plants well watered every 12 hours before and after lights on.

DESIGN
A nine chip (Biogemma Nimblegen Custom Array) study using total RNA recovered from three replicates (plants) sampled every 12 hours (1h before and 12 and 24h after lights on).
