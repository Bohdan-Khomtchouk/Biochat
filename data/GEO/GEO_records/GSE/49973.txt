TITLE
Gene expression of the mouse choroid plexus epithelium (CPE)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the gene expression of the mouse CPE. We isolated CPE cells from three mouse brains with laser dissection microscopy. Next, we performed RNA isolation, amplification, labeling and hybridization against 44k Agilent microarrays.

DESIGN
We performed the microarrays against a common reference sample, which was mouse RPE/choroid RNA. We performed 3 mouse CPE replicates from 3 different mouse from the same strain, namely C57BL/6 .
