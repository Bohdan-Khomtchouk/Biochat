TITLE
Spotlight and whole-plant far-red enrichment at sub-organ-specific level

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In dense stands,the earliest neighbor response is induced by touching,leading to shade avoidance. During light competion the R:FR distribution is not homogenous, leading to local differences in light quality (R:FR) within the same leaf. Hyponasty is induced by FR-signaling in the lamina tip,  which then induces local cell growth in the petiole base. Likewise, local touching of the leaf tip induces a similar phenoype. We studied gene expression in Arabidopsis, exposed to supplemental-FR in the lamina tip and in whole rosette plant. We harvested the lamina tip and the petiole base after 5h of the treatments (white-light, supplemeted-FR in the lamina tip (local FR) and rossete plants exposed to low R:FR (whole plant FR))

DESIGN
Plants were grown in single pots for 28 days (all light treatments). Gene expression measured in lamina tip and petiole base.
