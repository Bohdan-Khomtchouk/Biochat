TITLE
Gene expression changes in embryonic stem cells in response to Tcf15-E47

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We set out to identify genes that respond rapidly to overexpression of a Tcf15-E47 heterodimeric transcription factor in mouse embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
Dox inducible Tcf15-E47 mouse embryonic stem cells were exposed to dox for 0, 8, 12, 24h and samples collected in duplicate.  Control parental cells were exposed to dox for 0 or 8 h and samples collected in duplicate. Total 12 samples.
