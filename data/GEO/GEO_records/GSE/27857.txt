TITLE
Gene expression during seed coat development in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling during Arabidopsis seed coat development at 3 key developmental timepoints by using 2 mutant lines and their wild types. The data provides a globe view of seed coat development in arabidopsis can be used for identification of new gene candidates for seed coat development.

DESIGN
3 seed coat development stages, 4 lines (2 wild type + 2 mutants) of arabidopsis were sampled. 4 biological replicates.
