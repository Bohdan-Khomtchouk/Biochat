TITLE
Cardiac aldosterone and corticosterone regulated genes in mice with cardiomyocytes targeted mineralocorticoid receptor overexpression (MR-Cardio mice) and their controls (Ctrl mice)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inappropriate mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation is involved in cardiac diseases. MR binds aldosterone, but also glucocorticoids; the identity of the ligand responsible for the deleterious effects of cardiac MR activation is still unclear. Mice overexpressing MR in cardiomyocytes (MR-Cardio) and their controls (Ctrl) were treated for 7 days with aldosterone or corticosterone and a whole genome microarray analysis was performed.

DESIGN
Six-group experiment: Control mice (Ctrl), transgenic mice (MR-Cardio), Ctrl mice + aldosterone treatment, MR-Cardio mice + aldosterone treatment, Ctrl mice + corticosterone treatment, MR-Cardio mice + corticosterone treatment. Five comparisons: Ctrl vs MR-Cardio, Ctrl vs Ctrl-Aldo, Ctrl vs Ctrl-Cortico, MR-Cardio vs MR-Cardio-Aldo, MR-Cardio vs MR-Cardio-Cortico

PLATFORM
