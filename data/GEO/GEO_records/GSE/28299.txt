TITLE
Transcription profiling of Rab25 transfected ovarian A2780 cancer cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate potential mechanisms by which Rab25 contributes to tumor aggressiveness, we determined the transcription profile induced by expression of Rab25.

DESIGN
Twenty-four independent samples, 12 from pcDNA transfected and 12 from Rab25 expressing A2780 ovarian cancer cells were profiled on Affymetrix GeneChip HT-HG_U133A Early Access Array.
