TITLE
Bcl6 controlled gene expression in naïve CD4 T cells (Tf0)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression data from wild-type and Bcl6-/- naive CD4 T cells In order to find genes regulated by Bcl6 in follicular helper T cells

DESIGN
Naïve CD4 T cells were sorted from wild-type (WT) and T cell-specific conditional Bcl6-/- (KO) mice-- 8 samples, 4 WT and 4 KO
