TITLE
Sham-irradiated vs pool of sham-irradiated keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CEA_SGF:E00007# This set of experiments was made in order to perform time series analyses. RNAs from sham-irradiated cells at each time point were pooled together. We then hybridized sham-irradiated samples at each time point versus cDNAs obtained from the pooled RNA. Each time point was assessed with two independent dye-swap hybridizations. Keywords: time-course
