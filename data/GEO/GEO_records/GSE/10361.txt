Temporal Analysis of Platelets as Cytotoxic Mediators in Sepsis-induced Acute Lung Injury (ALI)

SUMMARY
ALI is one of the most common disease processes in adult and pediatric intensive care units and results in significant morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of ALI begins with a massive pro-inflammatory response likely mediated by as yet uncharacterized platelet/endothelium interactions with macrophage activation. This leads to a cytokine/chemokine cascade producing endothelial disruption. Neutrophilic infiltration of the alveolar wall and alveolar space with a concomitant procoagulant state develops. Despite the fact that inadequate understanding of ALI pathophysiology remains a barrier to effective treatment, novel therapeutics including ventilatory manipulations and anti-inflammatory molecules are beginning to improve the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease process. Keywords: Time Series Design, ALI - acute lung injury, ARDS - acute respiratory distress syndrome
