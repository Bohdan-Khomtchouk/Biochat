TITLE
ICI182780 effect on breast cancer cell in hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ER alpha positive breast cancer MCF7 cells were treated with ER alpha antagonist ICI182780 in normoxia and hypoxia. Extracted RNA was subject to microarray analysis. The goal of the experiment is to assess the ICI182780 effect on breast cancer cell in both normoxia and hypoxia.

DESIGN
MCF7 cells were treated with 1uM of ICI182780 in normoxia and hypoxia (1% O2) for 24 hours. Extracted RNA from duplicated biological samples was subject to microarray analysis.
