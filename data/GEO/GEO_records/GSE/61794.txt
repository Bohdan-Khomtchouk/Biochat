TITLE
PTEN suppresses neoplastic transformation of human neural stem cells by transcriptional repression of Pax7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our data throw light upon the effect of PTEN deficiency on gene expression, epigenomic modifications(H3K4me3, H3K27me3, 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine and 5-methylcytosin).

DESIGN
RNA-seq of NSCs-PTEN+/+ and NSCs-PTEN-/-; RRBS and TA-RRBS of NSCs-PTEN+/+, NSCs-PTEN-/-; H3K4me3 ChIP-seq of NSCs-PTEN+/+ and NSCs-PTEN-/-; H3K27me3 ChIP-seq of NSCs-PTEN+/+ and NSCs-PTEN-/-.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
