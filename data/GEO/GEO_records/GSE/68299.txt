TITLE
Regulation of histone methylation and gene expression reprogramming in rice inflorescence meristem

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Rice inflorescence meristem (IM) development is critical for panicle size and grain production. The transition from SAM to IM is an important development stage in rice. Here we report the application of ChIP-seq technology for profiling of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modification in SAM, IM, SDG711 RNAi IM and jmj703 IM which affect panicle size, respectively,  and besides, RNA-seq technology for detecting gene expression diversity betwwen SAM, IM and SDG711 RNAi IM. We found that genome-wide H3K27me3 modification vary between SAM and IM, and thouands of genes lost H3K27me3 in SDG711 and jmj703. Also, we found H3K27me3/H3K4me3 ratio was an important factor for the differential expression of many genes during the transition. Differential expressed genes were found between SAM and IM, 711RNAi and WT, repectively. Many important genes involved in  IM activity were repressed by SDG711-mediated H3K27me3 and some of whichâ€™s expressions were mis-regulated in SDG711 RNAi.

DESIGN
Genome-wide mapping of two histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) in SAM, IM, SDG711 RNAi IM and jmj703 IM, and mRNA transcripts in SAM, IM, SDG711 RNAi IM.
