SUMMARY
In mammals, ovarian folliculogenesis leading to the ovulation of completely mature oocytes is a long and complex process that is regulated at different levels. The mechanisms that underlie the selection of one or several dominant follicles as well as the regulation of the number of ovulating follicles are largely unknown. In this project, we proposed to study the genetic determinism that underlies the difference of ovulation rate between species (cattle and pigs).  Towards this purpose, we made a comparative transcriptomics study on granulosa cells.  Pig and cattle comparison was achieved by a transcriptome analysis with a 9K nylon pig microarray (GPL3729) on granulosa cells from either small healthy antral follicles (SHF) or large healthy antral follicles (LHF). The images were quantified using AGscan software and the data were managed with BASE software. Statistical analysis was performed using R software. Transcriptomic analysis on pig and cattle evidenced 252 differentially expressed genes (FDR5%) between the two follicle classes and/or the two species.     This research project which implicated three laboratories from INRA: « Laboratoire de Génétique Cellulaire » (UMR444-LGC) , « Station d’Amélioration Génétique des Animaux » (UR 631-SAGA) and « Physiologie des Comportements et de la reproduction » (UMR 85-PRC) benefited from both European funding through SABRE project and French ANR funding through  GenOvul project. Keywords: transcriptome analysis, pig, cattle, ovary, folliculogenesis, gene expression, cDNA microarray

DESIGN
The data were obtained from 21 RNA samples: 10 small healthy follicles samples (6 for sows and 4 for cows) and 11 samples for large healthy follicles (6 for sows and 5 for cows). They were hybridized on a 9K pig nylon microarray (GPL3729).
