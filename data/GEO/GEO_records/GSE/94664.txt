TITLE
Genes differentially expressed in long-term hematopoietic stem cells with latexin deletion [multipotent progenitor cells, MPPs]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Latexin is a hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells (HPCs) regulatory gene. Its deletion leads to the expansion of HSC and HPC population. The underlying mechanims are largely unknown. We therefore perfored microarrary analysis in HPCs with (Lxn-/-) and without (wild-type, WT) latexin deletion, and determined genes that were altered by latexin deletion. This led us to identify the molecular mechanims by which latexin regulates HSC function.

DESIGN
HPCs were immunophenotypically-defined as Lin-Sca1+c-Kit+Flt2+CD34+ (specifically named as multipotent progenitor cells, MPP) and sorted from bone marrow of WT and Lxn-/- mice. Total RNA was extracted and probed onto Affymetrix Gene Chip MoGene-1-0-st-v1 arrays. Three biological samples were obtained from each strain. Each sample contained nearly 100,000 LT-HSCs that were pooled from 10-20 mice. Microarray data were normalized by RMA method. The limma package(Smyth 2004) in R/Bioconductor was used to determine the differentially expressed genes.
