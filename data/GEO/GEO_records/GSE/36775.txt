TITLE
Genome wide analysis of pancreatic cancer cell gene expresison exposed to stromal pancreatic stellate cells in 3D gel matrix

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Capan1 (well differentiated pancreatic cancer cell line) was co-cultured with pancreatic stellate cell line (PS1) embedded in a 3D organotypic model and gene expression was analysed in comparison to cancer cells cultured alone without stellate cells.

DESIGN
Pancreatic stellate cells were embedded within a gel matrix composing collagen type I and Matrigel, and cancer cells were seeded on top. The gel was lifted on to metal grid after 24 hour and fed from below. Gels were harvested on day 10 and frozen sections obtained. The cancer cell layer on top of the gel was captured by laser microdissection for RNA extraction.
