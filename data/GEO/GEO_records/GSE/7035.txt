TITLE
Synergy between PPARgamma ligands and platinum-based drugs in cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PPARγ is a member of the nuclear receptor family for which agonist ligands have anti-growth effects.  However, clinical studies using PPARγ ligands as a monotherapy failed to show a beneficial effect.  Here we have studied the effects of PPARγ activation with chemotherapeutic agents in current use for specific cancers.  We observed a striking synergy between rosiglitazone and platinum-based drugs in several different cancers both in vitro and using transplantable and chemically induced “spontaneous” tumor models.  The effect appears to be due in part to PPARγ-mediated downregulation of metallothioneins, proteins that have been shown to be involved in resistance to platinum-based therapy.  These data strongly suggest combining PPARγ agonists and platinum-based drugs for the treatment of certain human cancers Keywords: Gene expression, change, synergy of interaction

DESIGN
Cells were treated with either DMSO/control, rosiglitazone, carboplatin or combination or rosiglitazone and carboplatin in duplicate for 24 hr. RNA was isolated and microarray analysis carried out by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Microarray Core.
