TITLE
Use of CGH microarrays to identify strain variable genomic regions in C. botulinum ATCC 3502

ORGANISM
Clostridium botulinum

SUMMARY
Comparative genomic hybridization microarrays featuring overlapping probes spanning the entire C. botulinum type A1 strain ATCC 3502 genome were used to identify regions whose presence are variable among a diverse panel of type A C. botulinum strains.

DESIGN
For each hybridization, the reference strain (C. botulinum ATCC 3502) was labeled with Cy5 and test strains were labeled with Cy3.

PLATFORM
GPL6392 CDC C. botulinum ATCC 3502 CGH 385k array version 1
