TITLE
Roles of Yap1 in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that Yap1 is dispensable for the maintenance of ES cells while Yap1 is required for the differentiation of ES cells using global gene expression profile

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis upon KD of Yap1 in ES and differentiated ES cells and overexpression of Yap1

PLATFORM
