TITLE
Transcriptiome of mouse erythroid cells (part2) poly(A)-

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report genome-wide maps of transcription in mouse erythroid cells. We used an approach to survey poly(A)+ (mRNA) (Transcriptiome of mouse erythroid cells (part1) GSE26877) and non-polyadenylated RNA separately. This provides an alternative framework for comprehensive transcriptome profiling in mammalian cells.

DESIGN
Examination of non-polyadenylated RNA in mouse erythroid cells  (Ter119+).

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
