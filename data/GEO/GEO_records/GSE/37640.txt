TITLE
Gene expression profile of TARDBP in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (SK-Hep1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TARDBP is TARDBP (TDP-43) is a DNA/RNA binding protein and was mutated in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, its function in human cancer has not been fully identified, yet.Thus, We carried out microarray to investigate the down-stream target genes of TARDBP after silencing TARDBP in liver cancer cell SK-Hep1.

DESIGN
To identify the role of TARDBP in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, we performed microarray after knocking down TARDBP in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (3 siLuc, 3 siTARDBP)
