TITLE
A single functional blast resistance gene Pi54 activates complex defense mechanism in Rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
To investigate the responses of resistance gene Pi54  at transcriptome level in  blast resistant transgenic rice line TP-Pi54 during infection by Magnaporthe oryzae, we studied the co-expression analysis using microarray  along with susceptible non-transgenic line Taipei 309 (TP). Suitable controls for both lines were used.  The comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes was conducted.

DESIGN
Total RNA from  the leaves of  mock inoculated non transgenic line Taipei 309 (TP) and transgenic line (TP-Pi54) along with challenge inoculated plants were isolated at 72 hours post inoculation. The samples  were analyzed in two different biological replications (A and B) making total eight samples.
