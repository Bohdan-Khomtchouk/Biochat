TITLE
Cellular and molecular characterization of the impact of laboratory setup on bovine in vitro embryo production

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression from expanded bovine blastocysts collected 7 days after fertilization and produced in vitro in two different laboratories using the same protocol.

DESIGN
Two different laboratories with same condition, site A blastocysts vs. Site B blastocysts, Biological replicates: 3 site A, 3 site B, protocol,extract and semen shared. Dye swap.

PLATFORM
GPL13226 Agilent-028298 Embryogene Bovine 45K microarray
