TITLE
Argonaute 2 binds directly to tRNA genes and promotes gene repression in cis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further our understanding of the RNAi machinery within the human nucleus, we analyzed the chromatin and RNA binding of Argonaute 2 (AGO2) within human cancer cell lines. Our data indicated that AGO2 binds directly to nascent tRNA and 5S rRNA, and to the genomic loci from which these RNAs are transcribed, in a small RNA- and DICER-independent manner. AGO2 chromatin binding was not observed at non-TFIIIC-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) III genes or at extra-TFIIIC (ETC) sites, indicating that the interaction is specific for TFIIIC-dependent Pol III genes. A genome-wide analysis indicated that loss of AGO2 caused a global increase in the mRNA expression level among genes that flank AGO2-bound tRNA genes. This effect was shown to be distinct from that of the disruption of DICER, DROSHA, or CTCF. We propose that AGO2 binding to tRNA genes has a novel and important regulatory role in human cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for AGO2 was performed from K562 cells using 2 commercially available monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and 5 replicates.  Replicates 1-3 were performed with Millipore 04-642, and replicates 4 and 5 were performed with Abcam 57113.  RNA-seq was carried out on 2 replicates of shMock and 2 replicates of shAGO2.  Lentiviral vectors GIPZ Lentiviral #RHS4531-EG271611.
