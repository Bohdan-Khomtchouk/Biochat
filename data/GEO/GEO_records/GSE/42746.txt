TITLE
A roadmap of cell-type specific gene expression during early stages of the arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) interactions between plants and Glomeromycota fungi primarily support phosphate aquisition of most terrestrial plant species. To unravel cell-type specific gene expression during early stages of Medicago truncatula root colonization by AM fungi, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling based on laser-microdissected cells. We used Medicago GeneChips to detail the cell-type specific programme of gene expression in early stages of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and identified genes differentially expressed during these stages.

DESIGN
Medicago truncatula Gaertn ‘Jemalong’ genotype A17 plantlets were grown in the climate chamber. Plants grown for the collection appressorial root areas (APP) and the corresponding non-appressorial root areas (NAP) were mycorrhized after 3 weeks and roots were harvested at 5-6 dpi.
