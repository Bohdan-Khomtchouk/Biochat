TITLE
Tailoring heated intra-peritoneal Mitomycin C for peritoneal metastases originating from colorectal carcinoma â€“  A translational approach to improve survival

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients with peritoneal metastases (PM) originating from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) are curatively treated by cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with Mitomycin C (MMC). We aim to improve patient selection and personalize treatment for patients treated with HIPEC by predicting MMC sensitivity. MMC sensitivity was determined for 12 CRC cell lines using two separate assays. Thirty-seven genes related to the FA-BRCA pathway, ATM-ATR pathway and enzymatic activation of MMC were correlated on expression array platform to MMC sensitivity. Low sensitivity correlated with a decrease in BLM (p=0.01) and BRCA2 (p=0.02) on mRNA expression level. Both genes are part of the Fanconi Anaemia-BRCA (FA-BRCA) pathway and therefore, functionality of the FA-BRCA pathway in cell lines was determined using chromosomal breakage assay and Western Blot for key protein FANCD2. However, FA-BRCA pathway functionality showed no correlation to MMC sensitivity. BLM was further analysed by staining for the corresponding protein with immunohistochemistry (IHC) on both CRC cell lines and patient material. In cell lines, weak intensity staining by IHC correlated to high sensitivity (p=0.04) to MMC. High BLM protein expression was significantly correlated to a decreased survival in patients after CRS and HIPEC (p=0.04). We are the first to have found a possible predictive biomarker for PM with CRC.
