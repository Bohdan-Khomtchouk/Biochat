TITLE
Revisiting the microRNA expression profiling of human intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA expression profiling of human nucleus pulposus derived from patients with IDD in comparison with those derived from cadaveric disc as normal control. We have identified the expression profiles of miRNAs in IDD using scoliotic nucleus pulposus as controls (GSE19943). It is noteworthy that scoliotic discs are not strictly normal discs. Therefore, the microRNA expression profiles were revisited using normal discs as control.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: control nucleus pulposus vs. degenerative nucleus pulposus. Biological replicates: 5 control, 5 degenerated, independently harvested (the same samples as in GSE56081). Four replicates per array.
