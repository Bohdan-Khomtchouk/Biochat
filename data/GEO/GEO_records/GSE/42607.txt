TITLE
Gene-expression profiles of primary cultures of cortical neurons and astrocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compare the global programme of gene expression in primary cultures of neurons and astrocytes. These data sets were compared to the expression profiles of other tissues, including pancreatic islets, in order to identify a specific neuroendocrine program in pancreatic islets.

DESIGN
Neurons and astrocytes were isolated from brain cortex and cultured in vitro for 7 and 20 days respectively. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Two biological samples from neurons and astrocytes were analyzed.
