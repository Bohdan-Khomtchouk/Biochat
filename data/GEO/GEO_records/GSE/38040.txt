TITLE
Transcription differences of Micrococcus luteus at late-exponential and stationary phase

ORGANISM
Micrococcus luteus NCTC 2665

SUMMARY
Investigation of transcriptomic changes in M.luteus at 12hrs and 24hrs.  Differences in fatty acid profiles of M. luteus at exponential and stationary phase is attributed to transcriptional changes of branched amino acid biosynthesis and degradation genes. This study is described by Pereira, J.H., E.B. Goh, J.D. Keasling, H.R. Beller and P.A. Adams in Crystal structure of FabH and factors affecting the distribution of branched fatty acids in Micrococcus luteus, which has been submitted to Acta Crystallographica Section D

DESIGN
A 6 microarray study using total RNA recovered from six separate control cultures of Micrococcus luteus NCTC2665 strain with 3 harvested after 12hrs of growth and the other 3 after 24hrs of growth.  Each chip measures the expression level of 2,374 ORF based on the draft genome sequence of Micrococcus luteus with ten 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with 3-fold technical redundancy.
