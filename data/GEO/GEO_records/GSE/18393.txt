TITLE
Gene expression of colon from control or VilCre;Ihhflox/flox mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ihh expression is required for intestinal stem cell niche development. Loss of Ihh leads to disruption of intestinal stem cell niche, which leads to abnormal stem cell development and epithelial cell differentiation.

DESIGN
3 paired control (C) and mutant (M) mice here harvested. Their colon tissues were analyzed using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0ST array Control and VilCre;Ihhflox/flox mice were harvested at p12 There are 3 pairs (total 6) samples: M1 and C1 are littermates M2 and C2 are littermates M3 and C3 are littermates
