TITLE
Study of the impact of G9a on DNA methylation in mouse embryonic cells [seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We explored the role of the lysine-methyltrasferase G9a in the control of DNA methylation during mouse embryogenesis. We provide maps of cytosine methylation by MeDIP and RRBS in G9a-deficient mouse embryos and ES cells, as well as ChIP-Seq profiles for H3K9me2 in embryos and RNA-Seq expression profiles in G9a-deficient embryos.

DESIGN
We prepared RRBS libraries from single embryos and mapped DNA methylation by RRBS in four WT and three G9aKO E8.5 embryos. We prepared RNA-Seq libraries from RNAs of single embryos and mapped the transcriptome of two WT and two G9aKO E8.5 embryos. We prepared H3K9me2 ChIP-Seq libraries from three independant ChIP experiments on eight pooled E8.5 embryos.
