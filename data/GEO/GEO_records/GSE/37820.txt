TITLE
Gene expression profile in MCF7 breast cancer cells after siRNA knock down of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Affymetrix microarray data was generated from MCF7 breast cancer cells treated in vitro with siRNAs against estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1).

DESIGN
Gene expresion of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) was knocked down in MCF7 breast cancer cells using siRNA. Then the gene expression profiles of these MCF7 cells, along with non-targetting control treated cells were analysed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays.
