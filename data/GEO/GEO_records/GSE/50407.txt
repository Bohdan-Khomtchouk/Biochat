TITLE
Oligonucleotide Array CGH Profiles of Breast Cancer Patients Treated with High Dose or Conventional Chemotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA copy number profiles can identify patients with a defect in BRCA1 or BRCA2. We previously showed that patients with a BRCA1 like profile benefit from intensified alkylating chemotherapy  (IA, 4 cycles 5-fluorouracyl (5FU), epirubicin, cyclophosphamide (C) + 1 cycle carboplatin, thiotepa and cyclophosphamide with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)). Presumably, this is because of the defect in error free homologous recombination DNA repair. Here we present an independent study IA chemotherapy (2 cycles induction, followed by ifosfamide, 12 g/m2; carboplatin, 900 mg/m2; and epirubicin, 180 mg/m2 with ASCT) versus anthracyclin-C (AC) or C-methothrexate-5FU  (CMF) regimens in high risk breast cancer.

DESIGN
DNA isolated from untreated resection specimens of 117 patients was labeled using Enzo labeling kit for array CGH and hybridized to a custom 135k Nimblegen platform.
