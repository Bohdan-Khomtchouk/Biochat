SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_2552 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of David MacAlpine. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: Analysis of copy number variation across modENCODE Drosophila cell line by high throughput sequencing.  We observe numerous copy number variations for the different cell lines, with each cell line having a distinct ploidy signature. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf Keywords: deep sequencing analysis
