TITLE
Blood based gene expression signature for diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: The immune system is a key player in fighting cancer. Thus, we seeked to identify a molecular ‘immune response signature’ indicating the presence of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and to combine this with a serum protein biomarker panel to increase the specificity and sensitivity for earlier detection of EOC.  Methods: Comparing the expression of 32,000 genes in a leukocytes fraction from 48 EOC patients and 20 controls, three uncorrelated shrunken centroid models were selected, comprised of 7, 14, and 6 genes. A second selection step using RT-qPCR data and significance analysis of microarrays yielded 13 genes which were finally used in 343 samples (90 healthy, 6 cystadenoma, 8 low malignant potential tumor, and 239 EOC patients). Using new 65 controls and 224 EOC patients the abundances of six plasma proteins was determined and used in combination with the expression values from the 13 genes for diagnosis of EOC.   Results: Combined diagnostic models using either each five gene expression and plasma protein abundance values or 13 gene expression and six plasma protein abundance values can discriminate controls from patients with EOC with Receiver Operator Characteristics Area Under the Curve values of 0.998 and bootstrap .632+ validated classification errors of 3.1% and 2.8%, respectively. The sensitivities were 97.8% and 95.6%, respectively, at a set specificity of 99.6%.  Conclusion: The combination of expression based and plasma protein based biomarkers in one diagnostic model increases the sensitivity and the specificity significantly. Such a diagnostic test may allow earlier diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer.

DESIGN
The expression of a blood cell fraction from 20 healthy controls and 48 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer was compared.
