TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana wild type mechanical damage (MD) vs herbivore wounding (HW)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (WT) comparing MD (mechanical damage) and HW (herbivore wounding). The differences in the biochemical responses to herbivory seen prompted us to search for less obvious differences between treatments using gene expression profiling. Biological replicates: 4

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, MD vs. HW Arabidopsis leaves of WT plants. Biological replicates:  4 biological replicates.
