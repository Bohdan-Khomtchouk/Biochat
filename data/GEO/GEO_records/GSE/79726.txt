TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 for nitrogen starvation response using RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942

SUMMARY
We reported transcriptome analysis of S. elongatus PCC 7942 for nitrogen starvation response by performing RNA-sequencing. As a result, we identified differentially express genes and confirmed physiological response changes for up or down regulation genes. among differentially expressed genes (p value < 0.01) during N starvation
