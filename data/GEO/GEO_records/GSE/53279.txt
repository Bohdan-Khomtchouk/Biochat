TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of HeLa cells treated with miR-15a, miR-16, miR-503 and control-miR

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To have a global picture of the targets of the miR-15 family, we assessed transcriptome changes, by deep-sequencing, of HeLa cells transfected with 3 members of the miR-15 family (miR-15a, miR-16 or miR-503) or a control miRNA (cel-miR-231). We observed a very extensive overlap between the genes down-regulated by these 3 miRNAs, as expected for miRNAs belonging to the same family.

DESIGN
transcriptmic profiles of HeLa cells treated miR-15a, miR-16, miR-503 and control-miR  were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
