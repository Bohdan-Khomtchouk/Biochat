TITLE
Candidate genes and pathways downstream of PAX8 involved in ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our goal was to identify candidate genes and pathways regulated by PAX8 that could be additional targets for the therapy of ovarian carcinoma. To reach this aim, we have determined the molecular profiles of ovarian cancer cells and in parallel of Fallopian tube epithelial cells by mean of a silencing approach followed by an RNA-seq analysis

DESIGN
Comparison of the transcriptome in normal Fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells and ovarian cancer cells with and without PAX8 silencing

PLATFORM
GPL18460 Illumina HiSeq 1500 (Homo sapiens)
