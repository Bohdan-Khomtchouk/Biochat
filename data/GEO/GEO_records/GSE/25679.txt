TITLE
microRNA profiling of mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue of differentially aged mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The data presented here is part of a study aimed to investigate whether the gene expression profile of Polycomb, Trithorax and interacting molecules might be related to different states of differentiative potential.

DESIGN
microRNA profiling (Exiqon miRCURY LNA array Version 9.2) has been performed on mesenchymal stem cells isolated from the inguinal fat pad of mice of 1 (n=2), 3(n=2), 6(n=2), 12(n=2) and 24(n=1) months of age.

PLATFORM
GPL11251 Exiqon miRCURY array
