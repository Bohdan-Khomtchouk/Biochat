TITLE
Wobbler modifier

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The vacuolar-vesicular protein sorting (vps) factors are involved in vesicular trafficking in eukaryotic cells. The wobbler mouse is an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Motoneuron survival and spermiogenesis are severely compromised in the wobbler mouse. The effect of the wobbler modifier in Chr. 10 on gene expression levels in testis. Keywords: cDNA array, Wobbler, testis

DESIGN
DNA chip technology has been exploited for RNA expression profiling analyses. Close to genome-wide microarrays were used for identification of changes in gene expression levels in testis. Pools of 3 individuals were used for hybridisation experiments. In total 12 chip hybridisations were performed including 50% dye swap experiments. (wt vs wr/wr; wt vs wr/mod; wr/wr vs wr/mod).

PLATFORM
GPL3697 GSF/IEG mouse array
