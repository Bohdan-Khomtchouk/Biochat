TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in human macrophages in response to infection with influenza A viruses expressing full length or truncated non-structural protein NS1.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in human macrophages infected with influenza A viruses expressing full length or truncated NS1 protein. The hypothesis tested was that C-terminal truncations of viral NS1 protein attenuate the capability of NS1 to limit activation of host antiviral and immune response genes. Cells were infected with influenza  A/WSN/33 viruses expressing wild type NS1 protein (WSN-230), NS1 protein of 220 aa long (WSN-220) and NS1 protein of 202 aa long (WSN-202) on non-infected (Mock)

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from macrophages after 8 hours of infection with wild type or mutant influenza A virus (multiplicity of infection = 2)
