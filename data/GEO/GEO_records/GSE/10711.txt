TITLE
arabidopsis ecotypes-Transcriptionnal response to potyviruses infection in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra06-05_potyvirus-ecotypes - arabidopsis ecotypes - Common and specific genes deregulated in response to various potyviruses in different Arabidopsis genetic backgrounds. - Four different Arabidopsis ecotypes were inoculated with one Potyviruse. About 4 weeks after sowing, the 6 expanded leaves plants were inoculated with the different viruses or were mock-inoculated. Seven days after inoculation, inoculated leaves were collected, RNA was extracted and virus infection controlled. RNA fron infected plants was then used for microarrays hybridization. Three biological repeat have been done and two dye-swap. Keywords: normal vs disease comparison

DESIGN
6 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
