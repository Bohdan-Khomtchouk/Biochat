TITLE
Expression data of Wnt3a stimulated K562 cells after CXXC5 overexpression or knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CXXC5 inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling pathway Impact of CXXC5 on Wnt stimulated gene expression in K562 cells

DESIGN
K562 cells were incubated with recombinant Wnt3a protein after overexpression (transient transfection of pEGFP-CXXC5 vector) or knockdown of CXXC5 (stable lentiviral infection of  CXXC5 shRNA (pLKO.1; clone TRCN0000144558 and TRCN0000142729)
