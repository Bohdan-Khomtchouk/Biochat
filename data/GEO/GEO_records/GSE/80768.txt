TITLE
Gene expression data from NRAS-driven CNS-PNET zebrafish brain tumors and normal brain.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Zebrafish CNS-PNET tumors were generated by activating NRAS in oligoneural precursor cells. Gene expression in the zebrafish brain tumors and normal zebrafish brain was analyzed by RNA-seq.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed on 7 zebrafish brain tumors and 8 normal brain samples on Illumina HiSeq 2000 using 50 Cycle Single-Read Sequencing v3 kit.

PLATFORM
GPL14875 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Danio rerio)
