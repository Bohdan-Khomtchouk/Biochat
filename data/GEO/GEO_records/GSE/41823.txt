TITLE
Gene expression in E18.5 Tex19.1-/- mouse placenta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray experiment to identify changes in gene expression in 18.5 day post coitum Tex19.1-/- mouse placenta. Tex19.1 is expressed in trophectoderm-derived cells in the placenta. Tex19.1-/- placentas are small and have defects in junctional zone and labyrinth layers of the placenta, Tex19.1-/- embryos exhibit intra-uterine growth retardation. Data provides insight into the changes in gene expression and cell composition in Tex19.1-/- placentas.

DESIGN
Six E18.5 Tex19.1-/- placentas (KO: four XX, two XY), four E18.5 Tex19.1+/- littermate control placentas (HET: four XX), and two E18.5 Tex19.1+/+ littermate control placentas (WT: two XY) are included in the analysis.
