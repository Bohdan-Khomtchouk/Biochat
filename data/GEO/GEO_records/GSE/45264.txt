TITLE
miRNA expression in classical Hodgkin lymphoma diseased nodes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine differential expression of miRNA in classical Hodgkin lymphoma diseased nodes compared to non-malignant lymph nodes, we used agilent microarray release 16 and quantile normalisation using Genespring GX software  to quantify and compare miRNA expression..

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 8 non-malignant lymph node and 14 classical Hodgkin lymphoma diseased node (6 mixed cellularity and 8 nodular sclerosing) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples
