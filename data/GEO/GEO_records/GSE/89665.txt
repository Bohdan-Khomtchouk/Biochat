TITLE
The molecular basis of CD4 T-cell help for the cytotoxic T-cell response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD4+ T cells optimize the cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response in magnitude and quality, by unknown molecular mechanisms. We here present the transcriptomic changes, resulting from CD4+ T-cell help during priming, as apparent in effector CTLs. This gene expression signature reveals that CD4+ T-cell help optimizes CTLs in the expression of cytotoxic effector molecules, but also in many other functions that ensure optimal efficacy of CTLs throughout their life cycle.

DESIGN
Whole transcriptome analysis of effector CD8 T cells primed in the presence or absence of CD4 T cell help after vaccination or virus infection, or treated with agonistic CD27 or blocking CD70 antibody after vaccination.
