TITLE
Insights into microbial modulation of host peripheral lipid and glucose metabolism using mouse gut organoids

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gastrointestinal microbiota is involved in the development of various diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, by affecting nutrient acquisition, energy balance, and metabolic signaling of the host. However, the underlying mechanisms of these host-microbiota interactions remain unclear. The aim of this study was to characterize effects of the microbiota on the host epithelium using a novel gastrointestinal model based on mouse organoids. We have explored the transcriptional response of organoids upon exposure to short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and products generated by two conspicuous members of the gastrointestinal microbiota; Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. We observed that A. muciniphila metabolites affect a large variety of transcription factors and genes involved in cellular lipid metabolism and growth, supporting previous in vivo findings. F. prausnitzii products exerted only a weak effect on the host transcription profile. While, A. muciniphila, and its main metabolite propionate, both stimulate fasting-induced adipose factor/angiopoietin-like protein 4 (Fiaf/Angptl4) and Ppar? expression, important regulators of lipolysis and satiety. This work illustrates that specific members of the microbiota and their metabolites differentially modulate epithelial transcription in mouse organoid lines.

DESIGN
Organoid culture: In short, murine (WT C57BL/6) small intestinal crypts were isolated and embedded in 250 µl Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and submerged in 500 ul basal culture medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, HEPES, Glutamax, N2, B27, N-acetylcysteine, and the murine growth factors EGF, noggin, and R-spondin-1 (ENR), as previously described (Sato et al., 2009. Nature 459:262–5). Organoids were passaged every 7 days with a 1:4 splitting ratio. Exposure to bacterial cultures and SCFA: A. muciniphila (ATTC BAA-835) was grown anaerobically at 37C in a basal liquid medium which contained (per liter of deionized water) the following: 0.4g KH2PO4, 0.669g, Na2HPO4 + 2H2O, 0.3g NH4CL, 0.3gNaCl, 0.1g MgCl2 + 6H2O, 10g casitone, 1mM L-threonine, 1 ml trace mineral solution, 5mM L-fucose, and 5mM D-glucose. F. prausnitzii strain A2-165 (DSM 17677) was grown anaerobically at 37ºC a liquid medium which contained (per liter of deionized water) the following: 10 g casitone, 2.5 g yeast extract, 4 g NaHCO3, 1 ml resazurine (0.1%w/v), 0.45g K2HPO4, 0.45g KH2PO4, 0.9g (NH4)2SO4, 0.9g NaCL, 0.09g MgSO4, 0.09g CaCL2, 2.5 mM acetate, 9 mM propionate, 1 mM n-valerate, 1 mM isovalerate, 1 mM isobutyrate, 0.28g KOH, 2.5 ml ethanol (95%), 10 mg haemin,, 10 ug biotin, 10 ug cobalamin, 30 ug para-aminobenzoic acid, 50 ug folic acid, 150 ug pyridoxamine, 1 g L-cysteine, and 25 mM glucose (Duncan et al., 2002. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 52:2141–6). The concentration of the following organic acids and sugars were determined in the culture medium before and after growth using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a Shodex Sugar SH-G and Shodex SH1821 column as has been described previously (Stams et al., 1993.  Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 59:1114–9): glucose, mannose, galactose, L-fucose, glucose-N-acetylglucosamine, lactate, formate acetate, propionate, 1,2-propendiol and butyrate. Overnight-grown cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 20 000 ×g for 10 min and supernatant was collected. At t=7 days after splitting organoids were exposed to 250 μl A. muciniphila supernatant, 250 μl unconditioned A. muciniphila culture medium, 85 μl F. prausnitzii supernatant, or 85 μl F. prausnitzii culture medium for 3 hours at 37ºC, prior to RNA extraction. 250 μl A. muciniphila supernatant and culture medium Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) sodium butyrate, sodium propionate, and sodium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) were administered at a final concentration of 5 mM. At t=7 days after splitting mature organoids were exposed to individual SCFAs for 3 hours at 37ºC, prior to RNA extraction. Data is presented from n = 4 independent biological replicates from one line of organoids. total RNA was isolated from mouse intestinal organoids exposed for 3h to SCFA and strain-specific culture medium: Am- (organoids exposed to A. muciniphila culturing medium), Am+ (A. muciniphila-conditioned medium), Fp- (F. prausnitzii-culturing medium), Fp+ (F. prausnitzii-conditioned medium), Ace (acetate), But (butyrate), Pro (propionate) and Con (standard organoid culturing medium).
