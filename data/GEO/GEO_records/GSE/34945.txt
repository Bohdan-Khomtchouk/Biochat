TITLE
Candidate SNPs association with APOC3

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ApoC-III is a proatherogenic protein associated with elevated triglycerides; its deficiency is associated with reduced atherosclerosis. Mixed dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated triglyceride and apoC-III levels and low HDL cholesterol level, with or without elevated LDL cholesterol, increases cardiovascular disease risk and is commonly treated with combined statin and fibrate therapy. We sought to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with apoC-III level response to combination therapy with statins and fenofibric acid (FA) in individuals with mixed dyslipidemia. Participants in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study examining response to FA alone and in combination with statin were genotyped for candidate SNPs. Association between genotyed SNPs and APOC3 response to therapy was conducted

DESIGN
We sought to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with apoC-III level response to combination therapy with statins and fenofibric acid (FA) in individuals with mixed dyslipidemia. Participants in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study examining response to FA alone and in combination with statin were genotyped for candidate SNPs. Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood was genotyped using a custom GoldenGate bead array encompassing 384 SNPs (Illumina). Multivariate linear regression and 2-way ANOVA for percent change in apoC-III level were performed between the groups receiving FA alone compared with FA+statin compared with statin alone.
