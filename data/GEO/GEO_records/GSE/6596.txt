TITLE
Comparison of gene expression data from human and mouse breast cancers: Identification of conserved breast tumor genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of our work was the comparison of human and mouse gene expression data and to identify a conserved breast tumor gene set. The results encourage the usefulness of transgenic mice as a model for human breast cancer formation and therapy. Keywords: Comparison of gene expression data

DESIGN
The aim of our work was to establish a database for breast cancer gene expression data in order to compare human and mouse breast cancer. We identified human and mouse homologues genes and compared the expression profile of 24 human breast tumors with six WAP-SVT/t breast tumors (WAP-SVT/t animals, line 8). Our studies confirmed the heterogeneity in gene expression of human as well as mouse breast cancer cells. However, 63 genes were found to be differentially expressed (upregulated: 40; downregulated: 23 genes) in at least 75% of the breast tumors of both species.
