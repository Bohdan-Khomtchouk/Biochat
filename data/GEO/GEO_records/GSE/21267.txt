TITLE
Expression data from CC10-rtta/teton-IL-13 tg mice fed with or without doxycycline

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Morphogenesis of epithelial tissues relies on the precise developmental control of cell polarity and architecture. In the early Drosophila embryo, the primary epithelium forms during cellularisation, following a tightly controlled genetic programme where specific sets of genes are up-regulated. Some of them, for instance, control membrane invagination between the nuclei anchored at the apical surface of the syncytium. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of regulated genes during EE.

DESIGN
CC10-rtta/teton-IL-13 mice were fed either with doxycycline or regular diet (Dox vs. NODOX). Esophaguses were collected and submitted to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
