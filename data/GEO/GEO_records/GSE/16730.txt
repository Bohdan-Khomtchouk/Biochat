TITLE
ChIP-on-chip from acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and clinical samples for H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and EZH2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone modifcations at the p15INK4b gene were compared in sample with p15INK4b DNA methylation vs. samples with no DNA methylation AML clinical samples without DNA methylation exhibit bivalent histone modifications at p15INK4b, while clinical samples with DNA methylation display lower H3K4me3 and retain H3K27me3

DESIGN
Comparison of AML cell lines and clinical samples with p15INK4b DNA methylation to those free of DNA methylation. AML cell lines KG-1, KG-1a Kasumi-1, AML-193 have p15INK4b DNA methylation. AML patient samples AML6, AML7, AML8 have p15INK4b DNA methylation.
