TITLE
LincRNA-p21 Blocks Somatic Cell Reprogramming by Sustaining H3K9me3 and CpG Methylation at Pluripotent Gene Promoters

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Through expression profiling and functional screening we have identified the large intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) as a barrier for reprogramming. LincRNA-p21 is induced by p53 but contrary to its role in the DNA damage response it does not promote apoptosis or cell senescence in reprogramming. Instead, lincRNA-p21 associates with the H3K9 methyltransferase Setdb1 and the maintenance DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 in separate complexes that are facilitated by the RNA binding protein hnRNP-K.

DESIGN
RNA-seq expression data during MEF to iPSC reprogramming using three shRNAs, targetting either luciferase (control), lincRNA-p21 and hnRNP-K. Days 6, 9 and 12 of the reprogramming timecourse were analyzed

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
