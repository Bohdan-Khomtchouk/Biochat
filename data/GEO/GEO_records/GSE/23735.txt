TITLE
mRNA expression data from A549 exposed to fresh or aged urban air mixtures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We are investigating the mRNA expression profiles of human lung cells to gaseous urban mixtures We used microarrays to compare the global mRNA expression profiles upon response to fresh against aged urban mix Keywords: dose

DESIGN
A549 cells were grown to confluency and exposed to fresh urban mix, aged urban mix, or mock-treated. RNA was collected 9 hrs after exposure.
