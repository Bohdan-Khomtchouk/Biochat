TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of HEPG2 cells after treatment with TRIB1-inducing compounds

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Treatment of HEPG2 cells with TRIB1-inducing compounds and Oncostatin M Transcriptional response of HEPG2 cells was measured after treatment with TRIB1-inducing compound BRD8518 and Oncostatin M, compared to DMSO control treatment at 1, 6 and 24 hours.

DESIGN
Transcriptional response was compared between BRD8518- and OSM-treated cells and untreated (DMSO) cells at 1, 6 and 24 hours.
