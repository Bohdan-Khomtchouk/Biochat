TITLE
Genomic instability of human embryonic stem cells in mechanic and enzymatic passaging culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
hESC have morphologic, genetic and genomic alternatiions when cells cultured in different passaging condition. Here sub-karyotypic genome change in three different hESC lines were compared in two passaging methods.

DESIGN
Cells had initially mechanic passaging. From the initiating passage (p13 for HD291, p16 for HD129 and p25 for HS306), cell were switched to enzymatic passaging. At indicated passges, the sub-karyotypic changes in genome were analysed by Affymetrix SNP6.0 microarray.
