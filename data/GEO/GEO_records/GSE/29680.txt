TITLE
Effects of DHA-rich n-3 fatty acid supplementation on gene expression in blood mononuclear leukocytes: the OmegAD study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The hypothesis was that 6 months of dietary n-3 FA supplementation to humans affected expression of genes that might be of significance for inflammatory processes and for Alzheimer´s disease.

DESIGN
Effects on global gene expression profiles (Affymetrix Human Focus array) in human blood mononuclear leukocytes obtained  from 11 patients with Alzheimer´s disease before and after 6 months of a DHA-rich n-3 fatty acid supplementation. Data analyses were performed using Gene chip Operating Software (GCOS) Version 1.4. Two Samples, GSM735991 and GSM736014, are missing CEL files due to storage failure.
