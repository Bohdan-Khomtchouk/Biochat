TITLE
ChIP-seq for Polycomb group proteins and H3K27me3 in ESCs and NSCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq was performed for Ring1b, Ezh2, Cbx2 and H3K27me3 in ESCs and Ring1b and H3K27me3 in NSCs. This was used to define Polycomb-bound regions and to assess their H3.3 enrichment and turnover using time-ChIP.

DESIGN
Cells were crosslinked and ChIP performed using the antibodies indicated. The resulting DNA, along with input DNA samples was made into libraries and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
