TITLE
Expression data from WASF3 knockdown stable MDA-MB-231 cells and control cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently showed that inactivation of the WASF3/WAVE3 gene in breast cancer cells results in loss of cell motility and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. To obtain a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of action of WASF3, we have established the stable  WASF3 knockdown  MDA-MB-231 cells using shRNA strategy. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression after silencing WASF3 and identified distinct classes of up or down-regulated genes associated with breast cancer cell migration and motility
