TITLE
Expression data from WASF3 knockdown stable MDA-MB-231 cells and control cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently showed that inactivation of the WASF3/WAVE3 gene in breast cancer cells results in loss of cell motility and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. To obtain a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of action of WASF3, we have established the stable  WASF3 knockdown  MDA-MB-231 cells using shRNA strategy. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression after silencing WASF3 and identified distinct classes of up or down-regulated genes associated with breast cancer cell migration and motility

DESIGN
The three stable WASF3 knockdown single clones and three control clones were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  To identify altered gene expression patterns in the knockdown cells, we compared gene expression levels between three different knockdown and three different control clones.
