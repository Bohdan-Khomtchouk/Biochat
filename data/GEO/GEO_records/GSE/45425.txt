TITLE
Runx1 targets in early B-cell progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The t(12;21) chromosomal translocation, targeting the gene encoding the RUNX1 transcription factor, is observed in 25% of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is an initiating event in the disease. To elucidate the mechanism by which RUNX1 disruption initiates leukemogenesis, we investigated its normal role in murine B-cell development. Gene expression analysis and genome-wide Runx1-occupancy studies support the hypothesis that Runx1 reinforces the transcription factor network in B-cell progenitors governing early B-cell survival and development .
