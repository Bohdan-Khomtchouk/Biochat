TITLE
Chromosome wide analysis of parental allele specific chromatin and DNA methylation along mouse distal chr15

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed according to parental inheritance. The maternally and paternally inherited alleles are distinguished epigenetically by DNA methylation and histone modifications. Chromosome-wide Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and MIRA analysis of  MatDup.dist7 and PatDup.dist7 MEFs provided a panoramic map of reciprocal allele-specific histone modifications and DNA methylation at imprinted genes along distal chromosome 7 and 15.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip and MIRA-chip was done to map histone modifications and DNA methylation along distal chr15 in the maternal allele and paternal allele in Patdup.dist7=MatDup.dist15 and Patdup.dist7=MatDupdis15 MEFs, respectively, using Nimblegen tiling arrays for chr15.
