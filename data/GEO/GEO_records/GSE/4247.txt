TITLE
cDNA microarray analysis of human skeletal muscle after endurance exercise

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We examined global mRNA expression using cDNA microarrays in skeletal muscle of humans before, and 3h and 48h after a single bout of exhaustive endurance exercise (cycling). Keywords: Time course

DESIGN
Healthy, non-trained university-aged subjects performed a single bout of exhaustive cycling.  Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis before, 3h and 48h after the exercise bout.  Total RNA was extracted, amplified, reverse transcribed, and cDNA was analyzed on a custom made cDNA microarray.  Four subjects were analyzed, and samples were not pooled between subjects (i.e. individual microarrays were used for baseline vs. 3H and baseline vs. 48h for EACH subject; repeated measures design).
