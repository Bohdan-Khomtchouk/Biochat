TITLE
Sensing the end: how TUT7 controls the fate of precursor microRNAs by uridylation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Terminal uridylyl transferases (TUTs) function as integral regulators of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis by modifying the end structure of precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Using biochemistry and deep sequencing techniques, we here investigate the mechanism how human TUT7 recognizes and uridylates pre-miRNAs. We show that the overhang of a pre-miRNA is the key structural element that TUT7 and its paralogues, TUT4 and TUT2, recognize. For group II pre-miRNAs which have a 1 nt 3’ overhang, TUT7 restores the canonical end structure (2 nt 3’ overhang) by mono-uridylation, and thereby promotes miRNA biogenesis. Interestingly, once the 3’ end is receded into the stem (3’ trimmed pre-miRNAs such as Ago-cleaved-pre-miRNA), TUT7 effectively generates an oligo-U tail that consequently leads to degradation. Our single-molecule study further suggests that a distributive mode is employed for both pathways, but the overhang length determines the frequency of TUT7-RNA interaction. Our results explain how TUT7 and TUT4 differentiate pre-miRNA species and reveal a role for TUT7 and TUT4 in the oligo-uridylation and removal of defective pre-miRNAs.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were knocked down of control or TUT2/4/7, then total RNAs were prepared for RNA-seq
