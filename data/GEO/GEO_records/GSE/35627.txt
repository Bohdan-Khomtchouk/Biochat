TITLE
Expression data from Angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated Rat Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (RVSMC)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) dysfunction plays a critical role in cardiovascular diseases. However, the gene expression in this process is unclear. We used Rat Affymetrix gene array to profile Ang II-regulated gene in RVSMC and evaluated their role in VSMC dysfunction.

DESIGN
Examined 4 samples of Rat VSMC in triplicate. Control (without Ang II treatment) and 3 samples treated with Ang II for 6h, 12h, and 24h. Compared the changes in gene expression in Ang II treated samples relative to control samples.
