TITLE
Role of Fzd2 in lung epithelium development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fzd2 is a Wnt receptor expressed in the embryonic lung.  We made a conditional knockout of Fzd2 to specifically address the role of signaling through Fzd2 in lung epithelial development.

DESIGN
To explore the genes that are regulated by signaling through the Fzd2 receptor in the lung epithelium, we performed microarray analysis of Shhcre control and Fzd2CKO lungs at E12.5
