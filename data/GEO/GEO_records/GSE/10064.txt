TITLE
Gene expression in immortalized B-lymphocytes derived from patients with multiple sclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aims to determine if global gene expression and transcription factor networks in B-lympocytes of siblings with MS were different from healthy siblings. Keywords: Multiple sclerosis, sibling comparisons

DESIGN
10 samples from 3 families were used in this study. Of these 4 were unaffected siblings while 6 were siblings with MS. The total RNA from these samples were processed for hybridization on to Codelink Whole Human Genome arrays.
