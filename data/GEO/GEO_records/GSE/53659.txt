TITLE
Expression data from WT mice and bitransgenic Pdx1-cre/Kras*A mice bearing Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have carried out transcriptional profile analysis in WT MICE and bitransgenic Pdx1-cre/Kras*A MICE baring Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Mouse models faithfully simulating human cancer are valuable for genetic identification of potential  drug-targets but, among them, the most advantageous for practical use in subsequent preclinical  testing of candidate therapeutic regimes are those exhibiting rapid tumor development. Considering  that a KRAS mutation (predominantly in codon 12, such as KRASG12D; KRAS*) occurs with high  frequency (~90%) in cases of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA)1, we sought to develop  a mouse PDA model that would exhibit high tumor incidence and short latency by ectopic  overexpression of Kras*.

DESIGN
Five WT mice and 6  bitransgenic Pdx1-cre/Kras*A MICE baring Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma were used to identify key genes in the formation of panceatic malignacies
