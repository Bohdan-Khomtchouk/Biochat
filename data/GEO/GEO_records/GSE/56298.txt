TITLE
Allele-Specific Methylation Occurs at Genetic Variants Associated with Complex Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We use targeted bisulfite PCR and next-generation 454 sequencing of multiple amplicons to analyze the association of cis-regulated allele-specific methylation (ASM) with multiple complex disease-associated variants in a population of 82 individuals. We detect ASM at four variants implicated in complex phenotypes such as ulcerative colitis and AIDS progression disease (rs10491434), Celiac disease (rs2762051), Crohnâ€™s disease, IgA nephropathy and early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (rs713875) and height (rs6569648).
