TITLE
Gene expression changes upon NUSAP1 over- or under-expression in PC-3 or DU145 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By transcriptome (RNA-Seq) analysis of PC-3 or DU145 prostate cancer cell lines over- or under-expressing NUSAP1, we determined genes that become differentially expressed upon expression changes of NUSAP1. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes correlated with increased tumor progression and are involved in functions that include cancer, cellular movement, and cell morphology

DESIGN
Lentiviral infections were used to over- or under-express NUSAP1 or controls in triplicate in PC-3 or DU145 cell lines. Seventy-two or ninety-six hours after infection, total RNA was extracted and purified. The sequencing libraries were prepared with the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina) or TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) as directed by the manufacturerâ€™s protocol.  Pooled libraries were run on a Hiseq 2000 Sequencing System (Illumina) with 101 base pair single-end reads.
