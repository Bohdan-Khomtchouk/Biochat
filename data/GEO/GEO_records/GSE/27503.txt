TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Genes Regulated by Macrophage-Conditioned Media Treatment of Human Pre-Adipocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A major development in the study of obesity is the recognition that the condition is characterised by chronic mild inflammation.  Within adipose tissue, this involves the infiltration of macrophages, as well as the direct inflammatory response of the adipocytes and pre-adipocytes.  This study has used Agilent whole-genome microarrays to examine the effects of macrophage-conditioned medium on the global inflammatory response of human pre-adipocytes.

DESIGN
Human pre-adipocytes (SGBS cells) were treated with macrophage (U937 cells) conditioned medium for 24 h.  Control pre-adipocytes were treated with unconditioned medium (control) or RPMI-1640 media alone to control for differences in media used to culture the U937 cells.  There were 5 biological replicates per group.
