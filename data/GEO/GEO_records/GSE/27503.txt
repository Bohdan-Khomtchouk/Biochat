TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Genes Regulated by Macrophage-Conditioned Media Treatment of Human Pre-Adipocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A major development in the study of obesity is the recognition that the condition is characterised by chronic mild inflammation.  Within adipose tissue, this involves the infiltration of macrophages, as well as the direct inflammatory response of the adipocytes and pre-adipocytes.  This study has used Agilent whole-genome microarrays to examine the effects of macrophage-conditioned medium on the global inflammatory response of human pre-adipocytes.
