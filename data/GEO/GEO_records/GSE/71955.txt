TITLE
Epigenetic profiling in CD4 and CD8 T cells from Graves’ disease patients reveals changes in genes associated with T cell receptor signaling [methylation]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In Graves’ disease (GD), a combination of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors causes an autoimmune response to the thyroid gland, characterized by lymphocytic infiltrations and autoantibodies targeting the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) and other thyroid antigens. To identify the epigenetic changes involved in GD, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks in sorted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We found 365 and 3322 differentially methylated CpG sites in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. Among the hypermethylated CpG sites, we specifically found enrichment of genes involved in T cell signaling (CD247, LCK, ZAP70, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CTLA4 and CD8A) and decreased expression of CD3 gene family members. The hypermethylation was accompanied with the active chromatin histone modifications as we found decreased signals of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks at several T cell signaling genes in ChIP-seq analysis. In addition, we found hypermethylation of the TSHR gene first intron, where several GD-associated polymorphisms are located. Our results demonstrate an involvement of dysregulated DNA methylation and histone modifications at T cell signaling genes in GD patients.

DESIGN
Individuals were recruited from the Estonian Genome Center of the University of Tartu. Genomic DNA was extracted from sorted CD4+ (31 controls and 36 GD patients) and CD8+ (31 controls and 37 GD patients) T cells. The data collection was performed at the SNP & SEQ Technology Platform in Uppsala University, and data analysis was done at the Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine in the University of Tartu.
