TITLE
MicroRNA Expression Differences In Human Hematopoietic Cell Lineages Enable Regulated Transgene Expression (Primary cell)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA content normal hematopoietic cells from 5 healthy individuals.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we report the miRNA content of highly purified normal hematopoietic cells from the same individuals. We provided the miRNA profile of peripheral blood components such as, platelets, T-cell, B-cell, granulocytes and erythrocytes.
