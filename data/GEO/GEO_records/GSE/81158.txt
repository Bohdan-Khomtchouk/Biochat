TITLE
Vibrio cholerae temperature shift microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
Temperature is a crucial environmental signal that govers the occurrence of Vibrio cholerae and cholera outbreaks. To understand how temperature impacts the transcriptome of V. cholerae we performed whole-genome level transcriptional profiling using custom microarrays on cells grown at human body temperature (37 C)  then shifted to temperatures V. cholerae experience in the environment (15 C and 25 C).

DESIGN
Wild-type V. cholerae  grown at 37 C were compared to those shifted to either 15 C or 25 C. Threee biological replicates were performed for each condition.  All reference RNA  was harvested from a wild-type strain grown at 30 C.
