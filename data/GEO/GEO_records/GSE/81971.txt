TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of long noncoding RNA expression patterns in chemoresistant breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in cancer progression. In this study, the lncRNA profiling were analyzed in chemoresistant and sensitive breast cancer cells. We found a group of dysregulated lncRNAs in chemoresistant cells. Expression of dysregulated lncRNAs are correlated with dysregulated mRNAs, and enriched in GO and KEGG pathways related with cancer progression and chemoresistance development. Within those lncRNA-mRNA interactions, some lncRNAs may cis-regulate neighboring protein coding genes and involved in chemoresistance. The lncRNA NONHSAT028712 was then validated to regulate nearby CDK2 and interfere with cell cycle and chemoresistance. Furthermore, we identified another group of lncRNAs trans-regulated gene expression via interacting with different transcription factors (TF). Whereby NONHSAT057282 and NONHSAG023333 was found to modulate chemoresistance and most likely interacted with ELF1 and E2F1 respectively. In conclusion, this study reported for the first time the lncRNA expression patterns in chemoresistant breast cancer cells, and provided a group of novel lncRNA targets in mediating chemoresistance development in both cis- and trans- action mode.
