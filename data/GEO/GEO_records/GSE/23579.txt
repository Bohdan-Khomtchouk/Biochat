TITLE
Gene expression profilings of fetal human and mouse cerebral cortex exposed to alcohol

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A dataset for coordinated transcriptome analysis of the effect of ethanol on human embryonic cerebral slices in vitro and on the mouse embryonic cerebral cortex in a in vivo model.

DESIGN
GW15 and 17 embryonic cortices that were obtained from the Human Fetal Tissue Repository at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The research protocol was approved by Yale Human Investigation Committee. The medical histories of all samples did not present exposure to alcohol during pregnancy. The tissues were stored in L-15 Leibovitz medium on ice and were cut at 300 Âµm using a tissue chopper within 3 hours after the surgery. the slices were cultured on the membrane floating on the Neurobasal medium containing 50 mM ethanol or PBS with supplements for 24 hours in tissue culture plate with low evaporation lid (falcon, 353046). Wild-type CD-1 pregnant mice were purchased from Charles River. For the mouse in vivo mFAE model, the pregnant dams of wild-type and transgenic mice were intraperitoneally injected with 25% ethanol/PBS (final 2.0g/kg weight) or PBS (as the control) once a day from E14 to E16.
