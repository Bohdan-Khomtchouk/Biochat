TITLE
Overexpression of the plant LAMMER kinase PK12

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Comparison of plants that overexpress PK12 and non-transformed plants. Plants were grown for 10 days under long day conditions (GSM3816-GSM3819) or plants were grown for 21 days under long day conditions (GSM3820-GSM3823) . Hybridization was performed on arrays from Arabidopsis Keck Resource Lab Array (Yale University) containing 12K (GSM3816-GSM3819) or 9K (GSM3820-GSM3823)Arabidopsis ESTs. The 4 samples corresponding to each array represent 2 repetitions of 2 independent biological experiments. Keywords = Alternative splicing Keywords = phosphorylation Keywords: equivalent probe
