TITLE
Expression data using esophageal epithelia from 3 month old-mice lacking the transcription factor Klf4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using the ED-L2 promoter of Epstein-Barr virus to drive Cre, we obtained tissue specific ablation of Klf4 in the squamous epithelia of the esophagus. Using a functional genomic approach, we showed decreased expression of critical late-stage differentiation factors and identified alterations of several genes important in cellular differentiation.

DESIGN
For all experiments with ED-L2-Cre/Klf4loxp/loxp mice (mutant mice), sex-matched littermate Klf4loxp/loxp mice lacking the Cre transgene served as controls. 3 mutant mice and 3 controls were used.
