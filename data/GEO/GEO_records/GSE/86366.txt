TITLE
Neuronal activity modifies the chromatin accessibility landscape in the adult brain (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated RNA profiling datasets from adult mouse dentate gyrus  upon neuronal activation at three different time point

DESIGN
Examination of chromatin accessibility changes and RNA expression changes in mouse dentate gyrus upon neuronal activation
