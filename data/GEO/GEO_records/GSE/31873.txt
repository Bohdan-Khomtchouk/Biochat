TITLE
Selective roles of p300 and CBP in androgen regulated gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transfected with siRNA against a non-specific (NS) sequence, siRNA specifically targeting EP300, or siRNA specifically targeting CREBBP. We tested the hypothesis that their exists different subgroups of genes that are preferentially affected by p300 or CBP depletion.

DESIGN
Cells were treated with 10nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 16 hours and total RNA was extracted to check for changes in gene expression.
