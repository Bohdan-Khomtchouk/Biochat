TITLE
Follicular CXCR5-expressing CD8 T cells curtail chronic viral infection [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), we defined a subset of exhausted CD8+ T cells abundantly expressing chemokine receptor CXCR5. These CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells were preferentially localized in B cell follicles, expressing less inhibitory receptors while exhibiting more potent cytolytic activity compared to the CXCR5- subset. Furthermore, we identified Id2-E2A axis as the regulator for the generation of this subset. In line with mouse LCMV chronic infection, we also identified a CXCR5+ CD8+ T cell subset in human HIV patients, which negatively correlated with viral load. Moreover, when adoptively transferred to chronically infected recipients, CXCR5+ subset showed greater therapeutic potential than CXCR5- subset.

DESIGN
RNA sequenceing of two CD8 T cell subsets in chronic infection
