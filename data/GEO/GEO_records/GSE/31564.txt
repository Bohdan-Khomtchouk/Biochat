TITLE
Gene expression response to bacterial phagocytosis by S2 cells (control and eater RNAi knock down)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The Drosophila phagocytic receptor Eater is expressed specifically in phagocytic hemocytes. It contributes to host immune defense and is required for survival of bacterial infections. Eater is involved in recognition and phagocytosis of bacteria. We used microarrays to determine whether any gene expression changes after bacterial phagocytosis are dependent on the expression of the phagocytic scavenger receptor Eater. We found transcriptional regulation in response to bacterial internalization, but no significant differences between controls and samples in which eater expression had been diminshed by RNAi eater knock down.
