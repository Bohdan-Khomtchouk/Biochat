TITLE
miRNA-seq study between Th0 and Th17 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the differences in miRNA profiles, naive CD4+CD62L+ helper T cells were  sorted by magnetic cell sorting from spleens of female C57BL/6 mice and were induced to differentiate into Th1 or Th17 cells, then total RNA was extracted and miRNA-seq were conducted. The results showed that many microTNAs presented a different expression pattern between Th1 and Th17 cells, which prompted us to further study their roles in Th117 differenciation.

DESIGN
miRNA profiles of  Th0 and Th17 cells were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
