TITLE
ENCODE ChIP-chip for JUN on Human Hela S3 Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
JUN ChIP-chip performed on Human Hela S3 Cells for Nimblegen ENCODE arrays which comprise 50mer oligonucleotides spaced every 38bps (overlapping by 12nts).  Goal is to identify binding sites for JUN. Keywords = Transcription Factor Binding, JUN, ChIP-chip, Human, Genome Tiling Arrays Keywords: ChIP-chip

DESIGN
DNA from immunoprecipitated chromatin or total genomic DNA was hybridized to a Nimblegen ENCODE tiling array containing overlapping 50 nt oligonucleotide probes.  Samples are three biological replicates.
