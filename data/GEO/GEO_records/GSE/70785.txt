TITLE
Differentially Expressed Pseudogenes in HIV-1 Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed transcriptomic data from infected and uninfected T-cells to identify pseudogenes and their parent genes showing differential expression in HIV-1 infection

DESIGN
H9 T-cell line was infected with NL4-3 strain of HIV-1 obtained by transfection of 293T cells. RNA from infected and uninfected cells was extracted 7 days post infection.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
