TITLE
Potential Target Genes of MicroRNA-21 In Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Of The Gracilis Muscle In Rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of rat gracilis muscle after ischemia 4h and reperfusion for 1d, 3d, 7d and 14d v.s. sham control, and correlate the downregulated transcripts to the computational predicted gene targets of ron-miR-21 Following 4 h of ischemia and subsequent reperfusion for 4 h of the gracilis muscles, three miRNAs (miR-21, miR-200c, and miR-205) of 350 tested rat miRNAs were found to have an increased expression in the miRNA array.The expression of the mRNA in the muscle specimens after 4 h of ischemia and reperfusion for 1, 3, 7, and 14 d were detected with the Agilent Whole Rat Genome 4 Ã— 44 k oligo microarray. A combined approach using a computational prediction algorithm that included miRanda, PicTar, TargetScanS, MirTarget2, RNAhybrid, and the whole genome microarray experiment was performed by monitoring the mRNA:miRNA association to identify potential target genes.
