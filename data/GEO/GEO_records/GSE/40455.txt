TITLE
Mechanisms of age-dependent response to winter temperature in perennial flowering of Arabis alpina.

ORGANISM
Arabis alpina

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profile of Arabis alpina apex enriched material. We compared apices from plants grown for 2 weeks in long days (20°C) (juvenile) with apices from plants grown for 8 weeks in long days (20°C) (adult) and apices from plants grown for 2 weeks and then shifted in vernalization for 4 weeks with apices from plants grown for 8 weeks and than shifted to vernalization for 4 weeks.

DESIGN
2x2 factorial design. 2 starting ages (2 weeks and 8 weeks) and 2 developmental conditions (before and after vernalization). 4 biological replicates for each condition (16 arrays). Reference: pool of the 16 arrays.

PLATFORM
