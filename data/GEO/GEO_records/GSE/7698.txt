TITLE
Gene expression in Aspergillus nidulans at different developmental stages

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to compare different developmental stages of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans.  Cells were grown for various times and comparisons made between: 1. Isolated conidia (0 hours) and isotropically expanding cells (3 hours). 2. Isotropically expanding cells (3 hours) and polarly extending cells (5 hours). 3. Undifferentiated vegetative hyphae (18 hours) and synchronously conidiating cultures (42 hours). Keywords: Developmental stage comparison

DESIGN
A total of 4 hybridizations were performed for each microarray experiment described in the summary.  The following replicates were carried out: 1. Two biological replicates were performed using cultures grown in parallel. 2. Two Technical ‘dye swap’ replicates were carried out for each biological replicate.

PLATFORM
GPL5138 TIGR PFGRC Aspergillus nidulans v1 array based on strain FGSC A4 (condensed - does not contain replicate spots)
