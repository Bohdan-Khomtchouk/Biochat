TITLE
Gene expression profiling of endothelial cells derived from Foxo1(+/+) and Foxo1(-/-) ES cells in response to VEGF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
VEGF induces elongation of endothelial cells (ECs) that are derived from wild-type (Foxo1(+/+)) ES cells. VEGF-induced EC elongation is an important process of angiogenesis. ECs derived from Foxo1(-/-) ES cells fail to elongate in response to VEGF. Gene expression profiling of wild-type and Foxo1(-/-) ECs in the presence or absence of VEGF stimulation identifies responsible genes that regulate EC elongation.

DESIGN
One wild-type (Foxo1(+/+)) ES cell clone and one Foxo1(-/-) ES cell clone were used. ES cells were cultured on OP9 stromal cell layer in the presence or absence of VEGF (10 ng/ml). After 6.5 days, VE-cadherin+ CD31+ ECs were isolated by FACS and used for total RNA extraction. Three independent experiments were performed for each condition.
