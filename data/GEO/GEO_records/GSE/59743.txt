TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Influenza vaccine response in Young and Old - Year 3 - PBMC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled gene expression of PBMC from a stratified cohort of subjects to define influenza vaccine response in Young and Old

DESIGN
Differential gene expression by human PBMCs from Healthy Adults receiving Influenza Vaccination (Fluvirin, Novartis). Healthy adults (older > 65, younger 21-30 years) were recruited at seasonal Influenza Vaccination clinics organized by Yale University Health Services during 2012 - 2013 seasons. With informed consent, healthy individuals were recruited as per a protocol approved by Human Investigations Committee of the Yale University School of Medicine. Each subject was evaluated by a screening questionnaire determining self-reported demographic information, height, weight, medications and comorbid conditions. Participants with acute illness two weeks prior to vaccination were excluded from study. Blood samples were collected into BD Vacutainer Sodium Heparin tube at four different time points, once prior to administration of vaccine and three time points after vaccination on days 4, 7 and 28. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinized blood using Histopaque 1077 in gradient centrifugation. About 1.0x10^7 freshly isolated PBMC were lysed in Triso and immediately stored in -800C. Total RNA in aqueous phase of Trisol - Chloroform was isolated in an automated QiaCube instrument using miRNeasy according to manufacturer's instructions. Integrity of RNA samples were assessed by Agilent 2100 BioAnalyser Samples were processed for cRNA generation using Illumina TotalPrep cRNA Amplification Kit and subsequently hybridized to Human HT12-V4.0 BeadChip at Yale Center for Genomic Analysis (YGCA).
