TITLE
KP1019 (trans-[tetrachlorobis(1H-indazole) ruthenate(III)]) Dependent Transcription in WT Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741

SUMMARY
To characterize cellular response to the anti-cancer ruthinium complex KP1019, budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcripitonal response to KP1019 was measured using microarray analysis. Although KP1019 molecular mechanism of action remains a matter of debate, the drug has been shown to bind DNA in biophysical assays and to damage DNA of colorectal and ovarian cancer cells in vitro.  KP1019 has also been shown to induce mutations and induce cell cycle arrest in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that budding yeast can serve as an appropriate model for characterizing the cellular response to the drug.  Here we use a transcriptomic approach to characterize KP1019 induced transcriptional changes.

DESIGN
Two concentrations of KP1019 (40 micrograms/mL and 80 micrograms/ml were assayed by microarray analysis to obtain comparative expression data for treated and untreated cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain BY4741).  Two biological replicates of each concentration were done. Each biological replicate was done in duplicate to allow for dye reversal controls.
