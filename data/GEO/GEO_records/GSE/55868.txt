ORGANISM
Pinus pinaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Pinus pinaster adult needles in a complete year. The needles were isolated by year emergence (whorl) in four groups. 0 (2012), 1 (2011), 2 (2010) and 3 (2009). The samples were harvested at 1245 m of altitude at Los Reales de Sierra Bermeja (Spain) (30S X:303.095 Y:4.039.618) one time per month.
