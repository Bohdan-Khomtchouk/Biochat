TITLE
Microarray analysis of transcriptional responses to abscisic acid and salt stress in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To investigate differences in plant responses to salt and ABA stimulus, differences in gene expression in Arabidopsis in response to salt and ABA were compared using an Agilent oligo microarray. Four-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) seedlings were treated with either 150 mM NaCl or 10 Î¼M ABA for 6 hours; unstressed seedlings (control sample) were collected in parallel to avoid the possible effects of circadian rhythms. The results revealed that 31 genes were up regulated by both NaCl and ABA stress, and 23 genes were down-regulated by these stressors. To provide further validation of our microarray experiment data, ten genes from this signature were quantified in the same RNA samples by quantitative real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Differentially expression genes of Arabidopsis thaliana were measured under salt stressed, ABA stressed and normal condition for 6 hours, respectively. Three independent experiments were performed at each treatment using different plants for each experiment.
