TITLE
Halobacterium NRC-1, H2O2 Stress Response

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
50mM H2O2 was added to mid-log phase Halobacterium NRC-1 cultures. After constant stress of H2O2 for 30 minutes, cultures were spun down and pellets were resuspended in same volume of GN101 media. Samples for RNA preparation were collected during recovery time points at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 120 minutes. Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
16 samples (8 exposed to H2O2 and 8 non-exposed controls) were each hybridized on duplicate arrays (as dye-flips) against the same standard control sample.

PLATFORM
