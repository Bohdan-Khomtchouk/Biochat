TITLE
Methylome of Salmonella enterica subsp. Enterica serovar Javiana str. CFSAN001992 by PacBio SMRT Sequencing

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Javiana str. CFSAN001992

SUMMARY
Single-molecule read technologies allow for detection of epigenomic base modifications during routine sequencing by analysis of kinetic data during the reaction, including the duration between base incorporations at the elongation site (the " inter-pulse duration. " ) Methylome data associated with a closed de novo bacterial genome of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Javiana str. CFSAN001992 was produced and submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus.

DESIGN
Single-sample sequencing and base modification detection of cultured isolate of a foodborne pathogen.
