TITLE
Molecular Organization of Drosophila Neuroendocrine Cells by DIMMED: Global Profiling of Pan-Neuronal DIMMED Expression Effects

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To amass candidate DIMM targets in addition to Phm (Park et al., 2008a), we used genome-wide microarray profiling by over-expressing DIMM throughout the embryonic nervous system. We compared profiles from experimental (elav > dimm) and control (elav-GAL4) embryos at 22-26 hr and 28-32 hr after egg laying (AEL). The design was intended to identify transcripts consistently up-regulated shortly after the induction of DIMM; in so doing, we could circumvent the lethality that ensues in late embryonic, and/ or by early larval stages, due to pan-neuronal DIMM expression.

DESIGN
Eight microarrays were used to hybridize cDNAs from experimental dimm::myc-expressing and control flies, sampled at two different embryonic stages. Four microarrays were hybridized with cDNA from the dimm::myc-expressing embryos of genotype w;UAS-dimm2A3/+;elav-GAL4/+; (prefix 'ED'). Another four microarrays were hybridized with cDNAs from the control (maternal) strain: w;;elav-GAL4 (prefix 'E'). Samples ED3 and ED4, E3 and E4 were hybridized with cDNA from stage 14 embryos (24-26hr development at 18C). Samples ED1 and ED2, E1 and E2 were hybridized with cDNA from stage 16 embryos (28-32 hr old embryos at 18C). A pair of GeneChip Drosophila Genome 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix Co., Santa Clara, CA) were tested with each RNA sample (two experimental and two control, for each of two time points).
