TITLE
Repertoire of porcine microRNAs in adult ovary and testis by deep sequencing.

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Despite increasing efforts in miRNAs identification across various species and diverse tissue types, little is known about porcine gonad-specific miRNAs. Although the well-known importance of pig in agriculture, as well as a model for human biology, the miRNA catalog of pig has been largely undefined. Identification and preliminary characterization of gonad-specific miRNAs would be a prerequisite for a thorough understanding of their roles in regulating folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis. In the present study, we get insight into miRNA transcriptome in adult porcine ovary and testis using deep sequencing technology, and to elucidate their characteristic organ- and gender-specific profiles, genomic context and emphasize the features of X-linked miRNAs.

DESIGN
Two small RNA libraries from adult porcine ovary and testis tissues were sequenced.
