TITLE
Estrogen-driven Prolactin-mediated Gene Expression Networks Hormone Induced Prostatic Dysplasia

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Emerging evidence suggests that estrogen and prolactin (PRL) play a key role in prostate cancer development, yet their relationship and molecular actions in prostate is not well understood. To address this issue, we made the first direct comparison of estrogen and PRL actions in the Noble rat (NBL) prostate dysplasia model.

DESIGN
Prostatic dysplasia in lateral prostate (DLP) has been induced by elevated circulating levels of estrogen and PRL in NBL with estrogen (E2)-filled implants, while physiological level of testosterone (T) was maintained with T-filled implants. The effect of estrogen and PRL was studied by using ICI and bromocriptine (Br) as their respective blockers, both can effectively inhibited dysplasia development under T+E2 induction. Transcript expression profile of the four treatment groups (Control, T+E2, T+E2+Br, and T+E2+ICI) has been characterized in this array.
