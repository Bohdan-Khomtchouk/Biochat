TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of ovaries from ducks with high and low egg production

ORGANISM
Anas platyrhynchos

SUMMARY
Gene expression differences between the ovaries of Jingding duck with high and low egg production were assessed using the RNA-Seq technology. A total of 843 differentially expressed genes were identified. These genes have known or potential roles in regulation the egg production. Therefore, they are appealing candidates for further investigation of the gene expression and associated regulatory mechanisms related to egg production of ducks.

DESIGN
Ducks ovary mRNA profiles of high egg production and low egg production were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2500.
