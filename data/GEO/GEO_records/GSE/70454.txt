TITLE
Comparison against 186 canid whole genome sequences reveals survival strategies of an ancient clonally transmissible canine tumor

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Whole genome sequencing of CTVT, breed dogs, and wild canids reveals pathways that are important in cancer cell survival. Comparison of these mutations with breed dogs shows that the original tumor came from a dog very similar to one of the modern Arctic breeds.

DESIGN
DNA was collected from pedigreed dogs of the Alaskan Malamute (AMAL) and Siberian Husky (HUSK) breeds living in North America. SNPs were genotyed using the Illumina CanineHD SNP chip. These SNPs were compared to published data and seqeunced mutations from CTVT by principal component alnalysis to identify the breed of the CTVT originator.
