TITLE
Effect of PD-1 immune checkpoint in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the brain's choroid plexus and myeloid cell populations isolated from the brain of 5XFAD Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice following PD-1 blockade

DESIGN
Choroid plexus samples and myeloid cell populations were isolated from the brain of 5XFAD mice following PD-1 blockade, and sequenced. For choroid plexus samples, 5 mice were treated with anti-PD-1, 5 with IgG control, and 4 were left untreated. For the myeloid cells samples,  myeloid cells sorted from the brains of 5XFAD mice according to a gating strategy that seperate microglia (CD11b+CD45-low) and monocytes-derived macrophages  (CD11b+CD45-high).
