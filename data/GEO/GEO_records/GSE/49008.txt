TITLE
Genome wide profiling of RNA Polymerase II upon knock-down or overexpression of RECQL5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RECQL5 globally effects the distribution of RNA Polymerase II on genes in a dose dependent manner.  Knock-down of RECQL5 reduces RNA Polymerase II density in the gene body, while increasing density on TSS and TTS.  Overexpression shows exactly the opposite effect.  We postulate that RECQL5 acts as a regulator of the elongation rate, more specifically, that the knock-down increases elongation rate while the overexpression decreases it.

DESIGN
RNA Polymerase II ChIP-Seq upon knock-down of RECQL5 with either of two specific shRNAs or a CTRL shRNA, and upon Doxycycline induced overexpression of RECQL5 .
