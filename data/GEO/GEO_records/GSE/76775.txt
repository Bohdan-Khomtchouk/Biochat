TITLE
Low plasma levels of miR-451a, miR-223-3p, and miR-27a-3p predict adverse prognosis in myelodysplastic syndromes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the spectra of circulating miRNAs in plasma of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients. Peripheral blood plasma from MDS patients with different risk scores was used for Agilent miRNA expression microarray analysis to define miRNA profile and to find miRNAs with discriminatory levels for lower risk and higher risk MDS. Results were further validated using droplet digital PCR on a larger cohort, enabling absolute quantification of plasma miRNAs and defining miRNAs with prognostic value for the disease.

DESIGN
We analyzed expression profile of circulating miRNAs in plasma from 21 individuals:  7 controls and 14 MDS patients.
