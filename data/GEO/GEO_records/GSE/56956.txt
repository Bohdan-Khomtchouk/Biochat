TITLE
Expression analysis of genes in Rattus norvegicus lungs at postnatal day 4, 10 and 21 after intrauterine growth restriction induced by low protein diet

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed RNA microarray in a low protein diet (LPD) model of IUGR at three key time points of alveolarization process.  IUGR and control rat pups had been studied for each time point considered: on postnatal day 4 (P4) before beginning of the alveolarization process, on P10, peak of alveolarization process and on P21 at the end of it.

DESIGN
A twelve chip study using total RNA extracted from 14 whole lungs intrauterine growth restricted rat pups compared to 15 controls. RNA was extracted at three key time points of alveolarization in postnatal life. RNA was pooled by groups of 2 ou 3 before analysis.
