TITLE
DNA copy number changes in fragile regions 3p21 and 16p13.3 in malignant mesothelioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an asbestos-related malignancy. MM cells have a broad histological spectrum, and consist mainly of epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and biphasic cell types. The prognosis of MM is generally poor. We applied a copy-number analysis to the identification of new fragile genes in regions 3p21 and 16p13.3 in MM.

DESIGN
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis was performed on malignant mesothelioma (MM) primary cell cultures, tumor and matched peripheral blood.
