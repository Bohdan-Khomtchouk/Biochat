TITLE
B.thetaiotaomicron mono-association versus B. thetaiotaomicron co-colonization with B. longum, PR chow, B6

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ; Bifidobacterium longum

SUMMARY
Genome wide transcriptional comparison of B. thetaiotaomicron mono-association vs. B. thetaiotaomicron bi-association with B. longum.  Cecal populations from 10d colonizations with b6 gnotobiotic mice fed a standard-chow polysaccharide rich (PR) diet (n=5 samples/group) were profiled. Keywords: Mono-association vs. Bi-association, in vivo

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from cecal contents of 10 day associated gnotobiotic mice and hybridized to B. thetaiotaomicron/B. longum GeneChips.
