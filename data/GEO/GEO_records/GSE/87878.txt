TITLE
Comparing the transcriptomes of ovaries from prolific Jintang black goat and non-prolific Tibetan goat (Capra hircus) during follicular phase

ORGANISM
Capra hircus

SUMMARY
The present study, for the first time, compared the transcriptomes of ovaries from the prolific Jintang black goat and the non-prolific Tibetan goat during follicular phase using the Illumina RNA-Seq method. The study provides insight into the transcriptional regulation in the ovaries of two distinct breeds of goats that might serve as a key resource for understanding goat fecundity.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from ovaries of the prolific Jintang black goat and the non-prolific Tibetan goat during follicular phase, then tanscriptomes of the two breeds were campared.
