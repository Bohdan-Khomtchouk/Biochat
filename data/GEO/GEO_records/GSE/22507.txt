TITLE
Conditional Dmrt1 knockout gene expression (phase 7)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome wide analysis of DNA binding and transcriptional regulation by the mammalian Doublesex homolog DMRT1 in the juvenile testis.

DESIGN
Gene expression differences found in conditionally targeted P9 testes were compared to those of controls
