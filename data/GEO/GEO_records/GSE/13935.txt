TITLE
Gene expression in pylorus stomach tissue in Bapx1 (Nkx3.2) deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bapx1 (Nkx3.2) is an important factor for GI development.  We document a morphologic change in the pylorus segment of the GI tract in Bapx1 deficient mice and we have used microarray analyses to assess gene exprofiles in the pylorus stomach region in knockout compared to wildtype littermates. Keywords: Genetic modiufied mice deficient in Bapx1 expression

DESIGN
RNA from 3 Bapx1 knockout animals and 3 control wildtype littermates were analyzed.
