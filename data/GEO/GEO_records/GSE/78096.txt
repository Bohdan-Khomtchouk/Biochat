TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state during cardiac reprogramming of human fibroblasts by small molecules

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cardiomyocyte-like cells can be reprogrammed from somatic fibroblasts by overexpression of cardiac genes, providing a new avenue for cardiac regenerative therapy. Here we report an alternative approach in which functional cardiomyocytes can be rapidly and efficiently generated from human fibroblasts by a specific combination of small molecules. ChIP-seq analysis has been used to understand the dynamic changes in chromatin state during early stage of reprogramming.

DESIGN
We analyzed the genome-wide epigenetic changes by ChIP-seq analysis of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac (active chromatin marks) and H3K27me3 (inactive chromatin mark) at reprogramming Day 6 (D6) and day 11 (D11).
