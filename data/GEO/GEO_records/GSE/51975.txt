TITLE
A bioinformatics approach reveals novel mechanisms of the OVOL transcription factors in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal cell programming and cancer progression.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We find significant evidence of the OVOL, AP1, STAT1, STAT3, and NFKB1 TFs having important roles in MET. We prioritize known gene/drug targets for follow-up in the clinic, and show that the AP1/MYC TF pair is a strong candidate for intervention.

DESIGN
Examination of the effects of OVOL1 and OVOL2 overexpression common to prostate cancer and breast cancer models.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
