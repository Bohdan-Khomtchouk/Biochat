TITLE
Expression data from normal and CRC human peripheral blood samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis of peripheral blood samples can contribute to the determination of distant blood markers of local pathophysiological alterations in colorectal diseases. These markers can lead to alternative screening procedures. Keywords: whole genomic expression

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of healthy patients and patients with CRC and hybridized on Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
