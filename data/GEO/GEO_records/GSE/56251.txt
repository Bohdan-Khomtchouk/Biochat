TITLE
Expression data from Escherichia coli after treatment with nalidixic acid (NA)

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Having found that LexA degradation was significantly higher under apoptotic like death (ALD) than under SOS conditions, we hypothesized that additional genes tightly regulated by LexA would be transcribed under ALD conditions.

DESIGN
We used microarray analysis to test the transcription pattern of up-regulated genes in ALD. We added no NA (n.t.), 100 µg/ml NA, or 10 µg/ml NA to cultures of the WT MC4100relA+, or its ΔmazEF or ΔmazEFlexA3 derivatives.
