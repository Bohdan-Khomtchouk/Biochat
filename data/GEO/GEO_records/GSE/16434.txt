TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana after priming with BABA and infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) plants were treated with BABA and gene expression differences to control plants were monitored after dip-inoculation with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000. Keywords: transcript profiling, response to BABA-induced priming and infection

DESIGN
3 independant replicates were analyzed by two color co-hybridizations.  Leaf RNA from Pseudomonas infected control plants (Cy3 labeled cDNA) was cohybridized with leaf RNA from Pseudomonas infected BABA pretreated plants (Cy5 labeled cDNA). Samples were collected 22 hours after bacterial inoculation. BABA pretreatment was performed two days before bacterial inoculation. To assess the effect of BABA alone on gene expression, leaf RNA from BABA treated plants (Cy5 labeled cDNA) was cohybridized with leaf RNA (Cy3 labeled cDNA) from water treated plants.
