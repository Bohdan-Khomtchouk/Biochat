TITLE
An in vitro human liver model by iPSC-derived parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have established culture systems to generate liver progenitor cells (LPCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) from hiPSCs. Then, we established co-culture system of hiPSC-derived liver cells and performed RNA-seq of hiPSC-derived liver model.

DESIGN
Liver progenitor cells (LPCs), Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs, and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were generated from human iPS cells. Expression profile of hiPSC-derived liver model (co-culture system of LPCs and NPCs, N=2) was compared with hiPSC-derived LPCs (N=2) and primary human hepatocytes (N=2) by RNA-seq.
