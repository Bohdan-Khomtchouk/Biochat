SUMMARY
Comparative effects of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Aging in skeletal muscle Expression profiling established by microarray technology provides a powerful tool by which complex pathways can be assembled. The pathophysiology of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a complex process involving many pathways downstream of the primary genetic insult (lack of dystrophin). Similarly, the mechanisms implicated in muscle aging are only partially understood. The objective of the present study was to compare the muscle transcriptional response downstream of lack of dystrophin with the molecular events associated with aging using a muscle-dedicated microarray. Defining a common transcriptional profile in a range of wasting diseases should increase our understanding of the critical adaptations associated with muscle atrophy independent of the cause of the muscle wasting.

DESIGN
RNA samples from 4 DMD and 4 AGE skeletal muscle tissues were analyzed by hybridization against control samples. This hybridization was done on microarrays containing quadruplicate 50-mer oligonucleotides corresponding to 3,588 muscle relevant genes. Two hybridizations were per-formed for each subject. Thus, eight values per gene were obtained for each subject. These stringent conditions conferred powerful significance to our results.
