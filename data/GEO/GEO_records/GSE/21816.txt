TITLE
Gene expression profiling of BHDS-associated renal tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Renal tumors that arise in individuals with BHD Syndrome represent a molecularly distinct form of renal cancer.  In addition, BHD syndrome is due to a mutation the folliculin gene (FLCN). While the folliculin gene is an important tumor suppressor gene, the molecular function of this gene is not well defined.  By analyzing tumor samples that contain FLCN mutations, we demonstrate that the FLCN gene is an important regulator of mitochondrial function.
