TITLE
Target genes of AGAMOUS during early flower development in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Floral organs, whose identity is determined by specific combinations of homeotic genes, originate  from a group of undifferentiated cells called the floral meristem. In Arabidopsis, the homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) terminates meristem activity and promotes development of stamens and carpels. To understand the program of gene expression activated by AG, we followed genome-wide expression during early stamen and carpel development. Keywords: Developmental time course
