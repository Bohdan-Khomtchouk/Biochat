TITLE
Analysis of gene expression changes in early mouse embryos lacking Tgif1 and Tgif2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the differences in gene expression between wild type and Tgif1;Tgif2 double null mouse embryos at approximately 9.0 days after fertilization.

DESIGN
Stage matched individual mouse embryos at approximately 9.0 days after fertilization (~9-10 somites) were analyzed by RNA-seq. We analyzed four wild type embryos and eight conditional double mutant embryos, lacking both alleles of Tgif1 and both Tgif2 alleles.
