TITLE
Gene expression data from induced Pluripotent Stem cells from Parkinson's Disease patients harbouring amplification of, or mutations in the SNCA gene, and from healthy control donors [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have generated human induced Pluripotent Stem cells (hiPSc) using Sendai virus-mediated delivery of reprogramming factors. hiPSc lines have been screened using SNP array to assess chromosomal stability (alongside the fibroblast lines from which they derived), and validation of the pluripotency of the hiPSc lines is provided by Pluritest assessment of transcriptome datasets, prior to differentiation and downstream assays. Excess Î±-synuclein compromises phagocytosis in iPSC-derived macrophages.

DESIGN
human iPSc lines were derived from human dermal fibroblasts from 3 PD patients harbouring SNCA A53T mutations, 1 patient harbouring SNCA triplication, and 5 control donors (newly-derived lines are reported here; for control lines that have been previously described, see GSE53426, GSE64582, GSE77664, and refer to Table S1 of current manuscript). SNP and gene expression datasets were generated from patient and control lines.
