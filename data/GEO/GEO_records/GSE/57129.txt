TITLE
Evaluating microRNA profiles reveals discriminative responses following genotoxic or non-genotoxic carcinogen exposure in primary mouse hepatocytes [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The study investigated differential gene expression in primary mouse hepatocyte mRNA following 24 and 48 hours of exposure to aflatoxin B1, cisplatin, benzo(a)pyrene,  2,3,7,8-tetrachloordibenzo-p-dioxine, cyclosporin A or Wy-14,643 or their responsive solvent. Three (four for Wy-14,643) biological replicates per compound/solvent.
