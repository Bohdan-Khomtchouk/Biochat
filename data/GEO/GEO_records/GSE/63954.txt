TITLE
Collaborative Cross founder strain lung miRNA expression after allergen challenge

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this project was to identify strain-dependent expression of miRNAs in lung tissue from Collaborative Cross founder strains that were sensitized and challenged with house dust mite allergen (Der p 1).

DESIGN
We analyzed whole lung RNAs from the eight Collaborative Cross founder strains (n=4/strain, all males) using Affymetrix miRNA 2.0 arrays
