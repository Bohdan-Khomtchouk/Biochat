TITLE
Expression data for knockdown of POLRMT or RNA PolII in MCF-7 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription of mRNA in mammalian is mainly performed by RNA polymerase II (PolII). POLRMT is responsible for the production of cytoplasmic and nuclear form of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. The former (mtRNAP) participates in transcription of RNA in the mitochondria while the latter (spRNAP-IV) is responsible for some mRNA transcription in the nucleus. The nature and amount of genes transcribed by spRNAP-IV still remains unclear. Thus, we scanned for possible candidate genes by using Affymetrix.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cell line was subjected to siRNA knockdown of either non-targeting, POLRMT, or PolII for 72 hours
