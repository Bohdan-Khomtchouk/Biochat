TITLE
Expression profile of HeLa THOC1-depleted  stable cell lines (HeTH-4)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
THO/TREX is an eukaryotic conserved complex with a role at the interface between transcription and mRNP biogenesis/export that in yeast has been shown to play an important role in preventing transcription-associated genome instability. However, whereas a role of mammalian THO/TREX in mRNA processing and export seems clear, a role on either transcription or genome stability is still being argued. In this work we show, by microarray analysis of gene expression, that THO depletion in human cell lines has a global effect on transcription, with a significant impact on genes involved in transcription and DNA metabolism. We performed a microarray analysis of gene expression on  THOC1-depleted cells in order to know if there was a change in the genome-wide expression profile. Our data data suggest that the absence of THOC1 has a global effect on transcription process

DESIGN
Three repeats HeTH-4 and three repeats of HeTH-4 +DOX (THOC1-depleted cells)
