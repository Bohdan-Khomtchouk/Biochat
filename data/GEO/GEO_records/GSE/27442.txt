TITLE
Genes Differentially Expressed as a Result of Enforced Pokemon Expression  in MCF-7 cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pokmeon is an oncogenic transcription factor involved in cell growth, differentiation, and oncogenesis,but its regulatory network in breast cancer cells remians elusive . We used microarray to determine the down stream target genes of pokemon by using  the MCF-7 cell line with stable ectopic expression of pokemon.

DESIGN
The MCF-7 cell clones with high ectopic expression of pokemon were screened by the Hygromycin B,and the control cell line was also obtained by introducing empty vector .Both the RNA were extracted  and hybridized  with 22k cDNA spots from CapitalBio, Chin

PLATFORM
GPL5918 CapitalBio Human 22k oligonucleotide microarray
