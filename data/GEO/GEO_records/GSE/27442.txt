TITLE
Genes Differentially Expressed as a Result of Enforced Pokemon Expression  in MCF-7 cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pokmeon is an oncogenic transcription factor involved in cell growth, differentiation, and oncogenesis,but its regulatory network in breast cancer cells remians elusive . We used microarray to determine the down stream target genes of pokemon by using  the MCF-7 cell line with stable ectopic expression of pokemon.
