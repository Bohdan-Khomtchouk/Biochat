TITLE
Substantial Reprogramming of the Thellungiella salsuginea Transcriptome in Response to UV and Silver Nitrate Challenge

ORGANISM
Eutrema salsugineum

SUMMARY
The transcriptional response of T. salsuginea to UV irradiation and AgNO3 was monitored by microarray analysis. Most transcripts (respectively 70% and 78%) were significantly differentially regulated and a large overlap between the two treatments was observed (54% of total). While core genes of the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates were repressed, tryptophan and indole glucosinolate biosynthetic genes, as well as defence-related WRKY transcription factors, were consistently upregulated.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of four biological replicates was conducted with Agilent arrays. Statistically robust differential regulation was observed for the majority of transcripts.
