TITLE
Time course study of confinement stress in HR and LR trout lines

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
Farmed fish are unavoidably exposed to husbandry-related stressors which can result in outbreaks of disease, reduced reproductive success and poor growth. Biomarkers are needed for the establishment of selective breeding approaches for the production of stress resistant fish. In this context, microarray analysis has been carried out on liver tissues of two genetic lines of rainbow trout, high responders (HR) and low responders (LR), after confinement for various time periods. Microarray hybridisations provided gene expression profiles for pools of fish (stress: n=5; control: n=3) after 6h, 24h and 168h of confinement stress. Keywords : stress response, pools, time course, comparison of two lines.

DESIGN
Samples were hybridised directly to each other in a parallel loop design. Each treatment (LC, LS, HC, HS) was hybidised in a loop of all 3 time points and each treatment loop was interconnected by hybridisations at a specific time. The publication will have this figure.
