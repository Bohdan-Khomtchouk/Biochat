TITLE
Genome-wide expression study of the early/innate responses of murine B and T cells to MCMV infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine Cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection leads to early activation of various immune cells, including B and T lymphocytes, before the actual initiation of antigen-specific adaptive immunity. This activation is partly driven by innate cytokines, including type I interferon (IFN), which are induced early after infection. The objective of this study was to address the role of type I IFN in shaping early/innate B and T cell responses to a primary acute viral infection. In order to decipher the specific impact of IFN-I on cell subsets, we performed a genome-wide expression analysis on WT splenic B and CD8 T lymphocytes isolated from C57BL/6 [CD45.1 WT / CD45.2 IFNAR-KO] mixed bone marrow chimera mice. This study complements series GSE39555, which focused on early responses of NK cells and of the two subsets of conventional dendritic cells.

DESIGN
This study includes data from B and CD8 T lymphocytes purified by flow cytometry sorting from the spleen of bone marrow chimera (BMC) mice, under steady-state or MCMV conditions. Two independent replicates were made for each cell type, from two independent pools of spleens from uninfected or d1.5 MCMV-infected BMC 5-8 mice, and were hybridized on 3 separate batches of GeneChips.
