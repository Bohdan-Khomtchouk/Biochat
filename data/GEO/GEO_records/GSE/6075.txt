TITLE
E6 in HOK/Bmi-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify genes that are differentially expressed by E6 in oral epithelial cells that are stably expressing Bmi-1. Keywords: oncogenesis.

DESIGN
Primary Normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOK) is explanted from normal human gingival tissue.  The cells were infected with retroviruses capable of expressing Bmi-1 and being selected.  Actively dividing HOK/Bm-1 cells were then superinfected with LXSN-based retorviruses capable of expressing E6 and E6(delta)118-122, and selected.  Actively proliferating cells are then harvested to isolate total RNA which was subsequently subjected to microarray analysis.
