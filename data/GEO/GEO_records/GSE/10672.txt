mir398 mutant analysis-Analysis of miR398 mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
adt07-03_mir398-mutants - mir398 mutant analysis - Defining new targets of miR398 by transcriptome analysis of two miR398 mutant alleles. - Plants were grown on soil in culture chambers under the following conditions, a day/night cycle of 16/8 hours was applied, light intensity was around 100-150 umol m-2 s-1, temperature day/night was 20/15Â°C. Plants were harvested 17 days later and RNAs were then extracted. The experiment was repeated twice. Keywords: gene knock out

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
