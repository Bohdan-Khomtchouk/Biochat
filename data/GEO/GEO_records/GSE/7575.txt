TITLE
Endogenous small RNAs from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain J3(mt-) vegetative cells

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
endogenous small RNAs from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain J3(mt-) vegetative cells Keywords: High throughput 454 small RNA sequencing

DESIGN
Size fractionated small RNA from total RNA extracts was ligated to adapters, purified again and reverse transcribed. After PCR amplification the sample was subjected to 454 high throughput pyrosequencing. Please see www.454.com for details of the sequencing technology.
