TITLE
Cultured cardiomyocytes treated with hyaluronan

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of the role of hyaluronan in cardiomyocytes . The aims of the study were to determine if cardiomyocytes are capable of detecting hyaluronan and if then intrecellular signaling causes changes in gene expression. The study showed that cardiomyocytes can bind hyaluronan with following change in gene expression.

DESIGN
Cultured cardiomyocytes were treated with hyaluronan in differrent length. Gene expression in cells were analyzed with Illumina Beadstation.
