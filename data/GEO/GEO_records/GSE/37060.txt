TITLE
Expression data from siSCR and siPRMT1 ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The major type of protein arginine methyltransferase is PRMT1. Since the growth of embryos from Prmt1−/− mice was arrested shortly after implantation, PRMT1 must play a critical role in early mouse development. We used microarray to investigate the effect of PRMT1 in early embryonic development.

DESIGN
PRMT1 knockdown D3 embryonic stem cells were generated (siPRMT) or as a control, scrambled sequence was introduced (siSCR). To avoid any feeder-cell contamination, the cells were passaged at least 3 times on 0.1% gelatin coated plates before the experiments. Samples were collected and used for microarray from undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells, four-day old aggregated embrioid bodies and 12h atRA or DMSO treated embrioid bodies. Three replicates each.
