TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of Rad21 binding sites and gene expression profiling in wild type mouse small intestinal epithelial crypts and Apc Min adenomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of RAD21 in the transcriptional regulation of global gene expression at early stage of colorectal cancer developments, we peformed the genome-wide analysis to map genomic regions bound by Rad21 in normal small testinal crypts and tumors (adenomas) harvested from Apc Min/+ mice using ChIP-seq. ChIP-seq naalysis identified high confidence RAD21 binding sites unique to normal crypts or adenomas, as well as those common to both tissues. We further performed RNA-seq to profile the changes in gene expression from normal WT crypts to adenomas at the very early stage of adenomagenesis in the context of Rad21 heterozygous loss.
