TITLE
Laser capture microdissection and microarray analysis of ectomycorrhizas formed by the ascomycete Tuber melanosporum reveal functional heterogeneity between mantle and Hartig net compartments

ORGANISM
Tuber melanosporum

SUMMARY
The aim of this analysis was to better understand the complex symbiotic stage of Tuber melanosporum by combining the use of laser capture microdissection and microarray gene expression analysis. We isolated the fungal/soil (i.e. the mantle) and the fungal/plant (i.e. the Hartig net) interfaces from transverse sections of T. melanosporum/Corylus avellana ectomycorrhizas and identified the transcriptional landscape associated with each compartment. We compared these data to the transcriptome of ectomycorrhizal root tips, free-living mycelium and fruiting bodies of Tuber melanosporum (Series GSE17529).
