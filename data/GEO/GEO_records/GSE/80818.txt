TITLE
ChIP-exo data of the Streptomyces venezualae protein Sven6563 (RsrR)

ORGANISM
Streptomyces venezuelae

SUMMARY
We report the results of ChIP-Seq experiment investigating the Rrf2 family transciptional regulator RsrR (putativeily name Redox sensitive response regulator).  The experiment utilised an in trans copy of rsrR with an N-terminal 3xFlag tag encoded on the plasmid pMS82 (containing a phiBT1 integration site).  The experiment utilised beads associated with anti-flag antibodies, specific for the Flag tagged protein and a WT host strain.  Exo nuclease treatment was carried prior to immunoprecipitation to improve the resolution of the binding site.  We report > 600 target binding sites for the RsrR regulon encompasing a broad range of functional targets with specific refernce to those associate with NADPH and NADH metabolism and synthesis.

DESIGN
WT vs RsrR::apr mutant with an in trans 3xFlag tagged copy of RsrR.  Due to the use of strain independent antibodies there is no clean negative control (as would be found with WT using mono/polyclonal antibodies specific to the WT protein.   Exonuclease treatment and processing post lysis and sonication was carrid out by peconicgenomics ( http://peconicgenomics.com/science.html ) Rhee, H-S., and Pugh, B.F.
