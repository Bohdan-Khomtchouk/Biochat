TITLE
Rhinovirus Infection Induces a Differential Gene Expression Pattern in Pulmonary Epithelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to investigate whether HRV infection induces a specific gene expression pattern in airway epithelial cells. The study suggests the underlying molecular regulatory networks genes which might be involved in pathogenicity of the HRV-B and potential targets for further validations and development of effective treatment.

DESIGN
Human alveolar epithelial cell monolayers were infected with HRV species B (HRV-B). Total RNA was extracted from both supernatants and infected monolayer cells at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post infection (hpi) and transcriptional profile was analyzed using high-density oligonucleotide Affymetrix GeneChip and the results were subsequently validated by using quantitative Real-time PCR method.
