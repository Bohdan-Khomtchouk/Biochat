TITLE
Epigenetic analysis of healthy young men following a control and high-fat overfeeding diet

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of healthy young men following a control and high-fat overfeeding diet using Illumina's Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v. 1.2. DNA methylation profiles were obtained for 27,578 CpG sites in human skeletal muscle.

DESIGN
Randomized cross-over desgin, where all subjects receieved both treatments (control and high-fat overfeeding diet). Biopsies were obtained from 23 different individuals amounting to 22 samples following the control diet and 22 samples following the high-fat overfeeding diet (paired n=21). Bisulphite converted DNA from the 44 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip.
