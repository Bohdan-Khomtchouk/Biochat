TITLE
Comprehensive gene expression analysis of human embryonic stem cell during differentiation into neural cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this research we have done a comprehensive transcripteome analysis of hESC differentiation at three different stages: early neural differentiation, neural ectoderm, and mature neurons. We detected and validated time-dependent gene expression patterns and represented that the gene expression patterns exhibit early ESC differentiation. Pathway analysis revealed dynamic expression patterns of members of several signaling pathways.

DESIGN
The hESC cells were passaged every 7 days using collagenase/dispase and cultured under feeder-free culture conditions on Matrigel in hESC medium. Three biological replicates per time point served as the input to generate biotin-labeled cRNA using a linear amplification kit.
