TITLE
Profile of estrogen-responsive genes in an estrogen-specific mammary gland outgrowth model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Both ovarian and pituitary hormones are required for the pubertal development of the mouse mammary gland. Estradiol directs ductal elongation and branching within the adipose stroma of the adolescent mouse mammary gland, while progesterone leads to tertiary branching and alveolar development. The purpose of this investigation was to identify the estrogen-responsive genes that are associated with estrogen-stimulated ductal elongation and branching in the mouse mammary gland in the absence of other ovarian hormones. We also wanted to determine if estrogen-responsive gene regulation at early stages of ductal elongation (ie. when ductal growth was minimal) was similar to those regulated after significant ductal elongation had occurred. To identify estrogen-regulated genes, ovariectomized prepubertal mice were exposed to 17beta-estradiol for four weeks, and mammary gland global gene expression analyzed by microarray analysis at various points during this time course. We determined that while many genes are regulated in all weeks of treatment, there remained a subset of genes that was uniquely regulated at each time-point. This observation was reflected in the biological functions of these genes; some categories were represented in all weeks of treatment while others were specific to only certain time-points. We have also identified estradiol-responsive genes in the mouse mammary gland that co-express with Estrogen Receptor alpha in human breast cancer, which may represent novel effectors of estrogen action and/or biomarkers for the progression of estrogen-dependent cancers and other estrogen-driven diseases.
