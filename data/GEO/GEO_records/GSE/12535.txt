TITLE
The expression profiles analysis of a virulence plasmid-cured strain of shigella flexneri

ORGANISM
Shigella flexneri

SUMMARY
In this study, we analyzed the expression profiles of a virulence plasmid-cured strain and wild-type strain of shigella flexneri. The results showed that the genes of glp regulon were upregulated in mutant bacteria in stationary phase cultures.

DESIGN
The two strains were cultured in LB broth into log-phase and stationary phase respectively. Then, the total RNAs were extracted and analyzed by Nimblegen biochips.
