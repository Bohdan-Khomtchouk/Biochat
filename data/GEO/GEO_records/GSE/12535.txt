TITLE
The expression profiles analysis of a virulence plasmid-cured strain of shigella flexneri

ORGANISM
Shigella flexneri 2a str. 2457T

SUMMARY
In this study, we analyzed the expression profiles of a virulence plasmid-cured strain and wild-type strain of shigella flexneri. The results showed that the genes of glp regulon were upregulated in mutant bacteria in stationary phase cultures.
