TITLE
CIITA regulated genes in human B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) is essential for the expression of MHC-II genes. CIITA functions as a transcriptional activator when bound to genes although repressive roles have been reported at some loci in other cell types.  To define the role of CIITA in gene regulation in human B cells, we performed ChIP-seq for CIITA using three independent antibodies, the histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and ATAC-seq in the Raji human B cell line.  Additionally, we profiled H3K27ac and ATAC-seq in the CIITA-null RJ2.2.5 cell line.  A core set of CIITA peaks were identified that overlapped in all antibodies.  Using the H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and ATAC-seq profiles generated in CIITA+ Raji and CIITA-null RJ2.2.5 cells CIITA dependent chromatin modifications were identified.  These data define the CIITA regulated genes in human B cells.

DESIGN
