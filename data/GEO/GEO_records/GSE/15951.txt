TITLE
Effect of DEL1 on endothelial cell apoptosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the effect of angiogenic factor DEL1 on endothelial cell apoptosis. To understand the functional roles of DEL1, we utilized human cDNA microarrays as a global approach to identify its effect on endothelial gene expression.  The arrays contained ~42,000 elements representing 27,291 unique genes, and were produced at the Stanford Functional Genomic Facility (SFGF).

DESIGN
time series design HUVECs were plated on DEL1- and BSA-coated surfaces, and allowed to grow for 12 and 24 hours; there were three repeats for 12h time point, and 4 repeats for 24h time point.
