TITLE
Highly dynamic molecular signature of macrophage subsets during sterile inflammation, resolution and tissue repair

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tibialis anterior muscle was damaged by cardiotoxin injection and macrophage subsets were isolated and analyzed by gene expression analysis. We used microarray to obtain global gene expression data of muscle-derived tissue macrophage subsets.

DESIGN
Tissue macrophages were collected from regenerating muscle samples, Gr1+/Cx3cr1low and Gr1-/Cx3cr1high macrophage subsets were sorted. The global gene expression patterns of distinct macrophage subsets were analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays.
