TITLE
RNAseq analysis of the N. punctiforme transcriptome during hormogonium development

ORGANISM
Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102

SUMMARY
Change in gene expression for wild-type Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 over the time course of hormogonium development

DESIGN
Total RNA from 1 biological replicate at 0,1,6,12, and 18 hours after hormogonium induction was ribodepleted, converted to cDNA, apended with adapters and sequenced in a single lane of a flow cell on an illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument

PLATFORM
GPL22983 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102)
