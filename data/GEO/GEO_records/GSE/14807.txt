TITLE
Investigation of over-expressing Annexin receptor cell line with and without agonists

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The therapeutic potential of pro-resolution factors in determining the outcome of inflammatory events has gained ground over the past decade. However, the attention has been focused on the non-genomic effects of these endogenous, anti-inflammatory substances. In this study, we have focused our attention on identifying specific annexin 1 (AnxA1) protein/ALX receptor mediated gene activation, in an effort to identify down-stream genomic targets of this well-known, glucocorticoid induced, pro-resolution factor.

DESIGN
In this study, we used four different types of samples (with 2 replicates each):1)cells transfected with the empty pGEX-4T-327 vector and vehicle (PBS) treated; 2)cells transfected with the annexin receptor ALXR (also known as FPR2) and vehicle (PBS) treated; 3)cells transfected with the annexin receptor ALXR and treated with 10uM Ac-26 peptide for 4 hours; 4) cells transfected with the annexin receptor ALXR and treated with 0.5uM Annexin 1 for 4 hours. After the treatments, cells were collected for RNA extraction.
