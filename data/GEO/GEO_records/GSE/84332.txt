TITLE
On the Relationships in Rhesus Macaques between Chronic Ethanol Consumption and the Brain Transcriptome (Central Nucleus of the Amigdala - CeA)

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
This is the first description of the effects of chronic ethanol consumption on the brain transcriptome in a non-human primate (rhesus macaque).  Thirty male animals self-administered ethanol on a daily basis for over 12 months. Gene expression was measured with RNA-Seq in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Genes negatively correlated with consumption were enriched in functional annotations associated with translation and included clusters of ribosomal and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. Genes positively correlated with consumption were enriched in membrane annotations including neuron and synapse part. Genes in the latter category included Ctnna2, Shank1, Vamp2, and Syn1. Gene-level expression data were clustered using the Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) algorithm to identify hub nodes affected by excessive consumption. Key hubs included Nf1, Nkain2, Tmem108 and Penk. The data were also analyzed for alternative exon usage (Iancu et al., 2015). Additional translation and membrane related genes affected by excessive consumption were detected. These included Grm2, Dpysl2 and Kcnc4. Overall, the data illustrate that the effects of excessive ethanol consumption are broad, consistent with the observation that ethanol affects the expression of numerous hub genes.

DESIGN
28 samples of Rhesus Macaques that were experimentally naïve at the onset of alcohol induction (Macaca mulatta, n = 28, 4-11 years, 6-8 kg), were first induced to drink 4% (w/v) ethanol and then allowed to self-administer ethanol for over 12 months under open access conditions (22h/d, 7d/wk) with concurrent meals and continuous access to water.
