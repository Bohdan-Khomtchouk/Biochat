TITLE
Assessment of functional overlap between mouse Dux and human DUX4 in vitro and in vivo

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report both DUX4 and Dux toxicity depend upon their ability to bind DNA and activate transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of V5 epitope tagged human DUX4 and mouse Dux was performed in human myoblasts was analyzed using ChIP-Seq to identify their subsequent binding sites. We found that DUX4 and Dux bind 4-8% of identical sequences, while majority of the binding sites are unique to either DUX4 or Dux. Although small, this overlap could be due to their conserved abilioty to regualte primordial pathways that were essential for life and therefore maintained in both proteins despite their separate evolutionary paths.

DESIGN
We performed ChIP-Seq analysis of human myoblasts transfected with plasmids encoding either epitope tagged human DUX4 (1 sample) and mouse Dux (1 sample). Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared from the ChIP and Input DNA, then resulting DNA libraries were quantified and sequenced and aligned to the human genome (hg19).
