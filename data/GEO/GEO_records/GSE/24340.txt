TITLE
Regulation of male germ cell cycle arrest and differentiation by DND1 is modulated by genetic background

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of E14.5 XY germ cells (marked with Oct4-EGFP transgene) from two strain backgrounds (C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ) that differ in their susceptibility to testicular teratomas.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment. For each sample, Oct4-EGFP+ germ cells from all XY embyos within a litter were pooled. For the C57BL/6J background, n=3 pooled biological replicates were profiled, and n=2 replicates were obtained and profiled for 129S1/SvImJ.
