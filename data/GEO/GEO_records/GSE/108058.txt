TITLE
Somatic cell contamination in sperm human DNA methylatoin studies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We assessed a novel benchtop approach to detecting somatic cell contamination in human sperm epigenetic studies.

DESIGN
We identified samples that were knonw to be contaminated based on array data and samples that we knew were pure based on methylatoin array data.
