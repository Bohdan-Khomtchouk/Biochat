TITLE
Gene expression in primary human B cells sorted according to IL-10 secretion or not after 2 days of activation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine characterize human B cells that express IL-10 on a molecular level, we compared the global gene expression of primary CD19pos B cells secreting IL-10 or not, upon activation with anti-CD40, IL-4 and CpG for 2 days.

DESIGN
Human B cells from healthy donors were sorted according to CD19 expression by magnetic cell separation. The cells were stimulated at 2.5E06 cells/ml by activating anti-CD40 mAb (1 µg/ml, clone 82111, RnD Systems), recombinant human IL-4 (10 ng/ml, Immunotools) and CpG2006 (3 µg/ml) for 2 days following restimulation for 3 h with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 10 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 µg/ml). Staining of viable IL-10 secreting human CD19pos B cells was performed by the IL-10 capture assay according the manufacturers instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, n=2). Finally, the cells were sorted into IL-10posCD69pos and IL-10negCD69pos cells by flow cytometric cell sorting on a BD Aria II sorter (Becton Dickinson). Dead cells were excluded using propidium iodide. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The integrity and amount of isolated RNA was assessed for each sample using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) and a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Double-stranded complementary RNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNA using Message AmpII Biotin (Ambion, USA). Fifteen micrograms of fragmented cRNA of each sample were hybridized to four HG-U133A plus 2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix). Hybridization was performed in a Hybridization Oven 640, and chips were washed and stained in the Fluidics Station 400 (both Affymetrix). Finally, the arrays were scanned with a GeneChip Scanner 3000 using the GCOS software, version 1.4, both Affymetrix. All relevant GCOS data of quality checked microarrays were analyzed with High Performance Chip Data Analysis (HPCDA, unpublished), using the BioRetis database (www.bioretis-analysis.de), as described and validated previously.
