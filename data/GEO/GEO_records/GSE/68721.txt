TITLE
To compare gene signature of  CLL cells from patients with high versus low lymphocyte counts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) the increment in peripheral blood lymphocytes is slower than the expected increment calculated from the cellsâ€™ proliferation rate, suggesting that cellular proliferation and apoptosis are concurrent. Exploring this phenomenon, we found overexpression of caspase3, higher cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) levels (P < 0.007), and a higher apoptosis rate in cells from patients with high counts compared with cells from patients with low counts. Although we previously found that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protects CLL cells from apoptosis, STAT3 levels were significantly higher in cells from patients with high counts than in cells from patients with low counts. Furthermore, overexpression of STAT3 in MM-1 cells did not protect the cells. Rather, it upregulated caspase3 and induced apoptosis. Remarkably, putative STAT3 binding sites were identified in the caspase3 promoter and a luciferase assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and an electromobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that STAT3 activated caspase3. However, caspase3 levels increased only when STAT3 levels were sufficiently high. Using ChIP and EMSA, we found that STAT3 binds with low affinity to the caspase3 promoter, suggesting that at high levels, STAT3 activates a negative proapoptotic feedback mechanism.

DESIGN
4 samples from patients with high-count CLL were compared to 4 samples from patients with low-count CLL
