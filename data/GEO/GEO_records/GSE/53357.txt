TITLE
Genome-wide screening for ELF4-binding sites.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ELF4 (also known as MEF) is a member of the ETS family of transcriptional factors. While an oncogenic role has been demonstrated for ELF4 mainly in hematopoietic malignancies, its definitive function in human carcinogenesis is not clear yet. Here we demonstrate that a wide array of human tumors carry somatic, loss-of-function mutations in ELF4 for its transcriptional activity, and restoring its function exerts anti-proliferative effects. To further explore the tumor suppressive function of ELF4, its binding sites were searched among the human genome with the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with sequencing (ChIP-seq).

DESIGN
Examination of binding site for FLAG-immunoprecipitated mock, ELF4 (WT) and ELF4 (L211M) with each input sample as a control.
