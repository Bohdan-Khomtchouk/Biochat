TITLE
Gene expression alterations in Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We assessed global gene expression profiles in two mouse models of oncogenic FLT3-driven leukemia in the presence and absence of Dnmt3a.

DESIGN
Mouse mRNA profiles of Dnmt3aKO/FLT3-ITD leukemias, FLT3-ITD leukemias, normal CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes, Dnmt3aKO thymocytes, heterozygous Dnmt3a/heterozygous Flt3-ITD knockin leukemia, and heterozygous Flt3-ITD knockin pre-leukemic bone marrow cells were obtained by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500.
