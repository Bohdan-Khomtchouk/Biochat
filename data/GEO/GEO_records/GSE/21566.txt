TITLE
Radial Migration Assay and Analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
When either Panc-1 or MiaPaCa-2 were plated as a discrete clump of cells in the middle of a plate, two morphologically distinct populations could be created. The cells on the periphery of the cell cluster migrated away from the region of high cell density and took on a classical mesenchymal phenotype with spindle like projections and loss of cell to cell adhesion. Cells that remained in the highly populated center showed greater intercellular adhesion and were more rounded in appearance. This model was included to provide information about whether glyco-gene expression changes observed in models of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition also are involved in migration.

DESIGN
Radial Migration Assay comparing two populations (Migrating vs. Non Migrating) in two pancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2)
