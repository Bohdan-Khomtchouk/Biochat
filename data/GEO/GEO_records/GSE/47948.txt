TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of global RNA levels at 4 stages of directed cardiac differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We interrogated the transcriptome using RNA-seq at several stages of an mouse embryonic stem cell to cardiomyocyte directed differentiation protocol.  These four stages represent timepoints when differentiating cultures are enriched for embryonic stem cells (ESC), mesodermal cells (MES), cardiac precursors (CP), or cardiomyocytes (CM) respectively.  This study revealed many dynamic patterns of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and identified groups of genes with similar expression patterns during differentiation.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis of global RNA levels at 4 stages of directed cardiac differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.  Each stage in biological duplicates
