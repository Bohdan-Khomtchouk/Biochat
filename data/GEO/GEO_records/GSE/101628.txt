TITLE
Effects of Inhibition of CDK8/19 Mediator Kinase by Senexin B in HCT116 cells treated with or without TNF-alpha

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have investigated the effects of CDK8/19 inhibitor Senexin B on NFκB-mediated transcription, induced by a canonical NFκB activator, TNFα.

DESIGN
HCT116 cells were pre-treated with or without 1 μM Senexin B for 1 hour, followed by 2 hour treatment with 10 ng/ml TNFα. Each treatment condition was done in biological triplicate.
