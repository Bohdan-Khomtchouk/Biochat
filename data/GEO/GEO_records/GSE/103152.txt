TITLE
Improved Detection of Circulating Epithelial Cells in Patients with Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Circulating epithelial cells (CECs) were purified using a microfluidic device from healthy donors, patients bearing intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and their transcriptomes were sequenced.

DESIGN
examination of mRNA expression of mucin genes in the above samples

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
