TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Determine methylation pattern in PDAC a genome-wide analysis was performed in a cohort of 167 PDAC and 29 adjacent pancreatic tissues samples using the Infinium 450k methylation arrays (Illumina).

DESIGN
167 pancreatic tumors (PDAC) x 29 adjacent -non tumor samples.
