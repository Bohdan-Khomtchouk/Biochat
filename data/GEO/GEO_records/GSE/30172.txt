TITLE
Expression data from Porcine alveolar macrophages infection with Haemophilus parasuis (HPS)

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) play impoartant role in innate immunity. Haemophilus parasuis is the etiological agent of Glasserâ€™s disease in pigs. We used microarrays to study the transcriptome of PAMs infection with Haemophilus parasuis.

DESIGN
Healthy Pigs were intratracheally challenged with H.parasuis strain 0165. And the PAMs were isolated at 6 dpi. RNA extraction were extracted from PAMs that obtained from infection pigs and control pigs and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the differently expressed genes that related to H.parasuis infection to understand the mechanism of PAMs against H.parasuis.
