TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of vorinostat-resistant HCT116 cells following gene knockdown of potential vorinostat-resistance candidate genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Potential vorinostat-resistance candidate genes were identified using RNA interference screening in vorinostat-resistant HCT116 cells (HCT116-VR) using a synthetic lethal approach.  In order to understand the mechanisms by which these genes contributed to vorinostat response, transcriptomic analysis was conducted on HCT116-VR cells and those with siRNA-mediated knockdown of each of the vorinostat resistance candidate genes.

DESIGN
There are 45 samples in total, from triplicate independent biological experiments of 15 samples each.  The negative control to which all gene knockdowns are compared is the mock transfection control (mock).

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
