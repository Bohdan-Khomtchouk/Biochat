TITLE
mRNA sequencing of wild type Columbia and serrate-1 globular stage embryos of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Wild type Columbia and serrate-1 globular stage embryos were sequenced in order to profile miRNAs which are expressed in embryogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana

DESIGN
Two biological replicates, two conditions
