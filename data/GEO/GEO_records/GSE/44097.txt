TITLE
β-catenin target genes in colorectal carcinoma cell lines with deregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To validate the suitability of two commonly used colorectal cancer cell lines, DLD1 and SW480, as model systems to study colorectal carcinogenesis, we treated these cell lines with β-catenin siRNA and identified β-catenin target genes using DNA microarrays. The list of identified target genes was compared to previously published β-catenin target genes found in the PubMed and the GEO databases. Based on the large number of β-catenin target genes found to be similarly regulated in DLD1, SW480 and LS174T as well as the large overlap with confirmed β-catenin target genes, we conclude that DLD1 and SW480 colon carcinoma cell lines are suitable model systems to study β-catenin regulated genes and signaling pathways
