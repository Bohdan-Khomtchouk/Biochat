TITLE
N6-methyladenosine-Mediated Nuclear Export of Messenger RNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA). The effects of this reversible cheimcal modification are mediated in part by methyl-specific RNA binding protein 'readers' of the YTH family. In this study we present the function of YTHDC1 (YT521) in promoting the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Additionally, we identify a role for YTHDC1 in exon retention in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).

DESIGN
Two complementary methods were used to determine YTHDC1 target transcripts within HeLa cells. Subcellular RNA-sequencing following knockdown of YTHDC1 was used to analyze transcript distribution. In mESCs, knockout of Ythdc1 showed minor splicing differences. We analyzed the differences in RNA binding by NXF1 and SRSF3 by RIP-seq in the presence and absence of YTHDC1.
