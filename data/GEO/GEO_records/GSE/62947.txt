TITLE
Expression Data from DMSO or SRPIN803 treated ARPE-19 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to evaluate the effect of SRPIN803 on gene expression in ARPE-19 cells.

DESIGN
ARPE-19 cells were treated with SRPIN803 (10 ÂµM) or the negative control (0.1% DMSO) for 4 hours for Total RNA isolation and hybridization on Microarray.
