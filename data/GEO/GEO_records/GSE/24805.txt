TITLE
Temperature stress differentially modulates transcription in meiotic anthers of tolerant and sensitive tomato plants

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
We have used cDNA-AFLP and microarray analyses to profile the response of the tomato meiotic anther transcriptome to moderate heat stress condition in Moneymaker or Falcorosso and HeatSet1 tomato genotype.

DESIGN
Combimatrix microarray technology were applied to obtain a general overview of the gene expression in meiotic anthers of a tolerant and a sensitive tomato genotype. We analyzed three time points (0,2,and 6h) for each genotype. For each sample we performed three biological replicates.
