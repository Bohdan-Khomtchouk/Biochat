TITLE
Transcriptomics of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SQR9 to maize root exudates

ORGANISM
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens

SUMMARY
Root exudates play an important role in plant-microbe interaction. The transcriptional profilings of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SQR9 in response to maize root exudates under static condition, were investigated by an Illumina RNA-seq for understanding the regulatory roles of the root exudates.

DESIGN
4 treatments, including 2 blank control (24 h and 48 h-post inoculation, named as 5 and 15, respectively), and 2 treatments with maize root exudates (24 h and 48 h-post inoculation, named as 7 and 17, respectively)

PLATFORM
GPL18285 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens)
