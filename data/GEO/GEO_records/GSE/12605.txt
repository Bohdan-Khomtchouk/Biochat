TITLE
The effect of prohibitin overexpression in Caco2-BBE intestinal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the effect of prohibitin overexpression on global gene expression in Caco2-BBE intestinal epithelial cells.

DESIGN
4 individual wells of Caco2-BBE cells, passage 41, were transfected with either empty vector (pcDNA4) or prohibitin/pcDNA4 for 72 hours.  Total RNA isolated from 4 wells of cells/per treatment were pooled together for labeling and hybridization purposes.

PLATFORM
GPL7217 VMSR Human 30k oligonucleotide microarray
