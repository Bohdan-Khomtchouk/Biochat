TITLE
Transcription profiling of wild type Basmati 370 and its T-DNA insertional mutant OsAPC6.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to look for the changes at the transcriptome level caused by the  insertion of a T-DNA in mutant of Basmati 370 with dwarf phenotype. The comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes was conducted individually and collectively for both.

DESIGN
RNA from wild type Basmati 370 and its mutant OsAPC6 grown under optimal conditions were analyzed in two different biological replications (A and B) making total four samples.

PLATFORM
GPL2025 [Rice] Affymetrix Rice Genome Array
