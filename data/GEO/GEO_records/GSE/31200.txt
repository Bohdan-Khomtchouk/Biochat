TITLE
Transcription profiling of wild type Basmati 370 and its T-DNA insertional mutant OsAPC6.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to look for the changes at the transcriptome level caused by the  insertion of a T-DNA in mutant of Basmati 370 with dwarf phenotype. The comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes was conducted individually and collectively for both.
