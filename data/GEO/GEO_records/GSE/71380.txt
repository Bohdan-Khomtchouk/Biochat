TITLE
E2f regulation of gene expression in the liver [1 mo]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
E2FÂ’s are regulators of the cell cycle and are involved in development. In this study we examine transcriptional changes occurring the liver in E2f1 (1KI) and E2f3b (3bKI) knock in mice. These mice have E2f1 or E2f3b knocked into the E2F3a locus resulting in loss of E2f3a and expression of E2f1 or E2f3b from the E2f3a locus as originally described In Tsai et. al., Nature 2008. Microarrays were used to evaluate transcriptional changes due to alterations in E2F expression during liver development.

DESIGN
Affymetrix microarrays were performed using RNA samples from 4 weeks (1 month)  old livers from wildtype (wt), E2F3a knockout (3aKO) E2f1 knock-in (1KI) and E2f3b knock-in (3bKI) mice.
