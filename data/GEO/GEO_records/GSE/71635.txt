TITLE
Expression profiling of fetal mammary cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We use RNA-sequencing to generate gene expression profiles of fetal mammary cells with unique sorting strategies.  These analyses reveal that sorting fetal mammary cells with Sox10 and EpCAM sorting markers provides a stroma-free fMaSC-enriched cell population.  The gene expression profiling of these cells offers a resources to probe the molecular mechanisms that specify this unique cell state.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different sorting strategies for fetal mammary cells
