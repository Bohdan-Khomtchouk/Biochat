TITLE
DNA methylation profiling for HEK-293T cells transfected with GFP and DMEΔ

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Methylome data obtained from human embryonic kindey (HEK)-293T cells expressing a GFP (293T-GFP) or a truncated form of Arabidopsis DEMETER (DME) 5-methylcytosine (5mC) DNA glycosylase (293T-DMEΔ) analyzed on a Human Methylation 450K BeadChip platform (Illumina). These methylation array data revealed genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of the 293T-GFP cells (without direct 5mC excision activity) and 293T-DMEΔ cells (with artificially implemented direct 5mC excision activity).

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 2 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation 450k BeadChip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
