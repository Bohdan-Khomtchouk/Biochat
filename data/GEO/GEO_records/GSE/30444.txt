TITLE
Retroviral Sox17 over-expression adult hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells microarray

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor SOX17 is expressed by fetal, but not adult hematoipoietic stem cells (HSCs), and is required for the maintenance of fetal and neonatal, but not adult, HSCs. In the current study we show that ectopic expression of Sox17 in adult HSCs and transiently reconstituting multipotent progenitors was sufficient to confer increased self-renewal potential and the expression of fetal HSC genes including fetal HSC surface markers. To assess the mechanisms by which ectopic Sox17 expression in adult hematopoietic progenitors increased self-renewal potential and conferred fetal HSC properties, we compared the gene expression profiles of E16.5 fetal liver HSCs, young adult bone marrow HSCs, young adult bone marrow CD48+LSK cells, and Sox17-expressing CD48+LSK cells isolated from mice that had been transplanted with MSCV-Sox17-infected bone marrow cells 12 weeks earlier.

DESIGN
Total RNA (~5ng) was isolated from 3 independent, freshly isolated aliquots of 10,000 E16.5 fetal liver HSCs, 10,000 fetal liver CD48+LSK cells, 10,000 adult bone marrow HSCs, 10,000 adult bone marrow CD48+LSK cells, 10,000 Sox17-expressing CD48+LSK cells isolated from primary recipients 12 weeks after transplantation of MSCV-Sox17-infected bone marrow cells. Purified RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the WT-Ovation™ Pico RNA Amplification system (NuGEN Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sense strand cDNA was generated using WT-Ovation™ Exon Module (NuGEN), then fragmented and labeled using the FL-Ovation™ cDNA Biotin Module V2 (NuGEN). 2.5µg of labeled cDNA were hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0 microarrays.
