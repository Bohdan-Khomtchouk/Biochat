TITLE
Gametophytic transcription factors

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Following our initial transcriptomic analyses of the male gametophyte development (Honys and Twell, Genome Biol 5:R85, 2004), we identified several candidate genes for the function of transcriptional regulators of the male gametophyte development. Two transcription factors with verified function (bZIP and C2H2 ZF) were selected for the identification of their regulons. Mature pollen was isolated as published previously (Honys and Twell Plant Physiol 132:640-652, 2003) from Col-0 wild type plants and T-DNA insertion mutants (SAIL) homozygous for tested genes.

DESIGN
6 samples were used in this experiment.
