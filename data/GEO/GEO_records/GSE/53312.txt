TITLE
Microarray analysis of WT and L-Myc-deficient DC subsets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of L-Myc-dependent genes in pDCs and classical DC subsets with and without stimulation.

DESIGN
Splenocytes were harvested from C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) or 10 generation C57BL/6 backcrossed Mycl1-gfp/gfp (LmycKO) mice and DC subsets sorted to > 95% purity on the FACSAriaII.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
