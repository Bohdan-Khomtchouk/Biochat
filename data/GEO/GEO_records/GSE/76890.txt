TITLE
Releasing activity disengages cohesin’s Smc3/Scc1 interface in a process blocked by acetylation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Sister chromatid cohesion conferred by entrapment of sister DNAs within a tripartite ring formed between cohesin’s Scc1, Smc1, and Smc3 subunits is generated during S and eventually destroyed at anaphase through cleavage of Scc1 by separase. Throughout the cell cycle, cohesin’s association with chromosomes is controlled by opposing activities: loading by the Scc2/4 complex and release by a separase independent releasing activity. Co-entrapment of sister DNAs during replication is accompanied by acetylation of Smc3 by Eco1, which blocks releasing activity and ensures that sisters remain stably connected. Because fusion of Smc3 to Scc1 prevents release and bypasses the requirement for Eco1, we suggested that release is mediated by disengagement of the Smc3/Scc1 interface. We now show that all mutations capable of bypassing Eco1, be they in cohesin’s Smc1, Smc3, Scc1,Wapl, Pds5, or Scc3 subunits, greatly reduce dissociation of N-terminal cleavage fragments of Scc1 (NScc1) from Smc3. We show that this process involves interaction between Smc ATPase heads and is inhibited by Smc3 acetylation
