TITLE
Aquaporin-11 knockout effect on kidney

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aquaporin-11 (AQP11), a new member of the aquaporin family, is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  Aqp11–/– mice neonatally suffer from polycystic kidneys derived from the proximal tubule.  Its onset is proceeded by the vacuolization of ER.  However, the mechanism for the formation of vacuoles and the development of cysts remain to be clarified.  Here, we show that Aqp11–/– mice and polycystic kidney disease animals share a common pathogenic mechanism of cyst formation. Keywords: Geneexpression profile of Aqp11 knokout mouse kidney
