TITLE
Expression profiling reveals transcriptional regulation by Fbxw7/mTOR pathway in radiation-induced mouse thymic lymphomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used gene transcript profiling to gain a deeper understanding of the role of FBXW7 in tumor development and to determine the influence of mTOR inhibition by rapamycin on tumor transcriptome and biological functions. In comparison to tumors from p53 single heterozygous (p53+/-) mice, we find that tumors from Fbxw7/p53 double heterozygous (Fbxw7+/-p53+/-) mice show significant deregulation of cholesterol metabolic processes independent of rapamycin treatment, while cell cycle related genes were upregulated in tumors from placebo treated Fbxw7+/-p53+/- mice, but not in tumors from rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/-p53+/- mice. On the other hand, tumors from rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/-p53+/- mice were enriched for genes involved in the integrated stress response, an adaptive mechanism to survive in stressful environments.

DESIGN
p53+/− and p53+/−Fbxw7+/− mice were generated by crossing p53-/- mice with Fbxw7+/- mice.  At 5 weeks of age, mice were exposed whole-body to a single dose of 4 Gy X-ray irradiation.  Mice were divided randomly into two groups and treated with rapamycin or placebo.  RNA was isolated from thymic lymphomas.
