TITLE
Murine splenic macrophage Cells: Control mice vs. Schistosoma japonicum-infected mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages initiate, modulate, and also serve as final effector cells in immune responses during course of schistosomal infections. Presently, we discussed the roles of the gene expression profile and functional changes of macrophages in immune responses against the Schistosoma japonicum by microarray experiments. Hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that a significant switch in gene transformation associated with a type-1 response and linked with a type-2 cytokine phenotype occurs between 4.5 and 8 weeks post-infection. Moreover, the gene profiles at 3 later time-points following egg challenge were similar in complexity and magnitude. These data also showed that there are mostly inhibition in gene expression related TLR, IFN, MHC and TNFrsf at the switch between 4.5 and 8 weeks post-infection, It is suggested that these immunomodulatory genes may be down-regulated in resistance against S. japonicum eggs and granuloma pathology. The induction of alternatively activated macrophage was important for dampening the inflammation in hepatic granulomas and contributing to a decrease in cytotoxicity. The genes expressions involved in repair/remodeling during liver fibrosis were also observed after eggs production. Understanding these immune mechanisms related to parasite resistance, pathology, and growth with regard to the disease will be helpful in further studies on S. japonicum.
