TITLE
Search for apoptosis-related transcriptome markers associated with herpesvirus infections in peripheral blood leukocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Proteins encoded by the herpesviridae family members interfere with apoptotic pathways helping the viruses to evade immune surveillance. The aim of the study is to reveal mRNA markers which could be clinically relevant for monitoring of the herpesvirus infections. Majority of the genes being investigated fall within the following categories - death receptors, adaptors, caspases, mitochondrial proteins associated with apoptosis, kinanses involved in apoptosis regulation and execution, splicing factors, transcription factors.
