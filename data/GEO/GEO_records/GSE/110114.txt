TITLE
A practical evaluation of alignment algorithms for RNA variant calling analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq with ten pieces of breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma; luminal B type) tissue and three pieces of adjacent normal tissue from a single patient. These RNA-seq data were used to evaluate the performance of splice-aware aligners.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed with 10 pieces of  breast cancer tissue and 3 pieces of adjacent normal tissue obtained from a single patient

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
