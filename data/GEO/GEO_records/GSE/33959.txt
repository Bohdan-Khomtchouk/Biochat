TITLE
Using microarrays to investigate differential gene expression in gills from smallmouth bass after various exposures.

ORGANISM
Micropterus salmoides ; Micropterus dolomieu

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to investigate differentially expressed genes in gill and liver tissue from smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) after exposure to various treatments, compared to controls.  The treatments consisted of bacteria, estradiol, and a mixture of bacteria plus estradiol.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment with biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 of each treatment for liver and gill tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL14931 EcoArrayBass-4x44K-001 [ProbeName version]
