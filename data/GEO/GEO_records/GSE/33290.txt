TITLE
Gene expression signatures of dasatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia patients with resistance to imatinib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Dasatinib has demonstrated efficacy in patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who had resistance or intolerance to imatinib. However, some patients also develop resistance or intolerance to dasatinib. To identify potential molecular pathways involved in primary resistance to dasatinib in CML, we analyzed gene expression profiles of mononuclear cells of 7 imatinib-resistant patients, collected before and after 1-year dasatinib treatment. Large-scale gene expression was measured with Agilent microarrays covering protein-coding genes and long ( > 200 nt) noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Sets of genes and lncRNAs significantly differentially expressed ( > 1.5 fold-change; q value â‰¤10%) were identified. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis pointed to a number of functions, canonical pathways and gene networks that were significantly enriched with differentially expressed genes. In addition to protein-coding genes, lncRNAs have been recently implicated in pathways leading to tumorigenesis. Our data point to new possible regulatory elements involved in dasatinib resistance in CML.
