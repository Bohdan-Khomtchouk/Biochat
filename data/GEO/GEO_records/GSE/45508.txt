TITLE
Genome-wide identification of genes differentially expressed between control and Prdm14 overexpressing ES cells grown in serum conditions.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Prdm14 function in mouse embryonic stem cells. Prdm14 null and overexpressing ES cells were generated and analyzed by microarray, immunoflurescence, flow cytometry, ELISA, qPCR in different culture conditions.

DESIGN
2 samples (control and overexpression) were analyzed in biological triplicates
