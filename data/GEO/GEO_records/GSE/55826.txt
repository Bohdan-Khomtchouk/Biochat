TITLE
Comparative microarray analysis of midgut tissues from feeding Rhipicephalus microplus and Rhipicephalus decoloratus adult females

ORGANISM
Rhipicephalus microplus ; Rhipicephalus decoloratus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of midgut  tissues isolated from  Rhipicephalus microplus and Rhipicephalus decoloratus females at day 20 post infestation. This enabled the identification of transcripts that are species-specific or shared between the two tick species tested.

DESIGN
A direct comparison (Balanced block) was performed: Midgut tissues collected on  day 20 (post infestation) from R. microplus was compared to that of R. decoloratus. Biological replicates: 3 ; Technical replicates: 1.
