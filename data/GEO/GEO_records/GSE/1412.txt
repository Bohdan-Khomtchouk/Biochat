TITLE
Identification of targets of Ultrabithorax

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The identity of every segment in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster is determined by the action of one or more homeotic selector genes. These genes encode proteins containing DNA-binding domains and function by regulating downstream target genes. The structure and function of homeotic genes are highly conserved across a wide range of animals including human. Although much information is available on the molecular and biochemical nature of homeotic genes, comparatively little is known regarding the mechanism/s that are used to generate segmental diversity. This series of experiments were carried out to determine targets of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax. Keywords: other
