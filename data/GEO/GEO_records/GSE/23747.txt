TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of kidney infiltrating T cells after ischemia reperfusion injury reveals a pathophysiologic role for the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined the transcriptional responses in kidney infiltrating T cells 6 hrs after IRI

DESIGN
CD3 (+) T cells were purified applying magnetic beads to mononuclear cells extracted from kidney by percoll gradient methods. The total T-cell RNA was isolated, and trabscript abundance measured with array-based PCR
