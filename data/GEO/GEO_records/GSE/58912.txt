TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of E. coli cultures exposed to green or red CdTe Quantum Dots 50 µg/ml

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
E. coli cultures were exposed to green or red CdTe Quantum Dots 50 µg/ml during 15 min. Total RNA was extracted and cDNA labeled probes were generated by reverse transcription using Alexa 555 and Alexa 647 fluorophores. These probes were used to hybridize genomic slides containing genomic arrays to determine global transcriptional changes.

DESIGN
Two-conditions experiment, Quantum Dots treated cells vs. Untreated control cells. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 toxicants exposed cells, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array

PLATFORM
