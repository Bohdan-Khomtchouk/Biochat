TITLE
Analysis of global gene expression of a human T-ALL cell lines, comparing GATA3low ETP-ALL (i.e. PER-117) and " typical " T-ALL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cell lines representing human T-ALL were analyzed to compare GATA3low ETP-ALL (i.e. PER-117) with " typical " T-ALL. Moreover, changes in global gene expression were assessed comparing GATA3low ETP-ALL (i.e. PER-117) and GATA3high ETP-ALL (i.e. Loucy) upon treatment with Decitabine, a hypomethylating agent.

DESIGN
Analysis of 6 human cell lines representing " typical " T-ALL (BE13, Jurkat, Molt4, RPM18402) and ETP-ALL (Loucy, PER-117).  Additionally, global gene expression was assessed before and after treatment of ETP-ALL cell lines with Decitabine
