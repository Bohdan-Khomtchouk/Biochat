TITLE
Biological function of antisense RNAs that are synthesized by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases under abiotic stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify RDR1/2/6-dependent antisense RNA loci under 2hr drought stress, expression profiles of Poly (A+) RNA and Poly (A-) RNA between rdr1/2/6 and wild-type using the custom microarray (GPL19830) were analyzed.

DESIGN
rdr1/2/6 and wild-type plants (Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia) were grown on MS medium for 2 hours. Then, the plants were transferred to  plastic dish  and kept for 1 week. Poly (A+) RNA and Poly (A-) fractions were separated from 100μg total RNA by treating with Ambion Poly A purist twice. Poly (A-) RNA sample was prepared by depleting rRNA using Invitrogen RiboMinus Plant Kit. 5 ng of Poly (A+) RNA  and 1.4 μg of Poly (A-) RNA samples were used for the expression profiling using the custom array (GPL19830).
