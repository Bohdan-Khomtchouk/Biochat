TITLE
Chromosome copy number and LOH analysis of colorectal carcinoma specimens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Structural changes of chromosomes play important roles in the carcinogenesis of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Here, by using SNP-typing arrays, we have tried to screen for recurrent chromosome copy number changes and loss-of-heterozygosity in the genome of colorectal carcinoma. Genomic DNA was isolated from tumor and paired normal tissues of CRC (n=94), and was hybridized to Affymetrix Mapping 50K Xba 240 arrays. Chromosome copy number and LOH likelihood score was inferred at every SNP locus with CNAG2.0 software ( ). Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization
