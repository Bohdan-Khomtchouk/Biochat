TITLE
Small RNA sequencing in tomato roots with and without Rhizophagus irregularis

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is a predominant relationship between plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. To idendify arbuscular mycorrhiza responsive miRNAs, small RNA libraries were constructed in tomato roots colonized with Rhizophagus irregularis and without Rhizophagus irregularis. We identify miRNAs in tomato roots and provide a new profile of tomato miRNAs. And we found that some miRNAs were responsive to arbuscular mycorrhiza by comparing miRNAs in treatment with that in control.

DESIGN
Examination of arbuscular mycorrhiza responsive miRNAs in tomato through high-throughput small RNA sequencing of  roots with Rhizophagus irregularis and that without Rhizophagus irregularis

PLATFORM
GPL16345 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Solanum lycopersicum)
