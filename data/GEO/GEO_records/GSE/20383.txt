TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Deinococcus radiodurans comparing wild type cells with treated cells at four time points

ORGANISM
Deinococcus radiodurans R1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Deinococcus radiodurans comparing control untreated wild type cells with wild type cells treated with 100 ÂµM CdCl2.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild type vs. 100uM CdCl2. Biological replicates: 4 time courses (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2h), dye-swapped, independently grown and harvested. Two replicate per array.

PLATFORM
