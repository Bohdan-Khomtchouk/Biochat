TITLE
ChIP-Seq for transcriptional regulators and RNA Polymerase II in tumor cells treated with JQ1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-Seq of RNA Polymerase II, and transcriptional regulators in multiple myeloma (MM.1S), glioblastoma (U87-MG), and small cell lung carcinoma (H2171) treated with the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1.

DESIGN
Cell lines (MM.1S, U87-MG, and H2171) representing multiple myeloma, glioblastoma, and small cell lung carcinoma, were treated with varying concentrations (5nM to 5µM) of the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 followed by ChIP-Seq for RNA Polymerase II and transcriptional regulators.  Other datasets from this series of experiments have been release as a part of GSE42355.
