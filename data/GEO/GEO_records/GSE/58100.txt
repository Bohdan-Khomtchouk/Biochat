TITLE
Genome-wide ChIP sequencing of NUCKS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NUCKS has a DNA binding domain at C-terminal region. We found that NUCKS has important roles in regulating glucose homeostasis. To get an unbiased handle on the plausible mechanism(s) of NUCKS action, we performed a genome-wide Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing for NUCKS in primary hepatocytes. We successfully mapped 25mln reads to the mm9 genome and detected NUCKS binding at 10203 sites, 60% of which were located in the proximity of a Transcription Start Sites (TSS). The peaks of NUCKS occupancy were often broad with some around 1Kb, suggesting that multiple NUCKS molecules could bind cooperatively to the same genomic loci. This study provides information of NUCKS binding sites in Mus musculus genome.

DESIGN
Examination of NUCKS binding in mouse primary hepatocytes by Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing.
