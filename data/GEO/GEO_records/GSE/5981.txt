TITLE
Rsd timecourse

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The gene expression profile of MC4100 delta rsd with pACYC Rsd and pACYC delta BS plasmids has been analysed using whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays. Control RNA was isolated from 50ml LB cultures of MC4100 delta rsd strain with pACYC delta BS. Experimental RNA was isolated from 50ml LB cultures of MC4100 delta rsd with pACYC Rsd, for each growth condition (OD600 = 0.4: log phase, 0.9: late log phase, 1.1: transition phase, ST(OD600 = > 2.0): stationary phase). The experiments performed replicate. Keywords: timecourse (overproduction of Rsd)

DESIGN
timecourse = OD600:0.4,0.9,1.1,ST( > 2.0) replicate = 2
