TITLE
Improved resistance to Eimeria acervulina infection in chickens due to dietary supplementation with garlic metabolites

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
This study utilized comparative global gene expression microarray analysis to evaluate the effects of a compound including garlic-derived secondary metabolites on intestinal immunity of chicken.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Garlic metabolites-fed chickens vs. Non-treated control chickens. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 Garlic metabolites-fed replicates with dye-switching.
