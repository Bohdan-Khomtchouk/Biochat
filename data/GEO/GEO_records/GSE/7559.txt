TITLE
Halobacterium NRC-1_oxygen_response_timecourse_set3

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
In order to ensure the reproducibility of the transcriptional response of Halobacterium NRC-1 to oxic/anoxic transitions, we repeated global mRNA measurements for the oxygen time series data in GSE5924, except that cultures were equilibrated to low oxygen for 24 hours prior to the start of the experiment rather than 12 hours, and time course sampling continued to 12 hours post-shift to high oxygen rather than stopping at 6 hours.  The results of these data suggest that there is good reproducibility between datasets, and that Halobacterium responds robustly to oxic/anoxic transitions. Keywords: time course
