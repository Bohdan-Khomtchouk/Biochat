TITLE
Gene expression and phenotypic characterization of mouse heart after chronic constant or intermittent hypoxia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chronic constant hypoxia (CCH), such as in pulmonary diseases or high altitude, and chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), such as in sleep apnea, can lead to major changes in the heart. The molecular mechanisms underlying these cardiac alterations are not well understood. We hypothesized that analysis on the changes in gene expression could help to delineate such mechanisms. In addition, the differences that can be anticipated between CCH and CIH could be potentially dissected.  Current study used CCH and CIH mouse models combined with cDNA microarrays to determine the changes of gene expression in CCH or CIH mice heart.
