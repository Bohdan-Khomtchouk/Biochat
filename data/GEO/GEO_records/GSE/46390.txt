TITLE
Expression data from peritoneal macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Colony Stimulating Factor 1(CSF1) is known to promote osteoclast progenitor survival but its role in regulating osteoclast differentiation and mature osteoclast function are less well understood. Macrophages have the potential to differentiate into osteoclasts and are also considered as osteoclast precursors. The microarray screen was designed to identify potential CSF1 targets in macrophage and osteoclast lineage.

DESIGN
Wild type C57/BL6 mice were treated with 0.2 ml 10 % thioglycolate medium (FTG) / mouse by intra-peritoneal injection. Mice were sacrificed one week after injection followed by intra-peritoneal lavage with 15ml PBS. Macrophages were plated at a density of 1.5×10^6/well in 6-well plates and cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS. At 80% confluence, cells were treated with 100ng/ml CSF1 for 12 hours and RNA extracted. Microarray analysis was performed using Affymatrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays. Data were analyzed by Gene spring 6.2 software.
