TITLE
ChIP-seq of chromatin modifications and factors associated with transcriptionally active regions of the genome in mES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Post-translational modification of histones are coupled to transcription where certain modifications are indicative of an active or inactive region of the genome.  Additionally, protein complexes can regulate the placement of nucleosomes across the genome and this influences the ability of DNA-binding proteins to interact with regions of the genome.  The datasets presented here are ChIP-seq datasets for chromatin modifications associated with active or poised genes (H2Bub, H3K9,K14Ac and H3K4me3).  Brg1 is a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex.

DESIGN
An antibody specific to the chromatin modification or indicated factor was used to enrich for DNA fragments in murine embryonic stem cells. DNA was purified and prepared for Illumina/Solexa sequencing following their standard protocol.
