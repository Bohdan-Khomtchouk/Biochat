TITLE
Altered expression of a limited number of genes contributes to cardiac decompensation during chronic pacing in dogs

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
We have used chronic cardiac pacing in conscious dogs to study mechanism related to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and the transition from compensated dysfunction (CD) to decompensated heart failure (HF).  This occurs from the 3rd to 4th week of pacing with end-stage HF at 30?1 days. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
In this study we used the Affymetrix Canine Array to determine differential expression of potential target genes during the progression to decompensation. Cardiac RNA was extracted at control, 3 and 4 weeks of pacing (n=4).
