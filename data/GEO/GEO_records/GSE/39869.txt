TITLE
A link between host plant adaptation and pesticide resistance in the polyphagous spider mite Tetranychus urticae

ORGANISM
Tetranychus urticae

SUMMARY
The goal of our microarray experiments was twofold: 1) Compare the gene expression profile of acaricide resistant spider mite strains (MAR-AB and MR-VP) with that of a susceptible spider mite strain (London); 2) Study gene expression changes in spider mites from the London strain upon transfer from bean, a suitable host, to tomato, a less favorable host. These gene expression changes upon host change were measured for three timepoints (2 hour on tomato (Tomato-2h), 12 hour on tomato (Tomato-12h) and 5 generations on tomato (Tomato-5G)).

DESIGN
23 samples were analyzed: 6 biological replicates for MR-VP, 5 biological replicates for MAR-AB and four biological replicates each for Tomato-2h, Tomato-12h and Tomato-5G
