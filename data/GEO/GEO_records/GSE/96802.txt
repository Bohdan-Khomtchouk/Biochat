TITLE
Drosophila CNS OXPHOS inhibition microarray

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Mitochondrial dysfunction causes biophysical, metabolic and signalling changes that alter homeostasis and reprogram cells. We used a Drosophila model in which individual subunits of 4 OXPHOS complexes are knocked-down in neurons in the larval CNS. We used microarray analysis to investigate gene expression changes caused by knock down of OXPHOS subunits of complexes I, III, IV and V in neurons.

DESIGN
RNA was purified from the late third instar larval CNS from control larvae (nSyb-Gal4/w), or larvae expressing RNAi transgenes targeting ND-75 (complex I, RNAi line #33910), UQCR-14 (complex III, RNAi line #109542), COX5B (complex IV, RNAi line #105769) and ATPsynCf6 (complex V, RNAi line #107826) in neurons using nSyb-Gal4.  Three replicates are included for the each condition.
