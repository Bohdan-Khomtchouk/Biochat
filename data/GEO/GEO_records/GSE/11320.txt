TITLE
Mutation in Transcription Factor Upc2p Causes Upregulation of Ergosterol Biosynthesis Genes and Fluconazole Resistance

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
In the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, the zinc cluster transcription factor Upc2p has been shown to regulate expression of ERG11 and other genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis upon exposure to azole antifungals.  ERG11 encodes lanosterol demethylase, the target enzyme of this antifungal class.  Over-expression of UPC2 reduces azole susceptibility, whereas its disruption results in hypersusceptibility to azoles and reduced accumulation of exogenous sterols.  Constitutive up-regulation of ERG11 is a major cause of resistance to fluconazole in clinical isolates of C. albicans, yet the mechanism for this has yet to be determined.  Using genome-wide gene expression profiling, we found UPC2 and other genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis to be coordinately up-regulated with ERG11 in a fluconazole resistant clinical isolate as compared with a matched susceptible isolate from the same patient.  Sequence analysis of the UPC2 alleles of these isolates revealed that the resistant isolate contained a single nucleotide substitution in one UPC2 allele that resulted in a G648D exchange in the encoded protein.  Introduction of the mutated allele into a drug susceptible strain resulted in constitutive up-regulation of ERG11 and increased resistance to fluconazole.  By comparing the gene expression profiles of the fluconazole resistant isolate and of strains carrying wild-type and mutated UPC2 alleles, we identified target genes that are controlled by Upc2p.  Here we show for the first time that a gain-of-function mutation in UPC2 leads to increased expression of ERG11 and imparts resistance to fluconazole in clinical isolates of C. albicans. Keywords: genome-wide expression profiling

DESIGN
Clinical isolates S1 (susceptible) and S2 (resistant), genome strain SC5314, UPC2 disruption strains (UPC2M4A and UPC2M4B), UPC2 re-integrant strains of non-mutated UPC2 allele (UPC2M2K21A and UPC2M2K21B), and UPC2 re-integrant strains of mutated UPC2 allele (UPC2M2K31A and UPC2M2K31B) were grown for 3 hours until log phase.  RNA was extracted for each isolate/strain.  Experiments were performed in duplicate.
