TITLE
Human macrophages exposed to hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hypoxia on human macrophages Keywords: Effect of treatment

DESIGN
Cultured macrophages from 4 donors were exposed to normoxia (21% oxygen) or hypoxia (0% oxygen) for 24 h. Two Î¼g RNA from 4 donors incubated at normoxia and 4 donors at hypoxia was pooled respectively and these 2 pools were used for the target preparation and analyzed on duplicate DNA microarrays. Comparisons were made between the expression profile from macrophages exposed to hypoxia and the expression profile from the control normoxic macrophages to identify genes regulated during hypoxia.
