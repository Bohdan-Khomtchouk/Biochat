TITLE
ASH1_A549 vs. vector control_A549

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide expression profiling of miRNAs in order to search for those significantly affected by ASH1 transduction in a lung cancer cell line.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was　conducted to examine miRNA expression profiles using a Human miRNA Microarray, pre-commercial version 6.0 (Agilent) with 470 miRNA probes, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A549 cells were infected with an ASH1-expressing or empty lentivirus and harvested 4 days later.

PLATFORM
GPL7341 Agilent-015508 Human miRNA Microarray, pre-commercial version 6.0 (Unique miRNA version)
