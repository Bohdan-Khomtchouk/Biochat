TITLE
IMM_Cleveland LiXX_EAE-Th1 or Th17_Act1 ko mouse_CNS_exp1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of these studies is to define the molecular signatures of TH1-induced EAE and TH17-induced EAE through adoptive transfer. We will also define the role of IL-17 signaling in the pathology by comparing cells derived from wild type mice to those derived from mice lacking Act1, a key adaptor required for IL-17 dependent signaling. Brains and spinal cords from animals at peak of disease will be profiled.

DESIGN
The goal of these studies is to define the molecular signatures of TH1-induced EAE and TH17-induced EAE through adoptive transfer. We will also define the role of IL-17 signaling in the pathology by comparing cells derived from wild type mice to those derived from mice lacking Act1, a key adaptor required for IL-17 dependent signaling. Brains and spinal cords from animals at peak of disease will be profiled. There are 24 mouse spinal cord samples with key attributes: Th1, Th17, or Unchallenged; wild type or Act1 ko.
