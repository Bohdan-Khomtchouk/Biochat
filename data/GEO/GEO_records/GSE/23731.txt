TITLE
Cl-amidine treatment reduces autoantibody response in collagen-induced arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cl-amidine treatment reduces autoantibody responses in CIA.  Sera were collected from Cl-amidine and control treated mice, and autoantibodies in these samples were profiled using Synovial Antigen Arrays. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) was used to analyze the antigen array datasets, and identified 8 antigens with a significant difference in autoantibody reactivity (false discovery rate (q) < 5%). Hierarchical clustering was then performed to elucidate the relationships between the autoantibody profiles. The Cl-amidine treated mice clustered together and exhibited lower autoantibody titers against all of the 8 antigens identified by SAM, including autoantibody reactivity to native epitopes derived from cartilage as well as citrulline-modified filaggrin peptides.
