TITLE
Differential expression data of BMDMs of mice infected with avian influenza influenza A (H7N9) viruses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To clarify the underlying mechanism that regulates the response of iron metabolism to influenza A virus infection, we analyzed gene expression profiles in mouse, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) infected with H7N9 virus. In addition, We also analysed the chemokine, inflammation, innate-immunity, lipid-metabolism, transcription mRNA level by micrroarray. So, we gain the global transcriptional response in the BMDMs of mice infected with H7N9 virus.

DESIGN
BMDMs were seperated from 4-6 week-old BALB/C mice (wild type, WT and Hfe KO) and inoculated with H7N9 virus for 6h and 12h, and the uninfected BMDMs were as a control.The cells were collected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent microarrays. Samples were named as follows: Control (WT-1), treatment(WT-12h-2, WT-6h-34, KO-5, KO-6h-67, KO-12h-8).
