TITLE
Directed differentiation of placode from human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we compare the transcriptional profile during the differentiation of hESC into neuroepithelial cells (NSB) (Chambers et. al 2009 Nature Biotechnology) with our new placode differentiation (PIP).

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated at day 1,3, 5 (NSB), 5 (PIP), 7 (NSB), 7 (PIP), 9 (NSB), 9 (PIP), 11 (NSB) and 11 (PIP) of differentiation using Trizol. Samples for each group in triplicate were processed for Illumina bead arrays (Illumina HT-12) by the MSKCC genomics core facility according to the specifications of the manufacturer.
