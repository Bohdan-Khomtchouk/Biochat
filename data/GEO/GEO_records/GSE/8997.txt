TITLE
XX hour expression data of AM from C57Bl/6 or gp91phox-/- mice following exposure to conidia or polystyrene beads

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The response of AM transcription to exposure to conidia is expected to provide information about the mechanism by which these cells prevent conidial germination and therefore invasive aspergillosis. Keywords: timecourse comparison with mock bead and conidia

DESIGN
Conidia from A. fumigatus or polystyrene beads were instilled into lungs of C57Bl/6 or gp91phox-/- mice to test the response of AM in a normal and immune compromised host to determine if different responses contributed to increased susceptibility of invasive aspergillosis. Following in vivo incubation for 0, 2, or 4 hours, AM RNA was collected and prepared for hybridization to mouse Affymetrix GeneChip arrays.
