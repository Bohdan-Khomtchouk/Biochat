TITLE
Pof D119 mutant expression analysis in Drosophila melanogaster testis

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To study the influence of POF on transcription in testis we made expression arrays from dissected testes (Pof mutants and wild type control). It is clear that POF mainly alters the expression of genes on the fourth chromosome Keywords: mutant analysis

DESIGN
Three replicates, each of 60 testes from 0-24h old males (Pof mutants and wild type control), were dissected and total RNA prepared
