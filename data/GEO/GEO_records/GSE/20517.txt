TITLE
Tumor-derived Jagged1- and Notch-dependent transcription changes in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts that were flow cytometry-separated from cocultures with control or Jagged1-overexpressing tumor cells and treated with either DMSO control or 1Î¼M MRK-003 (gamma-secretase inhibitor).

DESIGN
One cell line (MC3T3-E1) cells: four different experimental conditions: cultured with (1) control tumor cells + DMSO; (2) Jagged1-overexpressing tumor cells + DMSO; (3) control tumor cells + MRK-003; (4) Jagged1-overexpressing tumor cells + MRK-003. Each experiment has two biological replicates. Total, 8 samples.
