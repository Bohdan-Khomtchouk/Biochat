TITLE
A novel HbA1c-lowering traditional Chinese medicinal formula, identified by translational medicine study

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CYSKT affected the expressions of genes associated with insulin signaling pathway, increased the amount of phosphorylated insulin receptor in cells and tissues, and stimulated the translocation of glucose transporter 4 to the cell membrane. Moreover, CYSKT affected the expressions of genes related to diabetic complications, improved the levels of renal function indexes, and increased the survival rate of diabetic mice.

DESIGN
Type 2 diabetic mice were treatedwithout or with 200 mg/kg CYSKT for 30 consecutive days and RNAs from muscle tissuess were extracted for microarray analysis. Number of replicate was three.
