TITLE
Genome-wide maps of Runx3 bound regions in splenic CD8+ T cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq was conducted using freshly isolated (resting) splenic  WT CD8+ T cells with anti-Runx3 antibody (Ab), anti-H3K4me1 Ab and non-immune serum (NIS) as control.

DESIGN
Two biological Runx3 and two NIS IP repeats from splenic CD8+ T cells isolated by positive selection on anti-CD8 magnetic beads, collected from 18 WT mice.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
