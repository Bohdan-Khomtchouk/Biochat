TITLE
Aedes aegypti Cry11Aa intoxication curve transcriptome

ORGANISM
Aedes aegypti

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic analysis of mosquito larvae exposed to LC50 of Cry11Aa toxin from Bti at different times was conducted to determine defense response pathways in order to better understand the toxin's mode of action and identify possible cellular targets to enhance toxin activity.

DESIGN
4 replicates of 5 intoxication time points and 3 replicates of 2 control timepoints were sequenced on an Illumina platform, analyzed for differential expression with two packages. Read data can be accessed through PRJNA301038 and SRP065731

PLATFORM
GPL14869 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Aedes aegypti) GPL21020 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Aedes aegypti)
