TITLE
Beta-adrenergic-activated macrophages: Location in the M1-M2 spectrum and transcriptional regulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling results were used to systematically assess the extent to which transcriptomes of beta-adrenergic-activated macrophages show expression of genes that are characteristic of the canonical IL-4-stimulated M2 macrophage vs. IFN-gamma-stimulated M1 macrophage and to infer potential transcriptional regulators.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) of Balb/c female mice (aged 8-10 weeks) incubated with isoproterenol, IL-4, IFN-gamma, or only media for 24 hours.  Transcript origin analysis was used to assess the relative polarity of BMDMs activated by isoproterenol, using IL-4-activated and IFN-gamma-activated BMDMs as reference.  TELiS used to assess potential transcriptional regulation.
