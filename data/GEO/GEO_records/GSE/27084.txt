TITLE
Transcriptional targets of Xenopus EBF3 in the absence of Noggin : Untreated animal caps vs. Dexamethasone (DEX) treated animal caps

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling comparing the genes upregulated or downregulated by active hGR-Xebf3 by treating hormone DEX to those by non-active hGR-Xebf3 in Xenopus animal caps.

DESIGN
Three experimental conditions, hGR-Xebf3 without DEX treatment (1), hGR-Xebf3 with DEX treatment (2), and hGR with DEX treatment (3). Comparison, 1 vs.2 and 1 vs. 3.  Biological replicate, one time
