TITLE
Gene expression data from A2780 cells with BMI1 and lncRNA FAL-1 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human ovarian cancer cell line A2780 cells were infected with shRNA targeting  lncRNA FAL-1 and proteincoding gene BMI1. We used microarray to identify genes which were co-regulated by lncRNA FAL-1 and BMI1.

DESIGN
A2780 -BMI1 knockdown and A2780-FAL-1 knockdown cells were generated by lentivirus infection. Cells were transducted with BMI1 ctrl, BMI1 shRNA1, BMI1 shRNA2, FAL-1 ctrl, FAL-1 shRNA1 and FAL-1 shRNA2.  Medium containing lentivirus was replaced 24 hours post-infection. 96 hours after infection, cells were harvested for RNA extraction.
