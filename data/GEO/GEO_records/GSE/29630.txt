TITLE
Galectin-3 regulates the expression of various genes in human gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Although galectin-3 is known to modulate the cell proliferation, RNA processing, tumorigenesis, metastasis and apoptosis and also, which is highly expressed in human cancers, the function of galectin-3 is still controversy in gastric cancer. Here, we demonstrated the function of galectin-3 on gastric cancers by silencing with synthetic double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA). After silencing of galectin-3, cell numbers decreased and cell shapes changed in round. To determine the mechanism, microarray analysis was used to detect the changes in gene expression by galectin-3 silencing.

DESIGN
we silenced galectin-3 in AGS as a gastric cancer cells with synthetic double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA), and performed the microarray analysis to detect the changes in gene expression by galectin-3 silencing.
