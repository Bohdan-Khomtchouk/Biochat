TITLE
Gene expression profiles of PD fibroblasts treated by SNCA expression-control RNAi.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated gene expression profiles of Parkinson disease (PD) patient's fibroblasts that were treated by SNCA expression-control RNAi to see adverse effects of the RNAi treatment. The data suggested no significant adverse effects caused by the treatment.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples prepared from PD fibroblasts that were treated by SNCA expression-control RNAi and by non-silencing RNAi as a control.
