TITLE
Whole genome analysis in A549 cells treated for short incubation periods with various concentrations of triptolide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to identify the genes primarily affected by a short treatment of A549 cells with grading concentrations of the natural compound triptolide. The cells were exposed to this molecule before RNA was extracted, then used for whole human genome microarray experiments.

DESIGN
12 samples, corresponding to untreated cells plus three concentrations (0.05, 0.15, 0.45 ÂµM) of tripolide for each time point (1, 2, and 4 hours). Each sample was analysed in triplicate, i.e. three microarray for each condition, making a total of 36 microarrays.
