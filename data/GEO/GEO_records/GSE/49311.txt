TITLE
Expression data from left versus right mouse entorhinal cortex (EC).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The entorhinal cortex of the mouse seems to be sensitive to molecular mechanisms that have been linked to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. In this microarray study we are interested in comparing the expression profile of the left versus the right EC of the mouse, in order to understand if there is a significant difference in gene expression that might reveal any insights into the differential activation of these areas. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying a possible lateralization of the EC in the mouse brain (left versus right EC).

DESIGN
The left and the right entorhinal cortices of 6 month-old C57BL/6 wild-type mice was dissected out by following anatomical landmarks and guided by the Mouse Brain Paxinos and Franklin’s atlas. Samples were immediately processed for RNA extraction by using the RNeasy Kit from QIAGEN according to manufacturer’s instructions. Before running the microarrays, RNA quality and integrity was monitored on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. Samples were then run on Affymetrix Genechip Mouse gene 2.0 ST arrays following Affymetrix’s standard procedures (n=3 per cortical hemisphere). Microarrays data were analyzed through the use of Ingenuity® iReport (Ingenuity® Systems, www.ingenuity.com).
