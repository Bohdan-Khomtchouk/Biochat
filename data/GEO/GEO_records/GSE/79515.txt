TITLE
Gene expression profiles of OSKH iPSCs, OSK iPSCs and ESC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation is similar to somatic cell nuclear transfer in oocytes, and this procedure can be used to generate ESCs, which suggests the contribution of oocyte-specific constituents. Here, we show that the mammalian oocyte-specific linker histone H1foo has beneficial effects on iPSC generation. Induction of H1foo with Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (OSKH) significantly enhanced the efficiency of iPSC generation. H1foo promoted in vitro differentiation characteristics with low heterogeneity in iPSCs. H1foo enhanced the generation of germline competent chimeric mice from iPSCs in a manner similar to that for ESCs. These findings indicate that H1foo contributes to the generation of higher-quality iPSCs. This experiment was designed to investigate the similarity of global gene transcriptome profile among OSKH iPSCs, OSK iPSCs and ESC.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated four replicates of OSKH iPSCs, three replicates of OSK iPSCs (control group) and ESC were collected and applied in this experiment.
