TITLE
Absolute expression level of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Total RNA versus genomic DNA hybridization on custom arrays designed for all Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected in mid-log phase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells grown in rich medium (abbreviated CM, in house recipe).   RNA was then converted to cDNA, Cy3-labeled and hybridized competitively against Cy5 labeled genomic DNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
