TITLE
Gene expression signatures for combined ATO and CDDP treatment (Ato-C) in CML cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effect of Ato-C on gene expression, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to suppress the cell proliferation of Ph+ CML cell lines.  K562, KU-812 and MEG-A2 cells were treated with ATO, CDDP or Ato-C for 24 h in vitro.

DESIGN
K562, KU0812 and MEG-A cells were treated with ATO, CDDP or Ato-C for 24 h in vitro.

PLATFORM
GPL10332 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
