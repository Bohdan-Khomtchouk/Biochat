TITLE
MiRNA profiling in Rattus norvegicus pancreatic cells: RIN-5F cells during infection with Coxsackie B4 virus

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
This study aims at elucidating how Coxsackie B virus infection perturbs the host's miRNA regulatory pathways that may lead to different pathological events using the miRNA microarray approach.

DESIGN
The rat pancreatic cell line -RIN-5F, was infected with various preparations of Coxsackie B4 viruses was analysed for miRNA expression profiles subsequently. The miRNA expression profiles were measured at 48, and 72 hours post infection, respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL14860 Agilent-031189 Unrestricted_Rat_miRNA_v16.0_Microarray (miRNA ID version)
