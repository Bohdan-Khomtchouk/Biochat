TITLE
Genome wide analyses of Su(Hw)M393 binding in the Drosophila ovary

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The Suppressor of Hairy-wing [Su(Hw)] protein is a twelve zinc-finger DNA binding transcriptional regulator. Here, we map the genome wide association of Su(Hw) protein expressed from the novel su(Hw)M393 allele, which encodes a protein with a C350S substitution that inactivates ZF4. These analyses demonstrate that ZF4 is required for association with a subset of Su(Hw) binding sites and suggests that these sites may be primarily associated with insulator function.

DESIGN
Mapping the genome wide localization of Su(Hw) carrying a disruption of ZF4 in ovaries from Drosophila females that were less than 6 hours old .
