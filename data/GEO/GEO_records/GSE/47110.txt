TITLE
Illumina array to compare whole-genome expression change in miR-127 KO mice at E18.5 in 3 tissues: brain, skin and muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-127 is an imprinted microRNA on mouse chromosome 12, strongly expressed during late embryogenesis and known regulator of placental gene Rtl1. miR-127-knockout (KO) mice appear phenotypically normal. An Illumina beadchip whole genome microarray experiment was carried out on embryonic stage 18.5 (E18.5) mice with a deletion in the miR-127 gene, and compared with wild type (WT) mice. Three tissues with varying expression of miR-127 were analysed: brain, skin and muscle.

DESIGN
For each tissue (brain, skin, muscle) and genotype (WT or miR-127 KO), total RNA from 15 different embryos was extracted. These RNA samples were divided into three pools of five, to make three biological replicates. Each biological replicate was applied to two separate Illumina Mouse WG-6 v2.0 beadchips, to make two technical replicates.
