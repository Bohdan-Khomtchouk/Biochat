TITLE
Postia placenta MAD-698 gene expression in different media

ORGANISM
Postia placenta

SUMMARY
Transscript profiles of Postia placenta grown on different substrates were analyszed. Array design was based on the DoE's Joint Genome Institute's gene models for P. placenta version 1. The research goal is to identtify genes essential for cellulose depolymerization. Keywords: Culture condition comparison
