TITLE
OSKM induce extraembryonic endoderm stem (iXEN) cells in parallel to iPS cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
While the reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC (OSKM) can reactivate the pluripotency network in terminally differentiated cells, they also regulate expression of non-pluripotency genes in other contexts, such as the mouse primitive endoderm. The primitive endoderm is an extraembryonic lineage established alongside the pluripotent epiblast in the blastocyst, and is the progenitor pool for extraembryonic endoderm stem (XEN) cells. Several studies have shown that endodermal genes are upregulated in fibroblasts undergoing reprogramming, although whether endodermal genes promote or inhibit acquisition of pluripotency is unclear. We show that, in fibroblasts undergoing conventional reprogramming, OSKM-induced expression of endodermal genes leads to formation of induced XEN (iXEN) cells, which possess key properties of blastocyst-derived XEN cells, including morphology, transcription profile, self-renewal, and multipotency. Our data show that iXEN cells arise in parallel to iPS cells, indicating that OSKM are sufficient to drive cells to two distinct fates during reprogramming.

DESIGN
Sequence-based mRNA transcriptional profiling of three different cell lines (MEF, XEN, iXEN) with multiple biological replicates, under two different growth medium conditions (ESC medium, XEN medium) for XEN and iXEN cells.
