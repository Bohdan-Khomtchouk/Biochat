TITLE
Expression data from 5 day old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Upon induction of DNA damage Arabidopsis thaliana plants initiate a transcriptional response program governed by signalling cascades which are activated by the ATM and ATR kinases

DESIGN
To analyse if the ATM dependent gene GMI1 (At5G24280) is involved in the regulation of the transcriptionl response, we compared the gene expression profiles of wildtype and gmi1 deficient plants upon gamma-irradiation
