TITLE
Early effects of cdkf;1 RNAPII CTD Serine-7 kinase mutation on regulation of transcription in 7 days old Arabidopsis seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Serine phosphorylation of conserved Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 repeats of RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (RNAPII CTD) plays a central role in the regulation of transcription and co-transcriptional RNA processing. Maintenance of CTD phosphoserine-7 mark in Arabidopsis requires the CDKF;1 kinase, which mediates in vivo activation of downstream-acting CDKD CTD kinase family. Knockout mutations of CDKF;1 lead to over 50% reduction of RNAPII CTD Ser-7 phosphorylation as early as 7 days after germination in seedlings. The transcript profiling experiment aimed at determining how early changes in CTD Ser-7 phosphorylation affect global regulation of transcription. We used Affymetrix ATH1-121501 Genome Array to compare global transcript levels in wild type and cdkf;1-2 mutant seedlings 7 days after germination.

DESIGN
Wild type and cdkf;1-2 mutant Arabidopsis (Col-0) seedlings were grown in solid MSAR medium (Koncz, C., Martini, N., Szabados, L., Hrouda, M., Bachmair, A., and Schell, J. (1994). Specialized vectors for gene tagging and expression studies. In: Plant Molecular Biology Manual, Gelvin,S., and Schilperoort, B. (eds.), Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht-Boston-London, B2, 1-22.) containing ½ concentration of macro elements and 0.5% sucrose in Petri-dishes at 22°C, 120 mol/m2s light intensity and 8h light/16h dark period. Seedling were collected at 4h after the start of the light period in liquid nitrogen for RNA preparation.
