TITLE
TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion variants induce TGF-β signaling and epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TMPRSS2:ERG (T/E) gene fusions are detectable in approximately 50% of all prostate cancer cases and can be considered as biomarkers for molecular subtypes. Several T/E variants have been identified and expression of specific fusion mRNAs was associated with adverse clinicopathologic parameters. However, the underlying molecular processes induced by distinct T/E variants still remain unclear. We therefore aimed to characterize the molecular and cellular profile and specific transcriptional modulation induced by different T/E gene fusion variants.

DESIGN
A modified LNCaP cell model was used that stably overexpresses the T/E variants III and VI in a doxycycline-inducible (Tet-On) promoter system. Gene expression was induced with doxycylin for 72h. Expression profiles were compared to induced or uninduced empty vector control. Total RNA was obtained in triplicates for each variant clone and empty vector clone.
