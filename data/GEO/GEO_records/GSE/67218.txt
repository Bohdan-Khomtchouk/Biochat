TITLE
Transcriptional expression level of E. coli at 37 ℃ in LB media

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
In order to understand the impact of fitness effect on genome evolution, we measured gene expression level by directional RNA-seq of E. coli grown at 37 ℃ in LB media because it is known that gene expression level has correlation with sequence evolution rate (Koonin & Wolf, 2006).

DESIGN
Directional RNA-seq (dUTP method by TruSeq®) were generated  in duplicates by using Illumina MiSeq

PLATFORM
GPL17439 Illumina MiSeq (Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655)
