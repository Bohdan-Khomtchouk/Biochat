TITLE
Aristaeus chip 1.0: an in situ synthesized oligonucleotide microarray for Ovis aries

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Here we present a high-density in situ synthesized microarray for Ovis aries, named Aristaeus, designed by means of a pipeline of software instruments that, starting from non-annotated redundant EST sequences, selects oligonucleotides suitable for in situ generation on chip. The chip was tested by comparing the gene expression profiles of two sheep breeds with different phenotype, Sarda and Gentile di Puglia. We carried out microarray experiments on liver and udder tissues from lactating individuals and identified a relevant number of differentially expressed genes, all involved in metabolism pathways. The results are consistent with literature knowledge, while selected differential gene expressions have been confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses.

DESIGN
Tissue samples of liver were collected from 4 lactating individuals of two sheep (Ovis aries) breeds, Gentile di Puglia and Sarda. Biopsies of liver tissue were taken at second lactation stage (first record, stage 01: 6 days after lambing; second record, stage 02: 44 days after lambing) in both breeds. Tissues from liver were immersed in RNAlater (Sigma) immediately after biopsy and stored at -20Â°C. Samples were pooled by breed and then reverse labeled (cy5 and cy3), resulting in four raw data sets.
