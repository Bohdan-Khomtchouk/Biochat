TITLE
Effects of ACTH and DEX on gene expression in rat kidneys

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The left kidneys of 8 Sprague-Dawley rats were removed and the rats were left for 2 weeks to recover. After 4 additional days (during which blood pressure measurements were obtained), they were injected daily subcut. with either saline (1ml/kg), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, 0.2mg/kg) or dexamethasone (DEX, 0.02mg/kg) for 8 days before the right kidney was removed. ACTH and DEX treatment caused hypertension in the rats as illustrated by increased systolic blood pressure. The gene expression patterns of the kidneys were analysed using Affymetrix arrays. Keywords: repeat

DESIGN
The left kidney of each rat acts as a control for the treated right kidney. Two rats each were treated with either saline, ACTH or DEX.
