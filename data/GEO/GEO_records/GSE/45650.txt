TITLE
Gene expression profiles in liver of F344 rat treated with chemical

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The rodent carcinogenicity test requires extremely long test term and large examination cost. Therefore, now we need to develop a short term and low cost screening method. We already developed a chemical carcinogenicity short term  screening method CARCINOscreenÂ®. This study was performed to validate this screening method.  We conducted 28 days-repeated dose experiments in male F344 rats with 4 carcinogens and 2 non-carcinogens, and the gene expression profiles in liver were measureed by custom oligo microarrays.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs. chemical treated rat liver. Biological replicates: 4 control, 4 treated, control samples were pooled. One replicate per array. Compound treatments: 4 carcinogens: Hexachloroethane, 1,2,3-Trichloropropane, 1-Amino-2-methylanthraquinone, 3-(4-Chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea 2 non-carcinogens: 1,2-Dichlorobenzene and Tetracycline hydrochloride

PLATFORM
GPL16936 Agilent-015749 Rat ToxArrayIII ver.2 44Kx4 array
