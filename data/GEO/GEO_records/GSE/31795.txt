TITLE
Directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells allows exploration of novel transcription factor genes for pancreas development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our bioinformatics analyses of sequential microarray datasets allowed identification of over 20 novel TF genes potentially important for pancreas development.

DESIGN
Microarray analyses were performed on differentiating ESC cells at days 0, 4, 8 and 15 of their sequential differentiation.
