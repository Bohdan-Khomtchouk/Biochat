TITLE
Mouse Kidney - Effect of Low Phosphate Diet in Normal and Hyp Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This is a study of the change in gene expression in mouse kidney after feeding control (1.0% P) or low phosphate diet (0.03% P) for 3 or 5 days to normal or Hyp (X-linked hypophosphatemic) mice at 5 weeks of age.  The mice were C57BL/6J.  Normal wild-type mice, hemizygous Hyp (Hyp/Y) male mice, or heterozygous (Hyp/+) female mice were used.  The gene is dominant, so that the two genders are equally affected with low renal retention of phosphate and severity of their bone disease.  RNA from 3 mice were pooled for each microarray.  The arrays were processed as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (copyright 2001, Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), rev. 1, Part number 701021.  The data for each array were scaled to an average signal value of 500 for all genes on the array. Keywords = mouse Keywords = kidney Keywords = low phosphate diet Keywords = Hyp Keywords = Phex Keywords = X-linked hypophosphatemia Keywords: repeat sample
