TITLE
Mutant-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha target genes in myeloid progenitor cells by chromatin IP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) is a lineage-specific transcription factor that directs development of granulocytes. To obtain insights into the genome-wide transcriptome of mutant C/EBPα, we have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation on DNA promoter microarrays (ChIP-chip) in the murine 32D myeloid progenitor cell line. These cells expressed an estradiol-inducible form of mutant C/EBPα.

DESIGN
In the murine 32D myeloid progenitor cell line, expressing an estradiol-inducible form of C-terminal mutant of C/EBPα. (n=2, replicates). We have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation on DNA promoter microarrays (ChIP-chip) after 4 hours of estradiol incubation.
