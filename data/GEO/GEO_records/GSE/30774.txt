TITLE
Iron excess limits HHIPL2 gene expression and decreases osteoblastic activity in human MG-63 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our transcriptomic data shows that iron impact on human osteoblastic MG-63 cells  by decreasing HHIPL-2 gene expression (2 fold ratio). This impact is corrected in presence of deferoxamine. Additional biological experiments in the manuscript  suggest that the iron related modulation of HHIPL-2 gene expression could take place in the decrease of osteoblastic markers in the MG-63 cell line. Such mechanisms could  participate to the development of osteoporosis in iron overloaded patients.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, iron exposure using ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) at two concentrations (5 and 20µM) was compared to basal condition. Additional conditions include: deferoxamine (DFO) (iron chelator) 20µM alone or in addition to FAC 20µM. For each condition five biological replicates were performed (independent experiments).
