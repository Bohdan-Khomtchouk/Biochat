TITLE
Expression data from invasive lobular carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: The prognostic value of histologic grade (HG) in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) remains uncertain, and most ILC tumors are graded as HG2. Genomic grade (GG) is a 97-gene signature that improves the prognostic value of HG. This study evaluates whether GG may overcome the limitations of HG in ILC. Methods: Gene expression data were generated from frozen tumor samples, and GG calculated according to the expression of 97 genes. The prognostic value of GG was assessed in a stratified Cox regression model for invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and overall survival (OS).

DESIGN
Gene expression data were generated from frozen tumor samples of patients with ILC.
