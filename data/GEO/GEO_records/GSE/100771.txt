TITLE
cGAS surveillance of micronuclei links genome instability to innate immunity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA is strictly compartmentalised within the nucleus to prevent autoimmunity despite this cGAS, a cytosolic sensor of dsDNA, is activated in autoinflammatory disorders and by DNA damage. Precisely how cellular DNA gains access to the cytoplasm remains to be determined. Here, we report that cGAS localises to micronuclei arising from genome instability in a model of monogenic autoinflammation, after exogenous DNA damage and spontaneously in human cancer cells. These micronuclei occur after mis-segregation of DNA during cell division and consist of chromatin surrounded by their own nuclear membrane. Breakdown of the micronuclear envelope, a process associated with chromothripsis, leads to rapid accumulation of cGAS, providing a mechanism by which self-DNA becomes exposed to the cytosol. cGAS binds to and is activated by chromatin and consistent with a mitotic origin, micronuclei formation and the proinflammatory response following DNA-damage are cell-cycle dependent. Furthermore, by combining live-cell laser microdissection with single cell transcriptomics, we establish that induction of interferon stimulated gene expression occurs in micronucleated cells. We therefore conclude that micronuclei represent an important source of immunostimulatory DNA. As micronuclei formed from lagging chromosomes also activate this pathway, cGAS recognition of micronuclei may act as a cell-intrinsic immune surveillance mechanism detecting a range of neoplasia-inducing processes.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of 35 individual mouse embryonic fibroblasts 48 h after 1 Gy irradiation: 21 test (with micronuclei) and 14 controls (without micronuclei).

PLATFORM
GPL21626 NextSeq 550 (Mus musculus)
