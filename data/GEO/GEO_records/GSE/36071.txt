TITLE
Effect of costimulation on microRNAs levels in human naïve CD4 T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA transcriptional profiling of human naïve CD4 T cells comparing cells that saw no activation, only anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 to identify microRNAs specifically upregulated by CD28-mediated costimulation.

DESIGN
Three conditions experiment. PBS, anti-CD3, anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 all compared to a reference sample. Biological triplicates, independently extracted and activated.
