TITLE
Gene expression analysis of bovine blastocyst produced under alternative in vivo and in vitro culture conditions during EGA time

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
There is an inevitable need for combining in vitro and in vivo culture systems during specific developmental time points to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of early embryo development which would yield insights into the molecular pathways controlling early development and to improve our knowledge in regulation of embryonic development. In current study, we aimed to understand the influences of alternative culture conditions (in vivo or in vitro) during EGA event on embryonic developmental rate, gene expression pattern and subsequent influences on pathways and biological functions controlling bovine embryo development.

DESIGN
Six different blastocyst groups were produced under alternative in vivo and in vitro culture conditions. The first two groups (Vitro_4-cell and Vitro_16-cell) were matured, fertilized and cultured in vitro until 4- and 16-cell stage, respectively then transferred to synchronized recipients and continued culture in vivo until day 7 blastocyst stage. The second two groups (Vivo_4-cell and Vivo_16-cell) were matured, fertilized and cultured in vivo until 4- and 16-cell stage, respectively then flushed out and cultured in vitro until day 7 blastocyst stage. Complete in vitro (IVP) and in vivo (control group) blastocysts were also produced. Samples from the three pools (biological replicates) of each blastocyst group and in vivo control blastocyst were hybridized on EmbryoGENEâ€™s bovine microarray using a dye-swap design (technical replicates) for a total of six arrays.
