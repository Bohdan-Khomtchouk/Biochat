TITLE
Microarray analysis of large caged once mated females mortality study

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Two cages of 12,000 once mated females were used.  Samples were collected starting on Day 2 in the box, followed by days 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44, 51, 58, 65, 72, and 79 in the boxes.  The gene-expression profiles were computed over the lifespan of these females.

DESIGN
Each time point was compared to the control time point of 2 days in the corresponding box.  There were two boxes A & B, with three replicates from each (Box A replicates = A, B, & C; Box B replicates = B, C, & D).
