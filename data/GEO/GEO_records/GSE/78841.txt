TITLE
Time course of gene expression signatures for Tet3 induced neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further investigate the gene expression at different courses in MEFs and Tet3 induced neurons, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify the expression level of specific genes, such as neuronal specific genes, fibrobalst specific genes.

DESIGN
The gene expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and Tet3 induced neurons at 1, 3, 5, 7 dpi.

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
