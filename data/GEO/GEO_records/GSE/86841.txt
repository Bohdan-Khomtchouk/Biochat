TITLE
Glis3 plays a crucial role in thyroid hormone production

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The serum hormone levels including T3 and T4 were dramatically decreased in Glis3-null mice due to reduced production of thyroid hormones in thyroid. Gene expression profile and EdU incorporation analysis between WT and Glis3-null mice showed that the cell proliferation was greatly reduced in Glis3-null thyroid. Goitergenic diet (low iodine diet; LID) dramatically enhanced serum TSH levels in both WT and Glis3-null mice, however thyroid goiter was observed in WT mice but not in Glis3-null mice. A subset of genes associated with thyroid hormone production including Pendrin (Slc26a4), Nis (Na+/Iâ€“ symporter, Slc5a5), Duoxa2 (dualoxidase A2), Tpo (thyroperoxidase), and Dio1 (Deiodinase1) was significantly induced in WT but not in Glis3-null mice by LID feeding.

DESIGN
thyroid total RNAs were purified from 5 WT and 5 Glis3KO2 fed normal diet at 1 month old age, and 4 WT and 4 Glis3KO2 mice fed low iodine diet for 6 days. Then the samples were applied to Agilent mouse genome chip.
