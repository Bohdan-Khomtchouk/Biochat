TITLE
Aberrant DNA methylation reprogramming during iPS cell generation is dependent on the choice of reprogramming factors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we generate iPSCs from a common fibroblast cell source using either the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC) or the Thomson factors (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG and LIN28) and determined their genome-wide DNA methylation profiles. In addition to shared DNA methylation aberrations present in all our iPSCs, we identify Yamanaka-iPSC (Y-iPSCs)-specific and Thomson-iPSCs (T-iPSC)-specific recurrent aberrations.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from 9 iPS cells derived using Yamanaka factors (OSKM), 6 iPS cells derived using Thompson factors (OSLN), 2 parental fibroblasts and one embrionic ES cell  were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
