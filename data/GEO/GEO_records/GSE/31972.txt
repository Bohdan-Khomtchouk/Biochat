TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of ICAM-positive and -negative cells from the mouse olfactory epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used trasncriptional profiling of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) purified ICAM1-positive and negative cells from the olfactory epithelium (OE) of three-week old mice to identify genes enriched in the horizontal basal cells.

DESIGN
The olfactory epithelia from P21-P25 CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), were isolated, dissociated, and then purified by FACS using a FITC-conjugated antibody for ICAM1 (CD54).  ICAM1-positive and negative cell populations were collected and compared.  RNA was purified with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), subjected to two rounds of amplification, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430.2 GeneChip microarrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) using Affymetrix reagents and protocols ( ). There were three experimental replicates, each consisting of the ICAM1 (+) and ICAM1 (-) FACS purified cell populations from individual litters of mice that were dissected/dissociated/FACS-purified using an ICAM1-FITC conjugated antibody; one microarray was used for each ICAM1 (+) and ICAM1 (-) sample for a total of six microarrays.  Microarray data were normalized using GCRMA.
