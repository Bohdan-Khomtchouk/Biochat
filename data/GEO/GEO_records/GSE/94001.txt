TITLE
Genome-wide changes in FOXA1 binding after MEN1 silencing in MCF-7  cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq using FOXA1 antibodies in MCF-7 cells after induction of small hairpin RNA's directed at the MEN1 mRNA or a control sequence. We demonstrate that at menin-bound loci FOXA1 binding is disrupted by MEN1 silencing.
