TITLE
mRNA-Seq of central cells from the Arabidopsis thaliana female gametophyte

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This dataset provides the transcriptome of the central cell of the female gametophyte from Arabidopsis thaliana.

DESIGN
We sequenced two biological replicates. Each replicate started with a pool of 450 central cells collected using laser-assisted microdissection (LAM). Libraries were prepared as described in DOI:10.1038/NMETH.1315. Each library was sequenced on one eight of a slide on the AB SOLiD platform (version 3). IMPORTANT: In the alignment files (.bam), we named the mitochondrial and the chloroplastidial chromosomes ChrM and ChrC. This is different from the " chloroplast " and " mitochondrium " names in the whole genome fasta file available on TAIR.
