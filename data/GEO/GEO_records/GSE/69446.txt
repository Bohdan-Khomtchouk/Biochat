TITLE
Impact of NOD2 Genotype on the Innate Monocyte Transcriptome in Crohnâ€™s Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Short title: Innate Gene/miRNA MDP-response in CD RNA-seq and small RNA-seq were used to identify the expression of gene and microRNA (miRNA) in monocytes from healthy controls and patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), with and without NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) after stimulation with muramyl dipeptide (MDP).

DESIGN
Identification of the gene expression of mRNA and miRNA in monocytes from healthy controls and Crohn's patients with and without NOD2 SNPs before and after stimulation with the NOD2-agonist MDP.
