SUMMARY
Full title: Expression data from antisense miRNA-221/222 (si221/222) and control inhibitor (GFP) treated fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cells The expression of miR-221/222 were found to be upregulated in fulvestrant resistant breast cancer cells MCF7-FR compared to its drug-sensitive counterpart MCF7. To investigate the role of miR-221/222 in acquired resistance to fulvestrant, we lowered the level of miR-221/222 in MCF7-FR cells using miRNA inhibitors (antagomirs), and compared gene expression profiles before and after treatment.

DESIGN
Fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cells MCF7-FR (originated from drug-sentitive breast cancer model cell line MCF7) were transient-transfected by antigomirs targeting miR221 or  miR222 (i.e. si221, si222).  All three cell lines, MCF7-FR, siR221, siRNA222 were subjected to gene expression profiling.
