TITLE
RNA-Seq in neutrophils from Antiphospholipid Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Antiphospholipid antibodies are a leading cause of thrombosis. To further elucidate the role of neutrophils in APS, we performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis using the total RNA of neutrophils isolated from 9 patients with primary APS and 9 age, sex and ethnicity-matched healthy controls using next-generation RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Next-generation RNA-Seq of 9 APS (primary antiphospholipid syndrome) and 9 CON (healthy control) neutrophil samples matched by age, sex and ethnicity.

PLATFORM
