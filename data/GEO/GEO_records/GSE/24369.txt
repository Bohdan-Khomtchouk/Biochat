TITLE
Gene expression profiling of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in 17 low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) samples compared to that of histologically similar tumors. LGFMS is characterized by the specific translocations t(7;16)(q33;p11) or t(11;16)(p11;p11) and corresponding fusion genes FUS-CREB3L2 or FUS-CREB3L1. The results identifies a LGFMS-specific gene expression profile and provide insight into FUS-CREB3L2 regulated gene expression.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 17 LGFMS tumor biopsies and hybridized to Affymetrix arrays. RNA from 6 myxofibrosarcoma (MFS), 6 desmoid fibromatosis (DFM), 5 solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) and 6 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMCS) tumor biopsies was used as comparison. Two pools of skeletal muscle RNA was also included in the comparison.
