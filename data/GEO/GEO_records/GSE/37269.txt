TITLE
Transcript profiling of different Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes in response to Tobacco etch potyvirus infection

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We have used a strain of Tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) experimentally adapted to Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Ler-0 to infect a set of seven A. thaliana plant ecotypes(Col-0, Ei-2, Wt-1, ler-0, Oy-0, St-0). Each ecotype was inoculated with the same amount of the virus.  Using commercial microarrays containing probes Arabidopsis thaliana ssp. Col-0 plant transcripts, we explored the effect of viral infection in the plant transcriptome

DESIGN
This microarray can be useful to study gene activity of Arabidopsis thaliana associated with response to virus infection. For ecotypes ST-0, Wt-1, Ler-0, Di-2 there are five biological replicates and for ecotype Oy-0 there are three. As control we used four technical replicates of each ecotype, but five for Ler-0. Rows and columns are numbered as scanned by a GenePix Scanner (barcode on the bottom, DNA on the front surface).
