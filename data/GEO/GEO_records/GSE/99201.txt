TITLE
Wild-type and daf-16(mgDf50) L1 larvae 3 hours after hatching in the presence or absence of food

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
This experiment was designed to identify early targets of daf-16/FoxO during L1 starvation in C. elegans. Previous work (Baugh et al 2009) examined temporal dynamics of gene expression in fed and starved L1 larvae using the same platform and methods. Here, a single time point was analyzed (~3 hr after hatching) in fed and starved larvae also comparing wild-type and a daf-16 null mutant. Statistical analysis includes pairwise comparisons between the four conditions as well as a two-factor analysis to explicitly identify genes affected by nutrient availability in daf-16-dependent fashion.

DESIGN
Synchronized collections of eggs of two separate strains, N2 (wild-type) and GR1307 (daf-16), were hatched in the presence or absence of food (E. coli HB101 at 25 mg/ml) and samples were taken at 2-4 hours.  Each strain and condition combination was peformed in triplicate for a total of 12 samples (2 x 2 x 3).
