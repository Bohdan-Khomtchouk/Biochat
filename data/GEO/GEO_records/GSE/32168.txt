TITLE
RRBS (Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing) of HL60

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We exploited the methylation genome-scale screening RRBS to correlate the RNA species physically associated with DNMT1 and proximal to the annotated genes to the methylation status of the corresponding loci. Out of 15275 non ambiguous gene loci identified by DNMT1 RIP-Seq, 9436 loci were covered by RRBS. These 9436 loci were clustered according to the fold of specific DNMT1 library peaks enrichment (defined as the ratio of the sum of the area under the curve of specific DNMT1 library peaks covering the gene loci). Genes were then stratified by the expression profile ultimately leading to the epitranscriptome map, a comprehensive map cross-referencing DNMT1-interacting transcripts to (i) DNA methylation and (ii) gene expression profile.
