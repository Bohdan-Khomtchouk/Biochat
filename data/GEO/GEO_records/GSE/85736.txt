TITLE
A transcriptomics approach to compare transcriptomes of individual methylotrophs from Lake Washington sediment in artificial communities and in pure cultures.

ORGANISM
Methylobacter tundripaludum ; Methylotenera mobilis

SUMMARY
We established simple synthetic microbial communities in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanisms that underlay cross-feeding in microbial methane-consuming communities. Co-occurring strains from Lake Washington sediment were used that are involved in methane consumption, a methanotroph and two non-methanotrophic methylotrophs.

DESIGN
RNAseq profiles of methanotrophs and non-methanotrophic methylotrophs in pure culture and in two species mixtures. Duplicate samples (total N = 10) were submitted for transcriptomics analysis to GENEWIZ (Seattle, USA). 1 x 50 bp were sequenced in single-read configuration in Rapid Run mode on a HiSeq 2500 System.
