TITLE
Expression analysis of E. coli DH1 after exposure with {C2mim]Cl

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli DH1

SUMMARY
Whole genome gene expression level changes in E. coli DH1 exposed to 150 mM [C2mim]Cl in mid exponential growth, and compared to a non-exposed strain.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from three biological replicates for each condition: 150 mM [C2mim]Cl exposed at OD(600nm) 0.6, after 30 and 60 min, no exposure to [C2mim]Cl at OD(600 nm) 0.6 after 30 and 60 min.
