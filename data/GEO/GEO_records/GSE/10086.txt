TITLE
Expression profiling of V600E BRAF and RTK-activated cells upon MEK inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study used microarray expression analysis to identify global changes in transcript alteration in response to MEK inhibition. Genes under ERK control were identified in a panel of V600E BRAF and RTK-activated tumor cells and xenografts, using short-term inhibition of ERK activity using the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (Pfizer). This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Cell lines growing in culture (n=12) and murine xenografts (n=2) were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 or vehicle alone as control. Paired analysis of MEK inhibited to control samples was performed for two groups of tumor cells, V600E BRAF and RTK.  Time course analysis was performed on one representative cell line in order to first determine the optimal time point to detect changes in all cell lines.
