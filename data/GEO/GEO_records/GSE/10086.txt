TITLE
Expression profiling of V600E BRAF and RTK-activated cells upon MEK inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study used microarray expression analysis to identify global changes in transcript alteration in response to MEK inhibition. Genes under ERK control were identified in a panel of V600E BRAF and RTK-activated tumor cells and xenografts, using short-term inhibition of ERK activity using the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (Pfizer). This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
