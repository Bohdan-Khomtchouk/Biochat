TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling of Blastocysts Reveals Early Differences Associated with Parthenogenetic Embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment is to test the differences between parthenogenetic and normal fertilized embryos at the blastocyst stage. Keywords: gene expression assay for comparison purposes

DESIGN
30 embryos were pooled to generate each sample.  One sample for each condition was processed per array.  The tetraploid embryos were used as a pseudoreplicate for the diploid embryos.  parthenotes were compared to the fertilized embryos.

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
