TITLE
Targeted activation of CREB in reactive astrocytes is neuroprotective in focal acute cortical injury.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiling of mice overexpressing a constitutively active form of CREB in astrocytes (VP16-CREB) vs WT mice, both in normal conditions and after a focal cryolesion (C) in the parietal cortex. Goal is to determine which astrocytic genes are responsible for the neuroprotection we observed in VP16-CREB mice after injury.

DESIGN
Four group experiment. Loop design in which each sample was hybridized four times, and balanced with respect to the use of Cy3 and Cy5 in the samples. Biological replicates: WT: 6 replicates; T: 5 replicates; WTC: 5 replicates; TC: 6 replicates
