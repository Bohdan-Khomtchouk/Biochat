TITLE
mRNA expression profile in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) after inducing calcification

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Vascular calcification (VC) is often associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms linking VC to these diseases have yet to be elucidated. Here we report that MDM2-induced polyubiquitination of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) mediates VC. Loss of HDAC1 activity via either chemical inhibitor or genetic ablation enhanced VC. HDAC1 protein, but not mRNA, was reduced in cell and animal calcification models and in human calcified coronary artery. In the calcification-provoking condition, proteasomal degradation of HDAC1 preceded VC. The calcification-provoking condition induced MDM2 E3 ligase, which then resulted in HDAC1 K74 polyubiquitination. Overexpression of MDM2 enhanced VC, whereas loss of MDM2 blunted it. Decoy peptides spanning HDAC1 K74 and RG 7112, an MDM2 inhibitor, prevented VC in vivo and in vitro. These results demonstrate a previously unknown ubiquitination pathway and suggest MDM2-mediated HDAC1 polyubiquitination as a new therapeutic target in VC.

DESIGN
Calcification was induced in rat aorta vascular smooth muscle cells with inorganic phosphate (Pi). Total RNA were extracted from the cells 3 and 6 days later. mRNA profile of the sample was compared with normal control.
