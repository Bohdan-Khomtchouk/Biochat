TITLE
Developmental Acquisition of Regulomes Underlies Innate Lymphoid Cell Functionality

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play key roles in host defense, barrier integrity, and  homeostasis, and they mirror adaptive CD4+ T helper (Th) cell subtypes in both  usages of effector molecules and transcription factors. To better understand ILC  subsets and their relationship with Th cells, we measured genome-wide chromatin  accessibility. We found that chromatin in proximity to effector genes was selectively  accessible in ILCs prior to high-level transcription upon activation. Accessibility of these  regions was acquired in a stepwise manner during development and changed little  after in vitro or in vivo activation. Conversely, dramatic chromatin remodeling occurred  in na√Øve CD4+ T cells during Th cell differentiation using a type 2-infection model. This  alteration results in a substantial convergence of Th2 cells toward ILC2 regulomes. Our  data indicate extensive sharing of regulatory circuitry across the innate and adaptive  compartments of the immune system, in spite of their divergent developing pathways.
