TITLE
Polysome profiling of wild-type and gld-1 mutant animals

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
To determine the translational status of mRNAs in wild-type and gld-1 mutant animals, we analyzed total and polysomal RNA levels in both strains by tiling arrays

DESIGN
A total of 16 samples was analyzed (quadruplicates of wild-type_total, wild-type_polysomal, gld-1_total, gld-1_polysomal RNA respectively)

PLATFORM
