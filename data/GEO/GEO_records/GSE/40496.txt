SUMMARY
A need exists for biomarkers in T1D that can 1) sensitively and specifically detect disease-related immune activity prior to, and independent of, measurement of auto-antibodies towards islet cell antigens; 2) define immunopathological mechanisms; and 3) monitor changes in the inflammatory state associated with disease progression or response to therapeutic intervention.  In an effort to fill this gap, we have applied a novel bioassay to both human and BB rat T1D whereby the complex milieu of inflammatory mediators present in plasma can be indirectly detected through their ability to drive transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells drawn from healthy, unrelated donors.  The resultant gene expressions are comprehensively measured with a microarray.  In our human studies, we find that plasma of recent-onset T1D patients induces expression of a pro-inflammatory signature consisting in part of many interleukin-1 (IL-1) regulated genes related to immunological activation and immunocyte chemotaxis compared to unrelated healthy controls.  This signature has been found to resolve in long-standing T1D subjects ( > 10 years post-onset), thus associating it with active autoimmunity.  Importantly, this signature has been detected in pre-onset samples of progressors to T1D years prior to onset and prior to development of auto-antibodies directed towards islet antigens.

DESIGN
Fresh PBMCs of a healthy control donor were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. These cells were then stimulated with 20% plasma from a longitudinally monitored sibling of a T1D patient that progressed to T1D (n= 6 timepoints) at 37C in 5% CO2.  Gene expression analysis was perfromed in order to evaluate the transcriptional signature associated with T1D pathogenesis.
