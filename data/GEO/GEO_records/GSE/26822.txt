TITLE
Expression data from postnatal mouse apical and basal organ of Corti from Dicer1 conditional knockout and littermate control cochleae.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cre recombinase-mediated conditional knockout of floxed Dicer1 alleles causes depletion of small RNAs including microRNAs, which function to repress target mRNA expression by inhibiting translation and/or stimulating mRNA degradation. We used microarrays to examine gene expression in apical versus basal organ of Corti from the cochleae of control and mutant mice in which Dicer1 was deleted and microRNAs were depleted specifically in sensory hair cells by Atoh1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase expression.

DESIGN
Each biological replicate represents the combined apical or combined basal segments of organ of Corti from both cochleae of a single mouse. Two biological replicates for apical and basal organ of Corti from Dicer1 conditonal knockout and littermate controls were collected for RNA extraction and microarray analysis.
