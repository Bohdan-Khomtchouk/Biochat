TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of human embryonic stem cells, adult fibroblasts , and CD34+ cord blood (CB) cells before, during, and afer their episomal induction of pluripotency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of (a) human embryonic stem cells, (b) adult fibroblasts with and without nucleofection of SOKM, and ( c ) CD34+ cord blood cells at various time points during induction of pluripotency with SOKM, with or without co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC).

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from adult fibroblasts, adult fibroblasts three days after nucleofection with 4F (SOKM), Day -3 unstimulated cord blood (CB) cells, Day 0 growth factor stimulated CB cells, Day +3 CB cells with or without nucleofection at Day zero and with or without Day zero to Day +3 co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), Day 23 CB cells nucleofected on day zero and co-cultured on BMSC from Day Zero to Day +3,  and undifferentiated H9 human embryonic stem cells. All experimental conditions repeated in three independent trials, and each replicate at each condition analyzed on an individual microarray.
