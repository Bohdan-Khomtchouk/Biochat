TITLE
Rhabdomyosarcoma cells (SJRH30) response to hypoxia: time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Under hypoxic condition, solid tumor cells are known to involve gene expressions for adopting low O2 condition. We examined chronic hypoxia environment of human rhabdomyosarcoma cell (SJRH30), which is important for understanding characteristic of cancer in the body. We used microarrays to detail time development of gene expression by using new gene-set analysis called GSMTA and identified up/down-regulated gene sets during hypoxic stress.

DESIGN
We measured gene expressions at four time-points during 24 hours (0h, 6h, 12h and 24h) under 1% hypoxic condition by Affymetrix GeneChip. GSMTA identified novel differentially-expressed gene set under hypoxic stress at each time point.
