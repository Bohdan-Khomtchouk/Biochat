TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By using high-density DNA microarrays, we analyzed the gene-expression profile of Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from established Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines and analyzed with Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0ST microarrays.
