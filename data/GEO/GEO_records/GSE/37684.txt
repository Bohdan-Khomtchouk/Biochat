TITLE
Expression analysis of genes responding to ARID1A knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina array was employed to analyze the genes whose expression are altered when ARID1A gene is downregulated by shRNA in normal ovarian surface epithelial cells OSE4 and IOSE80pc.  This leads to discovery of p53-regulated genes such as p21 and SMAD3.

DESIGN
ARID1A knockdown in OSE4 and IOSE80pc

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
