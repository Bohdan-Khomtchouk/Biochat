TITLE
Plasma microRNA profiles in women with and without endometriosis at different menstrual cycle phases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objectives of the study: 1. Does the phase of the menstrual cycle alter microRNA (miRNA) plasma profiles in healthy women of reproductive age and in women with endometriosis? 2. Does this alter prospects for development of a miRNA-based diagnostic test  for endometriosis?

DESIGN
Prospectively recruited asymptomatic control women and women with surgically diagnosed endometriosis (n = 8 in each group) were included. Each patient provided blood samples in the early proliferative, late proliferative and mid luteal phases of the menstrual cycle (n = 47 total plasma samples). The cycle phase was verified by hormonal profile. RNA was extracted from each sample and expression of microRNAs was assessed using TaqMan Low Density Human miRNA arrays.
