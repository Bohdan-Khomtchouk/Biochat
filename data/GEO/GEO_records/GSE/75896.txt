TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of purified mouse platelets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine the relative expresson levels of mRNA transcripts in wild type platelets Methods: Total RNA was extracted and purified from purified platelets from BALB/c male mice (3 independent samples). Platelet purification was performed as described in Josefsson EC et al, Journal of Experimental Medicine (2011) 208:2017-31. Total RNA (100 ng) was used to generate sequencing libraries for whole transcriptome analysis following Illuminaâ€™s TruSeq RNA v2 sample preparation protocol. Completed libraries were sequenced on HiSeq 2000 with TruSeq SBS Kit v3- HS reagents (Illumina) as 100 bp paired-end reads at the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF), Melbourne. Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome mm10 and counts for known genes were obtained using the Rsubread package (version 1.18.0) (Liao et al. 2013; Liao et al. 2014).

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted and purified from purified platelets from BALB/c male mice (3 independent samples per population).
