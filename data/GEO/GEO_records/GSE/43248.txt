TITLE
Expression data from non sexual flocculation cells of S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Deleting ribosomal protein genes caused haploid cells of S. pombe flocculated in full nutrition YEPD medium. We deleted rpl32-1 and rpl32-2 gene respectively and these two mutant cells cultured in YEPD medium flocculated. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression between non flocculated rpl32-1 deleted and rpl32-2 deleted, compared with the non flocculated cells SPQ-01, and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Yeast cells cultured in YEPD medium in the log phase were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The rpl32-1 deleted cells were conformed as SD1 and rpl32-2 deleted cells were conformed as SD2. Control cells SPQ-01 were conformed as WT.
