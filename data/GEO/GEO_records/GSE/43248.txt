TITLE
Expression data from non sexual flocculation cells of S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Deleting ribosomal protein genes caused haploid cells of S. pombe flocculated in full nutrition YEPD medium. We deleted rpl32-1 and rpl32-2 gene respectively and these two mutant cells cultured in YEPD medium flocculated. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression between non flocculated rpl32-1 deleted and rpl32-2 deleted, compared with the non flocculated cells SPQ-01, and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.
