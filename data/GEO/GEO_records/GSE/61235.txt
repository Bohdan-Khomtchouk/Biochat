TITLE
Changes in DNaseI hypersensitivity upon ultradian (pulsed) hormone stimulation [Dnase-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report changes in DNaseI accessibility genome-wide upon treatment with corticosterone (Cort) for 20 minutes, treatment with Cort for 20 minutes followed by hormone withdrawal for 40 minutes, 60 minutes continuous stimulation with Cort, as well as Mock treatments for the aforementioned conditions.

DESIGN
We examine DNaseI accessibility genome-wide upon following treatments: 0' Cort, 20' Cort, 60' Cort Pulsed, 60' Cort Constant, as well as Mock treatments simulating 0' Cort, 20' Cort, 60' Cort Pulsed, 60' Cort Constant.
