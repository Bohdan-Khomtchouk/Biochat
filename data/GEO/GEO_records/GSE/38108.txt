TITLE
Global Analysis of the Transcriptional Response of Whitefly to Entomopathogenic Fungi Beauveria bassiana Reveals New Insights on Host-Pathogen Interactions

ORGANISM
Bemisia tabaci

SUMMARY
We investigated the transcriptional response of invasive Mediterranean (MED) species of the whitefly B. tabaci complex (commonly referred to as Q biotype) to entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana using Illumina sequencing technology.

DESIGN
Nearly 1,000 of control whiteflies, 48h fungal-induced whiteflies and 72h fungal-induced whiteflies were collected, respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL10981 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Bemisia tabaci)
