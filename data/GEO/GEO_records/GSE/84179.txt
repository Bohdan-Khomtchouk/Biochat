TITLE
Effects of digested onion extracts on intestinal gene expression using rat intestine slices

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat small intestine precision cut slices were exposed for 6 hours to in vitro digested yellow (YOd) and white onion extracts (WOd) that was followed by transcriptomics analysis. The digestion was performed to mimic the digestion that in vivo takes place in the stomach and small intestine.  The transcriptomics response of the rat small intestine precision cut slices was compared to that of human Caco-2 cells and the pig in-situ small intestinal segment perfusion. The microarray data for the human Caco-2 cells (GSE83893) and the pig in-situ small intestinal segment perfusion (GSE83908) have been submitted separately from the current data on rat intestine. The goal was to  obtain more insight into to which extent mode of actions depend on the experimental model. A main outcome was that each of the three models pointed to the same mode of action: induction of oxidative stress and particularly the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.

DESIGN
The dataset contains results of 12 microarrays. 3 arrays for saline_digest that can be considered as the reference to which the response of the in vitro digested yellow (YOd) and white onion extracts (WOd) can be compared. 3 arrays were used for  in vitro digested yellow (YOd) and 3 arrays for in vitro digested yellow (YOd). In addition, 3 arrays (called DMSO) were included for an exposure without digestion enzymes. That is informative for the effect of the enzymes in the digestion mixture.
