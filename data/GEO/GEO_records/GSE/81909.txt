TITLE
Primary human airway epithelial cell transcriptome response to wild type MERS-CoV (icMERS) [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA analysis in primary human airway epithelial cells infected with wild type MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (icMERS).

DESIGN
Human airway epithelial cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 5 PFU per cell. Infected samples were collected in quintuplet; time-matched mocks were collected in quintuplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post-infection. MERSCOV004.0P references the write up of the experimental procedure.
