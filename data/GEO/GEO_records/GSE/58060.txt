TITLE
Comparision of gene expression in miR-17-92 cluster overexpression stable CCLP-1 cells with scrambled control CCLP-1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression approach, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes which may be regulated by miR-17-92 cluster.   Two stable cell lines were used, one is scrambled control and another is miR-17-92 cluster overexpresion cell lines. The differential gene expression was identified.

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from two samples from the cell lines.

PLATFORM
GPL13497 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
