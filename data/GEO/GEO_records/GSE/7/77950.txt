TITLE
Long Non-coding RNA PICSAR Promotes Growth of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Regulating ERK1/2 Activity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Keratinocyte-derived cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the most common metastatic skin cancer, and its incidence is increasing globally. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in various biological processes, and their role in cancer progression is emerging. Whole transcriptome analysis of cSCC cells (n=8) and normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs, n=4) revealed overexpression of long intergenic ncRNA (LINC00162) in cSCC cells (GSE66412). We wanted to futher study the RNA expression profile of LINC00162 knockdown cSCC cells. Based on our observations, LINC00162 was named PICSAR (P38 Inhibited Cutaneous Squamous cell carcinoma Associated lincRNA).

DESIGN
RNA-Seq analysis of cSCC cells followed by siRNA-induced gene knockdown of lincRNA PICSAR. Total RNAs from negative control and PICSAR siRNA-treated cSCC cell lines (n=3) were extracted. The samples were sequenced using Illumina sequencing.
