TITLE
Functional Haploid Human Oocytes Generated from Polar Body Genomes (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oocyte defects lie at the heart of some forms of infertility and could potentially be addressed therapeutically by alternative routes for oocyte formation. Here, we describe the generation of functional human oocytes following nuclear transfer of first polar body (PB1) genomes from metaphase II (MII) oocytes into enucleated donor MII cytoplasm (PBNT). The reconstructed oocytes supported the formation of de novo meiotic spindles and, after fertilization with sperm, meiosis completion and formation of normal diploid zygotes. While PBNT zygotes developed to blastocysts less frequently (42%) than controls (75%), genome-wide genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional analyses of PBNT and control ESCs indicated comparable numbers of structural variations and markedly similar DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles. We conclude that rescue of PB1 genetic material via introduction into donor cytoplasm may offer a source of oocytes for infertility treatment or mitochondrial replacement therapy for mtDNA disease.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing collected from PBNT1 and hESO-14
