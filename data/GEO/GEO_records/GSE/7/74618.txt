TITLE
Re-expression of fetal IGF2 as a target for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) mainly regulate the expression of targeted genes by regulating mRNA degradation or repressing their protein translation. MiRNA microarray profiling was then performed on 218 human HCC tumors samples, 10 samples from adjacent cirrhotic non-tumoral tissue, 10 samples from healthy liver and 12 HCC cell lines. In this study we investigated which miRNAs were differentially expressed in HCC compared to cirrhotic non-tumoral tissue and healthy liver.
