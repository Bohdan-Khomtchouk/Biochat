TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of two mutants rdr6/sgs2 and sgs3 impaired in post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Identification of new genes regulated by RDR6 and SGS3 (two genes involved in PTGS) by analysis of the transcriptome of rdr6-1 and sgs3-1 mutants compared to wild-type plants in different tissues (flower and leaves). The comparison between transcriptome of rdr6-1 and sgs3-1 mutant alleles impaired in PTGS and development (juvenile-to-adult transition) and transcriptome of rdr6-5 and sgs3-3 alleles impaired only in PTGS would allowed identification of genes involved in the developmental default (zip phenotype) of the null alleles (rdr6-1 and sgs3-1 mutants). - Transcriptome of rdr6 and sgs3 mutants will be compared to the transcriptome of wild-type plants in flower and leaves. Further-more the comparison between transcriptome of rdr6-1 and sgs3-1 mutant alleles impaired in PTGS and development (juvenile-to-adult transition) and transcriptome of rdr6-5 and sgs3-3 alleles impaired only in PTGS will be done for flowers and leaves. Keywords: gene knock in (transgenic)
