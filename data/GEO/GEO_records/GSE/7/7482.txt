SUMMARY
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy accounting for between 0.02 and 0.2 percent of all cancer deaths. Surgical removal offers the only current potential for cure. Unfortunately, ACC has undergone metastatic spread in approximately 40-70 percent of patients at the time of diagnosis. Standard chemotherapy with mitotane containing regimens is often ineffective and associated with intolerable side-effects. Modern molecular technologies now allow the examination of germ-line and somatic DNA for chromosomal alterations which can give biological insight into cancer processes. Using an array-based high density comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) screen, genomic aberrations within 25 ACC patients were assessed to identify genomic characteristic of this cancer. Genomes were queried with > 44,000 probes on the Agilent Human Genome CGH array detecting regions of chromosomal gain and loss within the tumor population. Statistical analysis of this genetic landscape reveals a set of chromosomal aberrations strongly associated with survival in an accumulation dependent fashion. These regions may hold prognostic indicators and offer therapeutic targets that can be used to develop novel treatments for aggressive tumors. Keywords: CGH, adrenocortical carcinoma, cancer
