TITLE
Proteomics Analysis Reveals Differentially Activated Pathways that Operate in Peanut Gynophores at Different Developmental Stages

ORGANISM
Arachis hypogaea

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the mechanism of geocarpy, we extracted proteins from aerial gynophores, subterranean unswollen gynophores, and gynophores that had just started to swell into pods. An integrated analysis of proteome and transcriptome data revealed specifically or differentially expressed genes in the different developmental stages at both the mRNA and protein levels.

DESIGN
Peanut gynophores mRNA profiles of stage 1 (S1)  (i.e., aerial gynophores that are green or purple and 3-5 cm long), stage 2 (S2)  (i.e., gynophores that have been buried in the soil for about 3 days; the gynophores are white and ovary enlargement is not apparent), and stage 3 (S3) (dark-grown gynophores with 2-3 mm long pods)  were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina Hiseq 2000.
