TITLE
RNA profiling of p16ink4a-expressing pancreatic beta-cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome of beta-cells isolated from mice expressing p16ink4a and GFP transgenes  and of control Î²-cells isolated from mice expressing only the GFP transgene

DESIGN
RNAseq of murine beta-cells sorted based on GFP expression from three Ins-rtTA/tet-GFP/tet-p16ink4a mice and two control Ins-rtTA/tet-GFP mice following 10 days tet-mediated induction.
