TITLE
Expression data from soybean seed compartments with embryos at the cotyledon stage

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
We microdissected each compartment from 8-micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system to identify all genes active in different compartments of a soybean seed containing a cotyledon-stage embryo. Keywords: cell type comparison
