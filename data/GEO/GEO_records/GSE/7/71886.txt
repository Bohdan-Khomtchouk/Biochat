TITLE
Identification of c-Jun dependent genes downstream of acute MITF loss in the context of inflammatory signals in the human melanoma cell line Ma-Mel-15

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ma-Mel-15 human melanoma cell cultures were transiently transfected (RNAiMax, Lipofectamin) with control siRNA, siRNA against MITF (pool of 4 siRNAs), siRNA against c-JUN (pool of 4 siRNAs) or combinations of siMITF and siJUN. Cells were then either treated with TNF-alpha (1000U/ml) for 24 hours or left untreated. The experiment was performed as biological duplicates. We aimed to determine how c-JUN cooperates with acute MITF-loss in human melanoma cells to increase inflammatory responsiveness and cell plasticity.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from siRNA/TNF-treated Ma-Mel-15 melanoma cell lines and global gene expression profiling was done using the Illumina Human HT12 v4 platform.
