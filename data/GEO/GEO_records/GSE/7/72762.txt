TITLE
RNAseq analysis of the duodenum of intestine-specific adult SD mutant mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aim: Transcriptional analysis of the duodenum of adult Nkx2.2flox/SD;Villin-Cre (SDint) mice versus control Methods: 2 cm of the duodenum (as measured from the stomach) of 6 week old control and mutant mice were dissected and total RNA extracted. Libraries were prepared from total RNA (RIN > 8) with the TruSeq RNA prep kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the HiSeq2000 (Illumina) instrument. More than 20 million reads were mapped to the mouse genome (UCSC/mm9) using Tophat (version 2.0.4) with 4 mismatches and 10 maximum multiple hits. Significantly differentially expressed genes were calculated using DEseq. Results: 206 genes with a p-value < 0.05 were significantly changed. Among these are some enteroendocrine hormones. Conclusion: The SD domain of Nkx2.2 regulates specification of some enteroendocrine cells

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of the duodenum of 6 week old control and SDint mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000.
