TITLE
RNA sequencing reveals differential expression of genes associated with an altered morphology of rumen papillae in lactating dairy cows fed diets with various forage sources

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Total RNA from rumen epithelial tissues of cows fed alfalfa hay (AL),Rice straw (RS) or Corn stover (CS)diet were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2000 system. For comparative analysis, differentially expressed genes were identified with edgeR.

DESIGN
We performed a differential analysis of transcriptomes of rumen epithelial tissues collected from cows fed AL, RS or CS diets, to study molecular mechanisms of forage source changing rumen papillae thickness and shape.
