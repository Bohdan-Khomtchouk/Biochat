TITLE
Activation of P-TEFb by androgen receptor-regulated enhancer RNAs in androgen deprivation conditions [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgen receptor (AR) is required for castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progression, but the function and disease relevance of AR-bound enhancers remain poorly understood.  Here, we identify a group of AR-regulated enhancer RNAs (e.g. PSA eRNA) that are upregulated in CRPC cells, patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient tissues.  PSA eRNA binds to CYCLIN T1, activates P-TEFb and promotes in cis and trans gene transcription by increasing serine-2 phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II-Ser2p).  To avoid the total Pol II changing by PSA eRNA. We measured the total Pol II using N20 and 8WG16 antibodies with or without PSA eRNA knocking down. To avoid the AR binding changes by PSA eRNA, we also  measured the AR binding using AR N20 antibodies with or without PSA eRNA knocking down.

DESIGN
Androgen receptor (AR) binding sites in human prostate cancer cell lines, C4-2, were studied using ChIP-seq. Total Pol II Ser-2p and AR binding sites in human prostate cancer cell lines C4-2 with or without PSA eRNA knockdown, were studied using ChIP-seq. ChIP enriched DNA were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500and input DNA were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
