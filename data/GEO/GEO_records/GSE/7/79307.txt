TITLE
Transcriptome analyses of a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) from the cross Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme (E9) x S. pimpinellifolium line (L5) under multistress conditions

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
NILs were created for the detailed genetic mapping of a QTL (gFW9.1) in tomato. Residual heterozygocity in recombinant inbred lines from the cross S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme (parental accession E9) Ã— S. pimpinellifolium line (parental accession L5) was used for the generation of a pair of NILs of which line E9 had DNA from parent E9 on a large section of chromosome 9 (5-56 Mb), whereas line L5 had parent L5 DNA. These two lines were tested as rootstocks grafted to a common scion (cv. Boludo) in multi-stress conditions - low phosphorus and drought stress compared to high phosphorus and well-watered conditions. RNA for transcriptomic analysis was prepared from root tissues. Secondary use of data: In a study aiming to identify genes that respond to multiple abiotic stresses, microarray data obtained from different plant species and under different stresses was analysed. A number of conserved stress-responsive genes were identified whose expression was differentially regulated in tomato roots in response to one or several stresses. 10 of these genes were validated as reliable biomarkers whose expression levels are related to different signalling pathways involved in adaptive stress responses. This dataset comprises part of the full stress dataset and is for plant roots harvested after growth under low phosphorus and drought conditions, compared to plant roots harvested after growth under sufficient phosphorus and well watered conditions.
