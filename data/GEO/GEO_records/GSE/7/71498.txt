TITLE
Arrayed gene expression analysis of the SETD1A depleted cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression level changes in the SETD1A depleted cancer cells (shSETD1A), compared to the GFP depleted cancer cells (shGFP) as control. This analysis was performed to gain an understanding of the transcriptional changes induced by chromation modifications through H3K4 methyltransferase SETD1A. Key Word: SETD1A, Epigenetics

DESIGN
This series represents a set of experiments performed using RNA isolated from SETD1A depleted cancer cells in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and lung cancer A549 cells.
