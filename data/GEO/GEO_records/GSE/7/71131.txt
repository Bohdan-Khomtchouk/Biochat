TITLE
The dynamic regulatory genome of Capsaspora owczarzaki and the origin of animal multicellularity

ORGANISM
Capsaspora owczarzaki

SUMMARY
We carried out multiple functional genomic assays in Capsaspora owczarzaki, the unicellular relative of animals with the largest known gene repertoire for transcriptional regulation. We show that changing chromatin states, differential lincRNA expression and dynamic cis-regulatory sites are associated with life cycle transitions in Capsaspora.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of four different histone modifications and ATAC-seq; both in 3 different temporal cell types.
