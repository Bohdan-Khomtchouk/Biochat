Distinct roles of HDAC complexes in promoter silencing, antisense suppression and DNA damage protection

SUMMARY
Histone acetylation plays an important role in regulating DNA accessibility. Multifunctional Sin3 proteins bind histone deacetylases (HDACs) to assemble silencing complexes that selectively target chromatin. We show that, in fission yeast, an essential HDAC Clr6 exists in two distinct Sin3 core complexes. Complex I contains an essential Sin3 homologue Pst1 and other factors, and predominantly targets gene promoters. Complex II contains a non-essential Sin3, Pst2, and several conserved proteins.  It preferentially targets transcribed chromosomal regions and centromere cores.  Defects in complex II abrogate global protective functions of chromatin, causing increased accessibility of DNA to genotoxic agents and widespread antisense transcripts that are processed by the exosome.  Interestingly, the two Clr6 complexes differentially repress forward and reverse centromeric repeat transcripts, suggesting that these complexes regulate transcription in heterochromatin and euchromatin in a similar manner, including suppression of spurious transcripts from cryptic start sites. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
