Sphingosine-1-phosphate Phosphatase 2 Regulates Pancreatic Islet β-cell Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Proliferation

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid metabolite that regulates basic cell functions through metabolic and signaling pathways. Intracellular metabolism of S1P is controlled, in part, by two homologous S1P phosphatases, 1 and 2, which are encoded by Sgpp1 and Sgpp2, respectively. S1P phosphatase activity is needed for efficient recycling of sphingosine into the sphingolipid synthesis pathway. S1P phosphatase 1 is important for skin homeostasis, but little is known about the functional role of S1P phosphatase 2. To identify the functions of S1P phosphatase 2 in vivo, we studied mice with the Sgpp2 gene deleted. In contrast to Sgpp1-/- mice, Sgpp2-/- mice had normal skin and were viable into adulthood. Unexpectedly, WT mice expressed Sgpp2 mRNA at high levels in pancreatic islets when compared with other tissues. Sgpp2-/- mice had normal blood insulin levels and pancreatic islet size; however, Sgpp2-/- mice treated with a high-fat diet (HFD) had significantly lower blood insulin levels and smaller pancreatic islets compared with WT mice. The smaller islets in the HFD-treated Sgpp2-/- mice had a significantly lower adaptive β-cell proliferation rate in response to the diet compared with HFD-treated WT mice. Importantly, β-cells from Sgpp2-/- mice fed a normal diet showed significantly increased expression of proteins characteristic of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response compared with β-cells from WT mice. Our results suggest that Sgpp2 deletion causes β-cell ER stress, which is a known cause of β-cell dysfunction, and reveal a novel juncture in the sphingolipid recycling pathway that could impact the development of diabetes.

DESIGN
Three replications of Mouse (WT vs KO) that were treated with with Normal and HFD foods.
