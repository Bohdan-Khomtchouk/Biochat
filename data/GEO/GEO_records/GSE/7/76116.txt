TITLE
ChIP-seq analysis of MBD3 in human breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a powerful approach to identify the genome-wide localization of protein of interest. However, to perform ChIP-seq experiments for large protein complex, such as Mi-2/NuRD complex, is still challenging. Here, we present high-quality MBD3 ChIP-seq data in human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231.

DESIGN
MBD3 ChIP-seq experiment was perform using human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231. Two bilogical replicates were prepared.
