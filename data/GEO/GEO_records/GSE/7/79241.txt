TITLE
Gene profiling in the colon after depletion and activation of TLR3 and TLR7 signals

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TLR3 and TLR7 are critical recognition receptor which reacts with viruses. TLR3 and TLR7 contribute to many immunological pathway. Especially, TLR3 and TLR7 are clearly involved in the regulation of innate immunity in the gut. To identify the downstream target of TLR 3 and TLR7 in the IBD, we carried out microarray.

DESIGN
The colon tissues were isolated from four different groups. None-no treatment, after DSS treated, after DSS+antiviral treatment, after DSS+TLR3+7 agonists.
