TITLE
Long read sequencing of nascent RNA from S. cerevisiae and S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Long read SMRT cDNA sequencing of nascent RNA from exponentially growing S. cerevisiae and S. pombe cells was employed to obtain transcription elongation and splicing information from single transcripts. Nascent RNA was prepared from the yeast chromatin fraction (Carrillo Oesterreich, Preibisch, Neugebauer, Mol Cell 2010). The nascent 3’ end was labeled with a 3’ DNA adaptor through ligation. The adaptor sequence served as template for full-length reverse transcription and double-stranded cDNA was obtained in a PCR (gene-specific or transcriptome-wide). SMRT DNA sequencing libraries were prepared subsequently.

DESIGN
Nascent RNA profiles for mainly intron-containing genes were generated with long-read SMRT cDNA sequencing.
