TITLE
Gene expression profiling of gastric cells infected by Helicobacter pylori

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Helicobacter pylori are gram-negative bacteria that colonize the human stomach and are the major etiological factor in gastric carcinoma development. The aim of this work was to evaluate changes in gene expression in gastric cells induced by H. pylori.

DESIGN
The human gastric carcinoma-derived cell line AGS was infected with H. pylori strain 60190 (ATCC 49503) for 24 hours. RNA was extracted from three independent experiments.
