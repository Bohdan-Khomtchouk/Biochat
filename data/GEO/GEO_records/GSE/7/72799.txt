TITLE
Profiles of cytokines in heart after β-adrenergic stimulation in different time point

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the dynamic changes of cytokines in the heart upon β-adrenergic stimulation (isoproterenol, 5 mg/kg body weight) at 3hrs, 6hrs, 12hrs, 24hrs and 3days using mouse cytokine antibody arrays

DESIGN
27 samples. There are 6 groups: vehicle group, mice were subcutaneous injected with a single dose of saline (10 ml/kg body weight), ISO groups, mice were subcutaneous injected with a single dose of isoproterenol (5 mg/kg body weight) after 3hrs, 6hrs, 12hrs, 24hrs and 3days (5 groups by different pionts)
