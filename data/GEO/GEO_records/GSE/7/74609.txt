TITLE
Comprehensive DNA methylation and gene expression profiling in differentiating human adipocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) differentiating into adipocytes (day 10). The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to measure DNA methylation of hMSC before differentiation (day 0) and of adipocytes at day 10 of differentiation. Our aims were to 1) measure genome-wide DNA methylation changes during adipocyte differentiation in primary hMSCs and 2) investigate the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression regulation in a panel of 84 adipocyte-related genes.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from four independent experiments was hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip. The first comparison was made between undifferentiated hMSCs and differentiated adipocytes at day 10. As a positive control, differentiating cells were continuously exposed to 5-Aza-2â€²-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). The second comparison was made between differentiated adipocytes at day 10 and 5-aza-dC exposed adipocytes at day 10.
