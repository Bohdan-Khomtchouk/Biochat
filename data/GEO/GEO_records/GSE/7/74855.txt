TITLE
Transcriptional effects of I-PpoI induced DNA double strand breaks in mouse lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their repair can cause extensive epigenetic changes. As a result, DSBs have been proposed to promote transcriptional and, ultimately, physiological dysfunction via both cell-intrinsic and cell-non-autonomous pathways. Studying the consequences of DSBs in higher organisms has, however, been hindered by a scarcity of tools for controlled DSB induction. Using a mouse model for both tissue-specific and temporally controlled DSB formation, we investigated the transcriptional response to break repair.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of lymphocytes in spleen and thymus by RNA-Seq, with and without I-PpoI knock-in.
