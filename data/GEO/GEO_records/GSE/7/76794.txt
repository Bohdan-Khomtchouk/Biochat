TITLE
Gene profiling of primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) grown under the conditions of contact-inhibition, serum starvation, or both in comparison to normal cycling cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To investigate the differences of expression patterns in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) under conditions of contact-inhibition and serum starvation, we undertook a gene profiling study to characterize the transcriptomes of CEFs grown under conditions of contact inhibition, serum starvation or both, in relation to normal growing (cycling) cells.

DESIGN
Primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were grown under conditions of contact inhibition, serum starvation or both, and compared in relation to normal growing (cycling) cells. All experimental groups consisted of three biological replicates except for the contact-inhibited group, which was conducted in quadruplicate.
