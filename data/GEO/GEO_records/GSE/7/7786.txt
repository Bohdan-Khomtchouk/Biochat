TITLE
Chronic strychnine treatment induced gene expression changes in Drosophila head

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Strychnine (STR) is a convulsant agent. In an effort to develop a Drosophila model of kindling epileptogenesis, we have examined chronic STR induced alterations in gene expression profile of fly heads. Expression profiling of fly heads after 7 day long STR treatment revealed perturbations in various functional category of genes. Keywords: Drug Response
