TITLE
Expressions of Cardamine amara, hirsuta and flexuorsa under wet and dry conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand allopoyploid speciation into hydrologically fluctuating niches, we observed gene expressions of two parental species and their allotetraploid species under wet and dry conditions
