TITLE
The transcription factors SOX9 and SOX5/SOX6 cooperate genome-wide through super-enhancers to drive chondrogenesis (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
SOX9 is a transcriptional activator required for chondrogenesis, and SOX5 and SOX6 are closely related DNA-binding proteins that critically enhance its function. We used RNA-seq to charatierize a rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells as a faithful model for proliferating/early prehypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes and ChIP-seq to gain novel insights into the full spectrum of the target genes and modes of action of this chondrogenic trio.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for SOX9,  SOX6 and histone modifications were carried out using RCS cells
