TITLE
Differentially expressed genes between the miR-506-overexpressing AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cell line (n=3) and its negative control (n=3)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify additional miR-506 target genes and the mechanisms behind its tumor-suppressive effect, we performed global microarray analysis of mRNA expression in a miR-506-overexpressing AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cell line and a negative control

DESIGN
mRNAs in miR-506-overexpressing AsPC-1 cell line (n=3) and its negative control (n=3) by microarray using Agilent human Gene Expression 4*44K v2
