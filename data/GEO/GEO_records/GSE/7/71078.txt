TITLE
Comparative expression analysis of BRCA1mosMe fibroblast vs. BRCA1wt fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed a comprehensive molecular and cellular analysis of primary dermal fibroblasts taken from a patient with recurrent cancers, harboring a BRCA1 mosaic epimutation  (BRCA1mosMe) in comparison to their isogenic control fibroblasts (BRCA1wt), taken from the patientÂ´s healthy monozygous sister.

DESIGN
4 independent samples per individual
