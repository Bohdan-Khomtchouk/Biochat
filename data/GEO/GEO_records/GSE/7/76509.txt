TITLE
Comparison of expression data between control and Bdh2 morphant zebrafish embryos, as well as Bdh2 morphant zebrafish embryos expressing ectopic Bdh2

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Bdh2 morphants displayed mitochondrial dysfunction and degradation by autophagy, which could be restored by ectopic Bdh2 overexpression.

DESIGN
Total RNAs from control and Bdh2 morphant zebrafish embryos, as well as Bdh2 morphant zebrafish embryos expressing ectopic Bdh2 were isolated at 72 hpf using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were processed as per manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, Affymetric, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) at Case Comprehensive Cancer Center Microarray Core Facility. Experiments were performed in duplicate for control and Bdh2 morphant zebrafish embryos, and in singlet for Bdh2 morphant zebrafish embryos expressing ectopic Bdh2.
