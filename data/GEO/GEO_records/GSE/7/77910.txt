TITLE
Gene expression of prostate tumor tissues treated with leuprolide acetate plus ipilimumab

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the immune response of the prostate tumor tissues after the leuprolide acetate plus ipilimumab, we compared the gene expression of 6 post-therapy with 3 pre-therapy samples. We identified 690 differential expressed genes (DEGs).  Pathway analysis showed that these genes are associated with critical immune pathways such as CTLA4 signaling, antigen presenting etc.

DESIGN
We compared 6 post-therapy prostate tumor with 3 pre-therapy samples.
