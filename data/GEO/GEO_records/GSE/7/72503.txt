TITLE
C646, a Novel p300/CREB-Binding Protein-Specific Inhibitor of Histone Acetyltransferase, Attenuates Influenza A Virus Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole-genome data was developed from influenza virus infected A549 cells to better characterize the effect of C646 on influenza virus infection

DESIGN
A549 cells were treated with C646 or DMSO for 10 h, and then were infected with A/WSN/33 virus (WSN; H1N1) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 2. A549 cells for microarray studies were collected at different times. The gene expression in A549 cells was compared between C646-treated group and DMSO-treated group.
