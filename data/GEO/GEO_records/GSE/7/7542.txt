TITLE
Gene expression profiling induced by overexpression and silencing of Ankrd2

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have used a genomic approach based on microarray technology in order to identify the gene networks that are disturbed by Ankrd2 overexpression and silencing. We performed the experiments at the myoblast stage, because there Ankrd2 localizes in the nucleus where it may act as myogenic transcriptional regulator. The stable alteration of Ankrd2 expression level resulted in the modulation of different muscle differentiation-related genes belonging to functional classes having key roles in myogenesis (cell cycle regulation and apoptosis; skeletal muscle development and contraction; cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization). The transcriptional profile of Ankrd2-overexpressing clones highlights a remarkable impairment of the myogenic differentiation program. In the same clones the alteration of genes regulating cell cycle and apoptosis shows that the Ankrd2 overexpression leads to raised C2C12 proliferation compromising the response to serum deprivation and then myotube formation. On the other side, in Ankrd2-silenced clones numerous genes promoting cell cycle arrest are found upregulated. Keywords: gene-specific overexpression and silencing
