TITLE
Analysis of MOF under stress conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the role of MOF in primary MEFs and differentiated podocytes in response to Adriamycin. Mof was deleted in MEFs using the Cre-ERT2 trasgene, while Mof was knockdown in podocytes using shRNA infection. Samples were treated with Adriamycin for 24 hours and gene expression changes analysed.

DESIGN
Analysis of gene expression changes upon Mof depletion in two cell lines, MEFs and podocytes, with and without Adriamycin
