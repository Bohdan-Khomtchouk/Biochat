TITLE
Comparison of gene expression between sams-1(RNAi) and sams-1(RNAi) animals rescued by choline

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Gene expression was compared from adult C. elegans after RNAi

DESIGN
Triplicate control RNAi (Empty vector), control RNAi, choline treated, sams-1(RNAi) and sams-1(RNAi) choline treated animals were grown to young adulthood and RNA was extracted
