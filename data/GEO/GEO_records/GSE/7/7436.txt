TITLE
Profiling of genes regulated by TGF-beta in lung carcinoma (A549) and immortalized lung epithelial (HPL1D)cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TGF-beta is one of the key cytokines implicated in various disease processes including cancer.  TGF-beta inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis in normal epithelial cells and in contrast, acts as a pro-tumour cytokine by promoting tumour angiogenesis, immune-escape and metastasis.  It is not clear if various actions of TGF-beta on normal and tumour cells are due to differential gene regulations.  Hence we studied the regulation of gene expression by TGF-beta in normal and cancer cells. Results: Using human 19 K cDNA microarrays, we show that 1757 genes are exclusively regulated in A549 cells in contrast to 733 genes exclusively regulated in HPL1D cells.  In addition, 267 genes are commonly regulated in both the cell lines.  Semi quantitative and real-time qRT-PCR analysis of some genes agrees with the microarray data. Conclusion: These data suggest major differences with respect to TGF-beta mediated gene regulation in normal and transformed cells. Keywords: cell type comparison in response to TGF-beta
