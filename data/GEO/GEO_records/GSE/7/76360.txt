TITLE
03-311 Trastzumab preoperative Trial of Early Stage HER2+ BRCA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor core biopsies were obtained at baseline and after brief-exposure to single-agent trastuzumab from patients enrolled on the 03-311 trial.   Gene expression profiling was conducted on these tumor biopsies to identify signatures of response to preoperative therapy. This study was initiated to identify biomarkers of response to preoperative trastuzumab-conotaining therapy. We performed transcriptional profiling of patient tumor biopsies obtained at baseline and post brief-exposure to trastuzumab to test the hypothesis that transcriptional changes upon brief-exposure to therapy can provide an early readout of subsequent response.

DESIGN
A total of 50 patients generated quality microarray data at both both baseline and post-exposure timepoints. These 100 samples were analyzed for changes in immune subsets and pathway activities that correlated with subsequent response at surgery. Clinical response was assessed at the completion of preoperative therapy. Pathologic complete response (pCR) was scored by institutional pathologists and was defined as the absence of residual invasive disease in both the breast and any sampled axillary nodes; patients who failed to achieve pCR were grouped as objective responders (OBJR) category, which included complete and partial response (CR+PR), and non-responders (NOR) category including stable and progressive disease.
