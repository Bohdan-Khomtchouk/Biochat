TITLE
Transcriptome changes in mouse livers upon Bmal1 knock out

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the circadian regulations of Bmal1, we examined the transcriptome changes in mouse livers upon Bmal1 knock out at two circadian time points, CT0 and CT12.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of WT and KO at CT0 and CT12.
