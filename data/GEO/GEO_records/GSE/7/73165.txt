TITLE
Expression data from Huh7.5 hepatoma cells transfected with 100 nM miR-185 mimic

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our work demonstrated that 25-hydroxycholesterol induces the expression of miR-185, a microRNA which reinforces the oxysterol's antiviral effects on hepatic metabolism. We used microarrays to detail the effect of miR-185 on hepatic gene expression, and, within repressed genes, identified an enrichment for genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis.

DESIGN
Huh7.5 cells were transfected with miR-185 or control mimics (100 nM), and total RNA was isolated 72 hours post-transfection.
