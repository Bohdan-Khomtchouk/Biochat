TITLE
Systematic Identification of Factors Crucial for Provirus Silencing in Embryonic Stem Cells (RNA-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our study reports the first genome-wide atlas of functional nodes that mediate proviral silencing in ESCs. It provides evidences for the comprehensive, interconnected and multi-layered genetic/epigenetic machineries by which ESCs maintain the repressive state of provirus and ERVs.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis to determine the regulated endogenous retroviruses by Histone chaperones (Chaf1a/b), sumoylation factors (Sumo2/ Ube2i/Sae1/Uba2/Senp6) and chromatin modifiers (Trim28/Eset/Atf7ip)
