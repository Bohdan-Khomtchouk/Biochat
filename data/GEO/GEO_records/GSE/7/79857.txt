TITLE
Expression data from HHG affected and unaffected Vulpes vulpes gingival samples

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Hereditary hyperplastic gingivitis (HHG) is a progressive growth of gingival tissues in foxes resulting in dental encapsulation. It is an autosomal recessive condition displaying a sex-biased penetrance, with an association with superior fur quality.  The goal of this study was to explore potential molecular or cellular mechanisms underlying HHG by analysis of global gene expression patterns from Affymetrix Canine 2.0 microarrays cross-referenced.
