TITLE
Whole-genome profiling of the liver transcriptome in Trpm6 gene deficient mice and control littermates.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To attain deeper insight into metabolic alterations in Trpm6 gene deficient mice we used microarrays for profiling of hepatic transcripts of Trpm6 ko and control mice. We identified a set of gene networks up- or down-regulated in the liver of Trpm6 gene deficient mice.

DESIGN
Liver tissues were collected from 12-13 weeks old Trpm6 deficient (n=3) and control (n=4) male littermates.
