TITLE
Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy by single cell transcriptomics

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nervous systems are composed of numerous cell types, but the extent of cell type diversity is poorly understood. Here, we construct a cellular taxonomy of one cortical region, primary visual cortex, in adult mice based on single cell RNA-sequencing. We identify 49 transcriptomic cell types including 23 GABAergic, 19 glutamatergic and 7 non-neuronal types.

DESIGN
Single-cell RNA-Seq of adult mouse primary visual cortex
