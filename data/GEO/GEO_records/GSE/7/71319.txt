TITLE
Expression data of sorted GFP+ and tdTomato+ prostate tumor cells from Pten/Smad4/mTmG mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single cells from Ptenpc-/-Smad4pc-/-mTmG+ prostate tumors were isolated into single cells which were FACS-sorted for GFP+ and Tomato+ cells and RNA was purified with TRIzol (Life Technologies). RNA expression profiling was performed  using the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) to generate a Ptenpc-/-Smad4pc-/- tumor/Stroma dataset.

DESIGN
Two mice (9074, 9076) at 28 weeks old were used to isolate anterior prostate (AP) and dorsolateral prostate (DLP). From each prostate lobe, three populations were extracted for RNA: unsorted, GFP+, Tomato+. Therefore, there are total 12 samples.
