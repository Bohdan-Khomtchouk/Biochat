TITLE
Genomewide Analysis of Clp1 Function in Transcription in Budding Yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report the GRO-Seq analysis in Clp1 mutant and the isogenic wild type strain to determine the the role of Clp1 in termination of transcription on a genomewide scale.

DESIGN
Examination of GRO-Seq profile in the temperature-sensitive mutant and the wild type strain at permissive and non-permissive temperature.
