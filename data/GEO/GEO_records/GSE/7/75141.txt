TITLE
Gene expression analyses of expandable hepatocytes in culture

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To compare the global expression profiles among primary hepatocytes and expandable hepatocytes with or without in vitro differentiation.

DESIGN
Expandable hepatocytes were derived from 3 mice and cultured in expansion medium or differentiation medium for 21 days. Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated using a two-step collagenase perfusion technique.
