TITLE
Small Traditional Human Communities Sustain Genomic Diversity Over Microgeographic Scales Despite Linguistic Isolation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data were generated to study genome-wide patterns of genomic variation on Sumba and Timor, two small islands in eastern Indonesia. Both islands have a complex history from their initial settlement ~50,000 years ago, to admixture with Austronesian-speaking groups during the Neolithic farming expansion, and more recent intra-island gene flow and community interactions. As part of this detailed microgeographic study, we also collected associated cultural and linguistic information. The primary study location was Sumba, for which we genotyped SNPs in 235 individuals from eight communities that span the island, including groups that speak most of Sumbaâ€™s nine languages. Particular attention was paid to genomic data that are informative for recent aspects of population history, including reconstructions of past gene flow, socio-genetic interactions and possible signals of selection.

DESIGN
240 samples from 10 populations have been genotyped using the Illumina platform GPL19699
