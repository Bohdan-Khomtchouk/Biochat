TITLE
Tc17 cells are a pro-inflammatory, plastic lineage of pathogenic CD8+ T-cells that induce GVHD without anti-leukemic effects

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL-17-producing cells are important mediators of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Here we demonstrate that a distinct CD8+ Tc17 population develops rapidly after SCT but fails to maintain lineage fidelity such that they are unrecognizable in the absence of a fate reporter. Tc17 differentiation is dependent on alloantigen presentation by host-DC together with IL-6. Tc17 cells express high levels of multiple prototypic lineage-defining transcription factors (e.g. RORgt, T-bet) and cytokines (e.g. IL-17A, IL-22, IFNg, GM-CSF, IL-13). Targeted depletion of Tc17 early after transplant protects from lethal acute GVHD, however Tc17 cells are non-cytolytic and fail to mediate graft–versus–leukemia (GVL) effects. Thus, the Tc17 differentiation program during GVHD culminates in a highly plastic, hyper-inflammatory, poorly-cytolytic effector population which we term inflammatory Tc17 (iTc17). Since iTc17 mediate GVHD without contributing to GVL, therapeutic inhibition of iTc17 development in a clinical setting represents an attractive approach for separating GVHD and GVL.
