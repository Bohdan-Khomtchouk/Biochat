TITLE
Nucleosome Positioning Dynamics Through the Yeast Metabolic Cycle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We present Micrococcal Nuclease digestion maps of S. cerevisiae through the progression of the Yeast Metabolic Cycle. We demonstrate that nucleosome positions at many promoters are dynamic, and remodeling events at promoters have significant consequences with respect to gene expression.

DESIGN
Examination of nucleosome positions and transcriptional output through metabolic oscillations in budding yeast.
