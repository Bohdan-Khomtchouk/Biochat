TITLE
Expression data from toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) knockout macrophages stimulated with β-1,3 glucan beads

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dectin1 controls the recruitment of TLR9 to β-1,3 glucan beads containing phagosomes. We sought to determine whether Dectin-1 also plays a role in controlling TLR9 dependent gene expression.

DESIGN
We stimulated wild-type and TLR9KO immortalized macrophages with β-1,3 glucan beads for 4 h, harvested RNA, and conducted a microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed genes
