TITLE
Molecular determinants of tumor response to hyperthermia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A deeper mechanistic understanding of response to hyperthermia in cancer cells in comparison between hyperthermia sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cell lines

DESIGN
Four groups of samples are included: 1,2 A2780 cells treated with control (37C) or hyperthermia (46C) . 3,4. SKOV3 cells treated with control (37C) or hyperthermia (46C).
