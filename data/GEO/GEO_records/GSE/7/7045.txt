TITLE
ChIP-Chip of General Transcription factors in Halobacterium NRC-1

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
Cells responding to dramatic environmental changes or undergoing a developmental switch typically change the expression of numerous genes.  In bacteria sigma factors regulate much of this process while in eukaryotes four RNA polymerases and a multiplicity of generalized transcription factors (GTFs) are required. Here, using a systems approach, we provide experimental evidence (including protein-coIP, ChIP-Chip, GTF perturbation and knockout, and measurement of transcriptional changes in these genetically perturbed strains) for how archaea likely accomplish similar large-scale transcriptional segregation and modulation of physiological functions.  We are able to associate GTFs to nearly half of all putative promoters and show evidence for at least 7 of the possible 42 functional GTF pairs.  This report represents a significant contribution towards closing the gap in our understanding of gene regulation by GTFs for all three domains of life and provides an example for how to utilize various experimental techniques to rapidly learn significant portions of a global gene regulatory network of organisms for which little is previously known.
