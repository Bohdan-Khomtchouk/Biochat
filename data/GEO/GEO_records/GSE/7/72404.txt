TITLE
NOTCH1 mediates a reciprocal switch between two distinct secretomes during senescence [N1ICD]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ER:RAS-G12V expressing IMR90 cells were transduced with N1ICD-containing or control vectors before treatment with either 100nM 4-OHT or vehicle for 6 days leading to Notch-induced senescence (NIS), RAS-induced senescence (RIS) or combined Notch and Ras-induced senescence (RNIS).

DESIGN
IMR90 cells expressing a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) inducible estrogen receptor (ER)-coupled RAS-G12V (ER:RAS-G12V) were transduced with N1ICD-FLAG-containing (residues 1758-2556 of human NOTCH1, as per Capobianco et al, Mol Cell Biol, 1997) or control vector before treatment with either 100nM 4-OHT or vehicle for 6 days , leading to RAS-induced senescence (RIS), NOTCH-induced senescence (NIS) or combined Ras & NOTCH-induced senescence (RNIS).  The total RNA was then analysed for transcriptional profiling using mRNA-sequencing. There were 6 (six) biological replicates for each experimental condition. Untreated, vector-transduced ER:RAS IMR90 cells were the control condition
