TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of wild-type, spn-E and aub mutant 0-2h- and 2-4h-embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to identify unstable mRNAs in wild-type embryos by comparing the transcriptomes derived from 0-2h- and 2-4h-embryos. We then analyzed which of these unstable mRNAs are stabilized in embryos from aub or spn-E mutant mothers (aub or spn-E mutant embryos) by comparing mutant and wild-type embryonic transcriptomes

DESIGN
Transcriptomic analysis of 0-2 h and 2-4 h-embryos from wild-type, aubHN2/aubQC42 or spn-Ehls-03987/spn-E1 females crossed with wild-type males. Three biological replicates were prepared per condition. A technical replicate of each sample led to 36 hybridizations. Each sample was compared to a common reference made of an equimolar mix of all 18 samples.
