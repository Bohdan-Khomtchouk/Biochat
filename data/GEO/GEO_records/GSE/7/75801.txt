TITLE
Double-stranded microRNA mimics can induce length- and passenger strand-dependent effects in a cell type-specific manner (RNA 2015), Exp 2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experiment 2 - MiRNA mimics have a length and passenger strand specific effect Wildtype and mutant variants of miR-155 and negative control miRNA mimics were transfected to address the phenotype

DESIGN
Cells were transfected with mimics and samples were collected in duplicate (except 23mer miR-155 wild type mimic and 23mer negative control mimic)
