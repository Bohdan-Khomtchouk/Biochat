TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of xylogenesis -related genes in Eucalyptus tereticornis

ORGANISM
Eucalyptus

SUMMARY
The expression pattern of transcripts involved in secondary development was determined in four genotypes of E. tereticornis using 8x60K Gene chip. The genome-wide expression data was used to develop a gene co-expression network for xylogenesis.
