TITLE
RNA accumulation profiles generated by RNA-Seq in mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe exosome exonucleases Rrp6 and Dis3

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We studied the differences in RNA accumulation profiles of an rrp6-null mutant and compared it to RNA accumulation in rrp6 catalytic mutants as well as dis3 mutants using RNA-Seq. Rrp6 and Dis3 are exosome exoncleases, therefore this study was used to determine their target RNAs We examined 3' end RNA processing changes by RNA-Seq in wild type, rrp6Δ and rrp6-cat mutants. Libraries were made by 3' adapter ligation

DESIGN
polyA selected RNA abundance measurements in wild type and exosome exonuclease mutants rrp6Δ, rrp6-cat, dis3-4 (ts mutant at 23°C and 30°C), rrp6-cat dis3-4 (ts mutant at 23°C and 30°C) double mutant using paired-end Illumina sequencing of stranded libraries 3' end adapter ligated total RNA from wild type, rrp6Δ and rrp6-cat mutants was used to make stranded RNA-Seq libraries and sequenced by paired-end Illumina sequencing
