TITLE
Expression data of differentially regualted genes in TH-MYCN mouse tumors after immunotherapy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to understand differentially regulated gene expression after the different treatments, 4 size matched tumors of each group were analyzed by microarrays.

DESIGN
TH-MYCN mice were treaded for 10 days with BLZ945 (CSF-1R inhibitor, Novartis), anti-PD-1/L1 antibodies, are the combination of both. Control mice remained untreated. Heterozyous TH-MYCN mice were treated for 10 days as soon as they had a palpable tumor in their abdomen. At day 10, mice were sacrificed, tumors were weighed and snap frozen. Tumors were kept at -80degree until further analysis.
