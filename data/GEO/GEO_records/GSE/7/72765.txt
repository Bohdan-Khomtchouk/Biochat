TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Clostridium acetobutylicum biofilm cells in repeated-batch fermentation

ORGANISM
Arthrobacter sp.

SUMMARY
Previously, we performed DNA array-based transcriptomic analysis of Clostridium acetobutylicum biofilm adsorbed onto fibrous matrix in batch fermentation. Here, to further shed light on the transcriptomic modulation of maturing Clostridium acetobutylicum biofilm, we performed the DNA array-based transcriptomic analysis in repeated-batch fermentation. Significant time course changes in expression levels were observed for the genes involved in amino acid metabolism, oligopeptide ABC transporter, nitrogen fixation, and various other processes.
