TITLE
Transcriptome anlaysis of gastrointestinal tract of pre-weaned cavles

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In order to test the development of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in pre-weaned cavles, the GIT tissues were collected from day 0, day 7, day 21 and day 42 calves. RNA-seq was used to measure the transcriptome profiles. The RNA-seq analysis revealed the fast development of small intestine and rumen tissue during the first week after birth.

DESIGN
The tissues of rumen (RU), mid-jejunum (MJ), distal-jejunum (DJ), ileum (IL) in day 0 (D0), day 7 (D7), day 21 (D21) and day 42 (D42) calves were collected. Their transcriptome profiles were compared to obtain the reginal and temporal differences during the pre-weaned peroid of claves.
