TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of the binding sites of transcription factor Cst6p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Cst6p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been reported to play important roles in several biological processes. However, the genome-wide targets of Cst6p and the mechanisms for its physiological functions remain unknown. Here, we mapped the genome-wide binding sites of Cst6p with ChIP-exo at high resolution. Cst6p binds to the promoter regions of 59 genes with various biological functions when cells are grown on ethanol, but hardly binds to the genome on glucose. The growth deficiency of CST6 deletion mutant on ethanol is attributed to the markedly decreased expression of carbonic anhydrase gene NCE103, which is a direct target of Cst6p. The target genes of Cst6p have a large overlap with those of stress-responsive transcription factors, such as Sko1p and Skn7p. In addition, the CST6 deletion mutant growing on ethanol shows hypersensitivity to oxidative stress and ethanol stress, assigning Cst6p as a new member of the stress-responsive transcriptional regulatory network. These results show that genome-wide binding site mapping is able to provide new insights into the function of transcription factors, and highlight the highly connected and condition-dependent nature of the transcriptional regulatory network in S. cerevisiae.

DESIGN
The binding sites of Cst6p when cells were grown in glucose or ethanol were measured in biological duplicates, so there are four samples in total.
