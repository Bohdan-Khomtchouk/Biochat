TITLE
Transcriptomic profiles reveal the genome-wide responses of the harmful dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides (Cp) when exposed to the algicide copper sulfate

ORGANISM
Cochlodinium polykrikoides

SUMMARY
To identify the transcripome of dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides that responded to algicide copper sulfate

DESIGN
untreated cells that used as control (exponential stage of growth), the cells were treated with 1 mg CuSO4 and harvested at 12 h, 24h, and 48h after expousre  to CuSO4 (exponential stage of growth), untreated cells that harvest in stationary phase
