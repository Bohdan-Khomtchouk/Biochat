TITLE
Targeting biliary cancer desmoplasia in culture

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To more closely reproduce key cellular and stromal features of the desmoplastic reaction of cholangiocarcinoma in vitro, we developed a novel 3-dimensional culture modeling of cancer and stromal cells as a strategy for targeted therapies

DESIGN
Cellular, molecular, and functional characterization of different cancer-associated fibroblastic (CAF) and cholangiocarcinoma cell strains isolated from orthotopic tumors arising from bile duct inoculation of spontaneously-transformed rat cholangiocytes (BDEsp cells) in Fischer 344 young adult male rats.
