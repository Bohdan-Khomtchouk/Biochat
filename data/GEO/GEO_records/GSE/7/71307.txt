TITLE
ApiAP2 Factors as Candidate Regulators of Stochastic Commitment to Merozoite Production in Theileria annulata

ORGANISM
Theileria annulata

SUMMARY
Investigation of parasite (T. annulata) gene expression over the course of the life-cycle (sporozoite- > macroschizont- > merozoite- > piroplasm). The study focused on the expression of known and putative transcription factors, in particular members of the ApiAP2 gene family. Up-stream motifs associated with stage-specifically expressed genes were identified during the course of the analysis.
