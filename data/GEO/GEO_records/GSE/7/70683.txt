TITLE
Microarray expression data from three arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) patients' skin fibroblasts with recessive SLC2A10 mutations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To screen for candidate genes that may contribute to the pathogenesis of ATS Transcriptome-wide expression profiling using the Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST platform comparing the gene expression patterns of skin fibroblasts of three ATS patients with those of three healthy individuals

DESIGN
Comparison between three ATS human fibroblasts and three healthy individuals
