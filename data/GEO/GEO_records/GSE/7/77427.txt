TITLE
Comparative transcriptome of the fertile and sterile buds of genic multiple-allele inherited male sterile AB line in Chinese cabbage

ORGANISM
Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis

SUMMARY
we performed transcript profiling of male sterile and fertile buds from a multiple-allele inherited male sterile AB line using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform and analyzed differential gene expression at the transcriptional level.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in sterile and fertile buds of chinese cabbage Please note that the 'Table_S*.xls' files contain the further-processed supplementary data. The data processing details are provided in the readme.xlsx.
