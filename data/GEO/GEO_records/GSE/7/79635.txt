TITLE
Differential expression data for clonal EL4 mouse lymphoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our group originally developed clonal cell lines by limiting dilution of the parental cell line, and also stably transfected one of these cell lines with human phospholipase D2. The expression analysis was done to examine differences between a non-metastatic cell line (WT2), a metastatic cell line (V & ), and a highly metastatic cell line (C5) that had been transfected with hPLD2.

DESIGN
The cell lines, which had been serum-starved overnight, were analyzed without further treatment.
