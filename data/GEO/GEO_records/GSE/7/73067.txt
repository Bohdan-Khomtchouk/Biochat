TITLE
Expression analysis by RNAseq of roots and shoots of the pho1 mutant expressing the EXS domain of PHO1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Expression of the EXS domain of PHO1 in the Arabidopsis thaliana pho1 mutant leads to improved shoot growth in comparison to the parental pho1 mutant. We have used RNAseq to study the gene expression profile in the roots and shoots of the pho1 mutant, two independent transgenic lines of pho1 expressing the EXS domain of PHO1 (lines EXS32 and EXS34) as well as a pho1 mutant transformed with the full length PHO1 gene (complemented line).

DESIGN
Plants were grown for 25 days in pots, roots and shoots were harvested and RNA was extracted
