TITLE
Rare CNVs in Lynch Syndrome patients negative for mutations in mismatch repair genes [Agilent]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Only a small proportion of cases suspected to have Lynch Syndrome (LS) can be explained by mutation in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. This study aimed to identify rare CNVs that may contribute to an increased risk for hereditary colorectal cancer in patients with MMR proficiency.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood of 54 unrelated patients who met criteria for LS (Amsterdam or Bethesda). Genomic alterations were evaluated using the Agilent-022060 4x180K microarray platform. The reference was a pool of normal male DNA (Promega, cat. no. G1471) or normal female DNA (Promega, cat.no. G1521).
