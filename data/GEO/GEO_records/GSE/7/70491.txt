TITLE
The LSM1-7 Complex Differentially Regulates Arabidopsis Tolerance to Abiotic Stress Conditions by Promoting Selective mRNA Decapping

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report the role of LSM1-7 complex in the Arabidopsis tolerance to abiotic stresses. LSM1-7 controls gene expression reprogramming at the post-transcriptional level by promoting the decapping of mRNA. This function is selectively achieve over selected stress-induced transcripts depending on stress nature.

DESIGN
Comparison of transcriptomes from Col-0 and lsm1a lsm1b plants exposed to low temperatures, drought or high salt conditions
