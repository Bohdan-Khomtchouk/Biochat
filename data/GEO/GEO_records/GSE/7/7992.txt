SUMMARY
ra04-07_pgpr - trancriptional response to 3 rhizobacteria - Experiment 1 : Which genes are up- or down-regulated in Arabidopsis thaliana cultivated in vitro with increased lateral root development in response to Phyllobacterium STM196 inoculation. Experiment 2 : Which genes are up- or down-regulated during the ISR triggered by a rhizobacteria, in comparison with those affected by a pathogenic interaction. Experiment 3 : which genes are specifically induced or repressed in Arabidopsis thaliana by inoculation of the soil with a PGPR vs a bacteria that has the ability to trigger nodule formation in a Legume.  - Seeds of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) were surface-sterilized and sawn on agar mineral medium. Four days after storage in the dark at 4degreeC, seedlings were cultivated 6 days in a growth chamber (16 h daily, 20-22degreeC) and then transferred on soil inoculated or not with 108 cfu.g-1 of Mesorhizobium loti, or 108 cfu.g-1 of Phyllobacterium STM196, or 107 cfu.g-1 of Bradyrhizobium ORS278. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
