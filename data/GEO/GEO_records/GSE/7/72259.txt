TITLE
Potent and targeted activation of HIV-1 using the CRISPR/Cas9 activator Complex

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Integration of the HIV-1 provirus in the host genome ensures a persistent supply of latently infected cells. This latent reservoir is recalcitrant to antiretroviral therapy (ART) making lifelong treatment the only option for patients. The “shock and kill” strategy aims to eradicate latent HIV by reactivating proviral gene expression followed by ART treatment. Gene specific transcriptional activation can be achieved using the RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 system comprising small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with a nuclease deficient Cas9 mutant (dCas9) fused to the VP64 transactivation domain (dCas9-VP64).  We engineered this system to target 23 sites within the LTR promoter of HIV-1 and identified a “hotspot” for activation. We studied the functionality of activating sgRNAs to transcriptionally modulate the latent proviral genome across multiple different in vitro latency cell models including several J-Lat, ACH2 J1.1 and the CEM T cell model comprising a single clonal population of integrated mCherry-IRES-Tat from a full-length HIV LTR (LChIT).  While we observed variable responses of latent cell models to well-characterized chemical stimuli, we detected consistent efficient activation of latent virus mediated by activator sgRNAs.  In addition, transcriptome analysis of chemically treated cells revealed massive non-specific gene dysregulation whereas by comparison, dCas9-VP64/sgRNAs induced specific activation of the integrated provirus.  In conclusion, we show the potential for CRISPR-mediated gene activation systems to provide enhanced efficiency and specificity in a targeted latency reactivation strategy. This represents a promising approach to a “functional cure” of HIV/AIDS.

DESIGN
Three experimental conditions (sgRNA control, TNF treated and sgRNA against the LTR of HIV-1) were analyzed in triplicate using two sequencing lanes
