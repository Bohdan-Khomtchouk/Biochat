TITLE
In Silico transcriptional regulatory networks during tomato fruit ripening

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to generate gene regulatory networks by analyzing Affymetrix GeneChip expression datasets from four different stages of tomato fruit ripening, Breaker (Br), Turning (Tu), Pink (Pk) and Red Ripe (RR) with the LeMoNe algorithm in order to identify co expression modules and their putative regulatory TFs.

DESIGN
9 samples were analyzed in total, mainly 2 replicates for each developmental stage.
