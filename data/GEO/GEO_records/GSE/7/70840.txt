TITLE
Transcriptomic response of rice leaves to 30% CO2 concentration

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Analysis of rice leaves (V2 stage) in response to a short treatment with very high CO2 concentration in the dark, using standard atmosphere as control. Results provide insight into molecular mechanisms occurring in response to these extreme conditions, which are often used in the food industry.

DESIGN
V2 rice plants were either treated with 30%  [CO2] or kept under normal atmosphere (control) for 6 h at 27ÂºC in the dark. Two biological replicates per treatment (30% [CO2] and control), each encompassing the leaves of ten plants, were analyzed.
