TITLE
Transcriptome Profiling in NHP-HCT recipients

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the most common complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). However, our understanding of the molecular pathways that cause this disease remains incomplete, leading to inadequate treatment strategies. To address this, we measured the gene expression profile of non-human primate (NHP) T cells during acute GVHD.  This transcriptome analysis enables an unsupervised approach to the identification of targets for disease control using a model with an immune system that closely overlaps with the human and has a high degree of cross-reactivity with human antibody-based therapeutics.

DESIGN
Series of HCT performed on n=27 animals with n=47 arrays from the post transplant period including arrays from n=34 untransplanted healthy controls
