TITLE
Microarray based metatranscriptomics in the human gut microbiome

ORGANISM
human gut metagenome

SUMMARY
Hundreds of microbial species were found to be transcriptionally active in the human gut microbiome based on the expression profiling of ca. 680.000 microbial genes

DESIGN
As a part of the MetaHIT cohort 233 human stool samples were transcriptionally profiled using a custom made microarray that included probes for most prevalent microbial genes in the cohort as established by whole-genome sequencing of the same samples
