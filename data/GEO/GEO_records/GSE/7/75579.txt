TITLE
Effect of loss of Jmjd1c on normal hematopoiesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profile of LSK (Lin-Sca-1+ c-Kit+) isolated from Jmjd1c f/f Vav1Cre or Vav1Cre controls. Loss of Jmjd1c minimally affected HSC in homeostatsis while impiars HSC function in response to stree such as transplantation and 5-Fu treatment.  These results provide insight into the role of Jmjd1c in normal hematopoiesis.

DESIGN
LSK cells were isolated from bone marrow of seven weeks old  Jmjd1c f/f Vav1Cre or Vav1Cre controls mice by flow acivated cell sorting and  subjected  to RNA-seq.
