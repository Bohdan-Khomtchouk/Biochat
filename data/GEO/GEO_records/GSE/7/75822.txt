TITLE
Transcriptional regulation of the innate immune reponse by the MITF/TFE3 family

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the activation of the MITF/TFE transcription factors in effective defense against pathogens we examined the genome wide distribution of TFE3 in control and activated mouse macrophages. It was determined that TFEB and TFE3 collaborate with each other to promote efficient autophagy induction, increased lysosomal biogenesis, and transcriptional upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and key mediators of the inflammatory response.

DESIGN
4 samples were analyzed: Background Control, Control, Starvation, LPS
