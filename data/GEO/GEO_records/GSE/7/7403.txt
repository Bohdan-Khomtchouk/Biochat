TITLE
Expression data from PDGF-treated SH-SY5Y cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We conducted a proof-of-concept experiment to explore the possibility of using gene expression-based high throughput screening (GE-HTS) to find inhibitors of a signaling cascade, using platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling as the example. To define ERK/PDGFR activation signature, we performed gene expression profiling using Affymetrix U133A arrays 0.5-4 hours following PDGF stimulation, thereby identifying those genes whose expression is correlated with PDGFR activity. In order to identify the component of the gene expression signature that was attributable to ERK activation by PDGFR (as opposed to other pathways downstream of PDGFR), we also pretreated the cells will the ERK inhibitors U0126 and PD98059, and repeated the gene expression profiling studies. Keywords: time course, inhibitor treatment
