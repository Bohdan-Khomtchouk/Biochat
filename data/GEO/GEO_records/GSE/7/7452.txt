TITLE
Gene expression in normal tissues detected by newly developed chicken 44K microarray

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Chicken 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray, including 39854 cDNA and ESTs, entire Marekâ€™s disease virus and avian influenza virus genomes, and 150 chicken microRNAs, was developed. Cecal tonsil, ileum, liver and spleen from 6 chickens were selected for hybridization to validate the microarray performance. There are 2886, 2886, 2660, 358, 3208 3355, and 3710 genes significantly expressed between liver and spleen, spleen and cecal tonsil, cecal tonsil and ileum, liver and cecal tonsil, liver and ileum, spleen and ileum at the P < 10-7.  Number of tissue specific genes for cecal tonsil, ileum, liver and spleen was 95, 71, 535, and 108, respectively with p < 10-7. More than 95% of spots had high SNR ( > 10). Keywords: characteristics of newly developed microarray using different normal tissue
