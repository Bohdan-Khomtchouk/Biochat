TITLE
Regulation of mRNA transcript expression by hypoxia in human peripheral blood lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study is to evaluate oxygen regulated gene expression in human peripheral blood lymphocytes using microarray analysis. The results of this study are expected to provide useful marker transcripts whose expression is highly affected by hypoxia for further hypoxic gene expression studies using peripheral blood lymphocytes. Keywords: peripheral blood lymphocytes, hypoxia-regulated transcripts
