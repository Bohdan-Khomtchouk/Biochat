TITLE
Expression data from Drosophila mutants´ (misexpression and overexpression) of cabut/dTIEG gene

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
cabut (cbt), is the Drosophila ortholog of the human TGF-β Inducible Early Gene 1 (dTIEG). It  encodes a transcription factor involved in Drosophila dorsal closure (DC), and it is expressed in embryonic epithelial sheets and yolk cell during this process upon activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Additional studies suggest that cbt may have a role in multiple developmental processes. We used microarrays to detail the target genes of Cbt during dorsal closure process

DESIGN
cbtEP(2)2237E1 homozigote Drosophila mutant embryos were selected  at 10-13 stage (during dorsal closure process)  from non-GFP embryos from the line cbtEP(2)2237E1/Cy0, twi-eGFP line  by embryo sorter assays. In parallel, samples of white embryos at same stages (as control) were sorting also by embryo sorter. Also using UAS-GAL4 system, Cbt was overexpressed  in the embrionic epidermis during 10-13 stage by epidermal driver (69B-Gal4) and UAS-Cbt line.
