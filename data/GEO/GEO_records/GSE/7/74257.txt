TITLE
Identification of a novel Aire-regulating cis-regulatory element using H3K27ac ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Thymic central tolerance is essential to preventing autoimmunity. In medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), the Autoimmune regulator (Aire) gene plays an essential role in this process by driving the expression of a diverse set of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs), which are presented and help tolerize self-reactive thymocytes. Interestingly, Aire has a highly tissue-restricted pattern of expression, with only mTECs and peripheral extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs) known to express detectable levels in adults. Despite this high level of tissue specificity, the cis-regulatory elements that control Aire expression have remained obscure. We used sequence conservation analysis and ChIP-seq against the enhancer-associated histone mark H3K27ac to identify a candidate Aire cis-regulatory element. There is enrichment of H3K27ac near this element, ACNS1, in mTECs and the element also has characteristics of being  NF-ÎºB-responsive. Finally, we find that this element is essential for Aire expression in vivo and necessary to prevent spontaneous autoimmunity, reflecting the importance of this regulatory DNA element in promoting immune tolerance.

DESIGN
Two experimental groups (GFP neg mTECs and GFP pos mTECs), each with three samples, and one control sample (D10 Th2 cells).
