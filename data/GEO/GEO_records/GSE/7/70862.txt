TITLE
Genome-wide maps of transcription factor and co-factor binding and nucleosome density during B-cell to Macrophage lineage switching

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using homogenous populations of cells undergoing cell switching we observed an interplay between lymphoid and myeloid transcription factors during lineage switching

DESIGN
Examination of transcription factor binding and nucleosome density several time points after induction of transdifferentiation
