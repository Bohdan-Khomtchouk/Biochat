TITLE
Expression data from non-infected and Salmonella Choleraesuis infected mesenteric lymph nodes

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To understand the host transcriptional response to S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S. Choleraesuis), the first generation Affymetrix porcine GeneChip® was used to identify differentially expressed genes in the mesenteric lymph nodes responding to infection at acute (8 hours (h), 24h, 48h post-inoculation (pi)) and chronic stages (21 days (d) pi) The objectives of this study were to identify and examine the stereotypical gene expression response within the host mesenteric lymph nodes to S. Choleraesuis infection, and to characterize the global host responses by revealing the specific features of the host’s innate immunity. Keywords: time course
