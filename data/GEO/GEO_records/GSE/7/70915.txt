TITLE
Inhibition of Akt Signaling in PIK3R2 Overexpressing Colon Cancer Stem Cells Reduces Tumor Growth due Apoptosis and Decreased Mucin Production

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inhibition of Akt Signaling in PIK3R2 Overexpressing Colon Cancer Stem Cells Reduces Tumor Growth due Apoptosis and Decreased Mucin Production

DESIGN
Affymetrix microarray analysis was used to assess gene expression differences between ALDH+ and ALDH- cells enriched from primary human tumor xenografts
