TITLE
RNAPol2 accounts for tumor cells liability to JQ1 [Affymetrix]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We here use B-cell tumors as a model to address the mechanism of action of JQ1, a widely used BET inhibitor.

DESIGN
250000 cells/mL of RAJI cells were cultured in a total volume of 40 mL. 24h after the plating DMSO or 100 nM of JQ1 were added to the culture for 24h. Total RNA from 107 RAJI was purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions, treated with TurboDNase (Ambion) and processed for oligonucleotide microarray profile through Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays platform.
