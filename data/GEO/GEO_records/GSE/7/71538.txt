TITLE
Genomic profiling of Brazilian gliomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to perform a genomic profiling of gliomas of Brazilian origin, using array-CGH, MSI analysis and to associate the genomic alterations with TERT and IDH1 mutation status, and correlate the molecular features with clinicopathological characteristics.

DESIGN
65 frozen tissue specimen, including 7 pilocytic astrocytomas, 9 diffuse astrocytomas, 7 anaplastic astrocytomas and 42 glioblastomas, were submitted to 60K Agilent array-CGH platform in order to determine copy number aberrations (CNA)
