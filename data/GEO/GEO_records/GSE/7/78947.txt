TITLE
HCT116 gene expression analysis upon CAF stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HCT116 colon carcinoma cells invade more the basement membrane when carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are present. In order to identify if CAFs induce an invasive phenotype to HCT116 cells, and therefore regulate genes expression related to invasion, we compared gene expression of HCT116 cells cultured alone or in the presence of CAFs.

DESIGN
HCT116 cells were cultured with or without CAFs and were later collected and subjected to the gene expression analysis
