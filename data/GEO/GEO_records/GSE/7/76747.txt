TITLE
The Histone Methyltransferases MLL1 and DOT1L Cooperate with Meningioma-1 to Induce AML [Human RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To characterize transcriptional changes associated with inhibition of Dot1l in 2 inv(16) patient AML samples Methods: We sequenced mRNA from patient samples that were exposed to 5 uM EPZ004777 or DMSO control for 7  days. Results: Inhibition of Dot1l leads to gene expression changes in genes related to cell growth and cell cycle.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels between cells treated with  5 uM EPZ004777 or DMSO control
