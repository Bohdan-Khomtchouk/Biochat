TITLE
AR and ERG ChIP-seq in presence or absence of PRMT5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Replicates of ChIP seq data using AR and ERG antibodies from VCaP cell lines harboring inducible shRNA constructs for PRMT5 (3 independent, sh1, sh2, sh3) and 1 non targeting control (NTC), all sample stimulated with ligand, either DHT or R1881

DESIGN
AR ChIPseq in VCaP cells, 3 replicates each of DHT stimulated cells with one of 4 inducible shRNA constructs, sh1, sh2, sh3 targeting PRMT5 or NTC non targeting controls. Furthermore 2 AR ChIPseq in the same system stimulated with R1881 for targeting constructs sh1, sh2 and NTC. ERG ChIPseq 2 replicates DHT stimulated, each of sh1, sh2, sh3 constructs. Cells where induced (doxycyclin) for shRNA expression on day0, hormone starved on day3 and harvested on day5.
