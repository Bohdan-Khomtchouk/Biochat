TITLE
WT (Fis+) strain

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Fis is a nucleoid-associated protein in E. coli that is abundant during early logarithmic growth in rich medium but is in short supply during stationary phase.  Its role as a transcriptional regulator has been demonstrated for an increasing number of genes.  In order to gain insight into the global effects of Fis on E. coli gene expression during different stages of growth in rich medium, DNA microarray analyses were conducted in fis and wild type strains during early log, mid log, late log, and stationary growth phases. We used microarrays to detail the global impact of Fis on gene expression in Escherichia coli Keywords: time course
