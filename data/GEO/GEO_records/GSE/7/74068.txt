TITLE
Genome-wide Expression Profiling in Peripheral Models of XDP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide expression profiling using an Agilent microarray in blood- and fibroblast-derived samples from XDP patients and ethnicity-matched Filipino controls. The hypothesis was that TAF1 is dysregulated in peripheral models of XDP and this dysregulation has a concomitant downstream effect on expression genome-wide.

DESIGN
Cross-sectional, XDP affecteds vs controls. In blood-derived RNA: 10 from affecteds, 12 from controls. In fibroblast-derived RNA: 15 from affecteds, 10 from controls
