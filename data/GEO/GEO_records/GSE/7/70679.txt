TITLE
Prostate Cancer Risk SNPs in Androgen Receptor Target Sites

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled androgen receptor (AR) genomic targets using high-throughput sequencing of chromatin-immunoprecipitated (ChIP) DNA from TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene positive DUCaP prostate cancer cells. ChIp-seq and microarray gene expression profiling datasets were integrated with the NHGRI GWAS PCa risk SNPs catalog to identify disease susceptibility SNPs localized within functional androgen receptor binding sites (ARBSs). Eighty GWAS index or linked SNPs were found to be localized in ARBSs. Among these rs11891426:T > G in the 7th intron of the melanophilin gene was found located within a novel putative auxiliary AR binding motif, which we found enriched in the neighborhood of canonical androgen responsive elements. Tâ†’G exchange attenuated the transcriptional activity of the ARBS in an AR reporter gene assay of prostate cancer cell models. It went also in line with decreased melanophilin protein level in primary prostate tumors with G allele.These results unravel a hidden link between androgen receptor and a functional PCa risk SNP, whose allele alteration affects androgen regulation of its host gene melanophilin .

DESIGN
Genomic profile of androgen receptor binding sites of androgen or vehicle treated DUCaP cells using ChIP-seq. IgG precipiated DNAs from both treatments served as controls.
