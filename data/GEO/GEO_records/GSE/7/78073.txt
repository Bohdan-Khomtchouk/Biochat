TITLE
Oct4 ChIP-Seq at G1 and G2/M phase of cell cycle in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We mapped the genome-wide occupancy of Oct4 at G2/M (nocodazole-treated cells) and G1 phase (release of nocodazole-treated cells) in E14 mouse embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
Examination of Oct4 occupancy at different cell cycle.
