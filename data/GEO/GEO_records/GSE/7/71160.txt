TITLE
Gene expression profiles of ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the global gene expression in ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor samples with or without DICER1 RNase IIIb domain mutation

DESIGN
The global expression expression profiles of eight formalin-fixed paraffin-embeded (FFPE) ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors were determined by the Ilumina DASL whole transcriptome analysis.
