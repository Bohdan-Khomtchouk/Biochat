TITLE
Gene Expression Signatures of Motor Neuron Populations Isolated from Sporadic ALS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used total RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze ALS MN-specific gene-expression signatures in laser capture microdissected motor neurons from post-mortem lumbar spinal cords.

DESIGN
To obtain transcriptome-wide gene expression measurements in adult spinal motor neurons (MNs), we performed laser capture microdissection (LCM) of lumbar spinal cord sections from 13 sporadic ALS patients and 9 controls, extracted total RNA, made RNA-seq libraries and sequenced the libraries on Illumina GA II platform
