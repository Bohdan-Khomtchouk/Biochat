TITLE
DNA Microarray of Global Transcription Factor Mutant Reveals Membrane-Related Proteins Involved in n-Butanol Tolerance in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

SUMMARY
We successfully isolated an E. coli strain harboring rpoD mutant B8 with 2% (v/v) butanol tolerance using global transcriptional machinery engineering approach. DNA microarrays were employed to assess the transcriptome profile of n-butanol tolerance strain B8 and control strain E. coli JM109. The goal of this study is therefore to identify E. coli genes that are involved in n-butanol tolerance.
