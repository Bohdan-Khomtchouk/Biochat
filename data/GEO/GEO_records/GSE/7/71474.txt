SUMMARY
DNA Methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is frequently mutated in various hematopoietic malignancies; however, the underlying oncogenic mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that DNMT3A mutational ‘hotspot’ at Arg882 (DNMT3A-R882H) cooperates with constitutively activated RAS in transforming murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) ex vivo and inducing acute leukemias in vivo. DNMT3A-R882H potentiates aberrant transactivation of ‘stemness’ gene expression programs, notably transcription factors Meis1, Hox-A, Mn1 and Mycn. Mechanistically, R882-mutated DNMT3A directly binds to cis-regulatory elements of these genes and induces focal CpG hypomethylation reminiscent of what was seen in human leukemias bearing DNMT3A R882 mutation. Furthermore, DNMT3A-R882H induced DNA hypomethylation facilitates gene enhancer/promoter activation and recruitment of Dot1l-associated transcription elongation machineries. Inactivation of Dot1l represses DNMT3AR882H-mediated stem cell gene dysregulation and acute leukemogenicity. In this dataset, we provided R882H-mutated DNMT3A, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq profiling data of RH-RAS LSCs, and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq data in HOXA9-MEIS1 LSCs.

DESIGN
Genome-wide binding of R882H-mutated DNMT3A (Myc tagged; ChIP-seq with 9e10 anti-Myc antibodies) and histone modification profiles for H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were generated by ChIP-seq using specific antibodies in RH-RAS LSCs. Genome-wide H3K4me1 histone modification profiles were generated by ChIP-seq using H3K4me1 specific antibody in HOXA9-MEIS1 LSCs.
