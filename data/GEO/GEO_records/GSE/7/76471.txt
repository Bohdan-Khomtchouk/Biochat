TITLE
Expression data analysis from RPMI 8226 cells irraidated to C-ions.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an hematological malignancy. MM cells are resistant to X-ray irradiations. We irradiated RPMI 8226 cancer cells with C-ions, which are more energetic than X-ray irradiations. We found that MM cells, RPMI 8226, are also resistant to C-ion irradiations. We used microarrays to investigate the mechanisms of MM cell resistance to C-ion irradiations.

DESIGN
MM cells, RPMI 8226, were subjected to 0 or 6 Gy doses of C-ion irradiations. RNA were extratred from each batch of cells one day after irradiations and subjected to microarray analysis.
