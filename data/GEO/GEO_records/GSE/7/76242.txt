TITLE
Microarrays of Maize Recombinant Inbred Lines inoculated with Cercospora zeina, which causes  grey leaf spot (GLS) disease

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Global transcriptome profiling of leaf tissue from 100 RILs.  All plants were field-grown and infected with GLS.  Objective was to carry out systems genetics of the transcriptional responses to GLS, by overlaying results obtained from co-expression correlation analysis,  eQTL analysis and QTL analysis.

DESIGN
Plants were grown at Baynesfield Estate (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) as three replicated, randomised blocks. Each replicate of a RIL was a row of 10 plants. RILs were inoculated at the six leaf stage by placing into the whorls 50 g per plant of dry powdered maize leaf material collected from GLS infected maize.   RNA was extracted from three biological repeats of 100 selected maize RILs at 103 DAP, sampled at Baynesfield in March 2009. The RNA from the three biological repeats was pooled to create 100 samples. Each biological repeat consisted of 10 cm X 10 cm leaf pieces from two different plants in a RIL row. Fifty RIL microarrays were processed according to the “distant pair” experimental design. RNA was amplified from each of the 100 RIL samples using the Amino Allyl MessageAmpII aRNA Amplification kit (Ambion, Dallas, USA), labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 (100 pmol each), and hybridized to Agilent-016047 maize 4×44 K microarrays .
