TITLE
Enhanced Phospholipase A2 group 3 expression by oxidative stress decreases the insulin-degrading enzyme

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oxidative stress has a ubiquitous role in neurodegenerative diseases and oxidative damage in  specific regions of the brain is associated with selective neurodegeneration. We previously reported that Alzheimer disease (AD) model mice showed decreased insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) levels in the cerebrum and accelerated phenotypic features of AD when crossbred with alpha-tocopherol transfer protein knockout (Ttpa-/-) mice. To further investigate the role of chronic oxidative stress in AD pathophysiology, we performed DNA microarray analysis using young and aged wild-type mice and aged Ttpa-/- mice. Among the genes whose expression changed dramatically was Phospholipase A2 group 3 (Pla2g3); Pla2g3 was identified because of its expression profile of cerebral specific up-regulation by chronic oxidative stress in silico and in aged Ttpa-/- mice. Immunohistochemical studies also demonstrated that human astrocytic Pla2g3 expression was significantly increased in human AD brains compared with control brains. Moreover, transfection of HEK293 cells with human Pla2g3 decreased endogenous IDE expression in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings show a key role of Pla2g3 on the reduction of IDE, and suggest that cerebrum specific increase of Pla2g3 is involved in the initiation and/or progression of AD.

DESIGN
Gene expression in cerebral cortex and cerebellum of mice were determined using Agilent chips. To ensure higher quality results in gene expression data, we conducted microarrays on 4 mice per group. Young mice were 2 months old and the other aged mice were 29 months old at the time of use. Data were standardized using global normalization and pro-cessed by R-program. An absolute fold change threshold of greater than 1.5 was required to be considered for further analyses. Expression values were in log2 scale.
