TITLE
Changes in gene expression and RNA editing in Adar2-WT and Adar2-KO Mouse embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Measure gene expression and RNA editing changes in Adar-WT and Adar2-KO MEFs Methods: Performed PolyA+ RNA-seq (single end, one sample each) of Adar2-WT and Adar2-KO MEFs Results: Observed changes in editing and gene expression of several genes Conclusion: Adar2 influences gene expression and editing of transcripts

DESIGN
Gene expression and editing profiles of Adar2-WT and Adar2-KO were generated by PolyA+ RNA-seq (single end, one sample each), using Illumina HiSeq 2500
