TITLE
Differential expression profiling of  Arabidopsis ABHD11 knock-out mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ABHD11 has a acylhydrolase activity. Knock-out of abhd11 increases phospholipids in plant leaves. Wholegenome array was done to check the differential expressed genes in lipid metabolic pathway

DESIGN
Organism: Arabidopsis thaliana, Agilent Custom Arabidopsis Gene Expression 8x60k Array (AMADID: 037661) designed  by Genotypic Technology Private Limited.
