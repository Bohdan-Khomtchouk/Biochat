TITLE
Differential expression of lncRNAs during the HIV replication cycle

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Studying the effects of HIV infection on the host transcriptome has typically focused on protein-coding genes. However, recent advances in the field of RNA sequencing revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) add an extensive additional layer to the cellâ€™s molecular network and are highly involved in the regulation of molecular processes, including gene expression. Here, we performed transcriptome profiling throughout a primary HIV infection in vitro to investigate lncRNA expression at the different HIV replication cycle processes (reverse transcription, integration and particle production). Subsequently, guilt-by-association, transcription factor and co-expression analysis were performed to infer biological roles for the lncRNAs identified in the HIV-host interplay. Many lncRNAs were shown to play a role in mechanisms relying on proteasomal and ubiquitinylation pathways, apoptosis, DNA damage responses and cell cycle regulation. Through transcription factor binding analysis, we found that lncRNAs display a distinct transcriptional regulation profile as compared to protein coding mRNAs, suggesting that mRNAs and lncRNAs are independently modulated from each other. In addition, we identified five differentially expressed lncRNA-mRNA pairs with mRNA involvement in HIV pathogenesis (HIV linked co-expression) with possible cis regulatory lncRNAs that control the nearby mRNA expression and function. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that lncRNAs add a new dimension to the HIV-host interplay and should be further investigated as they may represent targets for controlling HIV replication.

DESIGN
HIV time-course experiment at 4 time points post HIV infection: 2h, 6h, 18h, 30h. Each timepoint has an uninfected and infected condition. Time course experiment was performed in duplicate resulting in a total of 16 samples.
