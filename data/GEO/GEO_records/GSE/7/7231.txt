TITLE
Ribosomal protein S3: a functional component of NF-kB p65 binding complexes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the effects on the NF-kB transcriptome after knockdown of RPS3 in stimulated T cells, we performed microarray assays comparing RPS3-silenced versus NS-treated samples on the same chip. p65-silenced versus NS-treated samples were used as a control. Keywords: time series design
