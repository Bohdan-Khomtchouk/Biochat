TITLE
Total RNA sequencing of HCT116 cells with vitamin C, 5-Aza-CdR and combination treatment compared to untreated cells I

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA sequenceing method was used to compare the differential expression of genes in HCT116 cells with vitamin C, 5-Aza-CdR and combination treatment compared to untreated cells

DESIGN
Examination of total RNA expressed after cells with vitamin C, 5-Aza-CdR and combination treatment compared to untreated cells
