TITLE
Autonomous extracellular matrix remodeling controls a progressive adaptation in muscle stem cell regenerative capacity during development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Muscle stem cells (MuSC) exhibit distinct behaviors during successive phases of developmental myogenesis. However, how their transition to adulthood is regulated is poorly understood. Here we show that fetal MuSC resist progenitor specification and exhibit altered division dynamics, intrinsic features that are progressively lost postnatally. Following transplantation, fetal MuSC more efficiently expand and contribute to muscle repair. Conversely, the efficiency of niche colonization increases in adulthood, indicating a balance between muscle growth and stem cell pool repopulation. Gene expression profiling identified several extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules preferentially expressed in fetal MuSC, including tenascin-C, fibronectin and collagen VI. Loss-of-function experiments confirmed their essential and stage-specific role in regulating MuSC function. Finally, fetal-derived paracrine factors were able to enhance adult MuSC regenerative potential. Together, these findings demonstrate that MuSC change the way in which they remodel their microenvironment to direct stem cell behavior in support of the unique demands of muscle development or repair.

DESIGN
MuSCs were isolated through fluorescent-activate cell sorting usinf alpha7-integirn and CD34 as markers to identify the cell population. Total mRNA was then isolated, and samples at different developmental times were compared.
