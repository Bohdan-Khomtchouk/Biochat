TITLE
Expression data fom human capillary network-derived cells before and after adipogenic differentation, and after chronic  adenylate cyclase activation of differentiated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Progenitors in human vasculature expanded in-vitro were differentiated with adipogenic cocktail for 12 days, following which they were stimulated with forskolin for 7 days Microarrays were used to detail the program of differentiation of thermogenic human adipose cells

DESIGN
Adipose tissue from three individuals was cultured in hydrogel under pro-angiogenic conditions. Capillary networks emerging from the explants were subcultured on plastic, grown to confluence, subjected to adipogenic differentiation and after 12 days treated with vehicle or forskolin for 7 days
