TITLE
Gene expression profiles in TICAM1 knockout and wild-type MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TICAM1 knockout and wild-type (TICAM1 knockout MEFs with restored TICAM1 expression) MEFs were treated by c-di-GMP or DMSO for 4 hours. Total RNA was analyzed via Illumina Mouse Ref-8 V2. Changes in gene induction, especially of interferon-stimulated genes, between c-di-GMP and DMSO treated cells were examined.

DESIGN
Total RNA from c-di-GMP or DMSO treated wild-type MEFs, c-di-GMP or DMSO treated TICAM1 knockout MEFs were analyzed. Gene expression was compared between c-di-GMP treated and DMSO treated samples.
