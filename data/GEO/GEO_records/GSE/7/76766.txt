TITLE
mTORC1 and CK2 coordinate ternary and eIF4F complex assembly

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA translation plays a major role in homeostasis, whereas its dysregulation underpins a variety of pathological states including cancer, metabolic syndrome and neurological disorders.  Ternary complex (TC) and eIF4F complex assembly are two major rate-limiting steps in translation initiation that are thought to be regulated by eIF2α phosphorylation, and the mTOR/4E-BP pathway, respectively2. However, how TC and eIF4F assembly are coordinated remains largely unknown. Using polysome-profiling, we show that on a genome-wide scale mTOR suppresses translation of mRNAs, which are translationally activated under short-term ER stress when TC recycling is attenuated by eIF2α phosphorylation. During acute nutrient or growth factor stimulation, mTORC1 induces eIF2β phosphorylation, which increases recruitment of NCK1 to eIF2, decreases eIF2α phosphorylation and bolsters TC recycling. Accordingly, eIF2β appears to act as a previously unidentified mediator of mTORC1 on protein synthesis and proliferation. In addition, we demonstrate a formerly undocumented role for CK2 in regulation of translation initiation, whereby CK2 stimulates phosphorylation of eIF2β and simultaneously bolsters eIF4F complex assembly via the mTORC1/4E-BP pathway. These findings imply a previously unrecognized mode of translation regulation whereby mTORC1 and CK2 coordinate TC and eIF4F complex assembly to stimulate cell proliferation.

DESIGN
Comparisons of polysome-associated and cytoplasmic mRNA from starved cells or cells stimulated with insulin in the presence or absence of Torin-1.
