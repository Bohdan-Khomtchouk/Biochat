TITLE
A developmental coordinate of the spectrum of pluripotency among  mice, monkeys, and humans

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
The epiblast (EPI) is the origin of all somatic and germ cells in mammals, and of the spectrum of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro. To explore the ontogeny of human/primate pluripotency, we performed comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing for pre- and post-implantation EPI development in cynomolgus monkeys. Here we show that after specification in the blastocysts [embryonic day (E)7], cyEPI undergoes major transcriptome changes upon implantation. Thereafter, cyEPI, while generating gastrulating cells (~E13), maintains its transcriptome relatively stably over a week, retaining a unique set of pluripotency genes while acquiring properties for “neuron differentiation.” h/cyPSCs show the highest similarity to post-implantation late cyEPI (~E17), which, despite co-existing with gastrulating cells, bears characteristics of pre-gastrulating mouse EPI (E5.5) and epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) in vitro. These findings not only reveal divergence/coherence of EPI development, but also identify a developmental coordinate of the spectrum of pluripotency among key species, providing a basis for better regulation of human pluripotency in vitro.

DESIGN
Single cell transcriptome analysis of cynomolgus monkey embryo E6-17 and mouse embryo E4.5 - E6.5 as well as of cynomogus monkey embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and mouse ESC, epiblast like cells (EpiLCs), using SC3-seq technology.
