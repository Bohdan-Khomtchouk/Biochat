TITLE
PHGR1 knockdown in the colorectal cell line HT29

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HT29 cells were transfected with two different PHGR1-targeted siRNA and a scramble siRNA (control) in four copies. Global mRNA profiling was performed by hybridization to Illumina Human-6 Express BeadChips (version 2). Genes significantly up- or downregulated for both PHGR1-targeted siRNAs were identified.

DESIGN
The transfections and corresponding hybridizations were done in four parallelles (12 samples in total). The controls were HT29 cells transfected with a scramble siRNA. Probe-level data not available.
