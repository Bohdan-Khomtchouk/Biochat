TITLE
Transient transfection of miR-449 family in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HLE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we comparatively analyzed the members of the miR-449 family (miR-449a, miR-449b, and miR-449c) with regards to their target genes and functional effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Microarray analysis after transient transfection of miR-449a, miR-449b, and/or miR-449c in the HCC cell line HLE identified putative target genes of miR-449a, miR-449b, and miR-449c.

DESIGN
For transient overexpression of miRNAs, the HCC cell line HLE was transfected with 50 nM Allstars Negative Control or miScript miRNA mimics. MiRNA mimics for miR-449a, miR-449b, and miR-449c were either single transfected or cotransfected in equimolar amounts (16.7 nM each). Global mRNA expression profiling was performed utilizing pooled RNA of three biological replicates per microarray and two microarrays per condition.
