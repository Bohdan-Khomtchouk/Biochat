TITLE
Host transcriptional reprogramming in response to the rice bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain BLS354

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-Seq of leaves of Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare 48 hours after inoculation with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola strain BLS354, the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak. Results provide insight into the molecular basis of bacterial leaf streak, particularly the role of transcription activator-like effectors in the disease.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare leaves at 48 hours after inoculation with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola  strain BLS354 with three biological replicates compared to three replicates of mock inoculated O. sativa as the control.
