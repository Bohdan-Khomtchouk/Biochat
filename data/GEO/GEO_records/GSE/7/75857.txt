TITLE
H3K36 mutations promote sarcomagenesis through genome-wide remodeling of H3K36 and H3K27 methylation [HA-H33-H31_ChIP]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to understand the genome-wide alterations in chromatin landscape induced by a histone mutation (H3.3K36M) derived from chondroblastomas

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide distribution of HA-tagged histone H3.1/H3.3 in cells expressing HA-tagged H3.3WT, H3.3K36M, H3.1WT and H3.3K36M.
