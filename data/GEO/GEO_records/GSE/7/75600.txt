SUMMARY
We investigated microRNA expression in motoneurons by performing small RNA sequencing of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-isolated motoneurons labelled with the Hb9:gfp transgenic reporter and Hb9:gfp negative non-motoneurons including spinal interneurons.  We find that one microRNA, microRNA-218, is highly enriched and abundantly expressed in motoneurons.  Furthermore, we find that miR-218 is transcribed from alternative, motoneuron-specific alternative promoters embedded within the Slit2 and Slit3 genes by performing RNA sequencing of FACS-isolated motoneurons and a dissected embryonic floor plate cells which served as a control.  Next, we performed RNA sequencing of FACS-isolated wild type (WT) motoneurons and motoneurons lacking miR-218 expression (218DKO motoneurons), and find that a large set of genes (named 'TARGET218' genes) with predicted miR-218 binding sites are de-repressed in the absence of miR-218 expression.  Finally, we examine the expression of TARGET218 genes in other neuronal subpopulations by FACS-isolating  V1, V2a, and V3 interneurons expressing Cre-inducible fluorescent reporters and performing RNA sequencing.  We find that the TARGET218 network of genes is depleted in wild-type motoneurons versus these interneuron types.  Additionally, these genes are expressed at similar levels in 218DKO motoneurons compared with interneuron subtypes, suggesting that this genetic network.
