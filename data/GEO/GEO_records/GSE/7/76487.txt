TITLE
MBNL1-dependent modulation of gene expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify MBNL1-dependent changes in gene expression, MDA-MB-231 cells expressing either control or MBNL1-targeting shRNAs were transcriptomically profiled.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing a control or two independent MBNL1-targeting shRNAs were sequenced in biological duplicate.
