TITLE
Gene expression profiling of selenophosphate synthetase 2 knockdown in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Selenium (Se) is an important trace element for many organisms and is incorporated into selenoproteins as selenocysteine (Sec). In eukaryotes, selenophosphate synthetase SPS2 is essential for Sec biosynthesis. In recent years, genetic disruptions of both Sec biosynthesis genes and selenoprotein genes have been investigated in different animal models, which provide important clues for understanding the Se metabolism and function in these organisms. However, a systematic study on the knockdown of SPS2 has not been performed in vivo. Herein, we conducted microarray experiments to study the transcriptome of fruit flies with knockdown of SPS2 in larval and adult stages. Several hundred differentially expressed genes were identified in each stage.

DESIGN
Genes expression profiles of 12 fruit fly samples corresponding to larval and adult stages of SPS2 knockdown and control groups (3 replicates for each group) were analyzed using an Affymetrix Drosophila genome microarray.
