TITLE
Human B-1 and pre-plamablast like cells Gene Expression Array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human B-1 cells (CD20+CD27+CD43+CD38lo/int) and pre-plasmablast like cells (CD20+CD27hiCD38hi) are new antibody secreting cells identified in circulation. We used microarray to compare and contrast expressed genes between these two cell population

DESIGN
Cell subsets of interested were sort purified using BD Influx cell sorter and were subject for RNA extraction and hybridization on Human Gene 2.1 ST arrays.
