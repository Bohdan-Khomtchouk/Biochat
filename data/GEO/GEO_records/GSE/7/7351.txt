TITLE
In vivo genomic binding sites for the Drosophila CTCF Insulator

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Chromatin immunopurification with anti-CTCF was used to identify in vivo binding sites for CTCF in approximately 3% of the Drosophila genome using amplicon-based tiling arrays.  This includes the Bithorax-complex, a known site of CTCF activity, the Antp-Complex, the Achaete scute-Complex and the Adh region.  Reproducible binding identified new CTCF sites in the Adh region and the Bx-C. Keywords: ChIP-chip
