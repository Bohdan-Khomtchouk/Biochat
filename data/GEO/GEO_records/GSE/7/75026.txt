TITLE
miRNA expression profile of PBMCs in healthy subjects after extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake - Part 2 (Controls)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression profiles of PBMCs in healthy subjects following extra virgin olive oil intake. The aim of the present study was to investigate the whole-genome gene and miRNA profiles of PBMCs after EVOO intake. Results provide the information of changes in PBMPs transcriptome following EVOO intake.

DESIGN
RNA obtained from PBMCs of the same patients before and after extra virgin olive oil intake (paired samples). Comparisons: T0 vs. T1 (paired samples) - Controls
