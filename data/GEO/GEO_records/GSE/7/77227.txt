TITLE
Comparison kPSCs versus bmMSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiles kPSCs versus bmMSCs Here we characterized human kidney derived perivascular stromal cells  (hkPSCs) and compared them to human bmMSCs in expression profile

DESIGN
hkPSCs were isolated from human kidneys based on plastic adherence and NG2 expression and compared to human bmMSCs
