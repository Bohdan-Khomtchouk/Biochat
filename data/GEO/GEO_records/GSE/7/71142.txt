TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed miRNAs in drug resistant and drug sensitive breast cancer tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify miRNAs involved in drug resistance of human breast cancer, a miRNA microarray was performed on 5 cases of drug resistant tissues and 5 cases of drug sensitive tissues.The expression levels of totally 2019 miRNAs in 5 pairs of matched, drug resistant and drug sensitive tissues were examined by microarray. There were 27 differentially expressed miRNAs between drug resistant and drug sensitive tissues were identified of which there were 11 significantly up-regulated while the other 16 were down-regulated in drug resistant tissues compared to drug sensitive tissues. It was found that miR-489 was one of the most downregulated miRNAs in drug resistant tissues.

DESIGN
Group 1: Examination of miRNAs in drug resistant tissues (5 cases), including C100, C17, C28, C22 and C115. Group 2: Examination of miRNAs in drug sensitive tissues (5 cases), including H801, H31, H19, H20, and H32.
