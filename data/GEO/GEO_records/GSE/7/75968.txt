TITLE
microRNA expression profile related to lymph node status in women with stage grade 1-2-3 endometrial cancer

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether microRNA profiles of grade 1 â€“ 2 or 3 endometrioid adenocarcinomas can be related to nodal status and used as a tool to adapt surgical staging in early-stage EC. MicroRNA expression were assessed in twelve formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) EC primary tumors with positive lymph node and in 36 FFPE EC primary tumors with negative lymph node, matched for grade, stage and lymphovascular space involvement status.
