TITLE
Expression profile of micro-RNAs and functional annotation analysis of their targets in human chorionic villi from early recurrent miscarriage

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study was designed to investigate the miRNA expression profilein human chorionic villi from early recurrent miscarriage. We identified 155 miRNAs exhibiting over 2-fold change in expression levels (P < 0.05) by microarray,
