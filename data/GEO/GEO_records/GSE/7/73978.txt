TITLE
Expression data from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines AsPC1, BxPC3 and their cisplatin-resistant derivatives AsPC1-R and BxPC3-R

SUMMARY
Cisplatin is a broad-spectrum anticancer drug, which is estimated to be administered to 40-80% of patients undergoing chemotherapy. However, its clinical utility is often limited due to factors that include acquired resistance of cancer cells to cisplatin. Because cisplatin is currently evaluated as a prospective agent for combined chemotherapy of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we have investigated mechanisms involved in the acquired resistance of PDAC cells to cisplatin using gene expression study of two different parental-resistant pairs of PDAC cell lines. We have developed cisplatin-resistant cell lines AsPC1-R and BxPC3-R from their parental PDAC cell lines AsPC1 and BxPC3, respectively, by culturing them in medium with step-wise increasing concentration of cisplatin. Parental and resistant pairs of PDAC cells were analyzed by whole-transcript gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
Cells from adherent subconfluent cultures of parental cell lines AsPC1, BxPC3, and their cisplatin-resistant derivatives AsPC1-R and BxPC3-R (3 replicates per cell line) grown in the absence of cisplatin were harvested and processed for isolation of total cell RNA.
