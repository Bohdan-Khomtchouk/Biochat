TITLE
Cathelicidin insufficiency in patients with fatal leptospirosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole blood transcriptional profiling of Brazilian patients with acute leptospirosis to identify mechanisms associated with case fatality

DESIGN
Independent whole blood was collected during early acute illness, convalescence, or from healthy volunteers directly into PAXgene solution and stored at -70C until RNA was extracted. RNA was isolated using Qiagen PAXgene Blood Kit, and Cy3-labeled cRNA was generated using the Low Input QuickAmp Labeling Kit One-Color and RNA Spike-In Kit, One-Color. 600ng of Cy3-labeled cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K v2 Microarrays
