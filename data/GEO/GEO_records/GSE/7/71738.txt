TITLE
Molecular hydrogen stimulates the gene expression of a translational coactivator PGC-1alpha to enhance fatty acid metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously reported that molecular hydrogen (H2) acts as a novel antioxidant to exhibits multiple-functions.  Moreover, long-term drinking of H2-water (water infused with H2) enhanced energy expenditure to improve obesity and diabetes in db/db mice, accompanied with the increased gene expression of an energy metabolism stimulatory hepatic hormone, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21); however, the molecular mechanism is unknown particularly on whether this gene regulation is a primary cause or the secondary consequence. Pathway analyses based on comprehensive gene expression revealed the increased expression in various genes involved in fatty acid and steroid metabolisms.  As a transcription pathway, the PPARa signaling pathway was identified to up-regulate the genes by 14 day-ingestion of H2.  As an early event, the gene expression of PGC-1a was transiently increased at day 3, followed by increased expression of FGF21. In wild-type mice that fed with fatty-diet, H2-water improved the level of plasma triglyceride and extended their life span.

DESIGN
H2 was ingested by ad libitum drinking H2-water for 14 days or by oral administration of an H2-producing material MgH2 for 1, 3 or 7 days. Comprehensive gene expression profile in liver of db/db mice was analyzed by DNA microarray.
