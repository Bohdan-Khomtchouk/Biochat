TITLE
TfRc Dependent Gene Expression in Embryonic Renal Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the ability of transferrin receptor1 (TfRc) knockout cells to populate different domains of the developing kidney by using a chimeric approach. The TfRc cells developed into all segments of the developing nephron, but there was a relative exclusion from the ureteric bud and a positive bias towards the stromal compartment. Here we conducted a microarray analysis of differential gene expression between TfRc deficient and wild type (wt) cells in chimeric embryonic kidneys derived from embryos created by blastocyst injection of wt blastocysts with TfRc-/- green fluorescent protein-expressing (GFP+) embryonic stem cells. Keywords: cell type comparison, genetic modification, iron signaling
