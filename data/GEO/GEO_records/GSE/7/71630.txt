TITLE
Genetical genomics implicates the IAA biosynthesis pathway in the regulation of Populus adventitious root formation

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
Adventitious roots (AR) develop from tissues other than the primary root, in a developmental process physiologically regulated by phytohormones. Adventitious roots provide structural support and contribute to water and nutrient absorption, and are critical for commercial vegetative propagation of several crops. Here we quantified the number of AR, root architectural traits and root biomass in cuttings from a pseudo-backcross population of Populus deltoides and Populus trichocarpa. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and whole-transcriptome analysis of individuals carrying alternative QTL alleles for AR number wereas used to identify putative regulatorsregions in the genome that regulateof AR development in the genome., and putative candidate genesregulators.
