TITLE
Genome-wide measurement of spatial expression in mutants of Drosophila Melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from transverse slices of embryos from a variety of D. melanogaster mutants (bicoid over-expression, bicoid knockdown, hunchback knocdown, and zelda mutant) at the blastoderm stage to determine genome-wide patterns of gene expression.

DESIGN
mRNA from transverse sections of single D. melanogaster embryos mutant for patterning TFs was sequenced.
