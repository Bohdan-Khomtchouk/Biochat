TITLE
Expression data from NSC11, 0923, and GBMJ1 polysome-bound RNA and total RNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Defining radioresponse using the translatome and the transcriptome to identify functional consequences of radiation. We used microarrays to detail the changes in glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) in both the translatome and transcriptome after irradiation.

DESIGN
GBM stem-like cells were grown in monolayer and irradiated with 2Gy. Cells were collected 1h or 6h after irradiation (IR).
