TITLE
Expression profiling of grass-clump dwarf in synthetic hexaploids from triploid hybrids crossed between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes to alter the transcript accumulation levels in grass-clump dwarf lines, which are synthetic hexaploid lines from triploid hybrids crossed between tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum cv. Langdon or T. turgidum ssp. carthlicum) and diploid wheat progenitor Aegilops tauschii (KU2025). No up-regulation of defense-related genes was observed under the normal temperature, and down-regulation of wheat APETALA1-like MADS-box genes, considered to act as flowering promoters, was found in the grass-clump dwarf lines. Together with small RNA sequencing analysis of the grass-clump dwarf line, unusual expression of the miR156/SPLs module could explain the grass-clump dwarf phenotype.

DESIGN
Expression patterns were compared between the three synthetic hexaploid lines showing the wild-type phenotype (as a reference) and grass-clump dwarf. Total RNA samples were isolated from crown tissues of the plants grown at 24Â°C under long day (18-h light and 6-h dark) condition for 8 weeks. Two independent experiments were conducted in each exprement.
