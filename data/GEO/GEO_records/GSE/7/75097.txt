TITLE
Microarray gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with  obstructive sleep apnea and primary snoring

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Therefore, we extended our investigation into OSA patients with long-term continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, hypertension, or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) by analyzing whole-genome gene expression profiles of PBMC in three comparisons: (1) treatment-naïve moderate to very severe OSA patients versus subjects with primary snoring; (2) moderate to very severe OSA patients with hypertension or EDS versus those without hypertension or EDS, respectively; (3) treatment-naïve very severe OSA patients versus those receiving at least one year of adequate CPAP treatment.

DESIGN
We analyzed whole-genome gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 48 patients with sleep-disordered breathing stratified into four groups: primary snoring (PS), moderate to severe OSA (MSO), very severe OSA (VSO), and very severe OSA patients with long-term continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment (VSOC).
