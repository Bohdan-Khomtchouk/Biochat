ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BRD4-NUT megadomains is an order of magnitude larger than super-enhancer regions and displays a more continuously enriched profile rather than appearing as a cluster of individual peaks.

DESIGN
Chip-seq mapping of active chromatin marks in BRD4-NUT and different NMC cells
