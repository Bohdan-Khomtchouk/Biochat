TITLE
Comparison of gender-biased liver gene expression from transgenic mice with chronic IFN gamma expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed liver gene expression from male and female ARE-Del mice, which have prolonged and chronic expression of IFN gamma through deletion of the IFN gamma 3â€™ UTR AU-rich element.

DESIGN
Compare liver gene expression from male and female ARE-Del compared to control littermates (n=3)
