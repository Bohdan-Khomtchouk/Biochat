TITLE
Lung microbiome enriched with anaerobes associated with Th17 immune phenotype

ORGANISM
human lung metagenome

SUMMARY
In a prior report, we observed two distinct lung microbiomes in healthy subjects that we termed “pneumotypes”: pneumotypeSPT, characterized by high bacterial load and supraglottic predominant taxa (SPT) such as the anaerobes  Prevotella and Veillonella; and pneumotypeBPT, with low bacterial burden and background predominant taxa (BPT) found in the saline lavage and bronchoscope. Here, we determined the prevalence of these two contrasting lung microbiome types, in a multi-center study of healthy subjects. We confirmed that a lower airway microbiome enriched with upper airway microbes (pneumotypeSPT) was present in ~45% of healthy individuals.

DESIGN
Cross-sectional Multicenter cohort. BAL of 49 healthy subjects from three cohort had their lower airway microbiome assessed by 16S rDNA sequencing and microbial gene content (metagenome) was computationally inferred from taxonomic assignments. The amplicons from total 100 samples are barcoded; the barcode and other clinical characteristics (e.g. inflammatory biomarkers and metabolome data) for each sample are provided in the 'Pneumotype.sep.Map.A1.txt' file.
