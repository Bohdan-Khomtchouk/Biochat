TITLE
Three Reactive Compartments in Venous Malformations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: Vascular malformations affect 3% of neonates. Venous malformations (VMs) are the largest group representing more than 50 % of cases. In hereditary forms of VMs gene mutations have been identified, but for the large group of spontaneous forms the primary cause and downstream dysregulated genes are unknown. Methods and Results: We have performed a global comparison of gene expression in slow-flow VMs and normal saphenous veins using human whole genome micro-arrays. Genes of interest were validated with qRT-PCR. Gene expression in the tunica media was studied after laser micro-dissection of small pieces of tissue. Protein expression in endothelial cells (ECs) was studied with antibodies. We detected 511 genes more than 4-fold down- and 112 genes more than 4-fold up-regulated. Notably, chemokines, growth factors, transcription factors and regulators of extra-cellular matrix (ECM) turnover were regulated. We observed activation and arterialization of ECs of the VM proper, whereas ECs of vasa vasorum exhibited up-regulation of inflammation markers. In the tunica media, an altered ECM turnover and composition was found. Conclusions: Our studies demonstrate dysregulated gene expression in tunica interna, media and externa of VMs, and show that each of the three layers represents a reactive compartment. The dysregulated genes may serve as therapeutic targets. Keywords: disease analysis
