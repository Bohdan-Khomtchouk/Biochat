TITLE
Comparison of age-related changes in gene expression of 2 rat skeletal muscles

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study we compared Gastrocnemius and Triceps gene expression with age. Our results show that gene expression is massively modulated with age in Gastroc but on the contrary very stable in Triceps, suggesting that Triceps is resistant to age-related defects.

DESIGN
3 groups of age (8 months, 18 months and 24 months) were analyzed, with 9-10 replicates per group. Gastrocnemius and Triceps were collected for each animal.
