TITLE
Lung miRNA profiling in mouse model of allergic airways disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the differential expression of miRNAs in the lungs of mice subjected to a model of allergic airways disease and non-allergic and steroid-treated control animals.

DESIGN
Total lung RNA was collected from mice sensitised and challenged with PBS or OVA with or without DEX treatment at day 16 and miRNA microarrays performed.
