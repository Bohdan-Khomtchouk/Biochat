TITLE
Direct conversion of rodent fibroblasts into myelinating induced Schwann cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of rodent fibroblast-derived induced Schwann cells

DESIGN
3 samples of source primary fibroblasts, 3 samples of primary Schwann cells as reference, and 3 samples of induced Schwann cells have been used for transcriptome analysis.
