TITLE
Expression analysis of TCRgd+LAP+ versus TCRgd+LAP- cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RNA-Seq to identify differential gene expression in LAP+ vs. LAP- Gamma-delta T-cells. We report a signature of 407 genes that were enriched in TCRgd+LAP+ vs. TCRgd+LAP- cells with p < 0.05. Among the up-regulated genes, we found increased expression of genes related to antigen presentation, including MHC class II molecules (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb1 and H2-Eb2), CD40 and CD86

DESIGN
RNA-Seq of TCRgd+LAP+ versus TCRgd+LAP- cells harvested from mouse spleen and Peyer's patches; began with 20 mice for two independent experiments (10 mice each); samples were pooled and for each experiment resulted in one LAP- and one LAP+ sample for RNA-SEQ, or four samples in total; The two LAP+ were combined, resulting in three samples in total for RNA-Seq.
