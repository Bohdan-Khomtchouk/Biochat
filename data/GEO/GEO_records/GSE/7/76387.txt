TITLE
Expression of lncRNAs in mouse heart 4 weeks after myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The expression signature of lncRNAs and mRNAs was analyzed in fibrotic tissue from peri-infarct region of mouse heart. We fund that fifty seven differentially expressed lncRNAs and 20 differentially expressed mRNAs are associated with 8 signaling pathways which are involved in the development of cardiac fibrosis, indicating a potential role of lncRNAs in cardiac fibrosis.

DESIGN
Male C57BL/6 mice was used to establish a myocardial infartion model by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery.  After 4 weeks, we collected the peri-infarct tissues from MI mice and corresponding region from sham-operated group for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
