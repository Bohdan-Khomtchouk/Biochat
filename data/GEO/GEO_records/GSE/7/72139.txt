TITLE
Transcriptional profile of mice with good and poor spatial learning during West Nile virus recovery

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Greater than 50% of patients who survive neuroinvasive West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne, positive-sense strand flavivirus, exhibit cognitive sequelae including memory impairments which may last several years. High survival rates from WNV neuroinvasive disease (WNND) ( > 90%) have led to hundreds to thousands of cases of WNV-mediated neurologic impairment accruing annually, yet underlying mechanisms responsible for these impairments have not been investigated. Here, we established a novel murine model of recovery from WNND in which intracranial inoculation of a mutant WNV (WNV-NS5-E218A) leads to rates of survival and cognitive dysfunction that mirror human WNND. WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered mice exhibit impaired spatial learning and persistently phagocytic microglia without significant loss of hippocampal neurons or brain volume. Whole transcriptome analysis of hippocampi from WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered mice with poor spatial learning was performed in order to identify target pathways and molecules underlying cognitive impairments during WNND recovery.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated murine hippocampus at 25 days post-mock or WNV-NS5-E218A intracranial infection.
