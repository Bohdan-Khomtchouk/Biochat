TITLE
Light and BcLTF2-dependent gene expression profiles in the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea

ORGANISM
Botrytis cinerea

SUMMARY
Full transcriptomes of the Botrytis cinerea wild-type strain B0510 and the null-mutant deltaBcLTF2, cultured in continuous darkness or submitted to a light stimulation, were compared to identify light- or/and BcLTF2-dependent genes.
