TITLE
Gene expression changes upon Lamin A and Lamin B2 depletion in a diploid colorectal cancer cell line - DLD1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated depletion of Lamin A/C and Lamin B2 was performed in a diploid colorectal cancer cell line - DLD1 with an aim to identify transcription deregulation across the genome.

DESIGN
To elucidate transcription changes upon Lamin A/C and Lamin B2 depletion, siRNA mediated knockdown was performed in three biological replicates at a concentration of 100nM and for a duration of 48 hours.
