TITLE
IL-31 regulation of transcripts in skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Interleukin-31 (IL-31), a T cells derived cytokine which is mainly produced by CD4+ T cells skewed towards Th2 phenotypes. It signals via a heterodimeric receptors composed of IL-31RA and OSMR that is expressed constitutively in epithelial cells and keratinocytes. IL-31 is shown to play a pathogenic role in allergic and inflammatory diseases. Transgenic mice overexpressing IL-31 have a phenotype similar to atopic dermatitis.  Here, we studied the role of IL-31 in skin damage by intradermal administration of recombinant IL-31. Notably, IL-31 was sufficient to increase epidermal basal cell proliferation and thickening of the epidermal layer of skin in mice. Analysis of skin transcriptome indicates a significant increase in the transcripts involved in epidermal cell proliferation and pathological skin remodeling. Thus, our study revealed an important role of IL-31 signaling in activating transcriptional programs involved in the pathophysiology of skin diseases.
