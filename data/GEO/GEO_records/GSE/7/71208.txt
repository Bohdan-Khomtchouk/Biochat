TITLE
Messenger RNA profile analysis deciphers new Esrrb responsive genes in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report nuclear receptor Esrrb's responsive genes with or without Esrrb ligand DY131 in DU145 cells. Using Esrrb-null cells, we used RNA-Seq to find Esrrb responsive genes. In addition, we tested DY131-driven Esrrb-dependent genes to test the ligand dependency of Esrrb in regulating gene expression.

DESIGN
Control vector transfected cells with vehicle treatment, Esrrb expression vector transfected cell with vehicle treatment, control vector transfected cells with DY131 treatment, Esrrb expression vector transfected cell with DY131 treatment.
