TITLE
Impact of tRNA-Glu(UUC) and tRNA-Arg(CCG) on mRNA stability

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stable expression of tRNA-Glu(UUC) and tRNA-Arg(CCG) followed by whole-genome transcript stability measurements using a-amanitin mediated inhibition of RNA Pol II.

DESIGN
Transfer RNA loci chr1.trna5 (Glu-TTC) and chr16.trna1 (Arg-CCG) were stably over-expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells were treated with a-amanitin (10ug/mL)  and samples were collected at 0- and 9-nr. The RNA samples were then profiled.
