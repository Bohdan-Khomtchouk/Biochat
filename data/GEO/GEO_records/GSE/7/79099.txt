TITLE
Inactivation of Oncogenic cAMP-specific Phosphodiesterase 4D by miR-139-5p in Response to p53 Activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of microRNA expression level changes in human colon cancer cell lines in response to p53 activation by Inauhzin (INZ), and identification of novel p53 target microRNAs.

DESIGN
HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53-/- cells were treated with DMSO or 4μM INZ and harvested at 18 hours post treatment. Cells were then homogenized in TriZol reagents. Duplicates were included for each sample. Total RNA was extracted by following the manufacturer’s standard instructions (Invitrogen).
