TITLE
Role of Sirt1 in cardiomyocytes in the development of caloric restriction-induced cardioprotection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptional profiling in murine hearts obtained from the control mice fed ad libitium (AL) and treated with caloric restriction (CR). Comparison of transcriptional profiling in murine hearts obtained from cardiomyocye-specific Sirt1 knockout mice fed ad libitium and treated with caloric restriction.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiments, AL vs.CR and the control vs. cardiomyocyte-specific Sirt1 knockout mouse. A pair of murine heart samples per array.
