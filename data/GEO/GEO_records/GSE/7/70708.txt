TITLE
Regulatory T cell modulation by CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide chromatin H3K27ac, H3K18ac and H3K4me3 occupancy changes in response to CBP inhibitor treatment in Treg cells using ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq).

DESIGN
Expression profiling by ChIP-seq of Treg cells treated with DMSO or CBP inhibitor
