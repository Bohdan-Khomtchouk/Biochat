TITLE
Identify gene expression signatures in the niche cells (CD45 negative) during proliferation of Hematopoietic stem cells (LSK)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further identify gene expression signatures in the niche cells (CD45 negative) during proliferation of Hematopoietic stem cells (LSK), we employed mice whole genome (60K) microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify the up-regulated and down-regulated genes of the niche.

DESIGN
[Samples A-D] In this experiment a physiological stress model was created where the recipient mice were subjected to sub lethal radiation (700 CGy) following a transplantation of 30,000 LSK cells (HSCs). Bone marrow cells were isolated on day 0 (before transplantation) and day 10 (post transplantation of 30,000 LSK cells when maximum proliferation of HSCs was observed). Donor HSCs was sorted by FACS following RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis followed by single color global gene expression analysis.
