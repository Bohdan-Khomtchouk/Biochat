Keratin-dependent TSLP expression suggests a link between skin blistering and atopic disease

SUMMARY
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a pruritic and inflammatory disorder characterized by elevated levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Pruritus is prevalent in epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Currently, epidermal barrier disruption is known to trigger TSLP upregulation, however, mechanisms controlling TSLP expression remain incompletely understood. Tslp levels were highly upregulated in the epidermis and in the serum of keratin-deficient mice. Cultured keratinocytes either lacking keratins or expressing the dominant K14p.Arg131Pro show highly increased TSLP. Re-expression of wild-type K14 normalized TSLP levels. We demonstrate that keratins regulate Tslp expression in parts through MEK1/2 activation. The finding that 8 out of 17 EBS patients show elevated TSLP serum levels supports a major role of keratins in TSLP regulation. Our data identify a novel, keratin-dependent and cell-intrinsic regulation of Tslp. Elevated TSLP levels likely explain the high prevalence of pruritus in EBS and additional forms of EB, suggesting TSLP as novel biomarker for pruritus in EB. MEK1/2, in addition to calcineurin inhibitors, might be suitable drugs to treat itch in EB.

DESIGN
Investigation was carried out using Keratin deficient keratinocytes isolated from typeI keratin mice.
