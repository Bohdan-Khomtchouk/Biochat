TITLE
Revealing suspension adapation of CHO cell in serum free media

ORGANISM
Cricetulus griseus

SUMMARY
Purpose : We performed strand-specific RNA-seq analysis of CHO cells according to adaptation trajectory to identify the specific genes responded to the suspension adaptation. Result : Cell growth, replication, and nucleotide metabolism categories were enriched in up regulated clusters whereas cellular community category which contains focal adhesion related genes were enriched in down regulated clusters

DESIGN
CHO-K1 mRNA profiles during suspension adaptation generated by RNA sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina MiSeq.
