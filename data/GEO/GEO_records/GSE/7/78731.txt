TITLE
mRNA microarray in MCAo rat model with IV-hUMSC

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To evaluate the change of gene expression at cerebral infarction by the treatment of IV-human umblical cord derived mesenchymal stem cell. RNA was isolated from the ipsilateral hemisphere to MCAo in rats. At 72 h post-MCAo, the ipsilateral hemisphere subjected to MCAo was used for mRNA microarray. RNA was isolated from the ipsilateral hemisphere to MCAo in rats without MCAo (control group, n=5), rats treated with 1x106 IV-hUMSC (hUMSC group, n=6) and saline (saline group, n=5) at 24h post-MCAo.

DESIGN
Gene expression of Rat brain tissue at 72 hours post-MCAo was measured. N: Control=5, Saline group=5, IV-hUMSC=6.
