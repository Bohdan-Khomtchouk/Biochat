Activation-induced cytidine deaminase acts as a mutator in BCR-ABL1-transformed acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells

SUMMARY
The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) encoding the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 kinase defines a subset of ALL with a particularly unfavorable prognosis. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are derived from B cell precursors in most cases and typically carry rearranged immunglobulin heavy chain (IGH) variable (V) region genes devoid of somatic mutations. Somatic hypermutation is restricted to mature germinal center B cells and depends on activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Studying AID expression in 108 cases of ALL, we detected AID mRNA in 24 of 28 Ph-positive ALLs as compared to 6 of 80 Ph-negative ALLs. Forced expression of BCR-ABL1 in Ph-negative ALL cells and inhibition of the BCR-ABL1-kinase showed that aberrant expression of AID depends on BCR-ABL1 kinase activity. Consistent with aberrant AID expression in Ph-positive ALL, IGH V region genes and BCL6 were mutated in many Ph-positive but unmutated in most Ph-negative cases. In addition, AID introduced DNA-single-strand breaks within the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2B in Ph-positive ALL cells, which was sensitive to BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibition and silencing of AID expression by RNA interference. These findings identify AID as a BCR-ABL1-induced mutator in Ph-positive ALL cells, which may be relevant with respect to the particularly unfavorable prognosis of this leukemia subset. Keywords: gene expression array-based (RNA / in situ oligonucleotide)
