TITLE
RNA-Seq of rice endosperm under high temperature

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
High temperature during the grain-filling stage causes deleterious effects on storage material accumulation and grain quality. But it is still unclear how high temperature affects storage materials accumulation. In this study, we systemically analyzed the expression pattern of rice genes under high temperture during the grain-filling stage.

DESIGN
Five days after pollination rice plants were then transferred to either a 35째C /28째C or 28째C / 22째C artificial climate room for high temperature or control treatment. endosprem were sampled 5d after treatment.
