TITLE
Serine and SAM responsive complex SESAME regulates histone modification crosstalk by sensing cellular metabolism

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report the genome-wide localization of SESAME and found that three SESAME subunits localized in the gene body.

DESIGN
Examining the genome-wide localization of SESAME subunits (Sam1, Ser33, Pyk1) and Set1
