TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of pediatric-type follicular lymphoma reveals a low genetic complexity and recurrent alterations of TNFRSF14 gene

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pediatric-type follicular lymphoma (PTFL) is a variant of FL with distinctive clinico-pathological features. Patients are predominantly young males presenting with localized lymphadenopathy; the tumor shows high grade cytology and lacks both BCL2 expression and t(14;18) translocation. The genetic alterations involved in the pathogenesis of PTFL are not known.

DESIGN
The aim of this study was to perform a complete genetic characterization of PTFL. Forty-two cases (40 males and 2 females; mean age: 16 years, range 5-31) with consensus diagnosis were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, copy number (CN) array and targeted sequencing analyses of genes associated with FL pathogenesis
