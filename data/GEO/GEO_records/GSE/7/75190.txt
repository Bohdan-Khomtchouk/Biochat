TITLE
Mechanisms for the Generation of Two Quadruplications Associated with Split-Hand Malformation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe an 18-month-old male (BAB7221)with split-hand malformation.  Custom high-density array and digital droplet PCR revealed the copy-number gains were actually quadruplications in the mother (BAB7219), the fetus (BAB7218) and her later born son (BAB7221). This quadruplication-normal-quadruplication pattern was shown to be expanded from the triplication-normal-triplication CNV at the same loci in the maternal grandmother (BAB8247).

DESIGN
High density custom aCGH detecting all 6 individuals in the family
