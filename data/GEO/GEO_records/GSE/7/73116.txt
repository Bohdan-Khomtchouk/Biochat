TITLE
Detecting metastatic tumors after γ-irradiation using longitudinal molecular imaging and gene expression profiling of metastatic tumor nodules

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis in the mouse metastatic tumor after ɣ-irradiation(ɣ-IR): non-irradiated primary tumor vs. radiated primary tumor vs. metastatic tumor after ɣ-irradiation Metastatic tumors in C6-L (rat glioma cells ) xenografted mice were studied after local treatment with fractionated γ-IR. To accurately detect the metastatic nodules after γ-IR, we observed the effect of γ-IR on distant metastatic tumor growth. Metastatic nodules after γ-IR indicated extensive colonization of C6-L cells in the lungs within 6 weeks after γ-IR. Identified and described the molecular events occurring after γ-IR through gene expression profiling to elucidate genetic changes (differentially expressed genes between the γ-IR primary tumors vs. non-γ-IR primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules vs. γ-IR primary tumors).

DESIGN
We investigated the change of gene expression profile in the γ-IR primary tumors vs. non-γ-IR primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules vs. γ-IR primary tumors in rat glioma (C6-L cell) xenograft model.
