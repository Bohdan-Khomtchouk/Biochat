TITLE
Expression data (micro-array, frozen tumors) from various sarcomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We validated the technological and material transfers of the CINSARC signature.

DESIGN
We performed both microarray and RNA-seq analysis and compared prognostic values based on the CINSARC classification. We measure significant metastasis-free survivals with both approaches. Additionally, depending on RNA degradation, transcriptomic analysis from FFPE blocks show similar CINSARC classification.
