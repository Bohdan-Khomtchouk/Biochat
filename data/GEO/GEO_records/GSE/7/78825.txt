TITLE
JAK inhibitor has the amelioration effect in lupus-prone mice: the involvement of IFN signature gene downregulation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We previously reported that JAK/STAT pathway-mediated regulation of IRF-related genes may have an important role in the disease activity of SLE through analyzing the difference of gene expression in peripheral blood CD3+ T cells obtained from SLE patients.  Recently pan-JAK inhibitor (JAKi) tofacitinib (TOFA) were developed and successfully applied to patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Therefore, the application possibility of TOFA was investigated for the new therapeutic strategy of SLE. Anti-dsDNA antibody and proteinuria were decreased and glomerulo/interstitial nephritis were ameliorated in any TOFA administered SLE mice.  In splenic CD4+ T cell analysis, na√Øve cells significantly increased and effector/memory cells decreased.  TOFA with dexamethasone (DEXA) therapy showed tendency to indicate stronger inhibitory effect comparing with TOFA or DEXA monotherapy.  The gene expression of Ifit3/IFIT3 that related with anti-viral IFN signaling pathway was significantly suppressed in both CD4+ from SLE mice and CD3+ T cells from SLE patients after treatment. Both TOFA monotherapy and dual therapy with DEXA could suppress nephritis and modify immunological function in SLE mice with different genetic background.  IFN signaling pathway was supposed to be important for the functional mechanism of TOFA to improve the disease condition.  TOFA may contribute to the development of a new therapeutic strategy for SLE.

DESIGN
The gene expression analysis was compared among tofacitinib, tofacitinib+dexamethsone, dexamethsone and non-treated control groups and extracted TOFA specific decreased genes in NZBWF1 mice.
