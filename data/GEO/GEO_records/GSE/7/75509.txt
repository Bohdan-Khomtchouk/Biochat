TITLE
IBMCP JLeon lab NO-exposed (15, 30 and 60 min after pulse of 300 ppm NO during 5 min) wt Col-0 versus untreated wt Col -0

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Compared analysis of the transcriptomes of 12-day old seedlings from wild type  Col-0 treated with NO for 15, 30 and 60 min vs untreated control seedlings. Samples were harvested 12 h after dawn of day 12 after sowing and seedlings were grown under long days (16 h light / 8 h darkness) photoperiodic conditions.

DESIGN
12 distributed as 3 independent biological replicates of untreated, NO-treated 15 min, NO-treated 30 min and NO-treated 60 min.
