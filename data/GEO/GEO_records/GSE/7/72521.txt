TITLE
Regulation of Lin28b and let-7 in developmental myelopoiesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We isolated RNA from sorted common myeloid progenitor cells from wild-type fetal liver, wild-type adult bone marrow, transgenic Lin28b bone marrow, let-7b/c knock-out bone marrow, and Lin28b-deficient fetal liver and compared mRNA expression profiles.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA expression in common myeloid progenitors from multiple developmental time points and genotypes. Please note that iLin28* samples represent Lin28-induced samples, while the iLin28_*_vavcre samples represent hematopoietic-specific induction of Lin28.
