TITLE
ATF7 mediates lipopolysaccharide-induced epigenetic changes in macrophages involved in innate immunological memory (ChIP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Immunological memory is generally thought to be mediated exclusively by lymphocytes such as memory T and B cells. However, enhanced innate immune responses caused by a previous infection increase protection against reinfection suggesting the presence of innate immunological memory. Here, we describe 3,811 ATF7 binding sites in mouse peritoneal macrophages, and 95% of the ATF7 signals in wild-type macrophages are lost in ATF7 knockout macrophages. ATF7 suppresses a group of innate-immunity genes in macrophage by recruiting H3K9 dimethyltransferase G9a. TLR ligands induce ATF7 phosphorylation, leading to release of ATF7 from chromatin and reduction in H3K9me2 level. Partially disrupted chromatin structure and increased basal expression on target genes are maintained for a long period, increasing resistance pathogens. Therefore we speculate ATF7 is important factor in controlling innate immunological memory.

DESIGN
This series contains one set of whole genome ChIP-chip data and 2 sets of promoter array ChIP-chip data. For all sample, we use three IP .CEL files and three WCE .CEL files (they are triplicated experiments) to make one profile.
