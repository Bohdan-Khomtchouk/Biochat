TITLE
Whole genome survey of the obesity model lean congenic mice B6.C-D7Mit353

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have analyzed the differential expression between the obesity model lean congenic B6.C-D7Mit353 (1) and the background C57BL/6J strains, in four different tissues of male mice: Brain, GWAT (Gonadal White Adipose Tissue), liver and muscle (gastrocnemius). From the 32,381 mouse genes covered by the Applied Biosystems AB1700 microarray system, we identified 330 genes passing FDR at 5% and 188 genes passing FDR at 1%, in any one of the four tissues examined. None of the genes that passed FDR testing were in the congenic donor region. 65 genes from the 8 megabases congenic region were assayed; only six genes (Thrsp, Kctd14, Myo7a, Capn5, Dgat2 and Mtap6) passed statistical significance filtering but not FDR filtering.
