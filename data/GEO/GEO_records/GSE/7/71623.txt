TITLE
Expression data from mouse lung epithelial cells and non-epithelial cells during Pneumococcal pneumonia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A growing body of evidence suggests that epithelial cells have special roles during pneumonia. The purpose of this study was to elucidate epithelial-specific responses during lung infection. Mice received intratracheal instillations of Streptococcus pneumoniae (10^6 CFU) into the left lung. 15 hours after the challenge, left lungs were collected. Single cell supensions were generated and sorted into 2 separate populations, epithelial cells (CD45-EpCAM+) and others (all non-epithelial cells). Epithelial cells from uninfected mice were also collected.

DESIGN
RNA from 3 separate groups of mice (3 mice per group) was analyzed: 1) Epithelial cells from pneumonic mice; 2) Epithelial cells from uninfected mice; and 3) Non-epithelial cells from pneumonic mice.
