TITLE
Gene expression analysis in NB adherent primary cell lines after endothelin-1 treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We cultured adherent primary cell lines from NB tumor samples. Adherent primary cell lines from NB tumor samples have a subpopulation of neural crest progenitors that grow as spheres when cultured in low-binding conditions.

DESIGN
We tested the changes in gene expression induced by endothelin-1 (ET1), a cytokine that regulates proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival of NC cells .
