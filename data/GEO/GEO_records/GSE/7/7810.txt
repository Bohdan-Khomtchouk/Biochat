TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression  WT and Nrf2-/- mice Type II cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that gene expression in the Type II cells of Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice are divergent thus contributing the cell growth. More specifically, type II cells from Nrf2-/- mice have increased reactive oxygen species that cause the impaired cell growth.  In order to test these hypotheses at the gene expression level, we utilized microarray analysis to examine transcriptional differences between Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- cells. Keywords: comparative expression profiling
