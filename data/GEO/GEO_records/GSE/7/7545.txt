Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array data from breast tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fifty-one breast tumors were profiled for copy-number alterations with the high-resolution Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array. Combined analysis of the prevalence and amplitude of copy-number alterations defined regions of recurrent gain or loss. Gains were most frequently observed on chromosomes 1, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 20. Losses were most frequent on chromosomes 3, 6, 11, 13, 14, 16, and 17. Compared with previous lower-resolution data, our analysis provided significantly more precise boundaries for frequently altered regions, greatly reducing the number of potential alteration-driving genes.
