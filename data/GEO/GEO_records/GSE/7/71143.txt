TITLE
Murine Primary Thymocytes: RadioAdaptive Response (RAR) vs Control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse primary thymocytes from males and females comparing radioadapted cells with either control untreated cells, high dose irradiated cells or low dose irradiatiated cells with ES cells tr. Goal was to determine the effects of sex differences associated to RAR on global thymocyte gene expression.

DESIGN
Three experimental conditions; Two-condition experiment for each condition, RAR vs Control, RAR vs High dose irradiation, RAR vs Low dose irradiation
