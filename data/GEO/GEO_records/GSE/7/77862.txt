TITLE
RNA-seq data from livers of 6 month old Akt1F/F;Akt2-/- versus Akt1F/F;Akt2-/-;Alb-Cre mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Finding diffrential gene expression gene expression in the livers of male mice after the deletion  of Akt1 in th eliver of Akt2-/- mice.

DESIGN
mRNA was isolated from 4 indivdual livers of each group of mice of the same genotype. mRNAs from each group was pooled to generate 1 sample per each group. The 2 samples were used to generate cDNA libraries for RNA-seq.
