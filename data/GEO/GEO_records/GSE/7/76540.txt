TITLE
Expression data from MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chemoresistance in breast cancer has been a great interest in past studies, however, the development of rational therapeutic strategies targeting chemoresistant cells is still a challenge for clinical oncology.The resistant property of MCF7/ADR cells was confirmed by long term culture with Dox, cell viability, and PARP cleavage assays. Microarray analysis was performed to compare the global differences of gene expression between MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells.

DESIGN
MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR gene expression profiles were analyzed. Total RNA were prepared for analysis with Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 arrays according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
