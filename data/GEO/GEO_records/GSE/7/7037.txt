TITLE
Control cDNA microarray profiles of Drosophila head

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In the process of developing a biological systems model of kindling-like plasticity in the fruit fly, we performed a control gene expression profiling analysis in which RNA isolated from different pools of heads of wild-type flies grown on normal food (NF) were compared between themselves using cDNA microarrays. Significance analysis of microarray (SAM) did not reveal any gene as differentially expressed below a false discovery rate (FDR) of 96.88%. Keywords: comparative
