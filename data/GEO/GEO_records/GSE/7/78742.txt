TITLE
Expression data from Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell SUNE1

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
To investigate the effect of FOXO1 on miRNAs in Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, we used miRNA chip on SUNE1 cells after FOXO1 overexpression. This analysis identified 82 miRNAs which were markedly dysregulated in FOXO1 overexpressing cells.
