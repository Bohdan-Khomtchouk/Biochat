TITLE
Effects of Oct1 inhibition  in AR signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and AR downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. Oct1 is an AR interacting partner and regulates the transcriptional activity of AR. In order to investigate the Oct1 function in prostate cancer cells, we performed gene expression in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines after siOct1 or pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide targeting Oct1-binding treatment. We also treated cells with vehicle or androgen to analyze the effects of Oct1 on AR function.

DESIGN
Observation of androgen dependent gene expression changes after treatment with siOct1 or polyamide targeting Oct1 with microarray.
