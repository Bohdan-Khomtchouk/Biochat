TITLE
Expression data from mouse brain tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were performed to assess changes in gene expression following treatment of aged mice with human plasma from donors of different ages (young=19-24 years; old=61-82 years).

DESIGN
Aged mice treated with different groups of human plasma were sacrificed following 6 intravenous injections, and hippocampi were dissected from brain tissue for analysis by whole genome microarray.
