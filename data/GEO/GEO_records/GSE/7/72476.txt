TITLE
Epigenome screening for genes regulated by retinoblastoma-binding protein 4 (RBBP4) in glioblastoma (GBM) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that RBBP4 has dual effect on gene regulation, whereby some genes are downregulated (~60%) while others are activated (~40%).

DESIGN
Examination of chromatin landscape of H3K9Ac in T98G cells expressing control NTshRNA compared with RBBP4 shRNA.
