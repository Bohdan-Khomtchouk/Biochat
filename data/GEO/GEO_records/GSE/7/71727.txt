TITLE
Fibroblast transcription pattern in Salmonella infected Vs uninfected cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human fibroblasts were infected with GFP-expressing Salmonella enterica serovar Typmimurium and further separated by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting. RNA from infected and uninfected cells sub-populations were used for genome-wide expression studies

DESIGN
3 independent experiments enabled us to obtain 3 infected and 3 uninfected sub-populations.
