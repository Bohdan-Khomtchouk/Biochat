TITLE
Expression data from SSG1 long-lived mutant

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
The SSG1-1 mutation was an allele of the YHR032W gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The SSG1-1 mutants contained higher levels of AdoMet than wild type (WT). SSG1-1 single mutants were shown to have a long lifespan, suggesting that the Ssg1-1 protein might have a role in longevity. We used microarrays to compare the global gene expression profiles between the wild type and SSG1-1 mutants under normal growth condition.
