TITLE
Differential DNA methylation profiles in estrogen-pre-exposed breast epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study tried to determine whether exposure of breast stem/progenitor cells to estrogen disrupts the epigenome of progeny epithelial cells.  DNA methylation profiles were compared between control and pre-exposed epithelial cells using a genome-wide detection method called MeDIP-chip. Keywords: MeDIP-chip
