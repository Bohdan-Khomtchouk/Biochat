TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of male rat fed either Lard based or Corn Oil based high fat diet and their female offspring

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Sperm cells from Sprague Dawley male rats fed different high fat diets (lard or corn oil based) and their 50-days-old female offspring mammary gland were used to perfom this array

DESIGN
qPCR miRNA expression profiling. Sperm cells and mammary gland cells were harvested from male rats and their female offspring respectivly, as indicated in the summary. Equal amount total RNA from each animal was pooled prior to miRNA expression analysis.
