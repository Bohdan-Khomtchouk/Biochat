Long oligonucleotide arrays verse short oligonucleotide arrays-CTX066

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Both in situ synthesized long oligo arrays from Agilent Technologies and short oligo arrays from Affymetrix were used to meausre differential gene expression in RNA samples generated from human neural stem cells treated with vehicle (EtOH, 0.01%) and tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ, 20ÂµM) for 24h. For Affymetrix technology, RNAs from vehicle or tBHQ treated groups were analyzed separately. There are three replicates (GSM 11755, 11756, 11780, 11781, 11782, and 11783) which represent the RNA preps harvested at three different time (Jan 16, 2002, Jan 24, 2002, and Feb 20, 2002). For Agilent arrays, amplified cRNAs generated from vehicle or tBHQ treated groups were labeled with cy3 or cy5 and were competitively hybridized with Hu 1A oligo arrays. The same RNA preps used for Affymetrix array analysis were also used for Agilent array analysis. Finally, three replicates (GSM 11803, 11804 and 11809) were generated. Keywords: parallel sample
