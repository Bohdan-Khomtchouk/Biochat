TITLE
Medial prefrontal cortex transcriptome changes in germ-free mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 12 samples extracted from mouse prefrontal cortex tissue to generate the first prefrontal cortex-specific murine transcriptome for germ-free mice (GF), conventionally raised controls (CON) and germ-free mice that have been colonized with normal microbiota from postnatal day  21 (exGF).

DESIGN
Equal amounts of RNA from two to three animals were pooled to yield 4 samples per group (CON, GF, and exGF). Pairwise comparisons for CONvsGF, CONvsexGF, GFvsexGF were performed using DESeq2.
