TITLE
Expression data of squamous cervical carcinoma after chemotherapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The patients with locally advanced squamous cervical cancer (SCC) were examined in this study.  All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical hysterectomy. Tumor response against NAC was determined based on RECIST criterior. Gene-expression profiles of SCC were determined using Human Genome GeneChip arrays U133.

DESIGN
SCC patients who had undergone radical hysterectomy after NAC were studied. To identify molecular signatures to predict response to NAC using Irinotecan/Nedaplatin, gene expression profiles were compared between NAC Reponder and Non-responder.
