TITLE
Transcriptomic responses of the liver and adipose tissues to altered carbohydrate-fat ratio in diet: An isoenergetic study in young rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the effects of altered dietary carbohydrate and fat balance on liver and adipose tissue transcriptomes, 3-week-old rats were fed three kind of diets: low, moderate and high fat diets (L, M and H) containing a different ratio of carbohydrate:fat (C:F) (65:15, 60:20 and 35:45 in energy percent, respectively).

DESIGN
Rats consumed the diets for 9 weeks, and were subjected to biochemical and DNA -microarray analyses.
