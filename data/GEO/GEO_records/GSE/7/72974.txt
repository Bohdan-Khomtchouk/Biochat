TITLE
Gene expression analysis reveals the concurrent activation of pro-apoptotic and antioxidant-defensive mechanisms in Flavokawain B and FIH-treated cervical cancer HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the difference in gene expression of HeLa cells after 48 hours of treatment with 7 µg/mL FKB and 15 µg/mL FIH after 48 hours

DESIGN
3 sets of sample were prepared; the untreated HeLa cells, 7 µg/mL FKB-treated HeLa cells after 48 hours, 15 µg/mL of FIH-treated HeLa cells after 48 hours
