TITLE
CGH: Transgenic soybeans and controls

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Transgenic soybean lines were compared to their parental lines by CGH to catalog structurally variant (e.g. deletion and duplication) regions among these genotypes. The CGH comparisons reveal reveal putative deletions and duplications among the 5 lines.

DESIGN
Transgenic soybean lines were compared to their parent lines ('Bert-MN-01' or 'Wm82-ISU-01', depending on the transgenic plant). Each transgenic line was represented by a single individual T1 generation plant. The reported values show the log2 ratio of the normalized transgenic line hybridization signals (Cy3) over the normalized parent line hybridization signal (Cy5).
