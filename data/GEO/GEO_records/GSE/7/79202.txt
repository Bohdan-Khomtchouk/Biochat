TITLE
Regulatory consequences of SOX4 knock-down in MDA-LM2 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of SOX4 knock-down MDA-LM2 cell line resulted in down-regulation of its transcriptional target gene, TMEM2.

DESIGN
Two independent siRNAs were used to knock down SOX4 in metastatic MDA-LM2 cells. The cells were then subjected to transcripome profiling in comparison to control siRNA-transfected cells.
