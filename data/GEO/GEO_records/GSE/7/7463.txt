Expression data from 43 Ovarian tumors

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of malignant carcinomas surgically removed from ovarian cancer patients pre-treated with chemotherapy (neo-adjuvant) prior to surgery group into two distinct clusters. One group clusters with carcinomas from patients not pre-treated with chemotherapy prior to surgery (C-L) while the other clusters with non-malignant adenomas (A-L). Although the C-L cluster is preferentially associated with p53 loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, the C-L cluster cancer patients display a more favorable clinical response to chemotherapy as evidenced by enhanced long-term survivorships. Keywords: Patient Tumor Samples
