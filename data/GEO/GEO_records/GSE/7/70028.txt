TITLE
MLX transcriptional regulation in muscle cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study set out to identify MLX transcriptional targets in muscle cells. C2C12 Myoblasts were virally transduced to increase MLX activity, by overexpression of the wild-type protein; and to decrease MLX activity by overexpression of a dominant negative MLX protein and by shRNA induced knockdown of MLX. Transcripts that were significantly and consistently regulated by the different modes of MLX modulation were identified. The largest proportion of these were genes encoding secreted proteins including growth factors, cytokines and extracellular proteins. We therefore conclude that MLX can regulate myokine transcripts.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from C2C12 muscle cells with increased and decreased MLX activity were examined.
