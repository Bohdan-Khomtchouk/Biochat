TITLE
Comprehensive Microarray Transcriptome Profiling of CD34-Enriched Mouse Keratinocyte Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent developments in animal models (Morris et al., 2004; Tumbar et al., 2004) as well as the discovery of cell surface markers (Jones and Watt, 1993; Tani et al., 2000; Trempus et al., 2003; Nijhof et al., 2006) have made it possible to isolate living epidermal hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) from mouse skin, facilitating the study of the biological and molecular features inherent to HFSCs.  A complexity of stem and progenitor cell populations within the hair follicle has been revealed. Here, we report comprehensive profiling of mouse CD34-expressing HFSCs using the Agilent mouse oligo microarray platform in order to extend and enrich the existing HFSC databases. Keywords: gene expression, cell characterization
