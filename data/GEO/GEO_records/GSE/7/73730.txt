TITLE
Expression data from differentiating primary culture of equine satellite cells (ESC) incubated with gamma-oryzanol (GO)

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of gamma-oryzanol-treated (24h) differentiating equine satellite cells (3rd day of differentiation) compared to control GO-untreated cells. Goal was to determine the effects of gamma-oryzanol influence on gene expression in equine satellite cells during in vitro myogenesis

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, GO-treated (24h) differentiating equine satellite cells (3rd day of differentiation) vs. differentiating equine satellite cells without GO treatment (control). Biological replicates: 4 reps of examined condition (Cy5), 4 control replicates (Cy3)
