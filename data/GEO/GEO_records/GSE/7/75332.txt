TITLE
Aggf1 regulates the activation of hepatic stellate cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Digital gene expression profiling was used to invesigate the differetiated genes between primary mouse hepatic stellate cells infected with AGGF1 adenovirus particles or negative control adenovirus pairticles.

DESIGN
Primary hepatic stellate cells isolated from mice were cultured in vitro, infected with AGGF1 adenovirus particles or negative control adenovirus particles, at day 8, total RNA were prepared and used for digital gene expression tag profiling.
