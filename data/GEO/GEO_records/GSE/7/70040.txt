TITLE
Whole-transcriptome analysis of Staphylococcus aureus under laboratory and infection-mimicking conditions

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus NCTC 8325

SUMMARY
We report the condition-dependent transcriptome of S. aureus HG001, a derivative of strain NCTC 8325, by strand-specific tiling array hybridizations. More than 40 experimental conditions were investigated ranging from optimal in vitro growth to interaction with host cells. Analyses included the systematic mapping of transcription units, annotation of non-coding RNAs, the classification of promoters according to their dependency on SigA and SigB, and the prediction of potentially new transcription factor target sites. Antisense RNAs being of particular interest because of the small number of alternative sigma factors used by S. aureus were found to be relatively rare, overlapping only 6% of the annotated coding genes.
