TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of miRNA in mouse peritoneal macrophages upon miR-33 or miR-33* modulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse peritoneal macrophages were transfected with 80-120 nM miRIDIAN miRNA mimics (miR-mimic-33/miR-mimic-33*) or with 80-120 nM miRIDIAN miRNA inhibitors (anti-miR-33 ASO/anti-miR-33*ASO) Control samples were treated with an equal concentration of a non-targeting control mimics sequence (control mimic) or inhibitor negative control sequence (control aso), to control for non-specific effects in miRNA experiments.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  Peritoneal macrophages from 2-4 donors were used and treated separately as indicated in the summary. Equal amount total RNA from each donor was pooled prior to gene expression analysis.
