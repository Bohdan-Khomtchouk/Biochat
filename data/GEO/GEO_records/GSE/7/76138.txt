TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Regulatory T-cells isolated from adult skin and skin draining lymph nodes (SDLNs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study were to identify preferential gene expression signatures that are unique to telogen skin resident Tregs relative to peripheral Tregs Methods: Tregs from telogen skin and SDLNs were purified by cell sorting (using the Treg GFP reporter mouse line Foxp3-DTR/GFP) to generate mRNA transcription profiles. Results: Transcriptional profiling revealed a unique Skin treg signature relative to SDLN Tregs Conclusion: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of the skin Treg transcriptome.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of skin and SDLN Tregs isolated from 6 week old Foxp3-DTR/GFP mice.
