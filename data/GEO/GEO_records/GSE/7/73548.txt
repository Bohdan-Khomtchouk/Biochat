TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for SOX2 overexpressing human dental pulp stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As a key factor for cell pluripotent and self-renewing phenotypes, SOX2 has attracted scientists’ attention gradually in recent years. However, its exact effects in dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are still unclear. In this study, we mainly investigated whether SOX2 could affect some biological functions of DPSCs.

DESIGN
DPSCs were isolated from the dental pulp of human impacted third molar. SOX2 overexpressing DPSCs (DPSCs-SOX2) were established through retroviral infection. Whole genome expression of DPSCs-SOX2 was analyzed with RNA microarray.
