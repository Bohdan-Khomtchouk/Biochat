TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of FHS1-dependent genes in Fusarium graminearum Z-3639

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) is a prominent pathogen that infects major cereal crops, such as wheat, barley, and maize. Fhs1 contains a Zn(II)2Cys6 fungal-type DNA-binding domain and localized to nuclei , suggesting that Fhs1 is a transcription factor required for hydroxiurea.

DESIGN
6 samples examined: 24 h after inoculation of Fusarium graminearum wild-type Z-3639 and fhs1 (Î”fhs1::GEN) strains in complete media
