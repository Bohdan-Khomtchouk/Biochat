TITLE
RNA-Seq data for KRAS wild-type(WT) and two mutant forms G12V and Q61H over-expressed samples with green fluorescent protein control samples using human mammary epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal was to capture the transcriptional activity due to over-expression of KRAS gene. Over-expressions were validated using Western Blots. Illumina RNA-Seq technology was used to capture the downstream transcriptional activity. Reads were 101 base pairs long and single ended. An R open source package “Rsubread” was used to align and quantify the read using UCSC hg19 annotation. The integer-based gene counts were later normalized in TPM .

DESIGN
Profiles of gene expression were generated in cells derived from breast and used to generate a gene-expression signatures.
