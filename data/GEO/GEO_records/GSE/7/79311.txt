TITLE
Expression data of cultured bovine granulosa cells plated at different initial cell densities

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In previous studies it has been shown that bovine granulosa cells (GC) cultured at a high plating density dramatically change their physiological and molecular characteristics, thus resembling an early stage of luteinization. During the present study, these specific effects on the GC transcriptome were comprehensively analysed of the same cell culture model comparing GC cultured at normal and high density.

DESIGN
Granulosa cells cultured at different plating densities (normal and high; 3 replicates each) were used and processed for microarray analysis
