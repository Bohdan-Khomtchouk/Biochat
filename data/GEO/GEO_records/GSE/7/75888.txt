TITLE
Expression data for iPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) treated with 100 ÂµM pazopanib for 24 hours

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pazopanib is a drug with idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity risk. Analysis of gene expression changes after exposing hepatocytes can indicate effects on specific biological pathways and  potential mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. HLCs derived from patient-specific iPSCs were treated with pazopanib to identify both drug-related global effects and patient-specific effects

DESIGN
HLCs (200,000) differentiated from iPSCs from HT1, HT2 and HT3 (patients with clinical hepatotoxicity) and NHT1 and NHT2 (patients without clinical hepatotoxity) were each treated with pazopanib or DMSO for 24 hours. RNA was isolated. Primary analysis was differential gene expression analysis for each sample compared to vehicle control. Secondary analysis compared HT to  NHT samples, after data normalization to respective controls. Gene set enrichment analysis to measure enrichment of custom gene sets in pazopanib treatment and and to identify differential enrichment of gene sets between HT and NHT cases.
