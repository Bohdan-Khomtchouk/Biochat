TITLE
Gene expression profiling of sciatic nerves from Zeb2cKO and control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression pofiling of Zeb2cKO and control sciatic nerves and identified significantly changed genes ZEB2 is also known as SIP1

DESIGN
4 RNA-Seq samples from P7 sciatic nerves of Ctrl and Zeb2 cKO mice (duplicatess, Ctrl and cKO)
