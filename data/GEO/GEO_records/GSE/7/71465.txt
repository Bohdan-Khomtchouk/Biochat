TITLE
Clostridium thermocellum DSM 1313 Transcriptional Responses to Redox Perturbation

ORGANISM
Ruminiclostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405

SUMMARY
Clostridium thermocellum is a promising CBP candidate organism capable of directly converting lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol.  Low yields, productivities and growth inhibition prevent industrial deployment of this organism for commodity fuel production.  Symptoms of potential redox imbalance such as incomplete substrate utilization, and fermentation products characteristic of overflow metabolism, have been observed during growth.  This perceived redox imbalance may be in part responsible for the mentioned bioproductivity limitations.  Toward better understanding the redox metabolism of C. thermocellum, we analyzed gene expression, using microarrays, during addition of two stress chemicals (methyl viologen and hydrogen peroxide) which we observed to change fermentation redox potential.
