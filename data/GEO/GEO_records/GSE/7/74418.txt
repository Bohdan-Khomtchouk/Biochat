TITLE
Gene expression profiles of prostate cancer cell line with or without HDAC inihbitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inibitors suppress cell proliferation of prostate cancer, but the detailed mechanisms are unknown. Moreover, HDAC includes 18 family members, namely HDAC1-11 and SIRT1-7, and differences of effects on prostate cancer proliferation among these enzymes are also unknown. Thus, we clarified differences of gene expression between prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) treated with pan-HDAC inhibitors (TSA and OBP-801) or selective HDAC inhibitor (NCC-149, HDAC8-specific inhibitor)using cDNA microarray.

DESIGN
LNCaP treated with TSA (1μM), NCC149 (2μM), OBP-801 (200nM) or DMSO for 24hrs, RNA was extracted from cells, and cDNA array was performed.
