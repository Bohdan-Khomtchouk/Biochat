TITLE
Double-stranded microRNA mimics can induce length- and passenger strand-dependent effects in a cell type-specific manner (RNA 2015), Exp 1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experiment 1 - miR-155 and miR-199 Phenotype miR-155 and miR-199 as 23mer miRNA mimics induced a double-stranded RNA response

DESIGN
Cells were transfected with miR-155, miR-199 23 mers, negative control or nothing (empty); samples collected in triplicate
