TITLE
The miR-17~92 microRNA cluster is a global regulator of tumor metabolism

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA expression in Eμ-Myc lymphoma cells expressing or lacking miR-17~92

DESIGN
Eµ-Myc B-cell lymphomas harboring conditional alleles of miR-17~92 were cultured with or without 4-OHT to generate isogenic tumour cells with homozygous deletion of miR-17~92. Wild type (fl) and miR-17~92-deleted (del) Eµ-Myc cells were cultured for 48 hours under regular growth conditions, and RNA isolated for sequencing analysis.
