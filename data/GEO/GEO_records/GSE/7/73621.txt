TITLE
Transcriptome-wide identification of Hfq-associated RNAs in Brucella suis by deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Brucella suis 1330

SUMMARY
We report the identification of new noncoding RNAs in Brucella suis 1330 and that are associated to the chaperone protein Hfq

DESIGN
Coimmunoprecipitation using Flag-tagged Hfq as bait
