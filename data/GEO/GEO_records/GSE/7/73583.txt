TITLE
RNA-seq analyses of JMJD3c-overexpressing human embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We generated the human ES line, in which the genome-wide reduction of H3K27me3 can be induced by the ectopic expression of catalytic domain of histone demethylase JMJD3 with doxycycline treatment (JMJD3c-hESCs). The forced-demethylation of H3K27me3 triggered the upregulation of many developmental genes. Overexpression of JMJD3c mutant, which lacked catalytic activity, did not induce these changes. These results suggest that H3K27me3 demethylase activity of JMJD3 is necessary and sufficient for upregulation of developmental genes in hESCs.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analyses of JMJD3c-hESCs and JMJD3c mut-hESCs treated with or without doxycycline. The samples of JMJD3c-hESCs were collected at day 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 after doxycycline treatment. The samples of JMJD3c mut-hESCs were collected at day 4 after doxycycline treatment.
