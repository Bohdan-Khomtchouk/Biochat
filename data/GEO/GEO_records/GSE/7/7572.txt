TITLE
Temporal expression profile of primary CD8+ T cell activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the global transcriptional program underlying CD8+ T-cell activation.  Using DNA microarrays and Q-RT-PCR, we examined the transcriptional profile of human CD8+ T-cell activation.  The goal of this study was to identify genes involved in the various facets of human CD8+ T-cell activation. Keywords: time course
