TITLE
Cellular response to proteasome inhibition by Bortezomib

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the coordinated transcriptional reponse to proteasome inhibition

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of NIH3T3 cells which stably expressing DD-sfGFP were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq. The samples were collected from indicated timepoints after exposed to proteasome inhibition by Bortezomib.
