TITLE
Age and estrogen-dependent inflammation in breast adenocarcinoma and normal breast tissue [cohort_2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chronic inflammation promotes breast tumor growth and invasion by accelerating angiogenesis and tissue remodeling in the tumor microenvironment.  The relationship between inflammation and estrogen, which drives the growth of 70 percent of breast tumors, is complex. Low levels of estrogen exposure stimulate macrophages and other inflammatory cell populations, but very high levels are immune suppressive. Breast tumor incidence is increased by obesity and age, which interact to influence inflammatory cell populations in normal breast tissue. The molecular impact of these factors on tumor initiation and growth is not well-understood. We modeled the difference in gene expression between 195 breast adenocarcinomas and 195 matched adjacent normal breast tissue samples, using age, body mass index (BMI), and tumor subtype as covariates. Age and BMI were independently associated with inflammation in normal tissue but not tumors. Older patients with ER-positive disease had tumors with higher levels of Estrogen Receptor (ER) signaling compared to adjacent normal tissue and had lower relative levels of tumor macrophage expression. We developed a novel statistic to quantify the rewiring of gene co-expression networks and demonstrate that in ER-positive tumors basal gene networks are rewired even though their expression levels of these genes are not significantly different from those in adjacent normal tissue.  Patient age influences the molecular profile of ER-positive breast tumors. Our data support an immunosuppressive effect of estrogen signaling in the breast tumor microenvironment, suggesting this effect contributes to the greater presence of prognostic and therapeutically relevant immune cells in ER-negative tumors.
