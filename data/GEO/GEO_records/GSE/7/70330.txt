TITLE
ncRNA (non-coding RNA) signature in endothelial cells during hypoxia [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To define ncRNA expression in hypoxic endothelial cells, we applied pro-angiogenic hypoxia to cultured endothelial cells. Afterwards, total RNA was isolated and underwent RNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
HUVECs were subjected to normoxic or hypoxic (0.1-0.2% O2) cell culture conditions.
