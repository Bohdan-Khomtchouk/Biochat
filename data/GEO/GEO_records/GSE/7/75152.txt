TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression in Dupuytren’s disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the whole-genome expression profiles of primary tissue samples from Dupuytren patients and controls. The aim was to identify differential expressed genes in the disease tissue and to identify pathways and networks altered in Dupuytren´s disease.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from disease and control primary tissue samples. Twelve Dupuytren Samples were compared with 12 samples from age and gender matched controls for genome-wide differential expression.
