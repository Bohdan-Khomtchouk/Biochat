TITLE
Toxoplasma gondii remodels the cis-regulatory landscape of infected human host cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the host transcriptome of human fibroblasts after infection with T. gondii (Type I-RH).

DESIGN
Three bioloigcal replicates of uninfected HFFs and three biological replicates of T. gondii (Type I-RH) infected HFFs were sequenced using directional RNA-seq.
