TITLE
Effect of MLL3 deletion in mammary stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MLL3 inactivation mutations occurs frequently in human breast cancer. To understand the function of MLL3 inactivation, we compared the gene expression profiles of the vector control (WT) and Mll3-null mouse mammary stem cells generated by CRISPR. Affymetrix mouse Gene 2.0ST ships were used for microarray.

DESIGN
Mammary stem cell lines were generated by CRISPR. Total RNA was extracted from stem cells cultured as organoids and used for microarray analysis.
