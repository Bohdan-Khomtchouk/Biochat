TITLE
Expression data from SHP specific siRNA or nonspecefic siRNA transfected rat astrocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To clarify the effect of SHP in LXRs-mediated signaling pathway, we performed global gene expression analysis of SHP siRNA transfected- or control siRNA transfected- astrocytes after IFN-γ and LXRs agonist. Microarray analysis revealed that expression of several genes encoding inflammatory mediators were reversed in SHP siRNA transfected-astrocytes, when compared with control siRNA transfected-astrocytes.

DESIGN
Primary astrocytes were cultured from the cerebral cortices of 1 day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The astrocytes were transfected with control siRNA or SHP siRNA and treated with IFN-γ in the presence or absence of GW for 3 h.
