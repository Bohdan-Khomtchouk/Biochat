TITLE
Effects of residual metals contained in single-wall carbon nanotubes on cellular response in rat alveolar macrophages and human alveolar epithelial cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of the rat alveolar macrophages (NR8383) and human alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) exposure to iron-enriched pristine single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) or their purified SWCNTs were employed to gain insights at the transcriptional level.

DESIGN
Two kinds of singlewall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), CNT-1 or CNT-2 induced gene expression in rat alveolar macrophages and human alveolar epithelial cell line were measured at 24 hours exposure to doses of 0.1mg/mL. The experiments were performed using control for each experiment (n=4).
