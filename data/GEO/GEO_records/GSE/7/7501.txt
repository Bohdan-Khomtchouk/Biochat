TITLE
Genes in nonpermissive temperature-induced cell growth arrest and differentiation of astrocyte RCG-12 cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed global scale microarray analysis to identify detailed mechanisms by which nonpermissive temperature induces cell growth arrest and differentiation in astrocyte RCG-12 cells harboring temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen by using an Affymetrix GeneChip system. Astrocyte RCG-12 cells used in this study were derived from primary cultured rat cortical glia cells infecting with a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen. Although the cells grew continuously at the permissive temperature, the nonpermissive temperature led to cell growth arrest and differentiation. Of the 15,923 probe sets analyzed, nonpermissive temperature differentially expressed 556 probe sets by > 2.0-fold. Keywords: Astrocyte cell; growth arrest; differentiation; temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen; nonpermissive temperature
