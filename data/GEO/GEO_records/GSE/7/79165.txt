TITLE
The Nuclear Receptor Rev-erb alpha Regulates Adipose Tissue-Specific FGF21 Signaling (ChIP-seq, eWAT)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify the cistrome of the transcriptional repressor Rev-erb alpha in epididymal white adipose tissue. Performing Rev-erb alpha ChIP-seq on epididymal white adipose tissue from wildtype mice at 5PM when Rev-erb alpha protein level peaks in wild type (WT) mice, we were able to globally determine the genomic regions undergoing Rev-erb alpha-dependent de-repression.

DESIGN
Examination of Rev-erb alpha binding in epididymal white adipose tissue.
