TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in hypoxic and normoxic HeLa cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The purpose of experiment is to compare the mRNA expression differences between HeLa cells conditioned with normoxia 21% oxygen and hypoxia 1% oxygen at 6h and 20h.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from HeLa cells for 4 different conditions, 3 biological replicate experiments were performed, resulting in a total of 12 samples.
