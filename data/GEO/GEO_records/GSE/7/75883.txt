TITLE
Gene expression of CD11b+ and CD8+ spleen dendritic cells from NOD and B6 mice after in vivo CpG or PBS stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Spleen conventional dendritic cells from NOD mice show a lower overall response to CpG-A compared to B6 cDCs.

DESIGN
8-10 week old NOD or B6 control mice were injected with either CpG-A or PBS. 12 hours later, CD8+ and CD11b+ DCs (CD11c+) were sorted from collagenase-digested spleen cells resulting in 24 samples with each condition having 3 replicates.
