TITLE
Expresion data from yeast (wild type and gcn5 mutants) exposed to Congo Red (CR)

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We analyzed the genome-wide expression profile of the wild type strain and the gcn5 mutant (component of the SAGA complex) under basal and cell wall stress (CR during 3 hours) conditions.
