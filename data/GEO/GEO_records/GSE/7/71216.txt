TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing to identify transcription factor regulatory network and alternative splicing in endothelial cells under VEGF stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) are crucial for angiogenesis that benefits functional recovery after cerebral infarction. This study aims to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on HUVECs.

DESIGN
HUVECs were treated with 16 ng/mL VEGF165 for 4 days
