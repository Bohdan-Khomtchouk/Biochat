TITLE
Genome-wide binding profiles of Sp5 in differentiation mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have determined the genome-wide binding profile of the transcription factor Sp5. Flag-tagged Sp5 was targeted to the HPRT locus in A2Lox.cre ES cells to allow for Doxycycline inducible expression. ES cells were cultured as embryoid bodies for 2 days to prime them for germ layer differentiation. Cells were then treated with Doxycycline for 24 hrs. We found that Flag-Sp5 prefentially bound to promoters associatd with several growth factor signalling pathways, but most prominently with the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway to selectively promote mesoderm differentiation over neural. These data implicate Sp5 as new regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin target expression to promotes ES cell differentation into the mesoderm lineage.

DESIGN
Examination of Sp5 transcription factor binding in differentiating embryonic stem cells.
