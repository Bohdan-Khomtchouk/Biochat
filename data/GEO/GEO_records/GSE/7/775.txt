TITLE
Mouse model of myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This dataset is a time series (1 hour [h], 4 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 1 week [w], and 8 weeks) intended to compare normal functioning left ventricles [lv + lv2] with infarcted [ilv] and non-infarcted left ventricles [nilv]. Ilv samples are taken from the region between the LAD artery and the apex on a mouse with myocardial infarction. Lv2 samples are from the same region in a sham operated mouse. Nilv samples are taken from the region above the infartion and the left ventricle [lv] samples mimic that region in a sham mouse. The lv and lv2 samples can be compared as both are from normal functioning hearts. For more information visit Keywords: other
