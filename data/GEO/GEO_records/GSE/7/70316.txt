TITLE
localization of Scc2 between wild type and scc4-m35 cells in S-phase

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Wild-type (AM15307) and scc4-m35 (AM15311) cells carrying SCC2-3FLAG were fixed for 2 hr, 15 min following an a-factor arrest. Samples were harvested, anti-HA ChIP was performed and both input and IP samples were sequenced for both strains.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for S. cerevisiae Scc2-3FLAG in S-phase cells in Wild type and in scc4-m35 mutant Vasso Makrantoni: experiments and Alastair Kerr: ChIP Seq Data analysis
