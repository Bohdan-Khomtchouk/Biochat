TITLE
Expression data from Pseudomonas aeruginosa ∆sbrR and ∆sbrIR mutants versus wild type

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
SbrI and SbrR are an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor and its cognate anti-sigma factor, respectively. To identify the SbrIR regulon, we measured gene expression in wild type PAO1 , PAO1 ∆sbrR, and PAO1 ∆sbrIR mutants using microarrays.
