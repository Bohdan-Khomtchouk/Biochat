TITLE
Promiscuous DNA-binding of a mutant zinc finger protein corrupts the transcriptome and diminishes cell viability

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The rules of engagement between zinc finger transcription factors and DNA have been partly defined  by in vitro DNA-binding and structural studies, but less is known about how these rules apply in vivo. Here we demonstrate how a missense point mutation in the second zinc finger of Kr√ºppel-like factor-1 (KLF1) leads to degenerate DNA-binding specificity in vivo, resulting in ectopic transcription and semi-dominant neonatal anemia. We employed RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and 4sU-RNA-seq to identify the direct transcriptional consequences of aberrant DNA-binding events genome wide.

DESIGN
mRNA sequencing Klf1Nan/+ and wild type fetal liver (E14.5) identified a requirement for in vitro studies. ChIP-seq and 4sU-RNA-seq were performed on replicate immortalized cell lines transfected with tamoxifen inducible  protein fusions of KLF1-ER or Nan-KLF1-ER.
