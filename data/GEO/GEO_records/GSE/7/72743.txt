TITLE
Expression profiling of dexamethasone inducible expression of YFP-CPR5-C in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Identification of early transcriptional responses to CPR5 function loss in Arabidopsis

DESIGN
Expression of CPR5 C terminal half efficiently interferes with native CPR5 protein function and causes a dominant negative effect. Four-week-old leaves of Col-0 WT and transgenic Dex:YFP-CPR5-C plant were sprayed with water or 50 uM dexamethasone to induce expression of CPR5-C. Samples were collected at 24 hours after treatment. Three biological replicates were performed per genotype per treatment.
