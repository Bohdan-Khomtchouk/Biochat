TITLE
Identification of dysregulated genes in lymphocytes from children with Down syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to analyze global changes of gene expression in lymphocytes from children with trisomy 21 by means of the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) methodology. Comparison between DS and normal profiles revealed that most of the transcripts were expressed at similar levels. Among the 242 significantly differentially expressed SAGE tags, many of them corresponded to genes involved in transcription, RNA processing, signaling, immune response and lipid metabolism. Our results indicate that trisomy 21 induces a modest dysregulation of disomic genes that may be related to the immunological perturbations seen in DS. Keywords: SAGE analysis in normal and Down syndrome lymphocytes
