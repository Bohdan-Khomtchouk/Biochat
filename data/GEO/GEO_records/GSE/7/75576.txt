TITLE
Effect of loss of Jmjd1c on MLL-AF9 leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profile of MLL-AF9 leukemia cells 6 days after loss of Jmjd1c. Loss of Jmjd1c induces differentiation and apoptosis in MLL-AF9 leukemia cells. These results provide insight into the role of Jmjd1c in MLL leukemia.

DESIGN
We used primary Jmjd1c f/f MLL-AF9-GFP leukemia cells from four leukemic mice and delivered Cre-Tomato by retroviral infection. Cells infected with virus made from empty vector was used as control. We sorted GFP and Tomato double positive cells 6 days after Cre infection and subjected the samples to RNA-seq.
