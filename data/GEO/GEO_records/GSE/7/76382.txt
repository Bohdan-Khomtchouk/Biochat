TITLE
Whole genome bisulfite sequencing of ros1-1 mutant and C24 wild-type (WT)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing to provide single-base resolution of DNA methylation status in ros1-1 mutant and C24 WT

DESIGN
2 samples examined: C24 wild type with RD29A-LUC transgene, ros1-1 mutant (in C24 background with RD29A-LUC transgene)
