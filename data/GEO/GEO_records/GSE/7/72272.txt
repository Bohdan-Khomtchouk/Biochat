TITLE
Study of RFX1 and RFX3 binding sites in the mouse genome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to identify RFX1 and RFX2 binding sites in mouse pancreatic beta cells.

DESIGN
Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with the mouse MIN6 beta cell line and antibodies raised against RFX1 and RFX3. Immunoprecipitated DNA was sequenced using the Genome Analyzer II (Illumina). Antibodies were described in       Reith W,   Ucla C,   Barras E,   Gaud A,   Durand B,   Herrero-Sanchez C,   Kobr M,   Mach B    : RFX1, a transactivator of hepatitis B virus enhancer I, belongs to a novel family of homodimeric and heterodimeric DNA-binding proteins.
