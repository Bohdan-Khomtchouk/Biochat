TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in TM4 Sertoli cells following siRNA-mediated Gata4 inhibition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effects of Gata4 inhibition on global gene expression in TM4 Sertoli cells was analyzed. Using microarray analysis we identified a set of genes that are downregulated or upregulated following siRNA-mediated silencing of Gata4 in the murine Sertoli cell line TM4. Among the downregulated genes were regulators of blood-testtis barrier function and lactate metabolism. TM4 cells were transfected with non-targeting (NT) siRNA and Gata4 siRNA respectively. 72h post transfection cells were lysed and RNA was extracted.

DESIGN
n=3 of each sample group; control samples are samples 3-6 (TM4 cells treated with non-targeting siRNA)
