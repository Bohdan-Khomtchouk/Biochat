TITLE
Gene expression of E12.5 laser capture microdissected embryonic mouse dermal fibroblast progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Determined genes that are expressed in E12.5 dermal fibroblasts progenitors.  The purpose was to identify cell type specific genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from E12.5 Engrailed1Cre/+; Rosa26Reporter/+ mouse dorsal dermal fibrobast cells obtained by laser capture microdissection from 5 embryos and pooled before amplifying with Ambion kit.   Technical replicates of pooled labeled RNA was performed. Samples were hybridized on commercial Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression bead chip.
