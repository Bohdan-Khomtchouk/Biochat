TITLE
RecG Directs DNA Synthesis During Double-Strand Break Repair [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
In the bacterium Escherichia coli, RecG directs DNA synthesis during the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination.

DESIGN
Examination of RecA binding during double-strand break repair in Escherichia coli in the presence and absence of RecG protein
