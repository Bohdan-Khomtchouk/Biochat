TITLE
Methylome and transcriptome of EAC (methylation)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
genome-wide methylation profile of 250 samples including 125 EAC, 19 Barrett’s, 64 normal adjacent squamous and 21 normal stomach. Transcriptome data was performed for 70 samples with methylation profile (48 EAC, 4 Barrett’s and 18 normal adjacent squamous). This is the first study to use methylome, transcriptome and ENCODE data to characterize the regulatory role of methylation in EAC.

DESIGN
methylation profile of 250 samples including 125 EAC, 19 Barrett’s, 64 normal adjacent squamous and 21 normal stomach.
