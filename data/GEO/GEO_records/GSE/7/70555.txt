TITLE
Single-cell analysis reveals a stem cell program in human metastatic breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Refer to individual Series. For normalization: For PDX cancer cells, (GSE70552) Ct values were normalized by subtracting the average primary tumor expression from the same individual animal on a per-gene basis. In normal mammary cell experiments, (GSE70554) Ct values were normalized by subtracting the average value of the basal/stem cell population on a per-gene basis. For more detailed information, refer to the Methods section of Lawson DA et al., (2015).
