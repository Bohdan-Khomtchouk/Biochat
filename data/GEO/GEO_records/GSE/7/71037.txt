TITLE
Fetal microglial in vitro phenotype depends on prior in vivo inflammation

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 8 microglia extracted from sheep fetuses exposed to LPS or saline solution, to determine genetic expression of the first sheep model of in utero inflammation and second hit inflammation.

DESIGN
Examination of genetic expression in naive and second hit microglia.
