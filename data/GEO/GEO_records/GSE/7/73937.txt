TITLE
Differential expression of microRNAs in bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) transformed equine cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment investigates the effect of BPV-1 on microRNA profile in control cell line and BPV-1 in vitro transformed cell line A subset of microRNAs have been found differentially expressed in cells containing the BPV-1 genomes compared to control cells
