TITLE
Differential gene expression in neuroblastoma cells after transfection with control siRNA, MYCN siRNA or TFAP4 siRNA.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyed the gene expression profiles after knocking down MYCN or TFAP4. Results showed that transcription factor MYCN and TFAP4 commonly regulats a subset of genes that may contribute to neuroblastoma cells proliferation and migration.

DESIGN
Neuroblastoma BE(2)-C cells were transfected with control siRNA, MYCN siRNA1, MYCN siRNA2, TFAP4 siRNA1 and TFAP4 siRNA2, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from cells 30 hours after each transfection and subjected to gene expression study by Affymetrix microarray.
