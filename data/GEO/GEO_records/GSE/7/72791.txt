TITLE
Examination of IL-12 and IL-33 or IL-12 + IL-33 induced mRNA in effector CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression in cytokine stimulated effector CD8 T cells.

DESIGN
OT-I CD8 T cells primed with cognate SIINFEKL peptide and agonists to the costimulatory receptors CD134 and CD137 were stimulated with and without IL-12 and IL-33, and then microarray was performed.
