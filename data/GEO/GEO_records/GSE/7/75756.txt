TITLE
Influence on PPFIA1 knock-down and overexpression to gene expression in primary and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines by exon and gene Affymetrix microarrays.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
11q13 amplification is one of the most common amplifications in several epithelial cancers and is often related to poor prognosis. The role of several genes mapping to this region, such as PPFIA1, is not well-known. The purpose of our study was to identify genes whose expression is altered due to PPFIA1 knock-down or overexpression. The overall goal was to gain insight into the mechanism by which PPFIA1 affects on progression of head and neck cancers.

DESIGN
Three replicates of UT-SCC-24B cell lines were infected with shScramble control and shPPFIA1 shRNA construct. UT-SCC-95 cell line was infected with one control (emptry vector) and two different overexpression constructs targeting PPFIA1. We compared the effect of knockdown and overexpression of PPFIA1 to gene expression profiles of the control samples.
