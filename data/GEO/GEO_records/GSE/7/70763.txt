TITLE
Gene profiling of naive, virus-induced and inflammatory-induced memory CD8 T lymphocytes in homeostatic condition and after stimulation.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis comparing naive, protective and non-protective spleen memory CD8 T lymphocytes were conducted to identify key functions associated with memory CD8-mediated immune protection.  Memory CD8 T cells generated in response to influenza or vaccinia infection (Flu-memory and VV-memory) were compared to inflammatory memory cells (TIM) that were generated by peptide in inflammatory context. Gene expression analysis was performed on quiescent and re-stimulated CD8 T cells.

DESIGN
Influenza or Vaccinia virus induced memory cells (Flu-TM or VV-TM) were generated in C57BL/6J mice that received naive NP68-specific F5xLy5.1 CD8+ T cells one day before intranasal infection with Flu-NP68 or VV-NP68. Specific memory F5 CD8 T cells from spleens were FACS-sorted at least 6 weeks after immunization. T Inflammatory memory (TIM) cells were generated by i.p. injection of NP68 peptide in naive thymectomized F5 mice. Purified CD8 T cells were stimulated with NP68 peptide (restimulated condition, R) or not (homeostatic condition, H) for 2 hours
