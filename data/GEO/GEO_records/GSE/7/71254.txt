TITLE
Effect of Gfi1 36N variant on genome-wide H3K9 Acetylation patterns

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-Seq Analysis of H3K9Ac in pairs of mouse and human samples carrying either the Gfi136S or the GFi136N variants. The objective of the study was to identify the changes in H3K9 acetylation at gene promoters that occur in samples expressing the 36N variant of the Gfi1 gene.

DESIGN
3 pairs of bone-marrow AML samples were obtained from mice where 1 mouse in each pair was homozygous for Gfi136S and 1 heterozygous for Gfi136N, or homozygous for 36N in one case. 2 pairs of AML samples were obtained from human patients were 1 patient was homozygous for Gfi1 36S and one was heterozygous for Gfi1 36N. H3 and H3K9Ac ChIP-Seq was carried out on each sample.
