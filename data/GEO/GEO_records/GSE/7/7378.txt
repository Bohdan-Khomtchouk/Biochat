TITLE
Expression data from age-dichotomized ER+, N0 breast tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Signaling pathways that converge on two different transcription factor complexes, NFÎºB and AP-1, have been identified in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers resistant to the antiestrogen, tamoxifen. In this study, biomarkers co-ordinately up-regulated by NFKB and AP-1 with prognositic significance are identified in a largely TAM-treated set of ER+ node negative breast cancers.  The prognostic value with respect to age is also investigated. Keywords: biomarker identification
