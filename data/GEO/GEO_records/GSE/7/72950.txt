TITLE
Expression data of adult digit tip of K14-CreER;Ctnnb1 cKO mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Removal of Ctnnb1 in epithelial cells results in the defect of nail differentiation as well as underlying digit bone maintenance. We have revealed that several osteoclastgenesis related genes are up-regulated in Ctnnb1 cKO digit.

DESIGN
Whole digit tip of 8w old wildtype and Ctnnb1 cKO mice were harvested and processed to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We analyzed three control and three Ctnnb1 cKO samples.
