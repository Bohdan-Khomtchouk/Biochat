TITLE
Expression data for whole adult tissue; Drosophila males of seven species

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Co-expression of genes that physically cluster together is a common characteristic of eukaryotic transcriptomes.  Identifying these groups of co-expressed genes is important to the functional annotation of genomes and understanding the evolutionary fates of the clustered genes. We used microarrays to measure gene expression in seven closely related Drosophila species, to identify domains clusters within a species of Drosophila (D. simulans) and that are evolving among species in the D. melanogater subgroup. Keywords: species comparison
