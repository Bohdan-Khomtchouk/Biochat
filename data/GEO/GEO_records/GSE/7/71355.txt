TITLE
Detection of SNCA duplication aritifical mosaics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine sensitivity of a custom 8x60k aCGH design for mosaicism of SNCA gains, a peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) DNA sample with a known heterozygous duplication (CN 3, or 50% increase in SNCA) was diluted with a control (wild type, wt) sample (CN 2, screened by MLPA) to create " artifical mosaics " (CN 2.4, 2.3, 2,25, 2.2, 2.15, 2.1). Dilutions, as well as the undiluted heterozygous sample, and the control, were tested, hybridised with Agilent reference DNA.

DESIGN
Individual mixed samples ( " artifical mosaics " ), undliuted duplication carrier, and control, each hybridised against the same Agilent reference DNA.
