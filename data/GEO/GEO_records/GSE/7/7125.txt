TITLE
Toxicogenomic responses of PCB52 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Although non-coplanar PCBs are ubiquitous organic chemicals known to induce numerous biological responses and thus are toxic to man and wildlife, little is known about the toxic mode of action. Using PCB52, an ortho-substituted, 2,2’,5,5’-tetrachlorobiphenyl, it was possible to pinpoint the relationship between induced gene expression and observed toxicity in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Keywords: stress response
