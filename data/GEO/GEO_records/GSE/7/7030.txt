TITLE
Phenotypic and molecular characterisation of a novel Bt2 allele in maize

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
At 35 DAP whole kernels (pericarp + endosperm + embryo) without glumes of green house grown ears of heterozygous (+/bt2-H2328), self-pollinated plants were visually divided into pools of phenotypically normal looking kernels (small indentation, slightly smaller than mutant kernels, genotype +/+ or +/bt2-H2328) and pools of phenotypically mutant kernels (plump, round kernels, slightly larger than normal kernels, genotype bt2-H2328/bt2-H2328). Pools consisted of 4 kernels. 3 different ears were used for a biological duplicate. Keywords: gene knock out
