TITLE
In(1)BM2(reinverted) males: reared at room temperature vs. Cold shock treatment

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Cold exposure leads to alteration in the structure of the male sex chromosome of the mutant strain In(1)BM2(reinverted).  Genome wide expression profiling was used to identify candidate genes involved in the expression of this phenotype.  Adult male flies were exposed to cold shock at 12±1°C for 4 hours and the differentially expressed  genes in the strain was compared to similarly exposed wild type Oregon R males. The microarray data was further validated using real time PCR.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, RT vs. CS flies. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 replicates exposed to cold shock.
