TITLE
Expression data from Mouse Lymphoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have made use of the Eμ-myc transgenic mouse, a model for the study of B-cell lymphoma development that is initiated through a defined genetic alteration, to explore the contributions of additional somatic alterations that contribute to the heterogeneity of the resulting tumors.  As one example of such heterogeneity, we have focused on the observation that lymphomas develop in Eμ-myc mice with a variable time of onset.  Twenty-five early-onset, 25 late-onset lymphomas and 10 normal samples were each assayed on an Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array. Keywords: Myc induced lymphomas with various time-of-onset
