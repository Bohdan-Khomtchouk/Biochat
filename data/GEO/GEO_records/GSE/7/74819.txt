TITLE
Transcriptomic differences between euryhaline and stenohaline malaria vector sibling species in response to salinity stress [set2]

ORGANISM
Anopheles merus

SUMMARY
We use RNA-Seq to explore the reaction norm of gene expression of larval Anopheles coluzzii and An. merus to a gradient of salinity.

DESIGN
After rearing in freshwater, separate pools of 18 h post-hatch larval instars of An. merus and An. coluzzii were briefly (6 h) exposed to one of six water salinities: 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50% the salinity of seawater. The last sample (G-50-RC) was split across 5 lanes for sequencing, resulting in total 10 fastq files associated with subparts G-50-RCa, G-50-RCb, G-50-RCc, G-50-RCd, G-50-RCe.
