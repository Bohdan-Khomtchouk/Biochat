TITLE
Gene expression signatures in SPIN1 siRNA- and negative control-transfected breast cancer cell line MCF-7/ADM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To screen potential target genes of SPIN1 in breast cancer, human gene expression microarray was performed to identify differentially expressed mRNAs in SPIN1 siRNA or negative control transfected MCF-7/ADM cells. After transfection with SPIN1 siRNA, 4409 genes were differentially expressed by > 2-fold in MCF-7/ADM cells compared with negative control-transfected cells, of which 2413 were significantly downregulated and the other 1996 were upregulated. Differentially expressed genes were submitted to GO and KEGG pathway analysis.

DESIGN
A two chip study using total RNA recovered from MCF-7/ADM breast cancer cells transfected with  SPIN1 siRNA or negative control. Each chip measures the expression 45033 genes were collected from the authoritative data source including NCBI.
