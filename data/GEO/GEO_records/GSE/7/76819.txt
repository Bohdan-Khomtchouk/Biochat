TITLE
The Arabidopsis miR396 mediates pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune responses against fungal pathogens

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
A first line of defense against pathogen infections is the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), leading to PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are primarily known as central regulators of plant development, but a few have also been connected to immunity. We have found that several fungal pathogens lead to a reduction in miR396 levels, suggesting that miR396 are negative regulators of downstream defense responses. In agreement with such as scenario, constitutive attenuation of miR396 activity enhances resistance to infection by fungal pathogens, while increased miR396 activity reduces pathogen resistance. We conclude that constitutive reduction of miR396 levels confer a primed state for enhanced defense reactions

DESIGN
MIM396 Arabidopsis thaliana samples infected with Plectosphaerella cucumerina fungus and in control conditions. 3 biological replicates.
