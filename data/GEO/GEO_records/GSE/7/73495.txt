TITLE
TrAP expression in Arabidopsis thaliana lead to global reprogramming of endogenous genes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We examined global expression profiles of 7-days old 35S-TrAP transgenic plants compared to Col-0 wild-type using an Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip and identified 586 genes that are differentially expressed in the 35S-TrAP transgenic plants (q < 0.005). Of these, 295 transcripts were elevated whereas 291 were reduced (Figure 2E). We performed real-time PCR and RNA blot assays to validate the microarray results for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

DESIGN
In total 10 samples; 5 Input files (5 different conditions) with the corresponding 5 RIP samples biological replicate: col-0_seedling_rp2, col-0_seedling_rp3 biological replicate: TA_seedling_rp1, TA_seedling_rp2
