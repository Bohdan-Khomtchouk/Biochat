TITLE
MiR-23b/-27b Targets in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of genes regulated by miR-23b/-27b overexpression in aggressive PC3-ML cells, confirmed by antagomiR inhibition of miR-23b and miR-27b in the relatively indolent cell line LNCaP. Genes that were downregulated in PC3-ML overexpression and upregulated with LNCaP inhibition were further explored as downstream targets of miR-23b/-27b.

DESIGN
PC3-Ml cells were transduced with miR-23b/-27b or a scrambled miRNA control, and only cells expressing greater than 95% transduction efficiency were used for array. LNCaP cells were transfected with antagomiRs to miR-23b and miR-27b, or a non-coding control.
