TITLE
Increased expression of long non-coding RNAs in T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis facilitates the inflammatory responses

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The expression levels of LOC100652951 and LOC100506036 were increased in RA T cells. Treatment with biologic agents could lower the expression of LOC100652951 in RA T cells. LOC100506036 could regulate the expression of SMPD1 and NFAT1 and could contribute to the inflammatory responses in RA

DESIGN
The aberrantly expressed lncRNAs were measured in Jurkat cells co-cultured with or without ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.
