TITLE
Genes that are differentially expressed by 5AZA treatment and DNMT1 knockdown in intestinal tumor organoid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles after treatment with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-CdR and DNMT1 knockdown were analyzed in tumor organoids derived from ApcMin mice.

DESIGN
Tumor organoids were established from polyps of ApcMin mice. Treatment with 5-Aza-CdR and DNMT1 knockdown were performed and gene expression profiles were analyzed in tumor organoids.
