TITLE
Interactions of PfETRAMP14.1 with PfEMP1 and EXP-2 at the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) of human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum [HIGH PARASITEMIA ANALYSIS]

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
In our global differential gene expression analyses,ETRAMP14.1, an ETRAMP family member was found to be highly transcribed in vivo in severe Malaria patients from highly endemic Indian region. This study for the first time reports the interaction of ETRAMP14.1 with PfEMP1, EXP2 and Hsp70-1. Therefore, we propose that ETRAMP14.1 facilitate PfEMP1 to cross the PVM via transcolon machinery component EXP2.
