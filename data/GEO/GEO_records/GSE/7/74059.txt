TITLE
Transcriptional regulation of genes in AML12 cells treated with Palmitic acid, LXR lingand (GW3965) and Ulk1 siRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional regulation of genes in AML12 cells treated with Palmitic acid, LXR lingand (GW3965) and Ulk1 siRNA shows differential effect of Ulk1 KD on LXr responsive genes

DESIGN
AML-12 cells co-treated with 0.75mM PA+/- 10ÂµM GW3965 for 24 h +/- Ulk1 SiRNA
