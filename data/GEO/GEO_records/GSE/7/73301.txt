TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis before and after bacterial RNA infiltration

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To analyze transcription in plants induced by total bacterial RNAs, we examined the transcriptomes of RNAs-treated plants at 0 and 6 h compared to those of control plants at the same time points.

DESIGN
To compare two time point samples, we isolated total RNA from 5 plants 0h and 6h after infiltration of bacterial RNA and the synthesized cDNAs were hybridized on Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.
