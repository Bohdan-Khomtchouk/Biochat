TITLE
Comparative gene profiling study: Pak1 deficient mouse breast cancer cells vs Pak1 wt breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify differentially regulated genes between wild-type and Pak1 deficient mouse breast cancer cells, we performed a comparative gene profiling study by using mouse whole genome arrays.

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profiles of Her2 positive : Pak1 deficient cells vs Her2 positive : Pak1 wild type cells. All the experiments were performed in duplicate using tumor derived cells from two different tumors per group.
