TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression using in vitro cultured control and Lats1/2 deficient hepatoblasts [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-sequencing results with in vitro cultured control and Lats1/2 deficient hepatoblasts, in vitro differentiated control and Lats1/2 deficient hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells

DESIGN
To investigate changes in gene expression by loss of Lats1 and Lats2 during hepatocyte or biliary epithelial cell differentiation, we performed multiplex RNA-sequecing with in vitro cultured hepatoblasts, in vitro differentiated hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells
