TITLE
Transcriptome of GFP-ZFP36L1 expressing and WT FO B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: to identify the effects on the transcriptome of overexpressing ZFP36L1 in FO B cells

DESIGN
Method: RNAseq libraries were prepared from RNA isolated from sorted ex-vivo FO B cells. Total RNA samples were sent to Aros Applied Biotechnology A/S and were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced (100bp paired end) on the Illumina Hiseq.
