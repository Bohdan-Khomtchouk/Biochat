TITLE
Expression data for nuclear actin regulated genes in keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Actin dynamically shuttles between the nucleus and cytosplasm and regulates a wide range of transcriptional processes within the nucleus We used gene expression profiling of keratinocytes overexpressing wild type actin or actin tagged with a nuclear localisation sequence to identify genes specifically regulated by nuclear actin

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from HaCaT keratinocytes expressing WT-actin or NLS-actin and analysed using Affymetrix 2.0 plus microarrays
