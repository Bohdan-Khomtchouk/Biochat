TITLE
Identification of conserved and novel microRNAs during tail regeneration in the Mexican Axolotl

ORGANISM
Ambystoma mexicanum

SUMMARY
The Mexican axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is one member of a select group of vertebrate animals that has retained the amazing ability to regenerate multiple body parts. In addition to being an important model system for regeneration, the axolotl is also a leading model system for developmental biologists. Many genes used in development have been identified to be reused again during regeneration, however how this molecular circuitry is controlled during regeneration is unknown. In recent years microRNAs have been identified as key regulators of gene expression during development, in many diseases and also in regeneration. Here we have used deep sequencing combined with qRT-PCR to identify microRNAs that are involved in regulating regeneration in axolotl. This approach has enabled us to identify well known families of microRNAs and in addition to identify putative novel microRNAs that differentially regulated in the regenerating tissue. These findings suggest that microRNAs may play key roles in managing the spatial and temporal expression of genes important for ensuring that the correct tissues are regenerated.
