TITLE
Follicular Helper T Cells Progressively Differentiate to Regulate the Germinal Center Response

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To compare the transcriptomes of IL-21-expressing, IL-21 and IL-4-expressing, and IL-4 expressing follicular helper T (Tfh) cells and Th2 cells in the spleen at 8 days following helminth infection Methods: Cell sorting of the populations was done for CD4+B220-CD44hiCXCR5hiPD-1hi cells of the various types, followed by mRNA purification.

DESIGN
CD4+Splenic T cell mRNA profiles 8 days post-infection of IL-21/IL-4 dual reporter mice with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis were generated by mRNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
