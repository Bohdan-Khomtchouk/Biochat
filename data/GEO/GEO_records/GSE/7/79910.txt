TITLE
An 18 gene expression-based score classifier predicts the clinical outcome in stage 4 neuroblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The prognosis of children with metastatic stage 4 neuroblastoma (NB) has remained poor in the past decade. Using microarray analyses of 342 primary tumors, we here developed and validated an easy to use gene expression-based risk score including 18 genes, which can robustly predict the outcome of stage 4 patients. This classifier was a significant predictor of overall survival in two independent validation cohorts (cohort 1 (n=214): P=6.3x10-5; cohort 2 (n=27): P=3.1x10-2). The prognostic value of the risk score was validated by multivariate analysis including the established markers age and MYCN status (P=0.027). In the pooled validation cohorts (n=241), integration of the risk score with the age and/or MYCN status identified subgroups with significantly differing overall survival (ranging from 35% to 100%). Together, the 18-gene risk score classifier can identify patients with stage 4 NB with favorable outcome and may therefore improve risk assessment and treatment stratification of NB patients with disseminated disease.

DESIGN
We analyzed expression profiling arrays of 27 Tumor samples from stage 4 neuroblastoma patients.
