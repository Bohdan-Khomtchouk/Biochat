TITLE
Response to poly(I:C) in WT and GADD34ΔC/ΔC MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The stress-inducible GADD34 was shown to be induced during dsRNA sensing and is a stress-inducible PP1 cofactor responsible for dephosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha. Its activity was shown to be required for efficient cytokine production in MEFs after poly(I:C) delivery. A microarray-based mRNA transcription analysis was used to compare the transcriptional response of WT and GADD34ΔC/ΔC MEFs lipofected with poly(I:C)

DESIGN
MEFs WT and GADD34ΔC/ΔC were left untreated or were lipofected with 2.5µg/ml of HMW poly(I:C) during 6 hours. Their RNA content was extracted with phenol/chloroforme and purified. Three independent experiments were performed.
