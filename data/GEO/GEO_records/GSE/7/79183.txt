TITLE
Changes in RNA expression in human oral cavity carcinoma cells as a result of LDB1 reduction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The study was designed to identify differential expressed genes between human oral cavity carcinoma cell lines with and without LDBI knockout

DESIGN
Three parental human oral cavity carcinoma cell lines were used as control, LDB1 was knocked out in the three parent cell lines to create KO cell lines.
