TITLE
Sex differences in gene expression profiles during hantavirus infection of rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles were examined in whole lung tissue collected from male and female Long-Evans rats at different time points after inoculation with Seoul virus (i.e., the species-specific hantavirus that infects Norway rats) We used microarray analyses to analyze global gene expression differences between the sexes during hantavirus infection Keywords: time course
