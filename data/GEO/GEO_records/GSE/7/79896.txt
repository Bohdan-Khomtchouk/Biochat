TITLE
miRNA expression profiling in human glioma stem cell upon TUG1 inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastomas show heterogeneous histological features. These distinct phenotypic states are thought to be associated with the presence of glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly tumorigenic and self-renewing sub-population of tumor cells that have different functional characteristics. We found that TUG1, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), plays pivotal roles in maintaining the self-renewal properties of GSC. Some lncRNAs are known to act as a miRNA sponge in the cytoplasm, where lncRNAs bind to miRNAs and quench their activity. To investigate miRNA expression profiling in GSC upon TUG1 inhibition, we have performed microarray experiment using SurePrint G3 Human miRNA 8x60K Microarray (G4872A, Agilent Technologies).

DESIGN
Microarray experiment was performed as single-color hybridization on Agilent human miRNA catalog 8x60k array.
