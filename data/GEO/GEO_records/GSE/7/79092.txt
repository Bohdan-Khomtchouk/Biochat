TITLE
Peripheral blood transcriptome profiles in adult male Japanese IT workers.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcript abundance estimates as a function generalized purpose in life and work-related dimensions of meaning.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was conducted on peripheral blood samples collected from adult male employees of a Japanese technology firm.  In addition to health-relevant background characteristics (age, indcome, body mass index/BMI, smoking history, heavy alcohol consumption history), participants were also assessed for hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions of generalized well-being (assesed by the Short Flourishing Scale, Keyes, C (2006). The Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) for adults) and work-specific variables including job evaluation (assessed by a12-item scale tapping both perceived significance of the firm’s work, through items such as “I am proud of my company” and “I think my company is really good,” as well as perceived significance of one’s own contribution to the firm's work, through items such as, “I think other employees within my company respect my work”), and workplace interdependence and independence of the self and coworkers (using the Singelis Self-Construal Scale, Singelis, T. M. (1994). The Measurement of Independent and Interdependent Self-Construals. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 20(5), 580–591).  Higher values of each scale score indicate greater levels of well-being, job satisfaction, etc.  Dichotomous variables were coded 0=no/absent and 1=yes/present.  Valid gene expression data are available for 106 participants.
