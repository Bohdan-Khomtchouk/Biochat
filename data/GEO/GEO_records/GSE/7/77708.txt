TITLE
Effect of Dietary Lysine on the Gene Expression Profile of Skeletal Muscle in Finishing Pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The main goal of swine production is to convert feedstuffs into edible meat whose major component is skeletal muscle. The overall objective of this project is to study the effect of dietary lysine on the gene expression profile of skeletal muscle in late stage finishing pigs. The hypothesis for this is that adequate or excess level of dietary lysine will change the expression levels of numerous genes, and these changes are in favor of muscle protein accretion and are associated with various blood metabolites and growth performance parameters.

DESIGN
Three experimental (lysine-deficient, lysine-adequate, lysine-excess) diets were respectively fed to 3 groups of pigs (initial body weight, ~95 kg/pig; 3 pigs/group) for a total of 5 weeks.
