TITLE
RUNX1-ETO (RE) murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) treated with GM-CSF

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GM-CSF signaling was previously reported to have a negative effect on a murine model of (8;21)-induced leukemia. Gene expression profiling of MigR1 (Mig) control and RUNX1-ETO (RE), the oncofusion protein generated from t(8;21), murine Lin-/c-Kit+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) was conducted to further elucidate the mechanisms mediating the negative effect induced by GM-CSF signaling in t(8;21) cells,

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of control MigR1 (Mig) and MigR1-RUNX1-ETO (RE) Lin-/c-Kit+murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) with and without 10ng/mL GM-CSF treatment
