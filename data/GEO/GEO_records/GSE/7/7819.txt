TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in SVG-A glial cells and SVGR2 glial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SVGR2 cells are glial cells which are derived from SVG-A cells. They were created by subjecting SVG-A cells to multiple rounds of lytic infection by the human polyomavirus JCV. SVGR2 cells are the cells that survived this process and are resistant to JCV infection. This experiment was designed to identify gene expression differences that may be responsible for SVGR2 resistance to JCV. Keywords: Cell type
