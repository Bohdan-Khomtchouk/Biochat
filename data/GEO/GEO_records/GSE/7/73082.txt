TITLE
Determination of the Sp5 regulated transcriptome in differentiating ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Sp5 is a target and critical transducer of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and is essential for mesoderm differentiation in vertebrate embryos. We established a doxycycline inducible ES cell line to over-express Flag epitope-tagged Sp5 protein in differentiating ES cells which have the capacity to form mesoderm cells in vitro. The goal of this study was to identify the genes/gene networks regulated by Sp5 to understand how it regulates mesoderm differentiation by identifying important target genes which may mediate its activity.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from ES cells after 3 days of differentiating following F-Sp5 over-expression from day 2 to 3. We compared the transcriptome of differentially expressed genes between untreated (minus) and doxycycline treated (plus) ES cells to identify Sp5 regulated genes.
