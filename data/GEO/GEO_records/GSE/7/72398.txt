TITLE
Expression data from CEA high and CEA low cells in colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detailed global expression of colorectal cancer cells that expressed high or low levels of carcinoembryonic antigen.

DESIGN
CEA high and CEA low cells were purified from LoVo and xenograft tumor derived from colorectal cancer patient (xhCRC) and were used for RNA extraction.
