TITLE
Global gene expression profile of primary mouse brain and glioblastoma tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse glioblastomas were induced by lentiviral vector expressing HrasG12V and shRNA against p53. Tumor tissues were isolated from mice reached clinical endpoints. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit according to manufacturerâ€™s protocol with the addition of DNase (Qiagen). cDNA libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina). RNA sequencing was performed using a HiSeq 2500 Sequencing System (Illumina).

DESIGN
3 normal mouse brain samples compared to 5 glioblastoma samples by standard RNAseq method.
