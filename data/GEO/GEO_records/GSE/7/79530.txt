TITLE
Characterization of genetic variability of Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses

ORGANISM
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus

SUMMARY
We performed whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based analysis of all available Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus antigenic complex genomes and developed a high resolution genome-wide SNP microarray. We used the SNP microarray to analyze a broad panel of VEEV isolates, found excellent concordance between array and sequence based genotypes for previously sequenced strains, and genotyped unsequenced strains.
