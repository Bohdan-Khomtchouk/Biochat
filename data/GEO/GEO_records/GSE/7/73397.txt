TITLE
LncRNA and mRNA expression profiles of 3 prostate cancer tumor tissues and 3 normal prostate tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LncRNA and mRNA expression profiles of 3 prostate cancer tumor samples and 3 normal prostate samples were measured by microarray

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we compared lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles between 3 prostate cancer samples and 3 normal prostate samples using a microarray containing 41531 lncRNA probes and 33352 mRNA probes.
