TITLE
The study of ethylene response in cellular elongation of Arabidopsis roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of the experiments is to identify differential genes between the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana and roots treated for 3 h with 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). ACC blocks the maximal cell elongation of the root cells. - Arabidopsis plants are grown for 5 days on MS medium and then we transfer them to a medium supplemented with ACC (5uM) or without ACC. After 3 h of growth, we isolate the RNA of the roots. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
