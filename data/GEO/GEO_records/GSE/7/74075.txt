TITLE
Changes in Expression of Genes Regulating Airway Inflammation Following a High-Fat Mixed Meal in Asthmatics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Consumption of a high fat meal can increase neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms driving airway neutrophilia following a high fat meal in asthma.

DESIGN
a subset of subjects (asthmatics, n=5; healthy controls, n=3) were examined by microarray. A total of 500 ng of sputum RNA was amplified and labelled with biotin-uridine triphosphate using the Total Prep RNA amplification kit as per manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Life Technologies). 750 ng cRNA was hybridised to Illumina Sentrix HumanRef-8 V3 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using standard protocols. Each BeadChip measured the expression of 24,354 genes and was scanned using the Illumina Bead Station and captured using BeadScan 3.5.11 (Illumina)
