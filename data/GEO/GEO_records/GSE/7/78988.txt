TITLE
Change in gene expression of a canine melanoma cell line caused by exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) .

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been suggested as adjunctive anti-tumor agents in human and veterinary medicine. However, its anti-tumor molecular machinery is still controversial. Therefore, we performed whole transcriptome analysis to discover gene expression influenced by NSAIDs treatment.

DESIGN
A canine melanoma cell line (Mi/CMM1) was treated by three NSAIDs, piroxicam, carprofen, and robenacoxib, at their half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentrations (116 µM, 779 µM, and 156 µM) for 6 hours. Subsequently, total RNA were extracted and microarray analysis was performed to evaluate change in gene expression caused by NSAIDs treatment. Each condition had three biological replicates.
