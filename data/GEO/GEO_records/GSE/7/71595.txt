TITLE
RNA-sequencing of cells derived from the site of inflammation of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through RNA sequencing of CD4+ Tmemory/effector cells derived from the synovium of JIA patients and healthy controls, we analyzed the JIA gene expression signature. Treatment of autoinflammatory site-derived patient T cells with the BET-inhibitor JQ1 inhibited immune-related super-enhancers and preferentially reduced disease-associated gene expression, including cytokine-related processes.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing of CD4+ memory/effector T cells derived from Healthy Controls (HC) and JIA patients upon JQ1 treatment.
