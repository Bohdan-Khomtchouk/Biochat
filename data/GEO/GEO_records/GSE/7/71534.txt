TITLE
Mechanisms of Fibrotic Aortic Valve Stenosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine molecular mechanisms of aortic valve stenosis in mice with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, RNA-Seq was used during the developmental phase of  stenosis to identify new gene targets.

DESIGN
Four groups of mice were studied: controls (CON), hypertensive  (HT), hypercholesterolemic (HC), and HC/HT. Transgenic mice overexpressing human renin and human angiotensinogen served as the HT model and ApoE knockout mice served as the HC model.    A sample size of N=4 was used for each of the four groups.
