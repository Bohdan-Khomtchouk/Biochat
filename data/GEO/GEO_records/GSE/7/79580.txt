TITLE
Role of H3.3 residues in chromatin assembly and cell fate at the maternal-to-embryo transition

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HISRainbow mice were used to obtain mosaic ovaries for transcriptome analysis of MII eggs expressing H3.3-eGFP, H3.3R26K-eCFP, or H3.3K27R-mCherry. Results provide comparison of eggs with different genotypes and insight into mechanism of how resting oocytes are selected for ovulation.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling of eggs expressing H3.3-eGFP, H3.3R26K-eCFP, or H3.3K27R-mCherry by deep sequencing in duplicates.
