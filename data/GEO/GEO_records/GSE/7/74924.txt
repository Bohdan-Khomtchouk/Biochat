TITLE
Calcineurin-dependent lateral transfer of Aspergillus fumigatus through a VASP tunnel during human macrophage cell death enables control of fungal germination

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced total RNA from human monocyte derived macrophages (n = 6, healthy donors) pre-treated with calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (10 ng/ml) for 1h and stimulated with live Aspergillus fumigatus swollen conidia (MOI=1) for 1h and 6h.

DESIGN
We sequenced total RNA from human monocyte derived macrophages from six healthy donors. For each donor, we had six conditions (Unstimulated control, FK506 pre-treated control, 1 hour stimulation with live Aspergillus fumigatus, 1 hour stimulation with live Aspergillus fumigatus with FK506 pre-treatment, 6 hour stimulation with live Aspergillus fumigatus, 6 hour stimulation with live Aspergillus fumigatus with FK506 pre-treatment. In total we analysed 36 samples (6 healthy donors with 6 conditions).
