TITLE
Exploiting single-cell expression to characterize co-expression replicability

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced two types of interneurons from adult mouse frontal cortex across multiple library batches to assess the replicability of co-expression networks.

DESIGN
Cells were harvested from four animals and processed in batches of 16 cells each. Two cells failed to amplify (ChC-49 and Pv-27) and were removed from our analysis.
