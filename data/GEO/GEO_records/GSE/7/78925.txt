TITLE
Differentially expressed vascular development genes for iPSC-ECs from CDI

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we report genes upregulated for iPSC-ECs cultured in PEG hydrogels relative to control cells on tissue culture polystyrene (TCP) surfaces included adhesion, matrix remodeling, and Notch signaling pathway genes relevant to in vivo vascular development.

DESIGN
Comparison between differentially expressed genes in 2D versus 3D culture of iPSC-ECS
