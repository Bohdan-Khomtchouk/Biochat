TITLE
Adaptive aneuploidy protects against thiol peroxidase deficiency by increasing respiration via key mitochondrial proteins

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We characterized the mechanisms that allow yeast cells to survive under conditions of thiol peroxidase deficiency. Two thiol peroxidase null yeast (delta8) strains independently acquired a second copy of chromosome XI and increased expression of genes encoded by it. Delta-8 strains were compared to the Wt-M11 strain, which is characterized by duplication of chr-XI.

DESIGN
Examination of thiol peroxidase-deficient yeast strains.
