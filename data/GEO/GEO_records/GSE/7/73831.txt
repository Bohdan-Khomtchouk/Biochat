TITLE
Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in ESET+/+ and ESET-/- DP thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated genome-wide H3K9me3-state maps of DP thymocytes purified from ESET+/+ and ESET-/- mice  by using next generation sequencing.

DESIGN
Examination of H3K9 trimethylation in DP thymocytes purified from ESET+/+ and ESET-/- mice.
