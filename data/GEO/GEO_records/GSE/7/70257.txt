TITLE
Assessing the hepatic immune response during the progression of the proliferative darkening syndrome in brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) by microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
The proliferative darkening syndrome (PDS) is an annually recurring disease that causes a near 100 % species-specific die-off of brown trout (Salmo trutta) in PDS-impacted pre-alpine rivers of central Europe. The progression of PDS occurs in three stages over a time period of more than 3 months starting in spring (May-June), culminating with the die-off of brown trout in late summer (mid August â€“ late September). Based on experimental evidence it is hypothesized that PDS is caused by an infectious agent. To substantiate this working hypothesis as well as to discern the type of pathogen likely to be responsible for PDS, microarray analysis were conducted using a salmonid-specific cDNA microarray to assess the hepatic immune response of brown trout during Stage 1 and 2 of PDS in 7-day intervals over a time period of 98 days. The microarray analysis revealed that brown trout suffering from PDS had increased hepatic expression of immune response genes, which are involved in a variety of immune system processes that mediate defense against infection, both during Stage 1 and 2 of PDS. Thus the microarray analysis support the working hypothesis that PDS is caused by an infectious agent. Furthermore, the up-regulation of an antiviral (BAF) and an antimicrobial (IRF1) immune response gene during Stage 1 and 2 of PDS, respectively, suggests that this disease is caused by a microbial infection.
