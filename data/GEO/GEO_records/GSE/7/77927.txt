TITLE
Real-time Quantitative PCR analysis of the expression of TGFB-pathway target genes on 3D-cultured chemoresistant colon carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to elucidate which TGFB signaling pathway molecules are involved in the colon cancer chemoresistance. The PCR array used for this experiments was 84 Human TGF-β Signaling Targets (Cat. N. PAHS-235ZA, Qiagen)

DESIGN
The expression of 84 Human TGF-β Signaling Targets genes was analyzed by RT2 profiler PCR array (PAHS-235ZA, Qiagen) using the StepOne Plus instrument (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Two independent experiments were performed for each group of treatment. Untreated cells were used as reference control sample. The mRNA expression levels of each gene in each cell treatment were normalized using the expression of the housekeeping genes B2M, GAPDH, RPLP0, HPRT1 and ACTB.
