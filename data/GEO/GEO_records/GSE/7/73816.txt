TITLE
Transcriptome expression profile of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from BAHD1+/+ (WT)  and BAHD1-/- (KO) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparisons of gene expression profiles of BAHD1-KO MEFs to those of wild-type MEFs (sampled at embryonic day E13.5).

DESIGN
We used DNA microarrays to identify the repertoire of genes differentially expressed by ablation of the BAHD1 gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.
