TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of mice lung tissue after inhalation of S100A8, S100A8 dimer, S100A9 or S100A8/A9 complex in acute lung [S100A8S100A9 LPS induced ALI]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LPS (10 μg/50 μl PBS; E. coli Serotype 055:B5, Sigma-Aldrich) was administered onto the nares. Baseline levels of genes in mice treated with vehicle (Hanks Balanced Salt solution (HBSS) and PBS), Intranasal S100s (10 μg/50 μl HBSS) were given 2 h before LPS; control mice received equal volumes of PBS and HBSS. Mice were sacrificed 4 h post LPS inhalation.

DESIGN
Expression of inflammatory genes was evaluated with the RT-qPCR array. Relative quantities of mRNA in duplicate samples were obtained using the LightCycler® 480 Software 1.5 and the Efficiency-Method.
