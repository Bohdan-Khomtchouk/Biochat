TITLE
Transcriptome Sequencing (RNAseq) enables utilization of Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Biopsies with Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma for Exploration of Disease Biology and Biomarker Development

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are an underused resource for molecular analyses. This proof of concept study aimed to compare RNAseq results from FFPE biopsies with the corresponding RNAlater® (Qiagen, Germany) stored samples from clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients, to enable the decision of whether or not it is feasible to apply RNAseq technology to archival tissue. Core biopsies were obtained with a 16g needle from 16 patients undergoing partial or full nephrectomy. The RNA sequencing libraries were generated applying the new Illumina TruSeq® Access library preparation protocol.
