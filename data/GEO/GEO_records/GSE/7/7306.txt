TITLE
Chromosomal rearrangement interferes with meiotic X-chromosome inactivation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of isolated populations of prepachytene spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids of males carrying a translocation T(16;17)43H was performed to study the influence of this translocation on gene expression from individual chromosomes. To evaluate the transcriptional behavior of individual chromosomes in the sterile B10-T43/+ males and their fertile congenic B10-T43/T43 and B10 counterparts, we compared their transcriptomes in sorted populations of pre-pachytene primary spermatocytes, pachytene primary spermatocytes and spermatids. Keywords: individual genetic characteristics design
