TITLE
Mouse primary myeloid dendritic cell transcriptome response to a wild type infectious clone of West Nile virus (WNVMT) and mutant virus (WNVE218A).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA analysis in primary mouse myeloid dendritic cells infected with wild type West Nile virus (WNVMT) and mutant virus (WNVE218A).

DESIGN
Mouse (C57Bl/6J) primary amyeloid dendritic cells (D10 after seeding of leukocytes from bone marrow) were seeded at 2 x 10^5 cells per well of non-tc treated 12-well plate in 0.8 mL R10 DC media after infection at a multiplicity of infection of 500.  Infected samples were collected in triplet; time-matched mocks were collected in triplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 1, 8, 12 and 24 h post-infection. There were two independent biological replicates of the entire procedure. This study (WDC010) is a biological replicate of another (WDC011; GSE75222).
