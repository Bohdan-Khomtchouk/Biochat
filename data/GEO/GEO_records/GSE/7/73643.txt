TITLE
Genome-wide methylome study in cassava [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Manihot esculenta

SUMMARY
Bisulfite treatment, and mRNA libraries were made to characterize DNA methylation and expression of cassava.

DESIGN
Genome-wide RNA profiling of cassava leaves was done by Illumina TruSeq preparation kits followed by high-throughput sequencing with Illumina HiSeq 2000.
