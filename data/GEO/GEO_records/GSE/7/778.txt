Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Four dye swap replicates were performed with material derived 24 hours after stimulation of HUVECs with  PMA and RMAC11 hybridised to material obtained at time 0 hours. The cDNAs used in this microarray were identified as part of collaborative project between the IMVS and Bionomics Limited. The project aims were to identify genes up-regulated during in vitro capillary tube formation as targets for angiogenesis-based therapeutics.
