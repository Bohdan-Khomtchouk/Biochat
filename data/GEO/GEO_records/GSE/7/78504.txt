TITLE
Transcriptome profile for roots of the rice plants which showed favorable morpho-physiological adaptation when subjected to severe drought stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To understand how OsNAM12.1 over-expression influences the target genes within qDTY12.1 and across the genome to affect root growth, the root transcriptome of Vandana, 481-B, IR64-Tr-E2, and IR64-WT were compared under control and drought conditions.

DESIGN
Drought induced gene expression was studied in the roots of the rice plants subjected to severe drought. Seeds of Vandana, 481-B, IR64 and the OsNAM12.1 overexpression line (OsNAM Event 2) were sown in 5 biological replicates in a randomized complete block design for both the well watered and drought stress treatments.
