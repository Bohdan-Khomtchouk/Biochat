TITLE
Gene expression change in Keap1 knockdown (KD) mice in kidneys of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed differences in IRI kidneys between WT and Keap1 KD mice (= Nrf2-activated mice).  To identify Nrf2-target genes or metabolic genes in kidneys, we examined the mRNA expression profile both in normal (uninjured) and IRI kidneys (at day1 after unilateral IRI) from mice

DESIGN
We performed microarray analyses using 1)  Injured kidneys at day 1 after unilateral IRI,  and 2)  intact kidneys from mice which did not undergo UIRI.  Samples were harvested from Keap1 KD mice and WT mice, n = 2 each,
