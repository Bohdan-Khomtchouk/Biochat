TITLE
A Glo1-methylglyoxal pathway that is perturbed in maternal diabetes regulates embryonic and adult neural stem cell pools in offspring

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compare the gene expression profile in cultured primary neurospheres derived from the subventricular zone of adult (2 m.o.) offspring of mothers treated with PBS or methylglyoxal during pregnancy

DESIGN
Primary neurospheres derived from 2-month-old adult CD1 mice born to mothers treated with PBS or MG twice daily from gestational day 12 until delivery were collected, and total RNA extracted. cDNA was hybridized on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array and gene expression was analyzed using Partek software. In total, 3 PBS treated and 3 MG treated mice were used.
