TITLE
Reduced dosage of β-catenin genetically rescues intracardiac anomalies in a Tbx1 conditional null mouse model of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Approximately 60-70% of patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS; velo-cardio-facial syndrome/DiGeorge syndrome) have cardiac outflow tract anomalies including persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) as the most severe defect. Among the genes in the 22q11.2 region, TBX1, encoding a T-box transcription factor is a major candidate for cardiovascular malformations and its inactivation in mice results in a PTA. To identify novel signaling mechanisms that function downstream, we found that Tbx1 restricts canonical Wnt signaling in the pharyngeal apparatus. To test for tissue specificity within the pharyngeal apparatus, we inactivated Tbx1 in the anterior portion of the secondary heart field (AHF) mesoderm using the Mef2c-AHF-Cre allele and observed a full penetrant PTA (n = 30). Tbx1 promotes progenitor cells but restricts differentiation whereas Wnt signaling, in the AHF, promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation.  To determine whether Tbx1 and canonical Wnt signaling act in opposing pathways, both alleles of Tbx1 and one β-catenin allele were inactivated in the AHF and 85% of them (n = 35) showed partial or complete rescue. The antagonistic function of the two pathways was further confirmed by gene expression profiling, indicating that these two pathways provide a key balance in the AHF to prevent premature differentiation of progenitor cells prior to reaching the cardiac outflow tract.

DESIGN
We inactivatedTbx1 and beta-catenin allele to identify function of Tbx1 and beta-catenin in the anterior portion of the secondary heart field (AHF) mesoderm. We also inactivated both alleles of Tbx1 and one β-catenin alleles (rescue design) to determine whether Tbx1 and canonical Wnt signaling act in opposing pathways
