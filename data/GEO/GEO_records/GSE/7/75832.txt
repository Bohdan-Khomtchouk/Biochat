TITLE
RNAseq from neonatal mouse hindlimb muscles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During neonatal development, skeletal muscle grows dramatically by myonuclei accretion to existing fibers and hypertophic growth of fibers with protein synthesis.

DESIGN
To understand molecular mechanism underlying neonatal muscle growth, we used RNAseq to profile the global program of gene expressions especially involved in myoblast fusion, migration, and muscle fiber growth by itself. We used two biological replicates for each time point.
