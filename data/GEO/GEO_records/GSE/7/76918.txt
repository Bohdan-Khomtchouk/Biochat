TITLE
Comparison of two A. nidulans strains: control CV125 and transgenic NA1363 harboring E. coli LacZ transgene.

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of two A. nidulans strains, aiming to compare the control strain CV125 (pabaA1) with the transgenic strain NA1363 (pabaA1) harbouring a gpdAp-lacZ-trpCt.riboB construct integrated in chromosome VIII. This construct, carried out in a derivative of the pBR322 vector, contained the E. coli lacZ sequence (encoding ÃŸ-galactosidase) fused to the A. nidulans trpC terminator and placed under the control of the strong and constitutive promoter of the A. nidulans gpdA gene, and the riboB gene as a selection marker.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, NA1363 vs CV125 strains. Biological and technical replicates: 8 control and 8 transgenic cultures, independently grown and harvested in two culture batches (4 cultures of each strain per batch). One sample from each indivudual culture hybridized per array, no hybridization replicates.  Each indivudual sample was labeled with Cy3 and hybridized in competition with a sample labeled with Cy5 prepared from a pool of RNA (reference).
