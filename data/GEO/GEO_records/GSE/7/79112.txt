TITLE
Gene expression profile using RNA-seq in WC00060 or SR-0788 cells transfected with siRNA for KPC1 or control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer with increasing incidence rates and a poor survival, particularly in patients with AJCC stage IV and advanced stage III. Deregulation of NF-kB is linked to different pathological states, including melanoma. To identify the involvement of NF-kB pathway regulation in melanoma progression, we manipulated NF-kB pathway activation and profiled gene expression using RNA-sequencing.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of WC00060 and SR-0788 with KPC1 knockdown (siKPC1) or control (siCntl) generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
