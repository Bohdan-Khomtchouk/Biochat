TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of chronic inflammation induced gene expression in livers isolated from either wild type or ApoE-Cyp7a1 transgenic animals.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole genome expression changes in livers from wild type animals and animals with a liver specific transgenic over expression of Cyp7a1. Mice were given a chronic, repetitive administration of LPS for 7 days. Our prior analysis had indicated that inflammation suppresses Cyp7a1 and that this leads to accumulation of intermediates in the mevalonate biosynthesis pathway. Here, we hypothesized that over expression of Cyp7a1 would not affect the changes in transcriptional state due to chronic administration of LPS. We provide gene expression data which evaluates this question. Here we find that over expression of Cyp7a1 minimally alters the transcriptome of livers in an untreated state, and that it has small effects on the response to chronic LPS.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from livers of wild type and liver specific Cyp7a1 transgenic animals treated with or without recurrent, daily LPS injections (1.5mg/kg) for 7 days. There are two biological replicates per condition. Samples are a matrix of all conditions reported as FPKMs.
