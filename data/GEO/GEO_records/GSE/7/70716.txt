TITLE
Tribbles-1 regulates hepatic lipogenesis through post-transcriptional regulation of C/EBPÎ± [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report ChIP-Seq data for C/EBPa in livers of mice with liver-specific KO (LSKO) of Trib1 as compared to WT controls, or in livers of mice overexpressing C/EBPa via adeno-associated virus (AAV) as compared to controls.

DESIGN
8-10 week old Trib1 flox/flox mice treated with AAV_Null (WT) or AAV_Cre (LSKO); 8-10 week old C57B/6 WT mice treated with AAV_Null or AAV_Cebpa.
