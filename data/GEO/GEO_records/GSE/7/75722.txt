TITLE
Lineage-specific enhancers activate self-renewal genes in macrophages and embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differentiated macrophages can self-renew in tissues and expand long-term in culture, but the gene regulatory mechanisms that accomplish self-renewal in the differentiated state have remained unknown. Here we show that in mice, the transcription factors MafB and c-Maf repress a macrophage-specific enhancer repertoire associated with a gene network controlling self-renewal. Single cell analysis revealed that, in vivo, proliferating resident macrophages can access this network by transient down-regulation of Maf transcription factors. The network also controls embryonic stem cell self-renewal but is associated with distinct embryonic stem cell-specific enhancers. This indicates that distinct lineage-specific enhancer platforms regulate a shared network of genes that control self-renewal potential in both stem and mature cells.

DESIGN
Chromatin marks H3K4me1, H3K27Ac, and transcription factors P300, PU.1, MafB and Flag-MafB were assessed by ChIP-Seq  in 3 different macrophage subtypes.
