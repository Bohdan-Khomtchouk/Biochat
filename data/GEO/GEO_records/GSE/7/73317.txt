TITLE
Gene expression analysis of BRD4 knockdown in HT-29 and HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNAseq is performed (50bp single end reads) on HT-29 and HCT-116 cell lines utilizing two independent shRNAs against BRD4 and a non-targeting control shRNA (NTC)

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptomic changes after knockdown of BRD4
