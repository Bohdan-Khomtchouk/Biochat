TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of young vs. old Drosophila melanogaster posterior midguts

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare changes in gene expression between young (5 days old) and old (45 days old) flies posterior midguts.

DESIGN
Seventy-five female WT posterior midguts per condition (5do and 45do) were dissected. Each condition was sequenced in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
