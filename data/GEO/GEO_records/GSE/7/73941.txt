TITLE
Transcriptome-wide mapping reveals reversible and dynamic N1-methyladenosine methylome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
N1-Methyladenosine (m1A) is a prevalent post-transcriptional RNA modification, yet little is known about its abundance, topol- ogy and dynamics in mRNA. Here, we show that m1A is prevalent in Homo sapiens mRNA, which shows an m1A/A ratio of ~0.02%. We develop the m1A-ID-seq technique, based on m1A immunoprecipitation and the inherent ability of m1A to stall reverse tran- scription, as a means for transcriptome-wide m1A profiling. m1A-ID-seq identifies 901 m1A peaks (from 600 genes) in mRNA and noncoding RNA and reveals a prominent feature, enrichment in the 5' untranslated region of mRNA transcripts, that is dis- tinct from the pattern for N6-methyladenosine, the most abundant internal mammalian mRNA modification. Moreover, m1A in mRNA is reversible by ALKBH3, a known DNA/RNA demethylase. Lastly, we show that m1A methylation responds dynamically to stimuli, and we identify hundreds of stress-induced m1A sites. Collectively, our approaches allow comprehensive analysis of m1A modification and provide tools for functional studies of potential epigenetic regulation via the reversible and dynamic m1A methylation.

DESIGN
Identification of m1A sites in human embryonic kidney cells. Comparisons of m1A profiles of wild type HEK293T with ALKBH3 knock out cell line reveals the ALKBH3 specific sites. Stress inducible m1A sites are also identified by comparing the profiles of untreated cells with stress treated cells.
