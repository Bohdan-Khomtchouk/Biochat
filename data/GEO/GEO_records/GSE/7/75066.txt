TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of mitosis, early G1, late G1 and G2 in mouse pluripotent cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We provide the genome-wide map of Esrrb binding in mitotic and asynchronous ES cells together with the Esrrb-induced transcriptomic changes in early G1, late G1 and G2.

DESIGN
Mitotic cells were obtained by mitotic shake-off and used for Esrrb ChIP-Seq studies. Cell-cycle RNA-Seq was performed on FACS-purified populations using a Ccna2-Gfp reporter
