TITLE
Copy Number Variation of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) from the Thailand Initiative in Genomics and Expression Research for Liver Cancer (TIGER-LC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix SNP6.0 microarray profiling to analyze Copy Number Variation in tumor and paired non-tumor tissue of HCC and CCA patients. We used copy number data to confirm molecular subgroups of HCC and CCA patients from Thailand

DESIGN
For profiling of copy number, tumors and paired non-tumor tissues were profiled separately using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Nsp/Sty 6.0 according to the manufacturer's protocol.
