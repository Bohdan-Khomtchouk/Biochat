TITLE
Gene expression profiling of pediatric adrenocortical tumors of patients treated on the Children's Oncology Group XXX protocol.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have previously observed that expression of HLA genes associate with histology of adrenocortical tumors (PMID 17234769). Here, we used gene expression microarrays to associate the diagnostic tumor expression of these genes with outcome among 34 patients treated on the COG ARAR0332 protocol.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to explore the expression profiles of a large group of uniformly-treated pediatric adrenocortical carcinomas. Specimens were harvested during surgery and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen to preserve tissue integrity.
