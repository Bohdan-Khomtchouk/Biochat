TITLE
Functional roles of Aves class specific cis-regulatory elements on macroevolution of bird-specific features

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We carried out a comparative genomic analysis of 48 avian species to identify avian-specific highly conserved elements (ASHCEs). We performed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for three enhancer-associated histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K27me3), to investigate dynamic regulatory roles of ASHCEs in chicken development. We found that all three enhancer-associated histone marks are enriched in ASHCEs compared to the whole genome background.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analyses for three known enhancer-associated histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K27ac and H3K27me3) with samples from developing chicken embryos at stages HH16, HH21 and HH32 respectively and samples from developing limbs at stages HH21 and HH32 respectively with two biological replicates.
