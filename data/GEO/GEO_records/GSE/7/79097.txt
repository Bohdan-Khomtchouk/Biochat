TITLE
Cell density effects on normal astrocytes and glioma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioma cells and normal astrocytes were plated at low and high density to compare density-dependent gene expression.

DESIGN
Primary glioma cells were splated at either sparse plating density (5x104 cells/mL) or dense (3x105 cell/mL).  NHAs were plated at either sparse plating density (3.5x105 cells/55cm2 dish) or dense (5.2x106/55cm2 dish) at a final conc of 5x104 cells/mL and 3x105 cell/mL.  Cells were incubated for 5 days prior to RNA harvest.
