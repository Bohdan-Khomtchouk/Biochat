TITLE
eHSP70 promotes osteogenesis of hMSCs through activating ERK signaling pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Heat shock proteins are highly conserved proteins that, when produced intracellularly, protect stress exposed cells. It has been suggested that extracellular Hsp70 has both protective and deleterious effects. Our study showed eHSP70 increased the ALP activity, promoted mineralization and up-regulated osteogenesis-related markers. We used microarrays to determine the differentially expressed genes and identify revelant pathways through pathway enrichment analysis.

DESIGN
hMSCs were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays  after 3-day culture. The experimental group was treated with HSP70 (200ng/ml) during osteogenic differentiation and control group without it.
