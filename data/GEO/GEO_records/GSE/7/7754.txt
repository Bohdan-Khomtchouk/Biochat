TITLE
Identification of human miR-34a-responsive transcripts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to examine the consequences of human miR-34a induction on the transcriptome, HCT116 cells (a colon cancer cell line) were infected with a retrovirus that produces miR-34a.  Gene expression profiles were then monitored using Affymetrix microarrays. Affymetrix microarrays were used to examine the transcriptomes of HCT116 cells infected with an empty retroviral vector (pMSCV-PIG) or a retroviral vector that expresses human miR-34a. Keywords: comparison of cells with or without enforced miR-34a expression
