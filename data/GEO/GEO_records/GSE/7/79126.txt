TITLE
circular RNA profiling of LT-HSCs and MPPs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of circular RNAs that have a higher expression level in LT-HSCs

DESIGN
Arraystar Mouse circRNA Array analysis of circular RNA expression profiling using sorted LT-HSC and MPP samples from C57/BL6 strain. Total RNA from each sample was quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000. The sample preparation and microarray hybridization were performed based on the Arraystarâ€™s standard protocols.
