TITLE
Cardiac adiposity is regulated by Klf4 and c-Myc

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we examined if KLF4 and c-MYC (KM)-transduced murine cardiac mesenchymal progenitors (CMPs) played a role in the differentiation into adipocytes in the absence of adipogenic stimulation cocktails. These progenitors exhibited increased expression of adipogenic-related genes, such as C/EBPα, PPARγ, and Fabp4, activation of the PPAR signaling pathway, and formation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets within 10 days. Moreover, these KM genes sharply increased following a reperfusion insult, resulting in increased ectopic fat formation. Thus, understanding CMP adipogenesis will clarify the pathophysiology of ischemic reperfusion injury and myocardial infarction and may pave the way for better treatment strategies.

DESIGN
Adult mouse cardiac mesenchymal progenitor cells were treated with OSKM for 0, 4, 6, or 8 days.
