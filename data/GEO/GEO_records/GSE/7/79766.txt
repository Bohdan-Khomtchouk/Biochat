TITLE
Toxicity of nano- and ionic silver to embryonic stem cells – a comparative toxicogenomic study

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic changes induced by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) during spontaneous differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were characterized and compared to those induced by Ag+ under otherwise identical conditions. C57BL/6 mESCs were allowed to differentiate after embryoid body (EB) formation and were exposed to 5.0 µg/ml 20 nm AgNPs or 5.0 µg/ml Ag+ for 24 h.

DESIGN
RNA samples were collected at 24 h after exposure. Three replicates were included for each experimental condition.
