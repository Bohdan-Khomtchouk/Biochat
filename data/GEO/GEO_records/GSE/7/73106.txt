TITLE
Expression profiling of PEG induced water stress responsive genes in Eucalyptus grandis

ORGANISM
Eucalyptus

SUMMARY
The study was conducted to identify differentially expressed polyethylene glycol (PEG) induced water stress responsive genes in E. grandis. Forty day old rooted cutting of E. grandis was subjected to -0.225 MPa PEG treatment and total RNA was isolated from leaves of water treated control and PEG treated samples after three hours of treatment. The differential expression of water stress responsive genes was analyzed using microarray technique.
