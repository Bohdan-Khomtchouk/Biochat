TITLE
Chromosome 20q amplification regulates in vitro response to Kinesin-5 inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified gene expression signatures predicting responsiveness to a Kinesin-5 (kinesin spindle protein, KIF11) inhibitor (Kinesin-5i) in cultured colon tumor cell lines.  Genes predicting resistance to Kinesin-5i were enriched for those from chromosome 20q, a region of frequent amplification in a number of tumor types.  siRNAs targeting genes in this chromosomal region identified AURKA, TPX2 and MYBL2 as genes whose disruption enhances response to Kinesin-5i.  Taken together, our results show functional interaction between these genes, and suggest that overexpression of AURKA, TPX2 and MYBL2 is functionally involved in resistance to Kinesin-5i.  Furthermore, our results suggest that patients whose tumors overexpress AURKA due to amplifications of 20q will be more likely to resist treatment with Kinesin-5 inhibitor, and that inactivation of AURKA may sensitize these patients to treatment.
