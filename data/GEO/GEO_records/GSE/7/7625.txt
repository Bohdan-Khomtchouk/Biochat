TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of an oxidative stress-induced rat renal carcinogenesis model

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
An iron chelate, ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA), induces oxidative renal tubular damage that subsequently leads to renal cell carcinoma in rodents.  Here we used gene expression microarrays to find target oncogenes in this model.  Network analysis of the gene expression microarray data revealed the involvement of beta-catenin pathway in the induced cancers. Keywords: dose response, disease state analysis
