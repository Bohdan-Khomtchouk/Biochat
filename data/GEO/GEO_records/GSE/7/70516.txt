TITLE
miRNA expression of livers of liver-specific Hnf4a-null (Hnf4aΔH) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Of 610 miRNAs, expression of 24 and 19 miRNAs was down-regulated or up-regulated more than 2-fold in Hnf4aΔH mice as compared to control (Hnf4af/f) mice

DESIGN
In the study presented here, in order to identifiy the target genes for hepatic HNF4a, hepatic expression profiles of a total of 610 unique miRNA genes in Hnf4aΔH mice were investigated as compared with Hnf4af/f mice
