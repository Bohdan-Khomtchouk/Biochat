TITLE
Spatial intratumor heterogeneity of epigenetic alterations in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is among the most common malignancies, but little is known about the spatial intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and the temporal clonal evolutionary processes in this cancer. Interestingly, the epigenetic profiling also showed strong evidence of spatial ITH, and the phyloepigenetic trees were extremely similar with the phylogenetic ones, indicating the interplay and co-dependency of genetic and epigenetic alterations in ESCC. We found that several genes were both mutated and hypermethylated at their promoters, such as ASXL1 and EPHA7. Our integrated investigations of the spatial ITH and the temporal clonal evolution might provide insights into developing biomarkers for early diagnosis of ESCC, as well as personalized therapeutic targets for treating this malignancy.

DESIGN
DNA methylation profiles of 12 tumor regions and 2 matched normal esophageal epithelial tissues from three M-WES-examined ESCC cases (ESCC01, ESCC03 and ESCC05) were performed using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at the Epigenome Center of University of Southern California.
