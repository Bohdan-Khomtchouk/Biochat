TITLE
Comprehensive Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs in Purified Cell Types from the Brain Reveals Functional LncRNA in OPC Fate Determination (RNA-Seq of differentiated NSC after lnc-OPC knockdown)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To quantitative analysis of transcriptome changes caused by lnc-OPC knockdown during OPC differentiation from NSC, lentivirus-based short hairpin RNAs were used to knockdown the lnc-OPC expression in a neural stem cell culture . Subsequently, puromycin-selected NSCs were differentiated to OPC in culture for three days.RNA-Seq was performed on the polyadenylated fraction of RNA isolated from cell samples. DEseq was used for differential gene expression analysis caused by lnc-OPC knockdown. GO functional term enrichment analysis of differential gene expression caused by lnc-OPC knockdown, revealed significant enrichment of ‘oligodendrocyte development’, ‘oligodendrocyte differentiation’, ‘glia cell development’, and ‘axon ensheathment’ terms that are associated with oligodendrogenesis.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of differentiiated NSC samples after lnc-OPC knockdown by RNA-sequencing.
