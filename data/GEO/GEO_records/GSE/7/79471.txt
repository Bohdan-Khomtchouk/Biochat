TITLE
Gene expression profiling in male rat germ cells after chronic cyclophosphamide treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To further understand the effects of chronic cyclophosphamide treatment on spermatogenesis, we used whole genome microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids from treated and control male rats.

DESIGN
Pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids from rats treated chronically with cyclophosphamide were isolated and profiled for changes in gene expression.
