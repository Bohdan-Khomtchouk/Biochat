TITLE
Changes in gene expression in primary human white preadipocytes in response to knockdown of DPP4

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of primary human white preadipocytes after infection with lentiviral vector either containing shRNA directed against dipeptidypeptidase 4 (DPP4) or unspecific shRNA as negative control

DESIGN
Treatment of cells with DPP4 shRNA or control shRNA was done in 4 biological replicates, the first sample of DPP4 KD was hybridized against the first sh-control sample, the second DPP4 smple against the second control sample and so on
