TITLE
Chameau Activates Transcription with Enhancer of Acetyltransferase Chameau (EAChm) in vitro

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We identified a novel co-activator EAChm which enhances histone acetyation and transcription with acetytransferase chameau.

DESIGN
Drosophila S2 cell mRNA profile of control, EAChm and chameau K.D. were generated by deep sequencing in duplicate, using illumina MiSeq.
