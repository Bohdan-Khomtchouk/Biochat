TITLE
Bile's chronic effect on the Cystic Fibrosis lung pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Many patients with Cystic Fibrosis suffer from Gastroeosphgeal Refux Disease (GERD).  This disease may lead to the aspiration of bile into the lungs.  We invesigated the effect of bile on the CF lung pathogen P. aeruginosa. We analysed gene expression profiles, comparing bile treated and untreated cells to identified distinct classes of up/down-regulated genes.
