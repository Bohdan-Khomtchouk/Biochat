TITLE
Transcriptional changes in Lhx8 Null newborn mouse ovaries

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lhx8 is a homeobox gene expressed in oocytes and critical in oogenesis. Lhx8 deficiency leads to rapid loss of postnatal oocytes. Early oocyte differentiation is poorly understood. We hypothesized that lack of Lhx8 perturbs global expression of genes preferentially expressed in oocytes.  We compared Lhx8 knockout and wild type ovaries using Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarray platform. Keywords: Genetic Modification
