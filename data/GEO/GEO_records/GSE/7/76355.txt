TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human c-Kit mutant D816V

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To decipher molecular targets responsible for c-Kit mutant D816V mediated hematopoietic malignancy, we employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify important gene targets downstream of c-Kit mutant D816V expressing cells compared to wild-type c-Kit.

DESIGN
Agilent one-color experiment, Organism: Human, Agilent-Custom Whole Genome Human 8x60k designed by Genotypic Technology Pvt. Ltd. (AMADID: 27114), Labeling kit: Agilent Quick-Amp labeling Kit (p/n:5190-0444).
