TITLE
Ribosome profiling on polysomes extracted via sucrose gradient and IP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Technical feasibility study to determine data quality and reproducibilty. Ribosome profiling was performed by either sucrose gradient (SG) or immunoprecipitation (IP).

DESIGN
1 sucrose gradient sample, 2 immunoprecipitation samples in two concentrations of beads
