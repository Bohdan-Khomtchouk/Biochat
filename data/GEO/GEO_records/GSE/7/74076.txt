TITLE
Gene expression in endometrium and corpus luteum of Holstein cows selected for high and low fertility

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Our hypothesis was that genes differentially expressed in the endometrium and corpus luteum on day 13 of the estrous cycle between cows with either good or poor genetic merit for fertility would be enriched for genetic variants associated with fertility. We combined a unique genetic model of fertility (cattle which have been selected for high and low fertility and show substantial difference in fertility), with gene expression data from these cattle, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) results in ~20,000 cattle, to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions and sequence variants associated with genetic variation in fertility.

DESIGN
26 samples total; 8 Fert+ (high fertility) endometrium, 6 Fert- (low fertility) endometrium; 7 Fert+ corpus luteum, 5 Fert- corpus luteum; Fert+ Fert- differential gene expression analysis
