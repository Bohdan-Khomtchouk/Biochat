TITLE
Melanoma cell lines involved in the p14ARF genotype analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
35 Melanoma cell lines hybridized to Affymetrix Hu133_Plus 2 microarrays were analysed for genes differentially expressed between cell lines carrying wild-type p14ARF and those with mutant 14ARF. All of these cell lines contained wild-type p53 (so that the effects of p14ARF mutations could be analysed without contamination from p53). Keywords: Affymetrix Hu133_Plus microarrays
