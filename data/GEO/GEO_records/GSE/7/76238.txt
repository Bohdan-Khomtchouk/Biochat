TITLE
Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data of mouse genome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RRBS was used to analyse global imprinting gene methylation pattern of offspring from the in vitro derived spermatids like cells and normal control

DESIGN
Global imprinting gene methylation pattern comparision of two offspring (one male and one female) from the in vitro derived spermatids like cells and two normal control mice (one male and one female)
