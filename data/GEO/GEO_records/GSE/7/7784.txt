TITLE
Expression profiling of double negative thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to understand the molecular mechanisms of DN thymocyte development, it may be also of use to clarify how these developmental processes are regulated in terms of their entire gene expression, to which cell differentiation is ultimately ascribed. In the current study, we approached this issue by investigating gene expression profiles in discrete subsets of DN thymocytes under development, in which DN2, DN3, and DN4 thymocytes were sorted and subjected to expression profiling analysis with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. Keywords: developmental stages
