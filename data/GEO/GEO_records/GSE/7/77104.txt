TITLE
Expression data from cultured mouse macrophages treated with fatty acids or LPS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the transcriptional responses of mouse macrophages treated with unsaturated or saturated fatty acids to macrophages treated with LPS to stimulate classical inflammatory activation. Microarray profiling was performed on total RNA isolated from primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with fatty acids (C18:1 oleic acid or C18:0 stearic acid), BSA vehicle, or LPS at two time points.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from n=3-4 biological replicates of BMDMs derived from wild type C57Bl/6 mice treated with 250 μM oleic acid (OA) or stearic acid (SA) for 5 h or 20 h, 125 μM BSA for 4 h (vehicle control), or 1 ng/mL LPS for 4h.
