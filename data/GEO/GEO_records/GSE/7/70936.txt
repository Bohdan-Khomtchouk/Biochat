TITLE
Global ovary gene interaction network structure informs biological effects of Chemical stressors

ORGANISM
Pimephales promelas

SUMMARY
Background: Complex biological networks control fundamental processes such as reproduction. The relationship of network structure to biological function was investigated in a global gene interaction network developed from ovary tissues of the model fish, fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Results: A global ovary gene interaction network was inferred from gene expression in ovaries of fathead minnow representing 288 different exposure conditions and 1,472 microarrays. More than 74 percent of the interactions in two subnetworks and 37% of the connections in a third subnetwork were also present as known connections found in curated databases and the literature. Subnetworks within the network were enriched in specific pathways and key ovarian functions. The network location of differentially expressed genes from different ovary stages was consistent with known functional changes at those stages. The global network provide additional insight into gene function when gene directly linked to differentially expressed genes are considered in enrichment analysis. Analysis of the impact of bisphenol A on ovarian gene expression demonstrated that the network provides an informative frame work in which to investigate mechanisms by which chemical effects occur. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the ovary transcriptional network is composed of several connected subnetworks where each is enriched in specific functions. Construction of a global gene regulatory network from multiple experiments provides valuable insight into the function of genes and the impact of chemicals on biological systems.

DESIGN
total RNA from the ovary tissue of treated or control fish labeled in single color was hybridized to Agilent fathead minnow microarray (design 019597)
