TITLE
Development of gene expression signature for primary epidermal neonatal keratinocytes treated with mature IL-36B cytokine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Stimulated primary keratinocytes with mature IL-36B cytokine and analysed differential mRNA expression at 8 h timepoint.

DESIGN
IL-36B induced gene expression in primary human neonatal keratinocytes was measured at 8 hours after exposure to dose IL-36B (5 nM).
