TITLE
BTH-responsive rice genes

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Benzothiadiazole (BTH) is a so-called ‘plant activator’ and protects plants from diseases by activating the salicylic-acid (SA) signaling pathway. We identified BTH-responsive genes in rice leaves 24 h after treatment using rice 44K microarray. Keywords: response to chemical treatment
