TITLE
Endothelial matrix-metalloproteinase-10 promotes pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with systemic sclerosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pulmonary endothelial dysfunction plays an integral role in mediating the initiation and progression of pulmonary vascular remodelling, an important feature of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our aim was to decipher the gene expression program of endothelial cells derived from circulating endothelial progenitor (EPCs) to gain insight into the pathological process of PAH associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc), which is the most extreme vascular phenotype of this disease. We used microarrays to investigate the gene expression profile in late outgrowth EPC-derived endothelial cells issued from SSc-PAH patients, in comparison with SSc patients without PAH and healthy controls.

DESIGN
EPC-derived endothelial cells were isolated from peripheral blood of PAH-SSc patients, SSc patients without PAH and healthy control for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Gene expression profiles of EPC-derived endothelial cells were determined in basal conditions and also after hypoxic exposure.
