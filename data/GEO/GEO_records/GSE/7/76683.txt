TITLE
RNA-seq expression data from FL-HSPCs after HOXA7 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HOXA7 regulates FL-HSPC self-renewal in vitro and in vivo. We profiled  FL-HSPCs after HOXA7 knockdown, to assess the gene expression programs regulated by HOXA7.

DESIGN
CD34+CD38-CD43+CD90+ HSPCs were infected with lentiviral shRNA vector targeting HOXA7 (sh-HOXA7). The emtpy lentiviral vector (LKO) was used as a control. Cells were expanded on op9 for 5 days and selected for puromicin resistance for 3 days, than sorted for HSPC immunophenotype.
