TITLE
MicroRNA-SEQ analysis of kidney and liver damage in rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Purpose : Identification of novel microRNA biomarkers in urine and plasma from rats with kidney or liver damage

DESIGN
micoRNA-SEQ was used to analyze changes in miRNA profiles of tissue, plasma and urine samples of rats treated with either a nephrotoxicant (cisplatin) or one of two hepatotoxicants (Acetaminophen [APAP] or Carbon Tetrachloride [CCL4]).
