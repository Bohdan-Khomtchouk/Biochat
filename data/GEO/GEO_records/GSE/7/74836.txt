TITLE
Sigma38 binding sites in E. Coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq to identify sigma38 binding sites in wild-type and delta ssrS (6S RNA knockout) strains of E. Coli K-12 MG1655, during stationary phase

DESIGN
ChIP-seq using antibody against sigma38 in wild-type and ssrS deletion strain. Two replicates for wild type and one replicate for ssrS deletion.
