TITLE
Expression data from porcelain crabs following heat stress

ORGANISM
Petrolisthes cinctipes

SUMMARY
Porcelain crabs, Petrolisthes cinctipes, live in the marine intertidal zone and routinely experience thermal stress.  Genes involved in heat shock responses are generally upregulated following heat stress and genes involved in oxidative energy production are downregulated following heat stress We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying responses to thermal stress and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: time course
