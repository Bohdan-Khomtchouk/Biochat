Gene expression profiles of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colon tissues from Pla2g10 knockout mice and their wild-type littemates

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Within the secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) family, group X sPLA2 (sPLA2-X) has the highest capacity to hydrolyze cellular membranes and has long been thought to promote inflammation by releasing arachidonic acid (AA), a precursor of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Unexpectedly, we found that transgenic mice globally overexpressing human sPLA2-X (PLA2G10-Tg) displayed striking immunosuppressive and lean phenotypes with lymphopenia and increased M2-like macrophages, accompanied by marked elevation of free omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites. Studies using Pla2g10-deficient mice revealed that endogenous sPLA2-X, which is highly expressed in the colon epithelium and spermatozoa, mobilized omega-3 PUFAs or their metabolites to protect against dextran sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and to promote fertilization, respectively. In colitis, sPLA2-X deficiency increased colorectal expression of Th17 cytokines, and omega-3 PUFAs attenuated their production by lamina propria cells partly through the fatty acid receptor GPR120. In comparison, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2alpha) protects from colitis by mobilizing w6 AA metabolites including prostaglandin E2. Thus, our results underscore a previously unrecognized role of sPLA2-X as an omega-3 PUFA mobilizer in vivo, segregated mobilization of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA metabolites by sPLA2-X and cPLA2alpha, respectively, in protection against colitis, and the novel role of a particular sPLA2-X-driven PUFA in fertilization.

DESIGN
4 different samples (1-4) mixed with colon from 3 mice, respectively; Wild-type (WT; 1, 3) and Pla2g10 knockout (X-KO; 2, 4); steady-state (Na√Øve; 1, 2) and DSS-induced colitis (DSS; 3, 4); A comparison between X-KO versus WT and DSS-induced colitis versus steady-state.
