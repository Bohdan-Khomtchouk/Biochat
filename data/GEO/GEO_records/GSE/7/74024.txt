TITLE
Discovery and profiling conserved and novel miRNAs involved in ovule development of Ginkgo biloba by deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Ginkgo biloba

SUMMARY
High-throughput small RNA sequencing were performed to identify a large number of miRNAs and their targets in mature  G. biloba ovules. Our study is the first to provide useful information for uncovering the regulatory networks of miRNAs in basal gymnosperm G. biloba ovules.

DESIGN
small RNAÂ sequencing in ovules of G. biloba
