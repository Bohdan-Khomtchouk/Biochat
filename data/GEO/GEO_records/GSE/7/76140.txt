TITLE
Initial seeding of the embryonic thymus by an immune-restricted lympho-myeloid progenitor independently of Notch signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of purified thymopoiesis-initiating progenitors/early thymic progenitors, lymphoid primed multipotent progenitors (LMPP) and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from E11.5, E12.5, E13.5 embryos, neonatal (1 week old) and adult (8 weeks old) mice

DESIGN
Differentially expressed genes analysis
