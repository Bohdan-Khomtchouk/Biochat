TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of drought-related genes in modulating metabolic processes in Lolium multiflorum

ORGANISM
Lolium multiflorum

SUMMARY
Drought is a major environmental stress that limits growth and development of cool-season annual grasses. Drought transcriptional profiles of resistant and susceptible lines were studied to understand the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance in annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.). A total of 4,718 genes exhibited significant differential expression in two L. multiflorum lines. Additionally, up-regulated genes associated with drought response in the resistant lines were compared with susceptible lines. Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analyses revealed that genes partially encoding drought-responsive proteins as key regulators were significantly involved in carbon metabolism, lipid metabolism, and signal transduction. Comparable gene expression was used to identify the genes that contribute to the high drought tolerance in resistant lines of L. multiflorum.

DESIGN
A total of 12 samples are analyzed.And ten individual plants were pooled to create one treatment, and two biological replicates were used for all RNA-Seq experiments from each treatment. Please note that Unigenes of all samples are provided in fasta format (series supplementary file)
