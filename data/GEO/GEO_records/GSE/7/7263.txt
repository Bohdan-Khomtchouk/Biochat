SUMMARY
These 12 arrays are the basis for Figure 1 of the " An interferon-response induced by tumor-stroma interaction in a subset of human breast cancers " manuscript.  Figure 1: Effect of heterotypic interaction between breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 and CCL-171 fibroblast. Biologically independent replicates of the mono-cultured fibroblast CCL-171, the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 and the mixed co-culture of CCL-171 and MDA-MB231 were grown for 48h at low serum conditions and characterized by DNA microarray hybridization. Hierarchical clustering of a total of 4333 elements that display a greater than 3-fold variance in expression in more than 3 different experimental samples. Data from individual elements or genes are represented as single rows, and different experiments are shown as columns. Red and green denote expression levels of the samples. The intensity of the color reflects the magnitude of the deviation from baseline. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the experiments grouped the biological replicates together. Gene expression varied considerably between fibroblast and MDA-MB231 as expected for cells of mesenchymal or epithelial origin respectively. The co-culture profile showed mainly intermediate expression levels. However, the vertical black bar marks a cluster of genes induced in all co-cultures compared to both mono-cultures indicating that they are induced by heterotypic interaction Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
