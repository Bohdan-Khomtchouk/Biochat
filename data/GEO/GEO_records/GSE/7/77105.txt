TITLE
MicroRNAs 24 and 27 suppress allergic inflammation and target a network of regulators of T helper-2 cell-associated cytokine production

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of cell fate decisions in immune responses. They act by coordinate repression of multiple target genes, a property that we exploited to uncover regulatory networks that govern T helper-2 (Th2) cells. A functional screen of individual miRNAs in primary T cells uncovered multiple miRNAs that inhibited  Th2 cell differentiation. Among these were miR-24 and miR-27, miRNAs coexpressed from two genomic clusters, which each functioned independently to limit interleukin-4 (IL-4) production. Mice lacking both clusters in T cells displayed increased Th2 cell responses and tissue pathology in a mouse model of asthma. Gene expression and pathway analyses placed miR-27 upstream of genes known to regulate Th2 cells. They also identified targets not previously associated with Th2 cell biology which regulated IL-4 production in unbiased functional testing. Thus, elucidating the biological function and target repertoire of miR-24 and miR-27 reveals regulators of Th2 cell biology.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of miRNA-deficient mouse CD4+ T cells transfected with miRNA mimics twice over a 5 day in vitro culture in the presence of low amounts of exogenous IL-4 (10U/ml). Cells transfected with either miR-23, miR-24 or miR-27 were compared to cells transfected with a control mimic.  Data are from at least biologic triplicates.
