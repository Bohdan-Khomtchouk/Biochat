TITLE
Sex-Biased Gene Expression and Sequence Conservation in Pacific and Atlantic Salmon Lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis)

ORGANISM
Lepeophtheirus salmonis

SUMMARY
This study investigates sex-biased gene expression between populations of Atlantic and Pacific salmon lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Two Atlantic L. salmonis populations were previously used for an array study (GSE56024) while a third dataset using Pacific L. salmonis was novel. Using all three populations, a consensus-based, meta-analysis approach was used to identify sex-biased and sex-specific genes.

DESIGN
Two separate experiments were conducted, one for Atlantic and one for Pacific salmon lice. As the Atlantic data has been previously published for other comparisons (GSE56024), only the Pacific data is uploaded here. Lice from three populations (2 in the Atlantic and 1 in the Pacific) were collected for in vitro bioassay analysis using emamectin benzoate. After 24hrs, lice were collected as per treatment protocol below. Males and females from all populations were compared separately before forming a consensus probe list of sex-biased genes concordantly expressed across all three populations. Please note that each raw data file contains three or four 'block' data and each block data correspond to individual sample raw data. Therefore, each raw data file contains raw data for 3-4 samples (as indicated in the description field).
