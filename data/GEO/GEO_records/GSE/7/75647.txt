TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from lung tissue of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and usually lethal lung disease characterized by unknown causes and few treatment options We used microarray to determine the expression of miRNA and 17 miRNAs were differentially expressed in IPF lungs, including 10 upregulated and 7 downregulated miRNAs.

DESIGN
Lung tissue was obtained from 4 IPF patients with histological evidence of usual interstitial pneumonia at the time of surgical lung biopsy or lung transplantation. The diagnosis of IPF was derived according to the standards accepted by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society. Histological normal lung tissues used as controls was obtained from 3 patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax at the time of thoracoscopy with stapling of any air leak.The miRNA expression profile was determined by Affymetrix microarray, and transcriptome with Affymetrix array
