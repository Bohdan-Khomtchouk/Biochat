TITLE
Inhibition of MYCN by a PNA anti-gene in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective was to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for in vitro and in vivo efficacy of an anti-MYCN peptide nucleic acid on a preclinical model of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Cells treated with a anti-MYCN PNA exhibit growth arrest and apoptosis, and in vivo tumor growth is blocked. Keywords: oncogene inhibition
