TITLE
Expression profile of peripheral blood of healthy individuals phenotyped  based on “Prakriti” concept of Ayurveda

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Immense phenotypic variability exists among healthy individuals which is a consequence of both genetic and environmental effects. Genome wide expression variability is a powerful tool for capturing these expression variations and hence can give insights into genotype phenotype correlations. In the ancient Indian system of medicine, of Ayurveda, the basic tenet for treatment relies on phenotypic assessment In this system, assessment of predisposition,  susceptibility or prognosis for  disease is based on the phenotypic assessment of the individual. Each individuals has a basic constitution which is termed as Prakriti, majorly decided by the relative concentration of three constituents called doshas - Vata (kinetic) Pitta (metabolic) and Kapha (structural) at the time of fertilization. Phenotypically, depending on the concentration the  normal individuals can be classified onto 7 basic types of which 3 are more distinct and are called as Pure Prakriti and the rest of the 4 groups are of mixed types. Pure Prakriti individuals have one of the doshas in more prominence than the other. In this study individuals of Pure Prakrities  have been  selected for elucidation of the transcriptomic variation  in peripheral whole blood cells. Keywords: Gene expression variability within healthy individuals, subgrouped on the basis of Prakriti (basic constitution of an individual based on Ayurveda)
