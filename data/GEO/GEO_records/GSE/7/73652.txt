TITLE
Gene expression analysis of uveal melanoma Class 1 tumors with and without metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Uveal melanoma can be classified by gene expression profiling (GEP) into Class 1 (low metastatic risk) and Class 2 (high metastatic risk), the latter being strongly associated with mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressor BAP1. Nevertheless, a small percentage of Class 1 tumors give rise to metastatic disease, and the purpose of this study was to identify biomarkers of metastasis in Class 1 tumors.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from tumor samples that were collected at the time of enucleation
