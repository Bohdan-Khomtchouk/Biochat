TITLE
Genome-wide maps of PBX3-binding site

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the high-throughput profiling of PBX3-binding sites under liver cancer stem cell reprogramming driven by PBX3 overexpression. By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide PBX3-binding maps of SMMC-7721 cells. This study provides a prediction of regulated genes by the PBX3.

DESIGN
Examination of PBX3-binding sites in SMMC-7721 cell with overexpression PBX3. The fragmented DNA was precipitated with a PBX3 antibody.
