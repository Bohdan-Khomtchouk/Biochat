TITLE
Effect of siRNA mediated silencing of lncRNA NRCP in cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) significantly influence the development and regulation of genome expression in cells. Here, we demonstrate the role of lncRNA ceruloplasmin (NRCP) in cancer metabolism and elucidate functional effects leading to increased tumor progression. NRCP was highly upregulated in ovarian tumors and knockdown of NRCP resulted in significantly increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation, and decreased glycolysis compared with control cancer cells. In an orthotopic mouse model of ovarian cancer, siNRCP delivered via a liposomal carrier significantly reduced tumor growth compared with control treatment. We identified NRCP as an intermediate binding partner between STAT1 and RNA polymerase II, leading to increased expression of downstream target genes such as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. Collectively, we report a previously unrecognized role of the lncRNA NRCP in modulating cancer metabolism. DOPC nanoparticle-incorporated siRNA-mediated silencing of this lncRNA in vivo demonstrates the first known preclinical model indicating therapeutic potential of modulating lncRNAs in cancer.

DESIGN
SKOV3 cells were treated with sicontrol and siNRCP for 48hrs. All the tretaments were done in triplicates.
