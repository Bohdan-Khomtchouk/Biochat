TITLE
Investigation of MET copy number in various cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment investigates In Vitro and In Vivo Activity of AMG 337, a Potent and Selective MET Kinase Inhibitor, in MET-Dependent Cancer Models.  The goal of this study was to examine the effects of AMG337 on proliferation in cancer cell lines with varying MET copy number, the hypothesis being that high-level focal MET amplification is required to confer MET oncogene addiction and AMG337 sensitivity.

DESIGN
Each of 21 cancer cell lines hybridized competitively against a pooled human male reference genomic DNA to determine CNV through array CGH.
