TITLE
Inefficient translation of nsrR constrains behavior of the NsrR regulon in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 nsrR with AUG start codon compared to the wild type nsrR (with a GUG start codon) and to the control lacking the nsrR gene. Conversion of the nsrR start codon from the wild type GUG to AUG increased the efficiency of translation and had measurable effects on the expression patterns of some NsrR regulated genes.
