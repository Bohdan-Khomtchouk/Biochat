TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and prognosis of patients with HCC still remain unsatisfactory. Therefore, more reliable biomarkers for predicting the disease and understanding the mechanisms underlying cancer development need to be found out urgently. In this study, we explored the clinical significance and role of ALDOB, G6PD in HCC pathogenesis. Here we show that low ALDOB expression with high G6PD expression lead to patients' poor survival and prognosis by remodeling metabolic pathway and increasing tumor proliferation and metastasis. Stat5a regulates ALDOB expression positively but negatively to G6PD expression in mRNA level, simultaneously, ALDOB inhibits G6PD enzymatic activity by protein-protein interaction and we have found one of their interaction sites in ALDOB. These data suggest that ALDOB and G6PD could be potential biomarkers for HCC.

DESIGN
We analyzed tissues from 5 hepatocellular carcinoma patients using the GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Array. Affymetrix microarray assays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on total RNA isolated from patients' tissues. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Exon Array Computational Tool. No techinical replicates were performed.
