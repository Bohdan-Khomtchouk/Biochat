TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of SIV-specific CXCR5+ and CXCR5- CD8+ lymphocytes in rhesus macaques infected with SIVmac251 and SIVE660

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
CD8+ T-cells inhibit virus replication in SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RM). However, it is not clear how SIV infection is controlled in germinal center during chronic SIV infection and limited information exists on the characteristics of CXCR5+ CD8 T cells during chronic SIV/HIV infection. In this study, we used functional genomics to investigate characteristic features and potential mechanisms of CXCR5+ and CXCR5- SIV specific CD8 T cells for the control of pathogenic SIV infection.  Six chronically SIV infected RMs, three SIVE660 infected and three SIV mac251 infected that are positive for Mamu A01 allele were selected and SIV-specific CXCR5+ and CXCR5- CD8 T cells were sorted  based on CXCR5 expression. RNA from sorted cells were extracted and microarray were performed and analysed. Principal component analysis demonstrated that overall gene expression difference between CXCR5+ and CXCR5- SIV-specific CD8 T cells. Interestingly, the CXCR5+ CD8 T cells revealed a distinct gene signature pattern when compared to CXCR5- CD8 T cells. Unlike the CXCR5- CD8 T cells, the CXCR5+ CD8 T cells expressed higher levels of genes associated with Tfh CD4 T cells such as the master transcription factor Bcl6, CD200, and CTLA4 as well as markers associated with Th2 CD4 T cells such as IL-4R (CD124), CCR4, STAT6, NFATC, and IL-10. Effector molecules typically observed in cytotoxic CD8 T cells such as granzyme A, B, and K were expressed at lower levels on CXCR5+ CD8 T cells compared to their CXCR5- counterparts. CXCR5+ CD8 T cells also expressed higher levels of molecules associated with co-stimulation/antigen presentation such as CD40, CD83, 41BBL and MAMU-DRA. The CXCR5+ CD8 also expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors such as CD200 and SPRY2 but lower levels of other inhibitory receptors CD160 and CD244. The functional consequence of the expression of these molecules is yet to be determined. Additionally, CXCR5+ CD8 T cells expressed higher levels of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and lower levels of the pro-apoptotic gene annexin, suggestive of their better survival potential during chronic SIV infection. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SIV specific CXCR5+ CD8 T cells possess a unique gene expression signature compared to SIV-specific CXCR5- CD8 T cells.

DESIGN
A total of 12 RNA samples were hybridized on to Rhesus Affymetrix 3' Expression arrays. The study was composed of 6 replicate rhesus macaques subjected to SIVmac251or SIVE660 infection. Samples were taken at various time points during acute and chronic infection (week 24), after CD8+ cell depletion, after CD8+ cell reconstition, and during ART suppression of virus.
