TITLE
Gene expression in brain tissue from MOG-immunized wild-type or C57BL/6Je/e mice at disease maximum.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neuroprotective effects of NDP-MSH. We have characterized the signaling down-stream of melanocortin-1 receptor ligation to identify pathways mediating neuroprotective effects of NDP-MSH using transcriptional profiling. In this data set we included the expression data obtained from mouse brain tissue (MOG-immunized wild-type or C57BL/6Je/e mice at disease maximum, d14 after immunization). The data were used to obtain differentially regulated genes in wild-type or C57BL/6Je/e mice upon systemic NDP-MSH treatment.

DESIGN
In total, 8 samples were analyzed and we generated the following pariwise comparisons: wild-type NDP-MSH vs. PBS, C57BL/6Je/e NDP-MSH vs. PBS
