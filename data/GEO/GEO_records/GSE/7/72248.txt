TITLE
Expression data from the aortas of ApoE knockout, ApoE/Caspase-1 double knockout, and wild-type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Caspase-1 activation senses metabolic danger-associated molecular patterns and mediates the initiation of inflammation. Here, we reported that caspase-1 contributes to hyperlipidemia-induced modulation of vascular cell gene expression during early atherosclerosis in vivo. Our results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of caspase-1 inhibition in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

DESIGN
All mice were in a C57B/L6 strain background. Male wild-type mice, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene knockout mice, and ApoE/Caspase-1 double gene deficient mice were fed with high fat diet for 3 weeks starting from 8 weeks to induce early dyslipidemia.  At 11-week of age, aortas from these mice were used for microarray analysis. 5 biological replicates in each group.
