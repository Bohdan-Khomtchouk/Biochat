TITLE
Whole RNA sequencing to identify targets of the RNase domain protein encoded by rege-1 (C30F12.1)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The goal was to identify targets of the RNase REGE-1 by whole RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling of C.elegans young adults of rege-1 knockdown or mock RNAi control performed in N2 as well as glp-1 background
