TITLE
Next-generation sequencing analysis of transcriptom in gemcitabine resistant pancreatic cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Next-generation sequencing was applied to compare the transcriptom of 1) SW1990 human pancreatic cancer cell lines and its gemcitabine-resistant derivative established with long-term exposure in medium containing 100 nM gemcitabine; 2) TRA-1-81+ cells and TRA-1-81- cells isolated from SW1990 human pancreatic cancer cell line.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles were generated with SW1990 cell lines and its derivatives by deep sequencing, using Illumina-HiSeq2500.
