TITLE
TZD-induced beige fat activation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Beige fat cells dissipate energy through mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP1 defending against obesity and can be activated by thermogenic stimuli in white adipose tissue.  Here, we provide candidate molecules involved in beige fat activation induced the TZD, rosiglitazone.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of the differentiated inguinal fat cells in the absence or presence of 1 uM rosiglitazone for 4 d. These samples were profiled using Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arrays, 6 samples in total
