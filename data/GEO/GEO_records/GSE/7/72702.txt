TITLE
Gene expression profiling of skin in hidradenitis suppurativa

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To acquire a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HS, we performed mRNA microarray studies to compare gene expression in lesional skin to healthy skin of HS patients. A significant difference was observed in mRNA expression between lesional and clinically healthy skin of HS patients.

DESIGN
Skin biopsy samples (n=30, LS: lesion, NL: non-lesion) were collected at baseline from patients with hidradenitis for RNA extraction and microarray analysis.
