TITLE
Integrated mRNA and miRNA expression profiling in blood reveals candidate biomarkers associated with endurance exercise in horse (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
The adaptive response to extreme endurance exercise might involve transcriptional and translational regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs). Therefore, the aim of this study was to define an integrative analysis of blood transcriptome and miRNome in horses before and after a long endurance ride (160 km) using equine microarrays. A total of 2,453 genes and 162 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (DEG) between animals at rest and after the endurance ride. To gain understanding of the biological functions regulated by the differentially expressed miRNA, we used a hypergeometric test analysis. Notably, we detected 42 differentially expressed miRNAs that putatively regulate a total of 350 depleted DEGs, involved in glucose metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrion biogenesis, and immune response pathways. Graphical Gaussian models in an independent validation set of animals confirmed that 4 miRNAs could be strong candidate regulatory molecules for endurance exercise adaptation. This study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first integrated comprehensive overview of the miRNA-mRNA co-regulation networks that may play a central role in controlling post-transcriptomic regulations during endurance exercise in horses.

DESIGN
Sixty-one Arabian or half-breed Arabian horses (20 females and 41 geldings) aged 10 ± 2 years (±SEM) were recruited on voluntary basis of the owner on three 160 km endurance rides.
