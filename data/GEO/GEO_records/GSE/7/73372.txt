TITLE
AP-1 family members act at DNA targets in conjunction with Sox9 to promote chondrocyte hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A comprehensive analysis of Sox9 binding profiles in developing chondrocytes identified marked enrichment of an AP-1-like motif (Ohba et al. 2015). Here, we have explored the functional interplay between Sox9 and AP-1 in mammalian chondrocyte development. Among AP-1 family members, Jun and Fosl2 were highly expressed within prehypertrophic and early hypertrophic chondrocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) showed a striking overlap in Jun- and Sox9-bound regions throughout the chondrocyte genome, a reflection of direct binding of each factor to target motifs in shared enhancers, and physical interactions of AP-1 with Sox9. In vitro expression analysis indicates that direct co-binding of Sox9 and AP-1 at target motifs enhanced target gene expression, while protein-protein interactions suppressed AP-1- and Sox9-driven transcription. Analysis of prehypertrophic chondrocyte removal of Sox9 demonstrated Sox9 was essential for hypertrophic chondrocyte development, while in vitro and ex vivo analyses showed AP-1 promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy. Sox9 and Jun co-bound and co-activated a Col10a1 enhancer in Sox9 and AP-1 motif-dependent manners consistent with their combined action promoting hypertrophic gene expression. Together, the data support a model where AP-1-family members promote Sox9-action in the transition of chondrocytes to a terminal hypertrophic program.

DESIGN
Intersection of ChIP-seq data from Sox9 and AP-1 factor Jun, RNA-seq data from developing rib chondrocytes and Col10a1mCherry positive hypertrophic chondrocytes in neonatal mice to uncover regulation of Sox9 by AP-1 factors during chondrocyte hypertrophy.
