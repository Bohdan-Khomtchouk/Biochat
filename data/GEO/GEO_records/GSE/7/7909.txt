TITLE
Dermatophytes CGH based on a Trichophyton rubrum cDNA microarray

ORGANISM
Trichophyton rubrum

SUMMARY
A cDNA microarray was constructed from the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of different developmental stages, and comparative genome hybridization based on microarray procedures were carried out. Dermatophyte species are classified into three genera: Epidermophyton, Microsporum, and Trichophyton. To determine the relationship between these three groups comparative genome hybridization were used in our experiment. Trichophyton rubrum genmic DNA was reference DNA and labelled by Cy3 while the other dermatophytes genomic DNA were test DNA and labelled by CY5. Test and reference DNA were co-hybridized with the T. rubrum cDNA microarray and the numbers of genes shared between each species and T. rubrum were determined. Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization
