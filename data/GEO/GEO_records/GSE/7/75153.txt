TITLE
Medulloblastoma Methylation Profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of human medulloblastoma. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. Preprocessed data performed using Illumina normalization in the minfi package as described in Sturm et al, Cancer Cell, 2012.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 91 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
