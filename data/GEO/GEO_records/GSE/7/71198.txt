TITLE
Group 3 innate lymphoid cells continuously require the transcription factor GATA3 after commitment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GATA3 is indispensable for the development of all IL-7Rα-expressing innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and maintenance of type 1 ILCs (ILC1s) and type 2 ILCs (ILC2s). However, the importance of low GATA3 expression in type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) is still elusive. Here, we report that GATA3 regulates homeostasis of ILC3s by controlling IL-7Rα expression. In addition, GATA3 is critical for the development of NKp46+ ILC3 subset partially through regulating the balance between T-bet and RORγt. Genome-wide analyses indicate that while GATA3 positively regulates CCR6+ and NKp46+ ILC3 subset-specific genes in respective lineages, it negatively regulates CCR6+ ILC3-specific genes in NKp46+ ILC3s. Furthermore, GATA3 regulates IL-22 production in both CCR6+ and NKp46+ ILC3s. Thus, low GATA3 expression is critical for the development and function of ILC3 subsets.

DESIGN
To identify GATA3 regulated genes in total ILC3s with RNA-Seq; To identify unique genes expressed by CCR6+ ILC3 or NKp46+ ILC3 and GATA3 regulated genes within these two ILC3 subsets with RNA-Seq; To identify GATA3 direct binding sites in ILC3s, ILC2s and Th2 cells with ChIP-Seq.
