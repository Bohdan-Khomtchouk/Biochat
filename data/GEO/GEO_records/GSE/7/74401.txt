TITLE
Role of Tet1 and Tet3 genes and Chromatin Remodeling in Cerebellar Circuit Formation [hMe-Seal]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although mechanisms underlying early steps in cerebellar development are known, evidence is lacking on genetic and epigenetic changes during the establishment of the synaptic circuitry. Using metagene analysis, we report pivotal changes in multiple reactomes of epigenetic pathway genes in cerebellar granule cells (GCs) during circuit formation.  During this stage, Tet genes are up-regulated and vitamin C activation of Tet enzymes increases the levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) at exon start sites of up-regulated genes, notably axon guidance genes and ion channel genes.  Knockdown of Tet1 and Tet3 by RNA interference in ex vivo cerebellar slice cultures inhibits dendritic arborization of developing GCs, a critical step in circuit formation.  These findings demonstrate a role for Tet genes and chromatin remodeling genes in the formation of cerebellar circuitry.

DESIGN
5hmC-enriched genomic DNA fragments were purified with a selective labeling strategy known as hMe-Seal and carried out DNA deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
