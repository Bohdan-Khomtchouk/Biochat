High-Throughput mapping of the regulatory DNA

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We introduce the Multiplexed Editing Regulatory Assay (MERA), a high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9-based approach that analyzes the regulatory genome for function in its native context.  By tiling thousands of mutations across ~40 kb of cis-regulatory genomic space and using knock-in GFP reporters to read out gene activity, we obtain quantitative information on the contribution of cis-regulatory regions to gene expression.  In addition, we performed a deep-sequencing strategy to  find basepair-resolution functional motifs involved in regulation of the gene by sequencing thousands of functional and non-functional genotypes at genomic locations perturbed by specific guide RNAs.

DESIGN
Design of 3908 gRNAs to perturb regulatory regions associated with the genes Tdgf1,Nanog,Zfp42 and Rpp25 as well as 10 GFP-targetting positive controls. Also, deep-sequencing of genomic regions mutated by 6 selected gRNAs after sorting the electroporated cells into GFP-positive and GFP-negative populations.
