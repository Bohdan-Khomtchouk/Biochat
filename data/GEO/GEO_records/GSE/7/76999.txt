TITLE
Capacity of yolk sac macrophages, fetal liver and adult monocytes to colonize an empty niche and develop into functional tissue resident macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue-resident macrophages can derive from yolk sac macrophages, fetal liver monocytes or adult bone marrow monocytes. Whether these precursors can give rise to transcriptionally identical alveolar macrophages is unknown. Here, we transferred traceable yolk sac macrophages, fetal liver monocytes, adult bone marrow monocytes or adult alveolar macrophages as a control, into the empty alveolar macrophage niche of neonatal Csf2rb-/- mice. All precursors efficiently colonized the alveolar niche and generated alveolar macrophages that were transcriptionally almost identical, with only 22 genes that could be linked to their origin. Underlining the physiological relevance of our findings, all transfer-derived alveolar macrophages self-maintained within the lungs for up to 1 year and durably prevented alveolar proteinosis. Thus, precursor origin does not affect the development of functional self-maintaining tissue-resident macrophages.

DESIGN
CD45.1+CD45.2+ yolk sac macrophages, fetal liver monocytes, adult bone marrow monocytes or adult alveolar macrophages from the bronchoalveolar lavage were sorted from wild type CD45.1+CD45.2+ mice of indicated ages. From part of these samples RNA was isolated. The other part was transferred intranasally into the lungs of neonate Csf2rb-/- mice. 6 weeks post-transfer, transfer-derived CD45.1+CD45.2+ alveolar macrophages were sorted from the bronchoalveolar lavage. Wild type CD45.1+CD45.2 alveolar macrophages from the bronchoalveolar lavage of 6 week old mice were sorted as control. 36 samples (arrays) in total. RNA was isolated, amplified with Nugene pico kit, converted to cDNA and then hybridised on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
