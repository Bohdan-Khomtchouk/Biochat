TITLE
Yeast mutants that allow long-distance transcriptional activation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study we isolated polygenic mutants that allow activation of a reporter in which the GAL1 UAS is 799 bp from the HIS3 TATA and open reading frame. Several different mutants were isolated, each with multiple mutations. The mutants were tested after growth on glucose, galactose, and raffinose.

DESIGN
Two experimental replicates grown as described above except for samples 1.2 and 2.3b, which contain only one each: 1.2-sample 2 and 2.3a-sample 1.
