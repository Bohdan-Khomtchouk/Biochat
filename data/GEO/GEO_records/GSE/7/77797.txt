TITLE
DNA methylation profiling of whole blood and reconstructed mixtures of purified leukocytes isolated from human adult blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Confounding due to cellular heterogeneity represents one of the foremost challenges currently facing Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). Statistical methods leveraging the tissue-specificity of DNA methylation for deconvoluting the cellular mixture of heterogeneous biospecimens such as whole blood, offer a promising solution.  However, their performance depends entirely on the library of DNA methylation markers being used as the basis for deconvolution. The objective of this study was to train and validate an algorithm for the identification of optimal DNA methylation libraries for the deconvolution of adult human whole blood.

DESIGN
Purified granulocytes, monocytes, CD4T, CD8T, natural killer cells, and B cells from normal human subjects were purchased from AllCells LLC (Emeryville, CA).  DNA extracted from purified leukocyte subtypes were mixed in predetermined proportions to reconstruct two distinct sets of white blood cell (WBC) mixtures, each consisting of six samples. An additional six whole blood (WB) samples from disease-free adult donors with available immune cell profiling data from flow cytometry were purchased from All-Cells LLC and were included in this investigation.  All DNA samples were bisulfite modified using the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation kit (Irvine, CA) and profiled for DNA methylation using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array platform.
