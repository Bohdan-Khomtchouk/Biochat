TITLE
Signaling through MyD88 in bone marrow-derived cells promotes gastric tumorigenesis by inducing the TLR2/CD14 pathway in tumor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gan mice express Wnt1, Ptgs2, and Ptges, which develop inflammation-associated gastric tumors (Oshima et al, Gastroenterology 131: 1086, 2006). We examined the role of MyD88 in tumorigenesis by construction of Myd88-/- Gan mice and bone marrow transplantation into Gan mice from Myd88-/- mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from wild-type normal glandular stomach (n=3: WT 1–WT 3),  B6 C2mE mice (n=3: C2mE 1–C2mE 3), B6 Gan mice (n=3: Gan1–Gan3), B6 Gan MyD88-/- mice (n=3: Gan 1 (MyD88-/-)–Gan 3 (MyD88-/-)), and B6 bone marrow transplanted Gan mice from Myd88-/- mice (n=3: BMT-Gan 1 (from MyD88-/-)–BMT-Gan 3 (from MyD88-/-)). We used Illumina HiSeq 2000, and examined expression profiles.
