TITLE
Splicing-independent loading of TREX on nascent RNA is required for efficient transcription of dual-strand piRNA clusters in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The conserved THO/TREX complex is critical for pre-mRNA processing and mRNA nuclear export. In Metazoa, TREX is loaded on nascent RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase II in a splicing-dependent fashion; however, how TREX functions is poorly understood. Here we show that Thoc5 and other TREX components are essential for the biogenesis of piRNA, a distinct class of small non-coding RNAs that control expression of transposable elements (TE) in the Drosophila germline. Mutations in TREX lead to defects in piRNA biogenesis resulting in derepression of multiple TE families, gametogenesis defects, and sterility. TREX components are enriched on piRNA precursors transcribed from dual-strand piRNA clusters and co-localize in distinct nuclear foci that overlap with sites of piRNA transcription. The localization of TREX in nuclear foci and its loading on piRNA precursor transcripts depends on Cutoff, a protein associated with chromatin of piRNA clusters. Finally, we show that TREX is required for accumulation of nascent piRNA precursors. Our study reveals a novel splicing-independent mechanism for TREX loading on nascent RNA and its importance in piRNA biogenesis.

DESIGN
Examination of the effects of Thoc5 deficiency on the total and small RNA transcriptome, and characterization of the Thoc5-bound transcripts in the ovary of D. melanogaster.
