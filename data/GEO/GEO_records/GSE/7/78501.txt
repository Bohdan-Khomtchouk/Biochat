TITLE
Gene expression profiling of genes differentially expressed by oral carcinoma Ca9-22 and SLPI-deficient Ca9-22 (ΔSLPI) cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used the myoma model in conjunction with gene expression profiling with microarray data as an efficient tool for high throughput analysis and to screen for differentially expressed genes. Our aim was to identify candidates playing an important role in SLPI and/or MMP-promoted tumor invasion by comparing oral carcinoma Ca9-22 cells, which highly express secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) gene, with SLPI-deficient Ca9-22 cells.

DESIGN
In oral carcinoma Ca9-22 and SLPI-deficient Ca9-22 (ΔSLPI) samples, gene expression profiling was performed with the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Two arrays for 2 cell lines were analyzed.
