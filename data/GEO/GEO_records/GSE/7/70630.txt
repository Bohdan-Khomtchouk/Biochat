TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq analysis of oligodendroglioma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To understand the diversity of expression states within oligodendroglioma tumors, we obtained six freshly resected samples, profiled ~1000 cells from each tumor and examined their diversity.

DESIGN
Tumors were disaggregated, sorted into single cells, and profiled by Smart-seq2. **GSM1812084 to GSM1815456: Submitter declares reads will be made available through dbGaP.** **Sample records after GSM1815456: Submitter declares reads will be submitted to controlled access SRA and/or dbGaP. The sample records that follow GSM1815456 are incomplete.**
