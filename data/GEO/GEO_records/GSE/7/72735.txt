TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler BRAHMA and Histone H3 lysine demethyalse Relative of Early Flowering 6 (REF6) in Arabidopsis [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis

SUMMARY
BRAHMA (BRM) is a conserved SWI/SNF-type chromatin remodeling ATPase implicated in many key nuclear events. Histone H3 Lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases specifically remove the repressive histone mark, trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3). Both proteins are thought to play active roles in regulating gene activities at the chromatin level, but their genome-wide coordination remains to be determined. In Arabidopsis thaliana, RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6, also known as JMJ12) is the first identified plant H3K27 demethylase. Here, genome-wide analyses revealed that REF6 targets to thousands of genes across the Arabidopsis genome and co-localizes with BRM at more than 1,000 genes, many of which are genes involved in response to various stimuli, especially plant hormones. Loss of REF6 activity results in decreased BRM occupancy at hundreds of BRM-REF6 co-targets, indicating that REF6 is required for the recruitment of BRM to chromatin. Further, REF6 targets to genomic loci that contains the CTCTGTTT motif in vivo

DESIGN
Examination of BRM occupancy in 14-day-old wt and ref6-1 seedlings. Examination of REF6 occupancy in 14-day-old wt and brm-1 seedlings. Examination of global RNA expression in 14-day-old wt, brm-1, ref6-1 and brm-1 ref6-1 seedlings. Examination of H3K27me3 profiles in 14-day-old wt, brm-1, ref6-1, and brm-1 ref6-1 seedlings.
