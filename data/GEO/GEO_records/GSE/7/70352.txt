TITLE
RNA-sequencing analysis of liver from mice overexpressing miR-30c

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aims to investigate the role of microRNA-30c on hepatic and metabolic gene expression and physiology

DESIGN
For this experiment, we used male C57BL/6 mice. At an age of 8 weeks, we started them on Western diet for one month and then injected them with either PBS or increasing dose of Scr or miR-30c mimic (2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mg/kg) for 6 weeks. Liver from these mice were harvested and flash frozen. RNA from the livers of these mice were extracted and RNA-seq was performed.
