TITLE
Assessment of ability of hTSLP to maintain primary CRLF2 B-ALL cells in a xenograft model in a state more similar to the parent leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Xenograft models represent an excellent method for expanding primary leukemias, but their ability to preserve the gene expression profile of the parent leukemia may also depend on providing microenvironmental factors that are not cross-reactive between human and mouse. Here we focused on leukemias with a CRLF2 mutation, and the ability of human TSLP to stimulate these cells.

DESIGN
Three different classes of samples were analyzed. 1) The primary leukemia sample without any culture or treatment 2) Xenograft samples (2) of the primary leukemia that were exposed to TSLP in vivo for 2 weeks, 9 weeks post-engraftment and 3) Xenograft samples (2) of the primary leukemia that were NOT exposed to TSLP in vivo for 2 weeks, 9 weeks post-engraftment.
