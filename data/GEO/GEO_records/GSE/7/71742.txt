TITLE
Genes altered by miR-634 in three cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes affected by miR-634 overexpression, we transfected with 20nmol of miR-634 or miR-negative control (NC) in HeLa, KYSE850, or U2OS cells. After 2 days, RNA was extracted, and then expression analysis was performed using agilent microarray.

DESIGN
Expression microarray with miR-634 or miR-NC transfected HeLa, KYSE850, or U2OS cells were performed in duplicate.
