TITLE
Identification of plant vacuolar transporters mediating phosphate storage

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant vacuoles serve as the primary intracellular compartments for inorganic phosphate (Pi) storage. Passage of Pi across vacuolar membranes plays a critical role in buffering the cytoplasmic Pi level against fluctuations of external Pi and metabolic activities. Here we demonstrate that the SPX-MFS proteins, designated as Phosphate Transporter 5 family (PHT5), also named Vacuolar Phosphate Transporter (VPT), function as vacuolar Pi transporters. Based on 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis, Arabidopsis pht5;1 loss-of-function mutants accumulate less Pi and exhibit a lower vacuolar-to-cytoplasmic Pi ratio than controls. Conversely, overexpression of PHT5 leads to massive Pi sequestration into vacuoles and altered regulation of Pi starvation-responsive genes. Furthermore, we show that heterologous expression of OsSPX-MFS1, the rice PHT5 homolog, mediates Pi influx to yeast vacuoles. Our findings uncover a group of Pi transporters in vacuolar membranes that regulate the cytoplasmic Pi homeostasis required for the fitness of plant growth.

DESIGN
10-day seedlings grown on Pi-sufficient medium or followed by 1-day or 3-day Pi starvation, shoot RNA and root RNA were extracted separately
