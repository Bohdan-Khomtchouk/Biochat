TITLE
Genome-wide RNA expression analysis of rat dorsal root ganglion tissue after local absorbable collagen sponge implantation and BMP-2 exposure

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of whole dorsal root ganglion tissue expression signatures in responses to absorbable collagen sponge implantation with and without BMP-2 exposure.  The hypothesis is that inflammatory macrophage-associated responses to ACS implantation contributes to nociception in the DRG and spinal nerve.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from recipient rat dorsal root gangion tissue at days 1, 3 and 7 post-implantation were profiled by Illumina BeadArray expression analysis
