TITLE
Gene expression data from acetaminophen-induced toxicity in human hepatic in vitro systems and clinical liver samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we conducted transcriptomics analyses of: (i) liver samples from patients suffering from acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure (n=3) and from healthy livers (n=2) and (ii) hepatic cell systems exposed to acetaminophen, including their respective vehicle controls. The investigated in vitro systems are: HepaRG cells, HepG2 cells and a novel human skinpostnatal stem cell-derived model i.e. human skin-precursors-derived hepatocyte-like cells (hSKP-HPC). Clinical samples were obtained after surgical removal of the explant liver of patients diagnosed with ALF due to acetaminophen intoxication and treated by orthotopic liver transplantation (n=3).  Samples from healthy livers were obtained from individuals deceased from brain damage (n=2).

DESIGN
Different samples of hSKP, HepG2 and HepaRG were obtained from the same cell batch of each cell system. All cells were exposed for 24 hours to their corresponding sub cytotoxic concentrations (IC10): IC10(hSKP-HPC)=18mM; IC10(HepaRG)=13mM; IC10(HepG2)=2mM. Experiments were conducted in triplicate.
