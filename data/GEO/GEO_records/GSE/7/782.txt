SUMMARY
The experiment was a response to radiation experiment using LNCaP C4-2 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells with dominant negative p53 function.  Cells were irradiated to a dose of 10 Sv from a Cesium-137 gamma source.  Total RNA was extracted from cells at 6 and 24 hours after irradiation.  The control sample, labeled 0, was collected concurrently with the cells extracted at 24 hr.  It was not irradiated and was transfected with the base pLXSN retrovirus, lacking the inserted GSE56 coding region.  After extraction, the samples were processed and hybridized to the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, www.affymetrix.com) HG-U95Av2 chip, and then washed, stained and scanned according to Affymetrix's protocols contained in the GeneChip(R) Expression Analysis Manual.  Transcript abundance data from the scans was processed initially with Affymetrix' Microarray Suite 5(R), then by Silicon Genetics' (Redwood City, CA, www.silicongenetics.com) GeneSpring(R).
