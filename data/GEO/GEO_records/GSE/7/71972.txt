TITLE
Histamine footprint on the human exercise transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptome wide analysis of the skeletal muscle response to exercise in humans. Subjects performed one 60-min bout of moderate-intensity single-leg knee-extension exercise, and samples were obtained by biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle before, immediately after, and at 3 hr post-exercise. Eight subjects were control (no drug), and eight received combined H1/H2-histamine receptor blockade prior to exercise.

DESIGN
Three time-points in each of 8 control and 8 histamine-blockade subjects. Time points are before exercise, immediately after exercise, and at 3 hrs post-exercise.
