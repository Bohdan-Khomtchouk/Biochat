TITLE
Identification of discriminant genes and gene networks involved in pig ovarian follicular atresia

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Folliculogenesis corresponds to the development of follicles leading to either ovulation or degeneration (a process called atresia). Even if atresia involves an apoptosis process, this mechanism is not well understood. The objective of this experiment was : 1) to analyse gene expression in pig granulosa cells of ovarian follicles during atresia using transcriptome analysis with a 9 024 cDNAs microarray, 2) the identification of gene networks involved in pig ovarian follicular atresia. Granulosa cells were isolated from atretic follicles (small, medium or large). Gene expression was analysed by hybridization of nylon cDNA microarrays.  The images were quantified using Bzscan software and the data were managed with BASE software. Statistical analysis was performed using R software.
