TITLE
H3K36 mutations promote sarcomagenesis through genome-wide remodeling of H3K36 and H3K27 methylation [Cbx2_ChIP]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to understand the genome-wide alterations in chromatin landscape induced by a histone mutation (H3.3K36M) derived from chondroblastomas

DESIGN
Examination of genome-wide Cbx2 distribution in cells expressing H3.3WT and H3.3K36M.
