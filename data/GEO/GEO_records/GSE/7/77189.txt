TITLE
Ciprofloxacin triggers L-glutamate production by Corynebacterium glutamicum

ORGANISM
Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032

SUMMARY
Ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase IV, was shown to inhibit growth of C. glutamicum with concomitant excretion of L-glutamate. C. glutamicum strains overproducing L-lysine, L-arginine, L-ornithine, and putrescine, respectively, produced L-glutamate instead of the desired amino acid when exposed to ciprofloxacin. Even in the absence of the putative L-glutamate exporter gene yggB, ciprofloxacin effectively triggered L-glutamate production. When C. glutamicum wild type was cultivated under nitrogen-limiting conditions, 2-oxoglutarate rather than L-glutamate was produced as consequence of exposure to ciprofloxacin. Transcriptome analysis revealed that ciprofloxacin increased RNA levels of genes involved in DNA synthesis, repair and modification. Enzyme assays showed that 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity was decreased due to ciprofloxacin addition. Here, it was shown for the first time that production of L-glutamate by C. glutamicum may be triggered by an inhibitor of DNA synthesis and L-glutamate titers of up to 37 Â± 1 mM and a substrate specific L-glutamate yield of 0.13 g/g were reached.
