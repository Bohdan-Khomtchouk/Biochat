TITLE
SK-NEP-1 treated with SKI-5C

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wilmâ€™s tumor(WT) is the most common malignant renal tumor in children, representing approximately 6-14% of all childhood cancers and about 95% of all pediatric renal malignancies. SKI-5C is a newly developed Sphk1 inhibitor. This small molecular inhibitor was firstly reported at 2009 by Wang et al. This study investigated the antitumor activity of SKI-5C in SK-NEP-1 cells. SKI-5C inhibited cell proliferation of SK-NEP-1  cells in a dose-dependent manner. Annexin V, Tunel and Hochest 33342 staining analysis showed that SKI-5C-treated cells showed more apoptotic features compared with the control.

DESIGN
SK-NEP-1 cells were treated with 2uM SKI-5C and control group cells were treated with the same volume of DMSO 24 hours later. Human LncRNA Array analysis was performed by KangChen Bio-tech, Shanghai P.R. China. Briefly, RNA purified from total RNA after removal of rRNA was amplified and transcribed into fluorescent cRNA and cDNA was labeled and hybridized to the Human LncRNA Array v3.0 (8660 K, Arraystar). 30,586 LncRNAs and 26,109coding transcripts which collected from the most authoritative databases such as RefSeq, UCSC Knowngenes, Ensembl and many related literatures can be detected by the microarray.
