TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of pilocytic astrocytoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common type of brain tumor in pediatric population, generally connected with favorable prognosis, although recurrences or dissemination sometimes are also observed. For tumors originating in supra- or infratentorial location different molecular background was suggested but plausible correlations between transcriptional profile and radiological features and/or clinical course are still undefined. The purpose of this study was to identify gene expression profiles related to the most frequent locations of this tumor, subtypes based on various radiological features and clinical pattern of the disease.   According to the radiological features presented on MRI, all cases were divided into four subtypes: solid or mainly solid, cystic with an enhancing cyst wall, cystic with a non-enhancing cyst wall and solid with central necrosis. Bioinformatic analyses showed that gene expression profile of pilocytic astrocytoma highly depends on the tumor location. Most prominent differences were noted for IRX2, PAX3, CXCL14, LHX2, SIX6, CNTN1 and SIX1 genes expression which could distinguish pilocytic astrocytomas of different location even within supratentorial region. Analysis of the genes potentially associated between radiological features showed much weaker transcriptome differences. Single genes showed association with the tendency to progression.   Here we showed that pilocytic astrocytomas of three different locations could be precisely differentiated on the basis of gene expression level but their transcriptional profiles did not strongly reflect the radiological appearance of the tumor or the course of the disease.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed in 47 pilocytic astrocytoma tumours characterized by different localization, radiology and progression.
