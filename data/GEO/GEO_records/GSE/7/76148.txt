TITLE
Genome wide comparison of the inducible transcriptomes of CAR, PXR and PPARα in primary human hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the CAR-, PXR- and PPARα-specific genome-wide expression changes, hepatocyte cultures from six individual donors were treated with the prototypical ligands for CAR (CITCO), PXR (rifampicin) and PPARα (WY14,643) as well as DMSO (vehicle control). Afterwards, the mRNA expression in these samples was determined utilizing Affymetrix® microarrays.

DESIGN
Primary human hepatocytes (PHH) from 6 donors were treated for 24 h with 10µM of rifampicin, 50µM of WY14,643, 1µM of CITCO and 0.1% of DMSO (vehicle).
