TITLE
Nudt3 is a mRNA Decapping Enzyme That Modulates Cell Migration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Dcp2 and Nudt16 Nudix hydrolases, are mRNA decapping enzymes that preferentially modulate stability of a subset of mRNAs.  Here we report Nudt3 is a third Nudix protein that possess mRNA decapping activity in cells and is a modulator of cell migration in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.  Genome-wide analysis of Nudt3 compromised cells identified increases in mRNAs involved in cell motility including integrin β6, lipocalin-2 and fibronectin.  The increase in mRNA levels was dependent on Nudt3 decapping activity where integrin β6 and lipocalin-2 were modulated directly through mRNA stability, while fibronectin was indirectly controlled.  Moreover, increased cell migration observed in Nudt3 depleted cells was mediated through the extracellular integrin β6 and fibronectin protein nexus.  We conclude, Nudt3 is an mRNA decapping enzyme that orchestrates expression of a subset of mRNAs to modulate cell migration and further substantiates the existence of multiple decapping enzymes functioning in distinct cellular pathways in mammals.

DESIGN
Stably transformed MCF-7 cell lines constitutively expressing either a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against Nudt3 (Nudt3KD) or a non-targeted control shRNA (ConKD) were used, with three replicate cultures used per group (n=3).
