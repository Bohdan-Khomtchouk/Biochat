TITLE
Transcriptomics and proteomics in colon mucosa from rats fed quercetin

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Quercetin has been shown to act as an anti-carcinogen in experimental colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of the present study was to characterise transcriptome and proteome changes occurring in the distal colon mucosa of rats supplemented with 10 g quercetin/kg diet for 11 weeks. Transcriptome data analysed with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed that quercetin significantly downregulated the potentially oncogenic mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mapk) pathway. In addition, quercetin enhanced expression of tumor suppressor genes, including Pten, Tp53 and Msh2, and of cell cycle inhibitors, including Mutyh. Furthermore, dietary quercetin enhanced genes involved in phase I and II metabolism, including Fmo5, Ephx1, Ephx2 and Gpx2. Quercetin increased PPARÎ± target genes, and concomitantly enhanced expression genes in volved in of mitochondrial fatty acid degradation. Proteomics performed in the same samples revealed 33 affected proteins, of which 4 glycolysis enzymes and 3 heatshock proteins were decreased. A proteome-transcriptome comparison showed a low correlation, but both pointed out towards altered energy metabolism. In conclusion, transcriptomics combined with proteomics showed that dietary quercetin evoked changes contrary to those found in colorectal carcinogenesis. These tumor-protective mechanisms were associated with a shift in energy production pathways, pointing at decreased glycolysis in the cytoplasm towards increased fatty acid degradation in the mitochondria.
