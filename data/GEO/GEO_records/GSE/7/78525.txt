TITLE
Effect of tail domain and kinase domain mutations in BMPR2 on gene expression in rat Hc92 cells studied by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We sequenced RNA from rat Hc92 cells transformed with empty vector, tail domain BMPR2 and kinase domain BMPR2 knockout vectors

DESIGN
Comparison of Hc92 cells lacking BMPR2 tail domain vs those lacking BMPR2 kinase domain, using empty vector treated cells as control for both.
