TITLE
Effects of Lrf (encoded by Zbtb7a) deletion on gene expression in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
LRF is reported as a transcription repressor, but its transcription target genes are not completely known We compared the gene expression difference between control and Lrf deleted MEF by microarray

DESIGN
Lrfflox/flox MEFs were transduced with MSCV-PIG-Cre or empty control vector retroviruses for 2 days at passage 2. After selection with puromycin for 2 days, total RNAs were purified using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). RNAs from two independent experiments were labelled and hybridized using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® HT Mouse Genome 430 arrays by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Genomics and Proteomics
