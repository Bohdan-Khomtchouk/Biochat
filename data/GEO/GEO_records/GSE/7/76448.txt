TITLE
Expression data from 9-day-old and 21-day-old rat Sertoli cell.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
9-day-old Sertoli cells have a stronger proliferative activity compared with 21-day-old Sertoli cells. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Rat Sertoli cell were selected at postnatal day 9 and postnatal day 21 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the differentially expressed genes that were involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell death which were associated with the function of Sertoli cell.
