TITLE
Tissue gene expression of Xenopus laevis J strain [tissue]

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Comprehensive RNA-seq experiments to measure the expression of homoeologs across different tissues, as a part of the Xenopus laevis genome project. This work is funded by Agency Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT; " Genome Science " Grant ID 221S0002).

DESIGN
Collect mRNA from whole tissue; two female frogs were used as donors for most tissues (Taira dataset for one frog, Ueno dataset for the other frog); testis samples were collected from two male frogs (sibling of two female donors)
