TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of LPS-responsive gene expression in human macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression changes in human macrophages in response to LPS in the absence or presence of a CD11b agonist LA1. The hypothesis being tested in the present study was that LA1 mediated CD11b activation suppresses TLR signaling.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from human macrophages subjected to LPS for 8 hours in vitro in the absence or presence of LA1. Control cells were treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or with LA1 alone. Cells were treated with vehicle DMSO (1% DMSO), LA1 (20 μM), LPS (50 ng/mL), or LPS (50ng/mL) and LA1 (20 μM) for 4h.
