Genomic alterations during the progress of pulmonary hypertension

SUMMARY
Pulmonary hypertension (PH), a rare disorder is a complication of a number of  cardiopulmonary, unrelated systemic diseases, drug toxicity and genetic mutations. Major advances have been made in the field, but the pathogenesis of PH is not yet understood.  Several experimental models such as monocrotaline (MCT) and hypoxia have been used to understand the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of PH. We have recently shown that that the addition of hypoxia to MCT injected rats accelerates the disease process leading to neointima formation. We have profiled the lungs of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats kept for 4 weeks in normal atmospheric conditions or in hypobaric hypoxia (380 mmHg) w/o subcutaneous injection with 40 mg/kg MCT or just saline. While MCT and hypoxia altered expression of few genes when applied separately, together they induced a substantial alteration of the transcriptome. The most profoundly altered pathways by the combined effect of hypoxia and MCT were: endocytosis, apoptosis, HIF-1 signaling pathway and vascular smooth muscle contraction.

DESIGN
Two-condition (C = normal atmospheric conditions (control) vs H = hypobaric hypoxia) + two treatment (M = with MCT, O = without MCT) experiment. Four biological replicas of each combination: CO, HO, CM, HM. Differently labeled biological replicates were cohybridized with each array. Results of similarly labeled different conditions were compared then averaged for the two fluorescent labels. For instance: CO1 & CO3 were compared with CM1 & CM3, CO2 & CO4 were compared  with CM2 & + CM4, and the results of the comparisons averaged. This design uses 100% of the resources, has a better normlaiztion and allows all possible comparisons among the conditions.
