TITLE
DNA repair in species with extreme lifespan differences

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared RNA-seq expression patterns in liver, an organ with high oxidative metabolism and abundant spontaneous DNA damage, from humans, naked mole rats, and mice, differing in maximum lifespan over a range of ~100, 30, and 3 years, respectively, for 130 genes involved in DNA repair. The results show that the longer-lived species, human and naked mole rat, share higher expression of these DNA repair genes, including core genes in several DNA repair pathways. A more systematic approach of signaling pathway analysis (SPA) indicates statistically significant upregulation of several DNA repair signaling pathways in human and naked mole rat compared with mouse.

DESIGN
Compare steady-state RNA levels from 3 samples each of adult liver tissue of human, naked mole rat, and mouse. Mouse samples available in the Short Reads Archive: SRX871336, SRX871370, SRX871395 (SRP053350) and BioProject PRJNA274780.
