TITLE
Human embryos commonly form abnormal nuclei during development: a mechanism of DNA damage, embryonic aneuploidy, and developmental arrest

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nuclear abnormalities are commonly found in human IVF embryos and are associated with DNA damage, aneuploidy, and decreased developmental potential.

DESIGN
Immunohistochemical, microscopic, and cytogenetic analysis of human IVF embryos at different developmental stages and morphologic grades.
