TITLE
Genome-wide map of EBF1, H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 marks to unravel the EBF1 C-terminus domain function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To study the function of C-terminus domain, EBF1, H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 ChIP was performed

DESIGN
Freshly prepared Ebf1−/− c-Kit+ fetal liver cells were transduced with  pmys-Empty-IRES-GFP, pmys-EBF1wt-IRES-GFP and pmys-EBF1DC-IRES-GFP. EBF1wt- or EBF1ΔC-transduced cells were sorted as pro-B cells (GFP+CD19+). vector-transduced cells were sorted as only GFP+.
