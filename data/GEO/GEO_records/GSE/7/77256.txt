TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of hair follicle stem cell transcriptome upon loss of the transcription factor FOXC1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report downstream gene expression changes in stem cells of the adult mouse hair follicle upon conditional ablating of the transcription factor Forkhead Box C1 transcription factor (FOXC1). Hair follicles undergo cycles of rest (telogen; Tel) and regeneration (anagen; Ana). As such, we performed our analysis on these two different stages of hair follicles.

DESIGN
mRNA-sequencing of WT vs. Foxc1-conditional or inducible KO (Foxc1-cKO or iKO) hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) purified from mouse dorsal back skin by flow-activated cell sorting (FACS).
