TITLE
Genome wide identification of enhancer regions in the  retrosplenial cortex of the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster.

ORGANISM
Microtus ochrogaster

SUMMARY
We use ChIP-seq targeting histone 3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1)  to identify putative enhancer sites genome-wide, in the retrosplenial cortex of adult prairie vole males.

DESIGN
ChIP samples were generated by targeting a known enhancer mark (H3K4me1) in chromatin extracted from the retrosplenial cortex of 8 males. Illumina libraries were prepared from ChIP and INPUT DNA and sequenced on Illimuna HiSeq 2500 platform.
