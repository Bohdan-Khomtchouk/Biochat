TITLE
Expression data from isogenic Pten WT mouse T-ALLs infected with MSCV Myr-AKT-IRES-mCherry or empty vector, treated with DBZ or DMSO

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the mechanisms downstream of NOTCH1 and PTEN in the control of leukemia cell growth, we performed expression profiling on NOTCH1 induced and Pten-positive T-ALL tumor cells infected with constitutively active AKT (myristoylated-AKT). Constitutive activation of AKT rescues the transcriptional programs induced by NOTCH1 inhibition in Pten-positive T-ALL cells

DESIGN
We performed microarray gene expression analysis of GSI treatment in Pten WT NOTCH1 induced leukemias infected with constitutively active AKT (myristoylated-AKT) or empty vector.
