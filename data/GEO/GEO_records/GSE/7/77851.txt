TITLE
Effects of Lin28a overexpression on gene expression changes during culturing neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from mouse embryonic ventral midbrain (VM)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: we want to see gene expression changes during in vitro expansion of VM-derived NSCs (VM-NSCs) with cell passges in the absence or presence of Lin28a overexpression. changes upon Lin28 overexpression in P1 and P3 stages of Neural stem cells.

DESIGN
RNA-seq, sRNA-seq, and Polysome-seq with/without Lin28 overexpression in P1 and P3 stages of Neural stem cells.
