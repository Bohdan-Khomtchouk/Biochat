TITLE
Identification of MicroRNAs Targeting to Stat3 in RAW264.7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purification of mouse mRNAs encoding signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) identified many miRNAs using multiplex miRNA array in RAW264.7 cells.

DESIGN
To investigate the miRNAs targeting to mouse Stat3 gene in macrophage cells, we performed a protocol miRIP to affinity purify the miRNAs from an endogenous segment of Stat3 mRNA using nucleic acid hybridization and use multiplex miRNA array to identify the associated miRNAs.
