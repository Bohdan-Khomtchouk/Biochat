TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling in Non-Human Primate Colon after Total-Body Irradiation

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
This is an experiment to study the effects of total body irradiation on intestinal gene expression. There are 24 male animals in the study; 4 controls, 10 animals received 6.7 Gy, 10 received 7.4 Gy. Animals were killed 4, 7 or 12 days after irradiation

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from the Colon and hybridized to an Agilent 4x44 Rhesus v2 chip
