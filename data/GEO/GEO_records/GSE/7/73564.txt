TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for mouse macrophages polarization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression approach to macrophages polarization, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential mechanism of ATRA-inhibited M2 macrophages. RAW264.7 cells were treated with ATRA or IL-13 alone or together for 12h or 24h, then the cells were collected with trizol.

DESIGN
Overall gene expression in mouse macrophages were measured after raw264.7 cells were treated with ATRA or IL-13 alone or together for 12h or 24h.
