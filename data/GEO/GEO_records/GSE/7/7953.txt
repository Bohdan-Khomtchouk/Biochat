Correlation analysis of genome-wide gene expression profiles by DNA microarray

SUMMARY
We previously isolated a new angiogenesis inhibitor, terpestacin, from natural products. To investigate molecular mechanism of terpestacin for its anti-angiogenic activity, we identified a cellular binding protein of terpestacin using phage display biopanning analysis. Terpestacin specifically bound to the small molecular ubiquinone binding protein (QP-C), a 13.4 kD subunit of the mitochondrial Complex III. To explore the functional specificity of terpestacin at QP-C, we performed cDNA microarray analysis. The genome-wide gene expression profiling showed a significant phenotype correlation between terpestacin and QP-C genetic knock-down. These results demonstrate that QP-C is a biologically relevant target of terpestacin. Keywords: Sample comparison
