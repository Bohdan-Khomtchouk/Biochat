TITLE
Large-scale rewiring of innate immunity circuitry and microRNA regulation during initial rice blast infection [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Indica Group

SUMMARY
Rice blast is a recurrent fungal disease, and resistance to fungal infection is a complex trait. Therefore, a comprehensive examination of rice transcriptome and its variation during fungal infection is necessary to understand the complex gene regulatory networks. In this study, adopting Next-Generation Sequencing we profiled the transcriptomes and microRNAomes of rice varieties, one susceptible and the other resistant to M. oryzae, at multiple time points during the fungal infection.

DESIGN
In order to investigate variations of rice transcriptome and microRNAome in response to blast infection, we sequenced, profiled, compared and analyzed the gene expressions of two rice cultivars, one susceptible (CO39) and the other resistant (C101LAC) to M. oryzae, at different time points after M. oryzae infection.
