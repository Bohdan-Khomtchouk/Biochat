TITLE
Corticosteroid Resistant Asthma Is Associated with Classical Activation Of Airway Macrophages and Exposure To LPS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: A subset of asthmatics does not respond to steroid therapy and therefore is at risk for escalation of disease severity. The cause of corticosteroid resistant (CR) asthma is unknown. Gene microarray technologies have the potential to substantiate new hypotheses regarding the etiology of corticosteroid resistance. Methods: Gene microarray analysis was performed with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells of CR and corticosteroid sensitive (CS) asthmatics. Increased gene expression was verified with real time PCR and at the protein level by ELISA. Findings: Microarray analyses demonstrated significantly higher levels (over two-fold increase, p < 0.05) of TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL3, CCL4, CCL20 gene expression in BAL cells of CR than CS asthmatics. These findings, confirmed by RT-PCR in additional BAL samples, were consistent with classical macrophage activation by bacterial products. In contrast, markers of alternatively-activated macrophages, Arginase I and CCL24, were decreased in CR asthmatics. Genes associated with activation of the LPS signaling pathway (EGR1, DUSP2, MAIL, TNFAIP3) were significantly elevated in CR BAL samples (p < 0.05). CR asthmatics had significantly higher amounts (1444.0±457.3 pg per mg of total protein) of LPS in BAL fluid than CS asthmatics (270.5±216.0 pg; p < 0.05). Prolonged exposure to LPS induced functional steroid resistance to dexamethasone (DEX) in normal monocytes, demonstrated by persistently elevated IL-6 levels in the presence of DEX. Interpretation: Classical macrophage activation and induction of LPS signaling pathways along with high endotoxin levels detected in BAL fluid from CR asthmatics suggest that LPS exposure may contribute to CR asthma.
