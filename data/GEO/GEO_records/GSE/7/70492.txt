TITLE
Infection exposure promotes ETV6-RUNX1 precursor B cell leukemia revealing secondary genomic alterations in histone modification genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in ETV6/RUNX1 proB and preB cells

DESIGN
Bone marrow proB and preB cells of four ETV6/RUNX1 mice compared with bone marrow proB and preB cells of three WT mice and three Pax5+/- mice.
