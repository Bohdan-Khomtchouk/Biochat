TITLE
Virtual Microdissection of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Reveals Tumor and Stroma Subtypes.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a lethal disease with a 5-year survival of 4%. A key hallmark of PDAC is extensive stromal involvement, which makes capturing precise tumor-specific molecular information difficult. Here, we have overcome this problem by applying blind source separation to a diverse collection of PDAC gene expression microarray data, which includes primary, metastatic, and normal samples. By digitally separating tumor, stroma, and normal gene expression, we have identified and validated two tumor-specific subtypes including a â€œbasal-likeâ€ subtype which has worse outcome, and is molecularly similar to basal tumors in bladder and breast cancer. Furthermore, we define 'normal' and 'activated' stromal subtypes which are independently prognostic. Our results provide new insight into the molecular composition of PDAC which may be used to tailor therapies or provide decision support in a clinical setting where the choice and timing of therapies is critical.

DESIGN
Analysis of the landscape of gene expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Data include 145 primary and 61 metastatic PDAC tumors, 17 cell lines, 46 pancreas and 88 distant site adjacent normal samples. Arrays represent distinct samples. The SPOT column in the raw data file (linked to each sample record) contains Agilent feature extraction numbers (included in the 'GPL4133-20424.txt' linked to the platform records).
