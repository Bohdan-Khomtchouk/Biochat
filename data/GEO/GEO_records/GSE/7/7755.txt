TITLE
Gene expression in fetal gubernaculum and testis of wildtype (LE/wt) and cryptorchid (LE/orl) rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The Long Evans/orl (LE/orl) rat is an animal model of inherited undescended testis (UDT).  To explore genetic mechanisms of UDT, we studied differential gene expression in LE/orl and LE wild type (LE/wt) fetal gubernaculum and testis.
