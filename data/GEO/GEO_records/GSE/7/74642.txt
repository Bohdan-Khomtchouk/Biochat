TITLE
RNA-Seq of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells carrying different YRR1 alleles in response to 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4NQO) and to glycerol as the sole carbon source

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study, we constructed three isogenic strains of S96 yrr1Î” background (its native YRR1 gene was knocked out) carrying three different YRR1 alleles, YRR1_S96, YRR1_YJM789 and YRR1_S96-I775E, respectively. We then conducted RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the three strains grown in Yeast Peptone Dextrose medium (YPD), YPD + 4NQO and Yeast Peptone glycerol medium (YPglycerol).

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was performed in biological duplicates on S96 cells carrying three different YRR1 alleles grown in YPD, YPD + 4NQO, YPglycerol
