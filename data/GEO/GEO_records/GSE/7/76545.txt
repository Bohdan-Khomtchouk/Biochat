TITLE
Neuronal and glial Gene expression from control and healthy patient iPSC-derived forebrain neurons (A)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neuronal or glial cell fates related gene expression from single cells with variety of sAPPa or total Aβ secretion profiles were presented here.

DESIGN
Single living human iPSC-derived forebrain neuronal cells with variety of sAPPa or total Aβ secretion profiles were selected and examined for gene expression.
