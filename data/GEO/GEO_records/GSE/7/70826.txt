TITLE
mRNA Expression data from human Ewing's sarcoma (ES)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore possible oncogenic factors in ES, we used a microarray-based approach to profile changes in the expression of mRNAs in five ES cell lines and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We used a microarray-based approach to profilein the mRNA expression of ES

DESIGN
Human ES cell lines were analyzed with genome-wide expression arrays.
