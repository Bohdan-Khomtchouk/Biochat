TITLE
lncRNA DINO ChIRPseq in DNA damaged U2OS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Examine the chormatin localization of DINO in DNA damaged human U2OS cells using DINO ChIRP-seq.

DESIGN
DINO is a DNA damage induced long noncoding RNA required for the transactivation of several p53-regulated genes. We examined the chormatin localization of DINO in DNA damaged human U2OS cells in order to determine whether DINO regulated gene expression by interacting with gene regulatory elements. We performed ChIRP with two independed probe sets (even and odd) according to previously published methods (Chu et al. 2011) . RNAse treated chromatin controls identify we utilized to confirm that DINO ChIRP recovery of DNA was indeed RNA dependent and not the result of direct DNA interaction by the probes.
