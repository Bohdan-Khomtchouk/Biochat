TITLE
Chronic tetraethylammonium chloride treatment induced gene expression changes in Drosophila head

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) is an epileptogenic agent. In an effort to develop a Drosophila model of kindling epileptogenesis, we have examined chronic TEA induced alterations in gene expression profile of fly heads. Expression profiling of fly heads after 7 day long TEA treatment revealed perturbations in various functional category of genes. Keywords: Drug Response
