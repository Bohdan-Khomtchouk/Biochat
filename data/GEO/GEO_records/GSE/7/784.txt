SUMMARY
Transcriptional Profiling of the Transition from Normal Intestine to Adenoma in the APC(Min/+) Mouse. Tissue was from male 91-days old APC(Min/+) mouse (an animal model for human colon cancer). RNA was purified using Trizol and labeled for hybridization to high density oligonucleotide Affymetrix MG_U74Av2 arrays, using manufacturer protocol. We measured the relative expression level of > 12000 genes and ESTs. ----------------------------------------- Samples used in analysis: * GSM12501:  Normal intestine diet #1 sample C1_0112 Dnmt+/- Min/+ * GSM12502: Tumor diet #1 sample T1_0112 Dnmt+/- Min/+ * GSM12503:  Normal intestine diet #1 sample C2_0112 Dnmt+/+ Min/+ * GSM12504: Tumor diet #1 sample T2_0112 Dnmt+/+ Min/+ * GSM12505:  Normal intestine diet #2 sample C1_003 Dnmt+/- Min/+ * GSM12506: Tumor diet #2 sample T1_003 Dnmt+/- Min/+ * GSM12507:  Normal intestine diet #2 sample C2_003 Dnmt+/+ Min/+ * GSM12508: Tumor diet #2 sample T2_003 Dnmt+/+ Min/+ * GSM12509:  Normal intestine diet #3 sample C1_005 Dnmt+/- Min/+ * GSM12510: Tumor diet #3 sample T1_005 Dnmt+/- Min/+ * GSM12511:  Normal intestine diet #3 sample C2_005 Dnmt+/+ Min/+ * GSM12512: Tumor diet #3 sample T2_005 Dnmt+/+ Min/+ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Comparisons were performed as described in Chen Z, Ge B, Hudson TJ and Rozen R.
