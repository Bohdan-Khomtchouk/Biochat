TITLE
Whole genome analysis of mouse B16 melanoma cancer cells in response to interfacial geometry

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the regulation of B16 gene expression in response to interfacial geometry. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that interfacial geometry modulates tumourigenicity of B16 cells. Results provide important information of the response of B16 cells to interfacial geometry especially, metastasis, MAP kinase, and STAT pathways.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from B16 cells cultured for 5 days in different microenvironments to explore whether interfacial geometry could enhance gene expressions linked to cancer stem cells.
