TITLE
Control of Neuronal Synapse Specification by a Highly Dedicated Alternative Splicing program

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The RNA binding protein SLM2 represents a major functional determinant of neuronal function by directing the splice isoform identity of synaptic recognition receptors.

DESIGN
Examination of overall gene expression and alternative splicing events in hippocampi of wild-type and SLM2KO animals.
