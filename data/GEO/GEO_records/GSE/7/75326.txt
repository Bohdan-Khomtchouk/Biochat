TITLE
Expression analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana mutant atpme3-1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Investigation of the effect of atpme3-1 mutant on whole gene expression level hypocotyls of 96 hours-old plantlets were analyzed for this study

DESIGN
A 12plex high density chip was used. Six or 5 biological replicates for each condition. Each replicate was obtained separately from the others and each replicate represents about 300 hypocotyles.
