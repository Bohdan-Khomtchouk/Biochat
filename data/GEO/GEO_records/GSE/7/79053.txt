TITLE
Identification of PURPL regulated genes in HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes in gene expression profile upon depletion of PURPL in HCT116 cells. The hypothesis in this study is that PURPL regulates gene expression in the p53 pathway.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from HCT116_PURPL WT and KO cells.
