TITLE
The maleless gene mitigates global aneuploid effect and evolutionary shift from X to autosomes

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
During sexual dimorphism, the loss of one entire X chromosome in Drosophila males is achieved largely via a broad genome-wide aneuploid effect. Exploring how MSL proteins and two large non coding RNAs (roX1 and roX2) modulate trans-acting aneuploid effect for equality to females, we employ a system biology approach (microarray) to investigate the global aneuploid effect of maleless(mle) mutation by disrupting MSL binding. A large number of the genes (144) that encode a broad spectrum of cellular transport proteins and transcription factors are located in the autosomes of Drosophila melanogaster. We find these autosomal targets are sensitive to the aneuploid effect and are poorly conserved in primitive Drosophila species and Anopheles gambiae autosomes. It is expected that during evolutionary process, they shifted gradually from their X chromosomal position in primitive Drosophila to autosomes in melanogaster, suggesting that MSL favors inverse counteraction of these autosomal targets along with X-linked genes. These findings suggest a remarkable and previously unsuspected level of complexity among aneuploid-sensitive genes, that creates a functional shift of the aneuploid effect from X to autosomes during evolution, which is resolved by the binding of MSL complex on the X chromosome..

DESIGN
Drosophila  larvae were selected based on genotypes particularly with Tb phenotypes. Total cellular RNA were extracted from each genotypes and hebridized with affymetrix Drosophila Microarray chip. Gene Expression profiling of fly base to understand the role of maleless mutation in aneuploid targets.
