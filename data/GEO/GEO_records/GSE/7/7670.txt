TITLE
Expression data from Lung cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Detection, treatment, and prediction of outcome for lung cancer patients increasingly depend on a molecular understanding of tumor development and sensitivity of lung cancer to therapeutic drugs. The application of genomic technologies, such as microarray, is widely used to monitor global gene expression and has built up invaluable information and knowledge, which is essential to the discovery of new insights into the mechanisms common to cancer cells, resulting in the identification of unique, identifiable signatures and specific characteristics. It is likely that application of microarray may revolutionize many aspects of lung cancer being diagnosed, classified, and treated in the near future. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression patterns of lung cancer. Keywords: Disease state analysis
