TITLE
Microarray expression profiling of discrete microdissected mouse inner ear tissues from E9 to E15 at half-day intervals.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The inner ear in mammals is derived from a simple ectodermal thickening called the otic placode. Through a series of complex morphological changes, the placode forms the mature inner ear comprising of the auditory organ (cochlea) and the vestibular/balance organs (utricle, saccule, and three semi-circular canals). The vast majority of genes known to be involved during inner ear development have been found through mutational screens or by chance. To identify genes that can serve as novel candidates required for inner ear development, and also candidate genes for uncloned human deafnesses, inner ear tissues from mouse embryos from E9 to E15 were microdissected and expression-profiled at half-day intervals. Also profiled was the non-inner ear mesenchymal tissue surrounding the inner ear tissue. Various patterns of gene expression were identified, and significant biological pathways that these genes represented were identified. Also identified were mouse genes whose human orthologs are located within uncloned non-syndromic deafness intervals, thus serving as candidates for sequence analysis.
