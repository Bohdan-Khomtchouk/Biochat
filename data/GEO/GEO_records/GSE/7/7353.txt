TITLE
Early GA response genes in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The phytohormone GA controls multiple important developmental processes in plants such as germination, elongation growth and flowering time. In this experiment, we look for early GA response genes in 7 day-old light-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. To this end we compare four data sets: (1) a GA biosynthesis mutant ga-1 (SALK_109115) mock treated for 1 hr; (2) a GA biosynthesis mutant ga-1 (SALK_109115) treated for 1 hr with 100 µM GA3; (3) a gid1a-1 gid1b-1 gid1c-2 GA receptor triple mutant mock treated for 1 hr; (4) a gid1a-1 gid1b-1 gid1c-2 GA receptor triple mutant treated for 1 hr with 100 µM GA3. In a comparison of the two ga-1 samples, GA regulated genes can be identified, and the assumption is that bona fide GA regulated genes are not responding in the gid1a-1 gid1b-1 gid1c-2 GA receptor mutant. Keywords: phytohormone response
