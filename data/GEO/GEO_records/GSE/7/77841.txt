TITLE
mRNA-seq from Nutlin-3a, doxorubicin, and DMSO treated HCT116 p21-/- cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from HCT116 p21-/- cells treated with Nutlin-3a, doxorubicin, or DMSO for 24 h.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels from HCT116 p21-/- cells treated with Nutlin-3a, doxorubicin, or DMSO for 24 h using four replicates each.
