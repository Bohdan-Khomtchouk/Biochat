TITLE
Rader HHDL genotyping

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The presence of a coding variant affecting plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels  was evaluated in subjects with elevated plasma levels of HDLC.

DESIGN
18 DNA samples from subjects with high plasma HDLC levels were analyzed. The samples were analyzed using the exome chip in three separate phases, with different samples in each phase. The same genotyping platform was used for each of the phases of the experiment under the same experimental conditions. Because different samples were run in different phases, raw intensity data was collected separately for each phase and genotypes were called separately for each phase. Raw intensity data is provided thus separately for the subjects by phase of genotyping. The experimental phase of each subject is also provided.
