TITLE
Different gene expression signatures in children and adults with celiac disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We collected 19 duodenal biopsies of children and adults with celiac disease and compared the expression of 38 selected genes between each other and with the observed in 13 non-celiac disease controls matched by age.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling. Intestinal samples from children and adults with active celiac disease patients and controls were analysed.
