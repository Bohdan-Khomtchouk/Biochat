TITLE
RNA-seq transcriptomic profiling for self-renewing (SR) and senescent (SEN) human adult adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterization of gene expression levels with RNA-seq was performed on self-renewing (SR) and senescent (SEN) human adult adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) using the Roche 454 pyrosequencing platform.

DESIGN
RNA-seq library from single replicates of self-renewing (SR) and senescent (SEN) human adult adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) were sequeced using the Roche 454 pyrosequencing platform.
