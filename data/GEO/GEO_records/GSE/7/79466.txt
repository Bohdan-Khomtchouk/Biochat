TITLE
Gene expression profiling of PBMC from coinfected or non-coinfected mice at d0, d3, d7, and d21 post YFV-17D challenge

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We tested the effects of co-infection on vaccine response to YFV-17D.

DESIGN
Groups of mice were divided into either Mock infected or Co-infected groups.  Mock infected were housed in a biohazard facility and inoculated with PBS.  Co-infected were infected sequentially with murine gammaherpesvirus-68, murine cytomegalovirus, influenza WSN, and Heligmosimoides polygyrus.  Both mock and co-infected groups were challenged with Yellow Fever virus (YFV-17D).  Day 0 is prior to YFV.  Days 3, 7, and 21 were timepoints after YFV.
