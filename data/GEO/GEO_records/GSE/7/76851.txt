TITLE
Cocaine and shock labeled ribosome from mPFC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Activity-dependent ribosome profiling from mouse mPFC. Ribosome from cocaine and shock activated cells were immunoprecipitated using antibody. Translating mRNA was isolated and analyzed.

DESIGN
Ribosome TRAP mice were crossed to a ArcCre transgenic line. Activity-dependent ribosome labeling was enabled by subjecting mice to cocaine or shock in the presence of tamoxifen. Ribosome was genetically tagged with GFP in the activated cells and could be purified by immunoprecipitation.
