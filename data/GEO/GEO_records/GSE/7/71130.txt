TITLE
Development of colorectal cancer miRNA expression signatures from expression profiles of embryonic development, precancer progression and cancer samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression signature for survival prediction, we conducted expression profiles of embryonic development, precancer progression and cancer samples.

DESIGN
Developing colon was obtained from 16 cases of abortion in Maternal & Child Health Care Hospital of Hai Dian between 2007 and 2009. The samples included whole embryos (WE) at 3 to 5 postovulatory weeks (PWs), early embryonic colons (EEC) at 8 to 10 PWs and middle embryonic colons (MEC) at 14 to 22 PWs.Normal colorectal mucosae samples were collected from patients with hemorrhoids who received surgical excision in the Department of Colon and Rectal Surgery of Beijing Shi Ji Tan Hospital between 2009 and 2010.
