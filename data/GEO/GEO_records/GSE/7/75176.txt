TITLE
Comparison of expression profiles of WT and Nrf2AY/AY mutant macrophages under electrophilic stress agent [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nrf2(A502Y) mutant failed to recognize cis-element required for induction of Nrf2 target genes.To examine whether Nrf2(A502Y) supports expression of a distinct gene set from that supported by Nrf2, RNA-Seq analysis was performed. We compared gene expression profiles in peritoneal macrophages from Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2AY/AY mice between basal and DEM (which is an electorophilic stress agent promoting Nrf2 induction)-treated conditions.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of wild type (WT) and Nrf2AY/AY (AY) mutant macrophages under basal and DEM-treated condition were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate.
