TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of growth factor response of NHEKs to antimicrobial petide LL-37 and dsRNA mimic Poly(I:C)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we analyzed how non-coding double stranded RNA (dsRNAs) act as a damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) in the skin, and how the human cathelicidin AMP LL-37 might influence growth factor production in response to this DAMP.

DESIGN
Each sample's RNA was isolated form a single biological source of P6 NHEKs. In total there are 4 samples (non-replicates); Control (PBS treated), 1.75uM LL-37 treated, 0.1ug/ml Poly(I:C) treated, and co-treated with 1.75uM LL-37 and 0.1ug/ml Poly(I:C).
