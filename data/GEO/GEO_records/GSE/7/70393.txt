TITLE
Gene expression in CD8+ T cells derived from Nrdp1+/+ and Nrdp1-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to determine which genes are differentially regulated by the E3 ligase Nrdp1 in CD8+ T cells after treatments with anti-CD3/CD28 Abs. The results demonstrate increased induction of cytotoxicity-associated genes in Nrdp1-/- mice than in Nrdp1+/+ mice after activation. Thus Nrdp1 may be involved in the regulation of TCR signaling.

DESIGN
Naive CD8+ T cells derived spleens of Nrdp1+/+ and Nrdp1-/- mice  were either untreated or treated with immobilized anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) Abs for 4h or 8h. Equal amounts of RNA were assayed for gene expression using Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 arrays.
