TITLE
Validation of gene expression from rice locus (dye-swap experiment)

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Transcription from 23K TIGR-loci were confirmed by full-length cDNA mapping, but other 33K TIGR-loci were not confirmed. However, it was not natural to think that full-length cDNA libraries was included almost rice genes, because the transcription of 3K CDS-ANE were confirmed by other transcriptome resources in TIGR OSA1. So, for detection of gene expression from FL-locus and TIGR-locus, we designed about 82K 60mer oligo probes based on TIGR Pseudomolecules release 2. However, TIGR-locus was revised according to revised Pseudomolecules and other additional transcriptome resources. Therefore designed 82K probes were re-mapped on TIGR4 ,and 63455 probes were mapped on 43090 locus Keywords: tissue type comparison
