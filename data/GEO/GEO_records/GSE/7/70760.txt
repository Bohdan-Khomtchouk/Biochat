TITLE
Gene expression patterns in house dust mite stimulated CD4 T cells and IgG:IgE ratios

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PBMC from house dust mite (HDM) sensitized atopics were cultured in the presence or absence of HDM extract for 24 hours. At the termination of the cultures, CD4 T cells were isolated using immunomagnetic separation. Gene expression was profiled on microarrays.

DESIGN
The study design consisted of 45 subjects and two conditions (medium control, HDM stimulation).
