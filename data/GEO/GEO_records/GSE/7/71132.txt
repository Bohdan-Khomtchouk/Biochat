TITLE
RNA-seq based transcriptome of Nesterenkonia sp. AN1

ORGANISM
Nesterenkonia sp. AN1

SUMMARY
The transcript profiles of Nesterenkonia sp. AN1 grown at 5 ºC (Cold) and 21 ºC (Topt) were acccessed to evaluate the cold reposnse of this Antarctic Nesterenkonia strain. The strain was grown in triplicates at the optimum growth temperature of 21 ºC and a test temperature of 5 ºC. Total RNA was extracted from two replicate samples for each treatment condition and the total RNA was enriched for mRNA. RNA-seq was done using Illumina Miseq platform at Inqaba Biotech, South Africa. The reads were mapped against the genome sequence of Nesterenkonia sp. AN1 (obtained from NCBI database) and assesed for differeential gene expression using CLC Genomics Workbench 7.5.

DESIGN
Evaluation of RNA-seq data for Nesterenkonia sp. AN1 at 5 ºC (Cold) and 21 ºC (Topt) in two biological replicates
