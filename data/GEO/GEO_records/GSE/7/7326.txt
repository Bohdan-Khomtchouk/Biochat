TITLE
Expression profiles during cell death programmed by a restriction-modification system in E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Genetically programmed deaths play important roles in the biology of unicellular prokaryotic cells. Some gene complexes force their maintenance on the host bacterial cells by killing cells that have lost them. This form of programmed death called post-segregational killing or genetic addiction is brought about by several Type II restriction-modification gene complexes, through restriction attack on the undermethylated chromosome, and underlie their behavior as selfish mobile elements. To learn the genetic steps to death, we examined how carriage and loss of PaeR7I restriction-modification gene complex affect host Escherichia coli cells through transcriptome and experimental analyses. The PaeR7I complex was on a temperature-sensitive plasmid so that the killing was induced by a temperature shift. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying cell death process mediated by PaeR7I restriction-modification system in E. coli. Keywords: time course
