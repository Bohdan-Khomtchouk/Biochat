TITLE
A Gram-positive three-component antimicrobial peptide-sensing system

ORGANISM
Coxiella burnetii

SUMMARY
To survive during colonization or infection of the human body, microorganisms must defeat antimicrobial peptides, which represent a key component of innate host defense in phagocytes and on epithelia. However, is not known how the clinically important group of Gram-positive bacteria sense antimicrobial peptides to coordinate a directed defensive response. By determining the genome-wide gene regulatory response to human beta defensin 3 in the nosocomial pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis, we discovered an antimicrobial peptide sensor system that controls major specific resistance mechanisms to antimicrobial peptides and is unrelated to the Gram-negative PhoP/PhoQ system. Keywords: Wild type control vs treated vs mutant
