TITLE
Role of the histone demethylase KDM2B in hematopoietic homeostasis and malignancies [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Development of the hematopoietic system is dynamically controlled by the interplay of transcriptional and epigenetic networks to determine cellular identity. Those networks are critical for homeostasis and frequently dysregulated in leukemias. We identified histone demethylase Kdm2b as a critical regulator of definitive hematopoiesis and lineage specification of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). RNA sequencing in murine HSPCs and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation studies in human leukemias revealed that Kdm2b regulates differentiation, lineage choice, cytokine signaling, and quiescence.

DESIGN
Identify the binding of KDM2B in seven human leukemia cell lines
