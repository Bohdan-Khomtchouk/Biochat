TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Lgr5-GFP-expressing cells in the adult mammary gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to identify genes that are differentially expressed in basal cell populations with different levels of Lgr5 gene expression. Samples were isolated from adult mouse mammary glands.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated and up to 125 ng of total RNA per sample was labelled and hybridized to the Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression BeadChip platform. Three replicate samples were analysed for each population (Lgr5+ basal, Lgr5- basal, luminal).
