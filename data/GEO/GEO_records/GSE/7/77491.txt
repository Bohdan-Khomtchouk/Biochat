TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome profile of CYTOR (LINC00152)-silenced MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcriptional profile of MDA-MB-231 cells silenced for CYTOR (LINC00152, long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 152) was compared to LNA-control-treated MDA-MB-231 cells to identify potential CYTOR targets.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with LNA targeting CYTOR or with LNA control (from Exiqon), and total RNA was obtained.
