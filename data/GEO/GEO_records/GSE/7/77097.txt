TITLE
Wound inducible gene in rice leaves

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) has been known as a signal molecule that is induced by various stresses and mediates plant defense responses. Rice O. sativa inductively produces variety of defensive compounds upon abiotic and biotic stress conditions, such as wounding and insect attack. We identified wound-inducible genes by comparison with transcriptomes between wounded and untreated wild-type rice leaves.

DESIGN
Expression profiling in wild-type rice leaves treated by wounding  for 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h was compared with that in untreated control using two-color method with two biological replicates.
