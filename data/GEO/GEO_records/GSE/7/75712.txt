TITLE
WT and Ikaros-deficient follicular B cells stimulated with anti-IgM

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have observed that follicular B cells from mice with a hypomorphic mutation (IkL/L) in the Ikzf1 gene (which encodes the Ikaros transcription factor) exhibit an increased proliferative response to anti-IgM stimulation (Kirstetter et al, Eur J Immunol, 32:720-30, 2002). We asked if Ikaros controls the transcriptional response that unfolds after activation, or if differences in the transcriptional landscape of resting B cells could explain the altered response. To this end, we have determined the transcriptome of unstimulated WT and IkL/L follicular B cells, as well as that of cells stimulated for 3h and 12h with anti-IgM. Samples from 2 independent experients were analyzed.

DESIGN
Follicular splenic B cell were sorted from 6-week old WT or IkL/L mice, and stimulated for 3 or 12h with anti IgM, or cultured without anti-IgM for 3h (unstimulated samples) 2 independant experiments were performed
