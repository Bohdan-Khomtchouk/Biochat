TITLE
Non-coding antisense transcription detected by conventional and single-stranded cDNA microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent bioinformatic studies revealed that many mammalian protein-coding genes also transcribe their complementary strands. This phenomenon raises questions regarding the validity of data obtained from double-stranded cDNA microarrays since hybridization to both strands may occur. To analyze experimentally the incidence of antisense transcription in human cells and to estimate their influence on protein coding expression patterns obtained by double-stranded microarrays, we profiled transcription with sense and antisense independently by using strand-specific cDNA microarrays. Keywords: Common reference design
