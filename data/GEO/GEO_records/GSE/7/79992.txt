TITLE
Protospacer integration into plasmid DNA by Cas1–Cas2

ORGANISM
Cloning vector pUC19

SUMMARY
We report the integration site specificity of Cas1–Cas2 into target plasmid DNA encoding a CRISPR locus. The goal of this study is to determine the effect of IHF on target site selection of Cas1–Cas2.

DESIGN
Methods: After DNA integration reactions, the target plasmid products were fragmented, end-repaired, adapter ligated, PCR amplified and analyzed by Illumina sequencing. Protospacer-containing reads were selected by Cutadapt and mapped to the plasmid with Bowtie
