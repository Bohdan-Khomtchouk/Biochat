TITLE
Expression data from the brain of Mus musculus upon intrastriatal administration of baculoviral vectors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recombinant insect baculoviral vectors (BV) efficiently transduce several types of cells in the brain and can possibly be used for gene therapy for brain disorders. To verify the suitability of using these viral vectors to develop gene therapy strategies in the brain, and to evaluate our method of virus purification, we evaluated immune reactions upon acute administration of BV that were purified by ion-exchange membrane chromatography with high-speed centrifugation or high-speed centrifugation alone into the mouse brain using microarray global gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
Adult male mice (Mus musculus) were administered with baculoviral vectors purified by membrane chromatography with high-speed centrifugation (MC+HS) or baculoviral vectors purified by high-speed centrifugation (HS) alone into the brain. We sought to compare the gene expression changes in the brain triggered by MC+HS-purified and HS-purified baculoviral vectors.
