TITLE
Vibrio cholerae lon protease mutant microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
Lon protease is known to regulate various transcriptional regulators in other bacterial organisms. To understand whether lon protease is involved in transcriptional changes in Vibrio cholerae, wholel-genome level transcriptional profiling was performed using custom microarrays. Transcriptomes of lonA mutant and wild-type strains were compared in this study.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates of wild-type and lonA mutant strains were used for this study. Reference RNA sample was harvested from wild-type strain.
