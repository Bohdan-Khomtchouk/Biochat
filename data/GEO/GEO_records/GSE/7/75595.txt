TITLE
Integrated epigenomic analyses of enhancer as well as promoter regions in gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed H3K27ac ChIP-seq data in seven gastric cancer cell lines to investigate the functional significance of epigenetic changes at distal regulatory regions

DESIGN
H3K27ac ChIP-seq profiling of gastric cancer cell lines were generated by deep sequencing, in each seven samples, using Illumina GAIIx and Hiseq-2000
