TITLE
Expression data from human mesenchymal stem cells (#4F1560)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human mesenchymal stem cells are expected to be a useful tool for cellular therapy. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression profiles and selected candidate biomarkers that indicate the culture stage of the cells. Keywords: mesenchymal stem cells, passage numbers
