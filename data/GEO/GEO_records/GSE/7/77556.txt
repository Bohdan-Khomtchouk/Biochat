TITLE
Impact of mutations in rv2887, putative transcriptional repressor, on gene expression in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
This study was aimed towards understanding the consequences of mutating rv2887, a putative transcriptional repressor, on gene expression in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Since clones carrying mutations in this gene were found to be highly resistant to a potent mycobactericidal compound, 14, we also tested the impact of short-term exposure to this compound on gene expression in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

DESIGN
Three different strains, wild type H37Rv and the two clones resistant to compound 14, named 1A and 8A, were grown to log phase in 7H9 complete medium. The cells were diluted to an OD of 0.5 and split in to two equal parts, 1 arm received the vehicle (DMSO) and the other arm received compound 14 at a final concentration of 3.9 Î¼M. The exposure lasted 4 hours, at which point the bacterial pellet was collected and processed for RNA extraction using protocols described previously.
