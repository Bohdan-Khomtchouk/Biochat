TITLE
Differential expression analysis of triple knockdown of TBP and TBP-related factors (TKD) in Xenopus laevis embryos at early developmental stage 10.5

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
We sequenced cDNA prepared from ribosomal RNA depleted total RNA of 10-10 embryos co-injected with TBP-,TBP2- and TLF-AS antisense oligonucleotides and with water to create expression profiles of triple knockdown of TBP/TBP-related factors (TKD) and control, respectively, in Xenopus laevis at early developmental stage 10.5. (according to Nieuwkoop and Faber). We executed differential expression analysis of sequence count data (DEseq).

DESIGN
Differential expression analysis using RNA sequencing
