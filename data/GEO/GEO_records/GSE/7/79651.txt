TITLE
End Sequence Analysis ToolKit (ESAT) expands the extractable information from single cell RNA-Seq data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Test data used for the evaluation of ESAT performance and results files for data from 3' and 5' end-sequencing RNA-Seq protocols and droplet-based single-cell RNA-Seq.

DESIGN
Quantification and analysis of Tophat-aligned (v2.0.9) samples from mouse bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (mBMDC) timecourse (0, 2, 4 and 6 hours) post LPS stimulation and non-diabetic BBDR rat pancreatic islet cells. Since end-sequencing (3' or 5') is used for all samples, alignments are only required for the R2 (sequence-containing) read.
