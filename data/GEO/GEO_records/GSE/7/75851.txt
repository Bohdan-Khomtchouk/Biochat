TITLE
ILC progenitor CEL-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we identify the c-kit+ CILP population which generates all ILC subsets including NK cells, and the CD25- ILC2-restricted Sca-1+ CILP. We mapped the transcriptional changes that occur in ILC progenitor commitment identifying new regulatory factors and provide a map for early ILC differentiation. Finally, we mapped the subsequent transcriptional changes that occur in c-kit+ CILP in absence of Id2 and Tcf7, key regulators downstream of Nfil3.

DESIGN
100 cells of each population were purified from wild-type, Id2-/- or TCF7-/- mice. 64 samples were analysed in 2 different experiment. We purified Common innate lymphoid progenitor (CLP), a4b7-expressing CLP, common innate lymphoid progenitor (CILP), Sca1+ CILP, and Group 2 innate lymphoid cell progenitor (ILC2p).
