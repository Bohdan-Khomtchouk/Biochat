TITLE
Global Gene Expression Profiles of Fibroblasts from the Lungs of Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: The Role of CCL8

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that Epigenetic mechanisms are likely to be associated with pathogenesis in IPF. To determine the DNA methylation change, and their effects on gene expression, we compared microarray data of DNA methylation and RNA expression. Results provide that among the genes whose DNA methylation status and RNA expression were both significantly altered between IPF-rapid and normal controls.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis samples.
