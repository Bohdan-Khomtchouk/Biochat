TITLE
Histone H3 modifications ChIP on chip

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Chromatin modification through the covalent modifications of histones play crucial role on establishment and propagation of gene expression pattern. Here we sought a global view of histone H3 modifications (tri-M-K4/27 and di-M-K27/36) and occupancy in Arabidopsis thaliana using ChIP combined with high-density tiling microarrays. In these analyses, we included vip3 mutant plants as well to gain an insight into role of Paf1C in plants. Keywords: ChIP on chip
