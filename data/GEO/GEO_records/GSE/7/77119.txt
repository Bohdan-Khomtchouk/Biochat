TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of  CV. ‘Shine Muscat’  (Vitis vinifera L.) buds during dormant and non dormant period

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
We used Illumina RNA-Seq technology to carry out digital gene expression profiling of Dormant and non dormant buds of Shine Muscat Cultivar.127 pathways were annotated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, and metabolic, biosynthesis of secondry metabolite and. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis demonstrated that DEGs were involved in various metabolic processes, including phytohormone metabolism. The newly generated transcriptome and gene expression profiling data provide valuable genetic information for revealing transcriptomic variation during dormant and non dormant period in Grapevine and ultimately helpful in uplifting of table grape industry.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from 3 samples with three replication for each and compared within all samples
