TITLE
Transcriptomes regulated by NFAT5 in RAW264.7 macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the function of NFAT5 in macrophage, we performed transcriptome analysis in raw cells.

DESIGN
In order to identify reliable transcriptional targets of NFAT5, we introduced two strategies Including 1) stable knock-down of NFAT5 transcript using shRNA (shNFAT5) and 2) a decoy system that inhibits the NFAT5 binding to its promoter by stably transfecting of the cells with oligonucleotides harboring the consensus sequence for NFAT5 target genes (NFAT5-decoy).
