TITLE
Molecular distinctions between proprioceptors supplying Tibialis anterior (TA) and Gastrocnemius (GS) muscles [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Muscle-specific populations of proprioceptive sensory neurons form selective connections with spinal motor neurons, implying the existence of molecular distinctions between proprioceptor subpopulations. Here, we compare the gene expression profiles of proprioceptors that supply an antagonistic muscle pair functioning at a single hindlimb joint.

DESIGN
TA and GS muscles in a Pv::YFP reporter line were injected at p0  with ctb-555; retrogradely labeled  proprioceptors were manually isolated at p1 and pooled to form 25-30 neuron samples.
