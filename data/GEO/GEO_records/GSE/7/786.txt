TITLE
short and long attack latency mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two wild house mice lines were genetically selected for short and long attack latency. Mice with an attack latency < 50s or > 600s were considered short attack latency mice (SAL) and long attack latency mice(LAL) respectively. RNA from the hippocampus of 14 SAL or 14 LAL mice was pooled and used as input material for the SAGE libraries. Keywords: other
