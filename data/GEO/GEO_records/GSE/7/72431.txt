TITLE
Self-maintenance of rat C6 glioma stem cells (GSCs) by their non-GSC progenies

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Hoechst 33342 dye-effluxing side population cells (SP cells defined as glioma stem cells, GSCs) and dye-retaining main population cells (MP cells defined as non-GSCs) that were FACS-sorted from the C6 glioma cell line stably expressing EGFP (C6-eGFP). ECM-related genes, such as Col4a1 and Col4a2, and the iron carrier gene Tf are upregulated in MP cells. Results provide the insight into molecular basis underlying the maintenance of GSCs by non-GSCs.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles were compared between SP and MP cells just after FACS-sorting from the whole C6-eGFP cells based on their Hoechst-effluxing abilities.
