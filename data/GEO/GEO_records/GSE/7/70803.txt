TITLE
Total RNA profiles associated with DDX3 wild-type (WT) or R534H variant expression with or without sodium arsenite treatment [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA expression profiles are not significantly altered by DDX3 WT or R534H expression as well as by 45 minute exposure of cells to sodium arsenite.

DESIGN
Cells expressing either DDX3 WT or R534H variant were treated with or without sodium arsenite and lysed in the presence of cyclohexime. Total cellular RNAs were extracted and sequenced.
