TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac in chicken immature erythrocyte cells

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional regulation is impacted by multiple layers of genome organization. Here, we report that highly expressed genes were associated with H3K4me3 and H3K27ac.Our data provide a genome-wide profile of chromatin signatures in relation to expression levels in chicken immature erythrocytes.

DESIGN
Examination of two different histone modifications in immature erythrocyte cells
