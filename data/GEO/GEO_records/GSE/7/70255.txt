Resveratrol Supplementation Ameliorates Neuronal Insults in Cortical Brain Tissue of Nonhuman Primates Fed a High-Fat/Sucrose Diet

SUMMARY
Chronic high-fat/high-sugar (HFS) feeding is linked to the development of insulin resistance as well as arterial wall and adipose tissue inflammation in nonhuman primates. These changes are significantly reduced when the animals are fed a HFS diet supplemented with resveratrol (RSV) for two years. Herein, we evaluated the occurrence of cerebral cortex injury in these HFS-fed middle-aged male rhesus monkeys and investigated the possibility of brain protection by RSV treatment. HFS caused a reduction in capillary density in the cerebral cortex that was preempted by RSV supplementation. The patterns of cDNA microarray analysis revealed upregulation of markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in the cortical cortex of HFS-fed monkeys, which was reversed by RSV. The underlying mechanism of RSV action included its ability to prevent the HFS-mediated NF-kappa-B activation and loss in mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 expression. We conclude that RSV may confer neuroprotection against HFS-mediated cerebral vascular dysfunction and activation of inflammatory pathways.
