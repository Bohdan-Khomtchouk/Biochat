TITLE
The signaling pathway involved in  wild type and 2D2-gut CD4+ T cell development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To find the signalling pathway involved in WT/2D2 CD4+ gut T cell (CD4+ intraepithelial lymphocytes, CD4+IEL) differentiation, particulary to determine whether aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway is involved.

DESIGN
Gene expression was analyzed ex vivo in CD4+ T cells that were sorted from Wild type-Gut / 2D2 mouse-Gut / Wild type-Spleen / 2D2 mouse-Spleen  (N=3 per group). The genes highly expressed in WT/2D2 Gut compared to WT/2D2 Spleen were selected by k-means clustering. AHR pathway related genes (IPA software) were further selected.
