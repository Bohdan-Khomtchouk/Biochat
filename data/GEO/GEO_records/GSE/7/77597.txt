TITLE
RNA-Sequencing of HUVEC treated with Tie2 activating antibody

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed genome-wide transcriptional changes induced by ABTAA+Ang2, using RNA-seq analysis of HUVECs

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different antibodies treated to HUVEC to analyze the effect of Tie2 activation
