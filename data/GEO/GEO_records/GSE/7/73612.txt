TITLE
Gene expression analysis of inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the biological significance of IP6K1 function we compared the gene expression profile of two mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines each derived from Ip6k1+/+ and Ip6k1-/- embryos. Results reveal downregulation of several biological processes upon the loss of IP6K1.

DESIGN
Organism : Mus musculus , Agilent Gene Expression Whole Genome Mouse 4x44k (AMADID: 14868). Two biological replicates each of Ip6k1+/+ and Ip6k1-/- MEFs
