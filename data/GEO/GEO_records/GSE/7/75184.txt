TITLE
A transcriptional regulatory network connects mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic shift with stem cell commitment to hepatic differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism recently emerged as critical modulators of stemness properties and differentiation programmes. The increase in mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic shift toward increased oxidative phosphorylations (OXPHOS) appear as hallmarks of stem cell differentiation processes. While several mechanisms support the involvement of mitochondrial biogenesis and function in the regulation of stem cell differentiation, the mechanisms triggering mitochondrial biogenesis in the context of cell differentiation remain elusive. In this study, we performed transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses in order to get deeper insights into the cross-regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and hepatogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). We identified a transcriptional regulatory network involved in the co-regulation of stem cell differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis.

DESIGN
Transcriptomics analyses performed at early time points of the hepatogenic differentiation of BM-MSC
