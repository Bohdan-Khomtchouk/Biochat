TITLE
Global gene expression in ocular isolates of Escherichia coli with potential to form biofilm

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The results of this study would unravel the identity of genes that are differentially regulated during biofilm formation and establish whether the differentially regulated genes are related to increased resistance to antimicrobials and or virulence.

DESIGN
The results indicate that ocular biofilm E. coli cells differ from non-biofilm E.coli cells in genes related to biofilm formation, cell adhesion, antimicrobial efflux pumping, stationary phase related and virulence exhibition which were all up-regulated. The findings also include upregulation of several genes encoding for toxin production and secretions (sat, yjgK, chpS, chpB and ygjN), pointing towards the virulence behaviour in E. coli L-1216/2013 biofilm cells.
