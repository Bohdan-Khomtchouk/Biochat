TITLE
Brain gene expression associated with facial recognition in Polistes fuscatus paper wasps

ORGANISM
Polistes fuscatus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to analyze genome-wide brain gene expression during facial and pattern learning for P. fuscatus, the only insect known to possess individual facial recognition. Furthermore, we investigated whether social environment affected a worker's facial learning ability and brain gene expression.

DESIGN
PRJNA287145; We sequenced total RNA from 17 individual Polistes fuscatus adult brains from 4 groups: foundresses trained to faces (n=5), foundresses trained to patterns (n=4), workers reared on non-natal conspecific nest and trained to faces (n=4), workers reared on non-natal allospecific nest and trained to faces (n=4).
