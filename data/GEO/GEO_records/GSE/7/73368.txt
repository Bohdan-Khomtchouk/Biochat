TITLE
A HAND2 Cistrome Controls Heart Development and the Endothelial-Mesenchymal Transition during Cardiac Valve Formation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our analysis identifies the direct transcriptional targets of HAND2 in mouse embryonic hearts, both ih second heart field derived structures and in the formation of the cardiac cushions

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq analysis using a Hand2-3xFlag allele on dissected E10.5 cardiac embryonic tissues
