TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq analysis of sensory neurons reveal diverse injury responses after sciatic nerve transection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We  reported the gene expression analysis of different types of sensory neuron with peripheral nerve transection treatment on single cell level. We found substantial variation between myelinated large diameter neurons and small diameter nonpeptidergic nociceptors, in both terms of regeneration response genes regulation as well as fraction of cells respond to nerve injury.

DESIGN
Two month old adult CAST/Eij ♂ cross C57BL/6♀F1 and C57BL/6 mice were performed sciatic nerve transection on the right side. Single DRG soma from L3-5 on both side were manually picked in the lowest possible volume and then performed single cell RNA-seq using smart-seq2 protocol.  A total of 106 dissociated DRG neurons for each side with almost equal number of small, medium and large diameter neurons were lysed and split into three parts in order to constructed bulk cell control.
