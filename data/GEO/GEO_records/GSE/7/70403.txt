TITLE
DNA microarray analysis of PBMCs from Behçet’s disease (BD) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine if gene expression profiles of many Behçet’s disease (BD) patients are commonly abnormal compared to those of healthy volunteers, we performed a genome-wide complementary DNA microarray analysis using an Agilent Hu44K array; RNA samples were isolated from the PBMCs of 41 individual BD patients (32 females and 9 males) and 17 normal volunteers.

DESIGN
A total of 41 two color arrays were performed and each individual array included a target sample and a control sample.
