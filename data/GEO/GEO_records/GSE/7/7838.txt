TITLE
Comprehensive Gene ExpressionProfiling of Peyer’s Patch M Cells, Villous M-like Cells, and Intestinal Epithelial Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Separate populations of M cells have been detected in the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer’s patches (PPs) and the villous epithelium of the small intestine, but the traits shared by or distinguishing the two populations have not been characterized. Our separate study has demonstrated that M cells are rare but M-like cells positive for lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 and our newly developed M cell-specific mAb NKM16-2-4 are induced by oral administration of cholera toxin in the duodenal villous epithelium. Here, we determined the gene expression of PP M cells, villous M-like cells, and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) isolated by a novel approach using FACS. Specific expression of glycoprotein 2 (GP2) and MARCKS-like protein (MLP) by PP M cells and not villous M-like cells was confirmed by additional mRNA and protein analyses. Comprehensive gene profiling also suggested that villous M-like cells share traits of both PP M cells and IECs, a finding that is supported by their unique expression of specific chemokines. The genome-wide assessment of gene expression facilitates discovery of M cell-specific molecules and enhances the molecular understanding of M cell immunobiology. Keywords: Cell type comparison
