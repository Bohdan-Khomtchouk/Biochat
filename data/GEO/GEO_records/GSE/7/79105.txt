TITLE
Ptbp2 controls an alternative splicing network required for cell communication during spermatogenesis [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alternative splicing (AS) plays key roles in the specialization of cell functions in different tissues and stages of development. In spermatogenic cells, the complexity of AS isoforms exceeds that of most whole tissues, but the regulation, dynamics, and functions of AS in spermatogenesis have remained poorly defined. We previously demonstrated that the RNA binding protein Ptbp2 is essential for cell survival during spermatogenesis, however the underlying mechanisms were not explored. To investigate this, we generated paired-end RNA-Seq data from wild type (WT) and Ptbp2 conditional knockout (cKO) testes at postnatal day 25 (p25) using Illumina ScriptSeqâ„¢ v2 RNA-Seq library preparation kits and sequenced at the CWRU Sequencing Core. Our resulting analyses demonstrate that Ptbp2 is a critical AS regulator in spermatogenic cells, where it controls a functionally-related network of genes involved in germ cell adhesion and protein trafficking to and from the plasma membrane. In parallel, we identified distinct AS programs in different stages of spermatogenesis, and defined a role for Ptbp2 in stage-specific AS regulation. Collectively, the data provide new insights into the importance of AS in mammalian germ cell development and demonstrate a central role for Ptbp2 in its regulation.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling of testes in wild type (WT) and Ptbp2-deficient (cKO) mice at postnatal day 25 (p25) by deep sequencing, in duplicate using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
