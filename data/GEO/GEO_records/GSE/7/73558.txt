TITLE
Affymetrix SNP6 array data for NLPHL- and PMBCL-derived cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We previously identified rearrangements involving CIITA, the master transcriptional regulator of MHC class II expression, as common mutational events in PMBCL and cHL. In order to inform on the prevalence and different types of structural genomic aberrations affecting CIITA in PMBCL and HL we performed high-resolution copy number analysis. Affymetrix SNP6 arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions on DNA extracted from cell lines.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP6 arrays was performed for 1 NLPHL- and 3 PMBCL-derived cell lines.
