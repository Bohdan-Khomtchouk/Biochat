TITLE
Hyperoxia in FGF10 knock-down mice [Lung]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our previous data obtained by using immunohistochemistry showed, that Fgf10+/- (50% Fgf10 expression compared to WT) in hyperoxic condition at postnatal day 3 (P3) compared to WT  has less vessel count in the lung and less muscularization of small capillaries in the lung. Furthermore, Fgf10+/- showed a drastic increase in mortality upon hyperoxic lung injury. Main question to be answer by this experiment is as followed: Does Fgf10+/-  mice after hyperoxia from P0-P3 show different expression profiles at P3 compared to WT? To adress this question we harvest lungs at P3 from WT and Fgf10+/- after hyperoxia treatment from P0-P3. For this the mice were sacrificed by Ketamin/ Dormitor ip, lungs were perfused transcardiac with PBS and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment (genotype x treatment): wild-type mice and Fgf10+/- mice are kept in either normoxic or hyperoxic conditions. Sample size: 4 per group (16 total)
