TITLE
Transcriptional immune response of PRRSV-infected porcine dendritic cells and monocytes to Streptococcus suis infection

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We investigated for the first time the in vitro response of PRRSV-infected porcine DCs and monocytes to S. suis. We first assessed the effect of PRRSV infection on the phagocytosis and intracellular survival of S. suis by these two cell populations. We then used a genomic approach to compare the gene expression profiles of both type of cells infected with S. suis, with or without a previous infection with PRRSV.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from porcine monocytes and dendritic cells infected with S. suis, PRRSV, or S. suis & PRRSV. Four replicates in all groups.
