TITLE
Global gene expression differences between blood- and lymphatic-specific human dermal microvascular endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed high throughput RNA-sequencing on blood and lymphatic HMVECs to identify differences in gene expression between these two cell types that may provide insight into their respective differentiation and roles in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from blood-specific HMVEC and lymphatic-specific HMVEC cell lines 3 separate times each
