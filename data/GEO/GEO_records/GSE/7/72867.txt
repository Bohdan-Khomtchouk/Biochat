TITLE
DNA methylation response of hematopoietic stem cells to recombinant lentiviral vector infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human cord blood CD34+ cells respond to the infection with LV by modifying the methylation profile of a large number of CpG sites in their genome. Different vector preparations vary in their capacity to trigger a response; some induce sporadic modifications only while others trigger a strong response that systematically includes de novo methylation of the same 4126 CpG-s corresponding to 1059 genes

DESIGN
Illumina Infinium 450K arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on bisulfite converted gDNA extracted from CD34+ cells from cord blood. CpG methylation profiling on Illumina Infinium 450K arrays was performed.
