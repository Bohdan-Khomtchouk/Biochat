TITLE
The Protein Non-anchored cell wall protein NCW-1 promotes cellulase production through effects on cellobiose uptake in Neurospora crassa

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
The mechanism of cellulase induction in the filamentous fungi is still not completely understood, and the components of this pathway are not well characterized. In this study, the mechanism of how the non-anchored cell wall protein NCW-1 (NCU05137) affect the cellulases induction was investigated. Transcriptome analysis of this quadruple deletion strain △3βG△ncw-1 showed that the expression of major cellulase, cellodextrin transporters and cellulase regulators were significantly increased. Taken together, the cellulase expression machinery was dramatically stimulated in Δ3βGΔncw-1. These results make us understanding the ncw-1 function better and deepened our knowledge about the cellulase induction in N. crassa.

DESIGN
△3βG△ncw-1 and △3βG were precultured for 20 h in MM, and then transferred into Vogel’s salts containing 1% cellobiose for an additional 4 h. Total RNA from frozen samples was extracted and treated.
