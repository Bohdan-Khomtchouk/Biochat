ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Study of the role of the FLV/DOT4 protein in post-transcriptional regulation of chloroplast gene expression. DOT4 is a pentatricopeptide repeat protein targeted to the chloroplast which regulates the editing of the rpoC1 transcript

DESIGN
The editing level of rpoC1 varies from one tissue to the other and because the main macroscopic phenotype of the flv/dot4 mutant are white leaf margins. We compared  the leaf border to the leaf center of wild-type Col0 plants but also the leaf borders of col0 and flv/dot4 knock out mutants by sequencing total RNA depleted from rRNA  to get a global view of gene expression (including post-transcrional modifications) of the 3 plant genomes: nucleus, chloroplast and mitochondria. mRNA seq on wild-type Col and FLV mutants knock out.
