TITLE
Expression data from E12.5 male fatal PGCs, PGCLC in vitro, round spermatids and spermatids like cells produced in vitro

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Generation of haploid gametes in vitro can potentially address gamete failure-based infertility.This study reports complete in vitro meiosis from murine ESC-derived PGCLCs resulting in the formation of male spermatid-like cells (SLCs) capable of producing viable fertile offspring via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).Our findings provide the basis for generation of haploid spermatids in vitro in human, the generation of transgenic animals, and the use of this system to investigate mechanisms of meiosis.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to compare gene expression profiles of in vivo and in vitro derived PGC cells and round spermatids. We collected E12.5 male fatal PGCs, PGCLC in vitro, round spermatids and spermatids like cells produced in vitro, each sample has 3 replications.
