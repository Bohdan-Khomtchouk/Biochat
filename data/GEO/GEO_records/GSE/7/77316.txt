TITLE
Expression analysis of Plasmodium falciparum male and female gametocytes

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level in Plasmodium falciparum male and female mature gametocytes, and detection of any transcriptional differences between male and female gametocytes. The Plasmodium falciparum parasite with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression under the control of alpha tubulin II promoter facilitated the separation of male and female gametocyte. This engineered parasite strain in this study are further described in Miao J,  Fan Q,  Parker D,  Li X,  Li J,  et al.

DESIGN
A 4 chip study using total RNA recovered from 2 sorted stage V male gametocyte  (3 X 10^ 6) and 2 sorted stage V female gametocyte ( (3 X 10^ 6).  The chip used in this stury was a custom designed microarray by agilent eArray (array name: MALARIAARRAY_JM, Design ID: 048532, Design format: 4 X 44K, Control grid: IS-45220-4-V1_4x44K_GX_EQC_V20060608 )
