TITLE
4sUDRB-seq of human PA1 cells, undifferentiated H9 cells and H9 differentiated FB neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have optimized the metabolic tagging of newly transcribed RNAs by 4-thiouridine (4sU) to identify newly-transcribed (nascent) circRNAs from human PA1 cells, undifferentiated H9 cells and H9 differentiated FB neurons.

DESIGN
Ribo-4sUDRB-seq for characterizing nascent circRNA biogenesis.
