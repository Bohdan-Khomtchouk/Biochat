SUMMARY
There remains a need for analysis of CD4 helper T cells differentiation in vivo. To this end ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD4 (OTII) T cells transferred into congenic mice were studied. Live attenuated OVA-expressing Salmonella (SalOVA) induce T-bet and IFN-g in OTII cells, while alum-precipitated OVA (alumOVA) induces GATA-3 and IL-4. Although 70% of alumOVA-responding OTII cells express GATA-3, only 7% produce IL-4. Thus Th2-polarization defined solely by IL-4 production does not recognize the diversity of GATA-3-expressing effectors. Low-density arrays were designed to assess the expression of 384 genes by real-time RT-PCR. Extensive early diversification occurred in both responses. SalOVA selectively induced many chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, while alumOVA induced few Th2-associated cytokines. Several cytokines and molecules associated with Th17 cells and follicular helper cells were also induced by both antigens. The transcription factor Helios was exclusively induced in alumOVA-responding OTII cells, and critically not in standard in vitro Th2-polarization systems. Early synchronous up-regulation of Helios and GATA-3 mRNA is paralleled at protein level with largely coincident localization in specific nuclear foci of OTII cells responding to alumOVA. This appears to be consistent with a key role for both transcription regulators in the direction of Th2 responses in vivo. Keywords: In vivo T cell polarization
