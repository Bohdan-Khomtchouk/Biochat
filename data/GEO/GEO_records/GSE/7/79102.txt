TITLE
SC3-consensus clustering of single cell RNA-Seq data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a new unsupervised clustering tool for single cell RNA-seq data called SC3. We show that biologically relevant information can be obtained from preneoplastic cells of patients with myeloprolifertive disease.

DESIGN
examination of three different patients with myeloproloferative disease
