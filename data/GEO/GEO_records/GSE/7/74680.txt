TITLE
Expression data from the spinal cord of wild-type C57Bl/6 mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The spinal cords of mice submitted to aortic cross-clamping for 7.5 minutes present with gray matter damage and central cord edema. 60% of mice subsequently experience hindlimb and tail paralysis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression following aotic cross-clamping, in order to identify genes that could be responsible for edema and paralysis.

DESIGN
RNAs extracted from the rostral (above T6) and caudal (below T6) part of the spinal cords of wild-type mice 24 and 48 hours following aortic cross-clamping were used for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Mice submitted to sham surgery were used as controls.
