TITLE
Immune-mediated Inflammation May Contribute to the Pathogenesis of Cardiovascular Disease in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Comparisons of canine arterial gene expression between control and untreated MPS animals were conducted with a canine-specific microarray covering 43,803 probes (Agilent G2519F 4x44k, Santa Clara, CA), for a total of four comparison groups: MPS ascending aorta vs. control ascending aorta, MPS descending aorta vs. control descending aorta, MPS carotid artery vs. control carotid artery, and finally pooled MPS artery (ascending aorta, descending aorta, carotid artery) vs. pooled control artery. Each comparison used four pairs of MPS vs corresponding age- and gender- matched animals to produce four biologic replicates.

DESIGN
Four total comparison groups were made: MPS ascending aorta vs. control ascending aorta, MPS descending aorta vs. control descending aorta, MPS carotid artery vs. control carotid artery, and finally pooled MPS artery (ascending aorta, descending aorta, carotid artery) vs. pooled control artery. Each comparison used four pairs of MPS vs corresponding age- and gender- matched animals to produce four biologic replicate.  These experiments were conducted with dual-channel arrays but the data are presented separately for each channel. Raw data are available in a tar archive on the series record.
