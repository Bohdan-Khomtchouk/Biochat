TITLE
Transcriptome response to 4h IL-1b stimulation of primary chondrocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using RNA sequencing (Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 sequencer) we report the transcriptome profile of primary human chondrocytes isolated from patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA), and the transcriptome response of these cells to 4h stimulation with IL-1β (1ng/ml).  In total, 983 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified, which included 642 intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), 124 antisense and pseudogenes.  Less than 4% of the identified lncRNAs overlapped with putative eRNAs regions, and visual inspection showed that they were uni-directional and multi-exonic.  Upon  IL-1β stimulation 499 protein-coding genes were differentially expressed, and 158 lncRNAs were differentially expressed, including 92 lincRNAs, 13 antisense and 18 psudogenes.  This study demonstrates that IL-1β induces a rapid and widespread change in the transcriptome of the primary human OA chondrocyte.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing analysis of primary human chondrocytes isolated from n=3 patients with hip osteoarthritis, with and without 4h IL-1b (1ng/ml) stimulation
