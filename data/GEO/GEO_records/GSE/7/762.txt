SUMMARY
The experiment design was multifold, consisting of a time course experiment on LNCaP C4-2 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells following irradiation to a dose of 10 Sv from a Cesium-137 mixed gamma and beta source, with two additional samples, one exposed to radiation in four fractions instead of all at once, and one containing the parent LNCaP cell line.  PolyA+ RNA was extracted, processed and hybridized to the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, www.affymetrix.com) HGU-95 (Av1-E) chip sets, and then washed, stained and scanned according to Affymetrix's protocols contained in the GeneChip(R) Expression Analysis Manual.  Transcript abundance data from the scans was processed initially with Affymetrix' Microarray Suite 5(R), then by Silicon Genetics' (Redwood City, CA, www.silicongenetics.com) GeneSpring(R).
