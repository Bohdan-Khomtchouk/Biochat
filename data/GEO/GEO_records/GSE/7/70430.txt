TITLE
Substantia nigra (SN) and basal ganglia (BG) gene expression in neurodegenertion with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) cases vs normal controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression is assessed in substantia nigra and basal ganglia of  neurodegenertion with brain iron accumulation cases (BIA)  compared to matched normal controls (c).

DESIGN
Post-mortem substantia nigra and basal ganglia of two clinicopathologically confirmed NBIA cases of unknown genetic subtype from the Canadian Brain Tissue Bank, University of Toronto, compared to two age- and gender-matched adults with no diagnosed neurological conditions from the Newcastle Brain Tissue Resource, University of Newcastle, UK.  Tissue was obtained with fully informed consent and the study approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Newcastle, Australia (H-2010-1219).
