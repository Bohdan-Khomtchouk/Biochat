TITLE
Effect of FSH on granulosa cell expression in cow.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
FSH signaling is well known to lead to steroidogenesis, cellular proliferation, and follicular growth. The development of global transcriptomic allows to expand our understanding of the FSH effect on several additional functions of granulosa cells and to better understand how it controls or prevents several differentiation events in granulosa cells from medium size follicles

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, CTR vs. FSH treated bovine granulosa cells. Biological replicates: 4 control replicates, 4 treated replicates. Experiments done in dye-swap.
