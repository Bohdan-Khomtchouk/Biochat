TITLE
RNA-sequencing of B-ALL cell lines, REH treated with LNA GapmeRs against four lncRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overwhelming evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs have essential roles in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, their expression and role in pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia has not been extensively explored. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome in ETV6/RUNX1 positive BCP-ALL, one of the most frequent subtypes of pediatric leukemia. An ETV6/RUNX1 expression signature was established, consisting of 596 lncRNAs (434 up and 162 down) using expression analysis of a series of primary patient samples. Subsequently, RNA sequencing from BCP-ALL cell lines and shRNA-mediated silencing of ETV6/RUNX1, illustrated that lnc-NKX2-3-1, lnc-TIMM21-5, lnc-ASTN1-1 and lnc-RTN4R-1 are bona fide ETV6/RUNX1 targets and could serve as novel biomarkers of this prevalent subtype of human leukemia.

DESIGN
REH cell lines were treated with LNA GapmeRs. Cells were collected 72h after treatment. This was performed for 3 replicates. RNA-sequencing was performed on these samples.
