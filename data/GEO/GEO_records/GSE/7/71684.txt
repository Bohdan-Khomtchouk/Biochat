TITLE
Study of microRNA associated with galectin-9 and anti-tumor effect in cholangiocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miRNAs expression was markedly altered with the treatment of galectin-9 in vivo and various miRNAs induced by galectin-9 also may contribute to tumor growth of cholangiocarcinoma in vivo.

DESIGN
Using a custom microarray platform, we analyzed the expression levels of 2019 human miRNA probes in the tumorous tissues in vivo that was treated with and without galectin-9.
