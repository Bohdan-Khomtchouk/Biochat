TITLE
Geographical and host plant influences on transcriptional variation in Drosophila mojavensis: mapping gene expression differences in both sexes

ORGANISM
Drosophila mojavensis

SUMMARY
Geographical and host plant influences on transcriptional variation in Drosophila mojavensis: mapping gene expression differences in both sexes. (1. Punta Onah:PO07; 2. Organ Pipe National Monument:OPNM08; 3. Punta Prieta:PP08; & 4. San Quintin:SQ08). The experiment was designed to investigate effects of host plant (diet), mating status (mated:M or nonmated:V) and sex (male:male or Female:F) on transcriptome.

DESIGN
A total of 128 hybridizations were performed in this entire experiment (127 in the final analysis). We used 135K 12-plex NimbleGen arrays. Total RNA was recovered from each sample listed below. The experimental design consisted a total of four populations (1. Punta Onah:PO; 2. Organ Pipe National Monument:OPNM; 3. Punta Prieta:PP; & 4. San Quintin:SQ), two mating status (mated:M or nonmated:V), both the sexes (male:male or Female:F) fed on two different diet regimes (Agria and Organ pipe). Each chip measures the expression level of 15528 transcripts. Four to 5 replicates were used for each type (R-1, R-2, R-3 etc.)
