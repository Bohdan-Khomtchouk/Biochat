TITLE
Identification of genes involved in cell wall integrity signalling in Arabidopsis dark-grown hypocotyls

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Inhibition of cellulose synthesis by chemical inhibitors or in a mutant background leads to rapid inhibition of cell elongation. This inhibition appears to be an active process, which involves feedback signalling from the cell wall. We have isolated two loci THE1 and THE2, which are identified by mutations that partially suppress the dark-grown hypocotyl phenotype in a mutant background for cellulose synthase catalytic subunit CESA6/PROCUSTE1. THE1 encodes a receptor kinase and may play a role in this feedback signalling process. To identify genes that are regulated by THE1 and THE2, we compared the transcript profiles of 5 day-old dark-grown seedlings of the1-1/prc1-1 with prc1-1 ; the1-3/prc1-8 with prc1-8 ; prc1-8 or the1-3 with WS and the2-1/prc1-1 with prc1-1.  - We have isolated two loci THE1 and THE2, which are identified by mutations that partially suppress the dark-grown hypocotyl phenotype in a mutant background for cellulose synthase catalytic subunit CESA6/PROCUSTE1.
