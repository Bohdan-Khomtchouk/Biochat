TITLE
Human neural stem cells transduced with oncogenic elements associated with aggressive medulloblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human neural stem and progenitor cells transformed with c-MYC, dominant-negative p53, constitutively active AKT and hTERT formed tumors in mice that recapitulated Group 3 medulloblastoma in terms of pathology and expression profile

DESIGN
Isogenic model systems and mouse xenografts
