TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of transcriptomes for developing fruits derived from sweet orange varieties

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
Transcriptome comparsions and integrated systems analysis were used to identify candidate genes associated with fruit acidity control and gene coexpression subnetworks involved in fruit acid accumulation.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of fruit tissues at two stages (45 days postanthesis (DPA); and 142 DPA) from four varieties with differing fruit acidity.
