TITLE
Gene expression signatures of transgenic and wild-type tobaccos under normal or salt-stress conditions

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
To understand the effect of salt stress on CbFAD3 transgenic and wild-type tobaccos, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling of transgenic and wild-type plants under normal or salt-stress conditons, respectively. We also found the founction of CbFAD3 gene on tobaccos through comparing these data.
