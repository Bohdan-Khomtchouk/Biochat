TITLE
Microarray analysis of regulatory and inflammatory macrophages differentiated with glycolysis inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The gene expression patterns of macrophages were analyzed to understand how glycolysis inhibitor affects macrophage differentiation. Human monocytes derived from peripheral blood were cultured in vitro in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) to yield regulatory macrophages (M-Mφs), or M-CSF plus interferon-gamma to yield inflammatory macrophages (Mγ-Mφs). 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a glycolysis inhibitor, was added during macrophage differentiation. Gene expression patterns of monocytes, M-Mφs and Mγ-Mφs diffrentiated with or without 2-DG were analyzed by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Gene expression patterns of monocytes, M-Mφs and Mγ-Mφs differentiated with or without 3 mM 2-DG for 6-days were analyzed. For each condition, equal amounts of RNA from 3 individuals were mixed and provided for microarray analysis.
