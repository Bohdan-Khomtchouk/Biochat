TITLE
Expression data from HeLa cells treated with collismycin A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Collismycin A is a microbial product. We used microarrays to examine the effect of collismycin A on gene expression of HeLa cells.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were treated with collismycin A or DMSO for 18h for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix  microarrays. For comparison, Dp44mT-treated HeLa cells were also prepared.
