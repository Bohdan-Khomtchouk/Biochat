TITLE
AKT regulates de novo induction of Foxp3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells play an essential role in maintaining tolerance via their suppressive function on conventional T cells.  The intracellular signaling pathways that regulate Foxp3 expression are largely unknown.  In this study we describe a novel inhibitory role for AKT in regulating de novo induction of Foxp3 both in vivo and in vitro.  A constitutively active allele of AKT significantly diminished TGF-Ã¢ induced Foxp3 induction via a rapamycin-sensitive pathway, establishing a role for the AKT-mTOR axis in Treg cells. Moreover, the observed impairment in Foxp3 induction was paralleled by a selective downmodulation of the imparted Treg transcriptional signature highlighting the importance of the balance of intracellular signals in Treg differentiation .  Our results provide a basis for further elucidation of molecular mechanisms that regulate Foxp3 induction and identify AKT as an important negative regulator of this process.
