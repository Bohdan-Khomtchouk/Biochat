TITLE
Expression data of MACS sorted cells (SSEA-1+ and SSEA-1-) from porcine fetal fibroblast cell line

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
A subset of cells in cellular populations may be preferentially reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells due to their innate gene expression characteristics. SSEA-1+ sorted cells were shown to be more amenable to reprogramming than other cells in porcine fetal fibroblast cell lines. This microarray data reveals which genes are unique to the SSEA1+ sorted cells and helps to give them an identity.

DESIGN
Porcine fetal fibroblasts were subjected to Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting using anti-SSEA-1. Five biological replicates were performed resulting in 5 SSEA-1 positive fractions and 5 SSEA-1 negative fractions which were analyzed.
