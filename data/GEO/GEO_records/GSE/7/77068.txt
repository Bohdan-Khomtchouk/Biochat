TITLE
Whole transcriptome sequencing of phage φR1-37 and its host Yersinia enterocolitica  

ORGANISM
Yersinia enterocolitica

SUMMARY
RNA-sequencing was preformed from RNA isolated from bacteria infected with the bacteriophage. In order to  reveal the phage-host interactions between φR1-37 and Yersinia enterocolitica throughout the phage infection cycle, both the transcriptomes were scrutinized during all the stages of infection.

DESIGN
Fresh cultures (logarythmic phase) of Yersinia enterocolitica YeO3-R1 were infected with bacteriophage R1-37. The RNA samples were taken at following time points post-infection: 0 (negative control), 2, 5, 10, 15, 21, 28, 35, 42 1nd 49 min.
