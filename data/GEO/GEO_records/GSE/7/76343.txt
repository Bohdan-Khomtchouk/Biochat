TITLE
Gene expression profile in cells treated with different oligonucleotides

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oligonucleotides are normally used to down regulate gene expression via RISC or RNase H dependent mechanisms. However, properly designed oliognucleotides can be used to specifically increase translation of proteins by targeting certain regions of mRNAs. To determine if this type of oligonucleotide that does not activate RNA cleavage causes off-targeted effects, microarray was performed to evaluate the gene expression in cells treated with different oligonucleotides.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were treated for 15 hr with oligonucleotides at 30 nM final concentration, under this condition the targeted protein level was increased. RNA was perpared from treated cells and analyzed by microarray.
