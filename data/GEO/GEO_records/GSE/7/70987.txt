TITLE
Genomic evidence for the Pleistocene and Recent population history of Native Americans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
How and when the Americas were populated remains contentious. Using ancient and modern genome-wide data, we find that the ancestors of all present-day Native Americans, including Athabascans and Amerindians, entered the Americas as a single migration wave from Siberia no earlier than 23 thousand years ago (KYA), and after no more than 8,000-year isolation period in Beringia. Native Americans diversified into two basal genetic branches around 13 KYA, one in North and South America and the other restricted to North America. Subsequent gene flow resulted in some Native Americans sharing ancestry with present-day East Asians and Australo-Melanesians, the latter possibly through the ancestors of Aleutian Islanders. Putative relict populations in South America, including the historical Peric√∫es and Fuego-Patagonians, are not directly related to modern Australo-Melanesians.

DESIGN
3 samples were analysed with the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad Genotyping BeadChip and are described herein.
