TITLE
Dissecting cell-type-specific roles of androgen receptor in prostate homeostasis and regeneration through lineage tracing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RNA-seq to compare the gene expression profiles of adult mouse prostate luminal cells and luminal cells that have the androgen receptor (AR) gene deleted. Our analyses show that AR-null luminal cells have altered expression levels of genes involved in cell-matrix adhesion, cytoskeleton regulation, and MAPK and TGF-beta signaling pathways. These results are consistent with our finding that AR-null luminal cells have abnormal cell morphology and loss of cell polarity.

DESIGN
Lineage marked wild-type luminal cells and AR-deleted luminal cells were flow-sorted based on YFP fluorescence respectively, and their expression profiles were analyzed by RNA-seq.
