TITLE
Haploinsufficiency in bromodomain containing 2 (Brd2) gene remodels synaptic transmission in female mouse striatum in a sex-specific manner

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our previous work showed that Brd2+/- mouse models the sex specific characteristics of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, a subsyndrome of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Here, we investigated a role of Brd2 gene in modulating the genomic fabrics responsible for the glutamatergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic and serotonergic transmission in the striatum of female mice. Agilent two-color gene expression arrays and the genomic fabric paradigm were used to determine whether the expression and networking of genes involved in the synaptic transmission differ between Brd2+/- and wildtype mice and whether these differences are sex-specific. As in Brd+/- male mice we found relatively few regulated genes in Brd2+/-female mice with respect to their wildtype counterparts. However, most of the regulated genes were directly related to control of anxiety and seizures, justifying the role of Brd2 upstream control of these traits. Remarkably, the sets of regulated genes in the two sexes did not overlap, supporting the conclusion of sex-specific control of traits by Brd2.

DESIGN
Agilent mouse two-color gene expression arrays to profile striata of the prefrontal cortices of wildtype (W) and Brd2+/- (H) mouse female (F) adult C57Bl/6j mice. Differently labeled biological replicates were cohybridized with each array. Results of similarly labeled different conditions were compared then averaged for the two fluorescent labels. For instance: FW1 & FW3 were compared with FH1 & FH3, FW2 & FW4 were compared  with FH2 & + FH4, and the results of the comparisons averaged. This design uses 100% of the resources, has a better normlaiztion and allows all possible comparisons among the conditions.
