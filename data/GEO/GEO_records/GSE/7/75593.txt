TITLE
Common asymptomatic and submicroscopic malaria infections in Western Thailand revealed in longitudinal molecular and serological studies: a challenge to malaria elimination.

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Malaria is the most important vector-borne disease in Southeast Asia. In Thailand, malaria incidence has been in decline, with the annual parasite incidence dropping to 0.56 in 2007. The Myanmar-Thai border province of Tak is considered meso-endemic for malaria, and both Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and P. falciparum (Pf) are equally present. As part of the International Centers for Excellence in Malaria Research (ICEMR) - Southeast Asia project, malaria surveillance is conducted in Tak on both the healthy population and hospital patients, and parasite prevalence is reportedly < 1%. However, little is known about the immuno-epidemiology associated with Pf and Pv infections in the region regarding the breadth and targets of the antibody response to the malaria parasites. Our hypothesis is that the serological profiles of the population will reflect the low parasite prevalence in Tak, showing little antibody reactivity to Pv and Pf. To examine this question, we developed a protein microarray displaying the top 500 most immunogenic antigens of these two Plasmodium species. We collected whole blood samples from healthy residents of Mae Salid Noi village during a Mass Blood Survey for malaria in the region. Whole blood was sent to UCI for qPCR and serology analysis. Blood plasma was probed on the protein microarray; genomic DNA was extracted from RBC pellets and screened by qPCR for infection confirmation and species identification. One-hundred percent (n=381) of serum samples were reactive to both Pv and Pf antigens, including all qPCR-negative samples.
