TITLE
Expression data of cultured organoids derived from human colorectal tumors and normal samples.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression of 58 line patinet-derived colorectal tumors and normal organoids.

DESIGN
mRNA from 58 cultured organoids were extracted and hybridized to GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Array, and scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.
