TITLE
Cdx ParaHox genes acquired distinct developmental roles after gene duplication in vertebrate evolution

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
We examined the degree of regulatory and functional overlap between the three vertebrate Cdx genes using single and triple morpholino knock-down in Xenopus tropicalis followed by RNA-seq.

DESIGN
Stage 14 (early neurula) embryos derived from eggs injected with morpholinos against Cdx1, Cdx2, Cdx4 and a mixture of all three plus corresponding uninjected embryos. All in triplicates.
