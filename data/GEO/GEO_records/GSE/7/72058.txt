TITLE
Activated neutrophils are associated with pediatric cerebral malaria vasculopathy in Malawian children

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to characterize the whole blood global  gene expression profiles in 98 children with P. falciparum cerebral malaria We associated retinopathy status with host genes and pathways to explore mechanisms of infected red sequestration to the microvasculature in CM

DESIGN
Cross sectional study of chidlren with CM, expression profiling derived from study enrollment whole blood sample RNA isolated from sample stored in Tri-Reagent BD; hybridization with Affymetrix Gene Chip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array.
