TITLE
Whole-genome DNA methylation analysis  for purified WT, Pld6 KO, and Dnmt3l KO spermatogonia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA methylomes were obtained to analyze methylation levels of retrotransposons as welll as the genome-wide methylation levels.

DESIGN
Bisulfite shotgun sequencing libraries were prepared by the PBAT method, and sequenced by HiSeq2500
