TITLE
Gene expression profiling from pooled samples of liver tissue of liver MyD88 WT mice and MyD88 liver specific KO mice fed either with a control diet or a high-fat diet.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice wild type or knocked-out for the MyD88 gene specifically in liver, were recruited for this expression profiling experiment. Each group of mice (WT versus LKO) were fed with a control diet or a high fat diet. Then mice were sacrificed and liver samples form were processed for RNA extraction. Total liver RNA of each sample was then pooled with those of the same group and treatment for microarray hybridization.

DESIGN
four groups of mice: (I) WT-CT, (II) MyD88 liver specific KO (LKO-CT), (III) WT treated with high-fat diet (WT-HFD) and (IV) MyD88 liver specific KO treated with high-fat diet (LKO-HFD) .
