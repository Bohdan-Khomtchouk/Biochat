TITLE
Regulation of androgen receptor signaling by Oct1 recruitment in prostate cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and AR downstream signalings promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. To investigate the AR signaling, we performed ChIP sequence analysis in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and VCaP. In addition, we also examined the effect of PI polyamide specificly inhibit Oct1 binding to AR occupied-regions.

DESIGN
ChIP sequence analysis of AR binding sites and epigenetic condition in two prostate cancer cells
