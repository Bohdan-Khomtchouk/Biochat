TITLE
Whole RNA sequencing to identify targets of ets-4 that are responsible for rege-1 (C30F12.1) phenotype

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Ets-4 was previously identified as a suppressor of rege-1(rrr13) phenotype. The goal of this experiment was to identify down-stream regulators of ETS-4, which facilitate this suppression.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling of C.elegans young adults of ets-4 knockdown or mock RNAi control in the background of rege-1(rrr13)
