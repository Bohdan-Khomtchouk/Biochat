TITLE
Transcription profiling of 8 months and 24 months old rat radial and sciatic nerves

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to determine which pathways are significantly regulated with age in sciatic and radial nerves, individually or considering the interaction term. We find a strong signature of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway being downregulated with age in both nerves, however, this effect is significantly milder in the radial nerve.

DESIGN
We collected both radial and sciatic nerves from 8 adult (8 months old) and 8 old (24 months old) rats.
