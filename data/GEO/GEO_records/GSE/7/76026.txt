TITLE
Single-cell mRNA isoform diversity in the mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single-cell isoform regulation is increasingly being studied. To get a full view of alternative isoform usage, from transcription start site and alternative splicing to transcription termination site, full-length sequences have to be studied. Here we use PacBio long read sequencing technology combined with unique molecular identities to get a full and accurate picture of alternative isoform usage of different stages in maturing oligodendrocyte single cells. We see that the majority of molecules in single-cells are separate isoforms, even after applying a conservative definition of what constitutes an isoform. Few isoforms are common between cells of the same cell-type but the common isoforms are higher expressed. We also see that exon junctions in coding regions are better regulated than exon junctions in non-coding regions and that genes often express more than one coding isoform.
