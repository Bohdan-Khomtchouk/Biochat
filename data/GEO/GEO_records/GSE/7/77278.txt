TITLE
The circular RNA (circRNA)  expression profiles in human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HAVSMCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore the potential involvement of circRNAs in the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, we conducted circRNA profiling in three pairs of proliferative HAVSMCs and quiescent HAVSMCs by microarray. Our results showed that circRNAs were aberrantly expressed in proliferative HAVSMCs compared with quiescent HAVSMCs, and provided potential targets for novel insights into VSMC proliferation or vascular remodeling diseases.

DESIGN
The circRNA expression profiles of three paired proliferative HAVSMCs and quiescent HAVSMCs were analyzed using the microarry platform.
