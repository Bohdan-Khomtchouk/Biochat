TITLE
C3A Cells: Exposure vs Control [two-channel arrays]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles comparing FCCP, CCCP, 6OH-BDE47, Ethylenglycol, TCP, PCP, Aniline, chloroaniline, DMSO in C3A cells

DESIGN
C3A cells were exposed for 2 hours to substances, 6 replicate wells per concentration were pooled. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (QUIAGEN, Product 74104, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). Quality of extracted RNA was checked via the Nanodrop 1000 spectraphotomoeter V3.7, as well as running the samples on a 1.5% agarose gel. cDNA was generated and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5-CTP using the low RNA input linear amplification kit (Perkin-Elmer). Total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using RNasin® Plus RNAse Inhibitor (N2611), M-MLV Reverse transcriptase (RNase H Minus, Point Mutant) (M3682),  5x Buffer (M3682) and random primer  (C1181) from Promega AG (product number in brackets) (Promega AG, Dübendorf, Switzerland). For Microarray analysis Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression Microarrays (8x60K) were used. Each treatment and controls consisted of three biological replicates.
