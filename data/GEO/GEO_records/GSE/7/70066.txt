TITLE
Transcriptome response of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exposed to methylmercury (MeHg)

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
This study aims at investigating the effects of methylmercury on a microalga using a transcriptomic approach. Algal cells were exposed two hours in a simplified artificial medium spiked with 0.05 or 0.5 nM MeHg. Total RNA was extracted using TRI ReagentÂ®. Libraries were prepared with the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 System.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were assessed for each of the 3 tested conditions: Control, 0.05 nM MeHg and 0.5 nM MeHg.
