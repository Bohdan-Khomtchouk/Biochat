TITLE
HEK293T cells treated with a G9a small molecule inhibitor (UNC0638) or vehicle (DMSO), WIZ siRNA, G9a siRNA, or scrambled (control) siRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of HEK293T cells following treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of catalytic activity of the G9a lysine methyltransferase (UNC0638, 1 micromolar, 48 hours), or siRNA against WIZ or G9a (72 hours treatment).

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, UNC0638 vs DMSO, G9a siRNA vs control siRNA, or WIZ siRNA vs control siRNA.  Biological replicates: UNC0638 vs DMSO 5 biological replicates with 2 dye swap experiments; G9a siRNA vs control siRNA, 2 biological replicates; WIZ siRNA vs control siRNA, 2 biological replicates with 2 dye swap experiments.
