TITLE
The effects of IL-10 on the gene expression of LPS-activated activated dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiels in the human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) from 4 different donors (A, B, C, and D) were studied. Cells were left untreated (Group 4), activated with LPS alone (Group 1) or activated in the presence cmv IL-10 (Group 2) or human IL-10 (Group 3) for 12 hours before subjected to RNA extraction. Keywords: IL-10, LPS, dendritic cells
