TITLE
Direct regulation of alternative splicing by SMAD3 through interaction with PCBP1 is essential for the tumor-promoting role of TGF-beta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To assess the global impact of TGF-beta on alternative splicing, we conducted RNA-seq of total RNAs isolated from various lines of HeLa cells that were generated for this study and treated without or with TGF-beta and EGF. Using rMAT tool from the RNA-Seq data and annotation of transcripts in GTF format, we identified differential alternative splicing events between untreated and treated cell lines. Our study shows that the TGF-beta-mediated alternative splicing affects the protein products of a large number of genes enriched in pathways critical for EMT, cykeskeleton organization, and adherens junction signaling.  PCBP1 was required for the most, if not all, alternative splicing events detected.

DESIGN
SRA accession number: SRP061634, BioProject ID PRJNA290799.  RNAs from Hela cells were treated with TGF-Î² and EGF, in triplicates and sequenced on HiSeq2000 with 2 samples pooled into one lane with Illumina TruSeq v3 chemistry.
