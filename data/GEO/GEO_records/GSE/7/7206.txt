TITLE
Gene expression profiling in T-47D breast cancer cells following inducible expression of estrogen receptor beta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-47D breast cancer cells were stably transfected with a tet-off inducible construct encoding estrogen receptor beta. Microarray experiments were carried out at multiple time points 1-30 hours following treatment with estradiol and under induction and non-induction conditions. Keywords: Inducible expression of ERbeta
