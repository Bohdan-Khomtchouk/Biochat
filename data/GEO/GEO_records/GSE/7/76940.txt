TITLE
Compare proB cells from WT, Tp53-/-, Lnk-/-, Tp53-/-Lnk-/- mice and Tp53-/-Lnk-/-B-ALL

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The adaptor protein LNK (SH2B3) has emerged as an important protein in regulating B cell development B cell leukemia. Loss-of-function mutations in LNK (SH2B3) are found in Philadelphia chromosomeâ€“like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL), but how LNK regulates normal B cell development or promotes leukemogenesis remains unclear. We found that combined loss of Lnk and tumor suppressors Tp53 in mice triggers a highly aggressive and transplantable precursor B-ALL. This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism by which LNK regulates B-ALL development. We performed expression profiling of bone marrow proB progenitors from WT, Tp53-/-, Lnk-/- and preleukemic healthy Tp53/Lnk double knockout (DKO) mice, as well as leukemic bone marrow cells from DKO mice that have developed B-ALL. Results suggest that Tp53-/-Lnk-/- B-ALLs display similar gene expression profiles to human Ph-like B-ALLs, suggesting this model for preclinical and molecular studies.

DESIGN
B220+CD19+CD43+AA4.1+IgM-NK1.1-Ly6c- bone marrow proB cells were double sorted from WT, Tp53-/-, Lnk-/- and preleukemic healthy Tp53/Lnk double knockout (DKO) mice, as well as leukemic bone marrow cells from DKO mice that have developed B-ALL.  RNA was isolated using miRNeasy kit from QIAGEN and processed using the NuGEN Pico kit. The microarray analysis was performed at the PENN Molecular Profiling/Genomics Facility using GeneChip Mouse Gene 2.0ST array (Affymetrix).
