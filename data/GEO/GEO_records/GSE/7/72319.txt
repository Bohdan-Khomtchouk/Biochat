TITLE
Gene expression profiling of transmitochondrial cybrids (triple negative breast cancer cells in SUM159 background)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used a transmitochondrial cybrid (cybrids)-based discovery approach to identify mitochondria-regulated cancer pathways in TN BCa. Cybrids were generated under a moderately metastatic TN BCa cell line SUM159 as the common nuclear background with mitochondria from benign breast epithelium (A1N4) and moderately metastatic (SUM159) TN BCa cells. In vitro and in vivo studies suggested that even under the common moderately cancerous nuclear background, mitochondria from benign cells inhibit and metastatic cell induce cancer properties of a moderately aggressive TN BCa cell. Gene expression studies identified c-Src onco-pathway as one of the major cancer pathways altered according to the mitochondria status of the cybrids.

DESIGN
SUM159 œÅ0 cells were used as nuclear donor and A1N4 and SUM 159 cells were used as mitochondrial donor cells. The two groups were profiled for gene expression using microarrays. two group comparison (159/SUM159 vs A1/SUM159)
