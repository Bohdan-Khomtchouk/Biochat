TITLE
C/EBPalpha regulated microRNA expression profiling in inducible K562-C/EBPalpha-ER cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
C/EBPalpha is an important myeloid transcription factor that is inactivated in approximately 50% of acute myeloid leukemia cases. We were interested in microRNAs that are regulated by C/EBPalpha during myeloid differentiation.

DESIGN
We induced K562-C/EBPalpha-ER cells for 6 hours with 5µM ß-estradiol or ethanol as control. NGS was performed out of 3 independent experiments.
