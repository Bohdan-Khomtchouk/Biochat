TITLE
Lung adenocarcinoma distally rewires hepatic circadian homeostasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression was performed in WT and tumor-bearing (TB) mice to determine the effects of a lung tumor on circadian clock of the liver.

DESIGN
Livers from WT and TB (KrasLSL-G12D;p53fl/fl) mice were harvested over the circadian cycle at ZT 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 for gene expression analysis.
