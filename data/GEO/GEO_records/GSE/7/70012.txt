TITLE
RNA-seq profiling of glomeruli, S1 proximal tubule, and the whole kidney of uninephrecomized rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNAs in microdissected glomeruli and S1 proximal tubule segments and the whole remnant kidney of uninephrectomized rats.

DESIGN
Male Sprague-Dawley rats received either right nephrectomy or sham surgery. Rats were sacrificed 24h, 48h, and 72h after surgery. Total RNAs were isolated from microdissected glomeruli, S1 proximal tubules, and the whole left kidney for RNA sequencing.
