Expression data from different karyotypic human embryonic stem cells

SUMMARY
Recent reports indicated that during long term culture HESCs acquired cytogenetic abnormality which are similar to those occurred in tumorigenesis. This raise concerns about the safety use of cultured HESCs. The cause of genetical instability in cultured HESCs is poorly understood and whether these changes will progressively developed and ultimately transform HESCs into malignancy has not been systematically investigated. In our lab, chHES3 was found to have progressive chromosomal changes during long term suboptimal culture. In order to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the karyotypic changes, we compared the expression profile of differnt karyotypic chHES-3 cells and signa pathways involved in the process. We found that the expression profiles of oncogenes, suppress tumor genes and genes related with apoptosis had tendency to EC with complexity and compared with the normal karyotypic HES cells, the activating Wnt pathway gene up-regulated and the suppressing gene down-regulated in the aberrant karyotypic HES cells. The species and abundance of the wnt gene family had obvious difference in difference batch mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder cells. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellular mailignant transformation, identified distinct genes or gene clusters and analysed some signal pathways involved in this process. Keywords: different karyotype
