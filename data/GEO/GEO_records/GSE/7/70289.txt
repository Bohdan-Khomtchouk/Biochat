TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we aimed to explore the role of miR-145, which is downregulated in LSCC, on cancer stem cell potency of laryngeal cancer cells. Using microRNA expression profiling and experimental follow-up studies, we demonstrated the regulatory role of miR-145 in stem cell characteristics of Hep-2 cells. Based on these results, we propose that mir-145 might carry crucial roles in LSCC tumorigenesis, prognosis, metastasis, chemoresistance and recurrence through regulating stem cell properties of tumor cells.

DESIGN
LSCC tissue samples and normal tissues were profiled for microRNA expression; cancer tissue profiles were compared with normal tissue profiles.
