TITLE
IL-6 induced changes in gene expression in activated mouse CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL-6, a proinflammtory cytokine produced by antigen presenting cells and non-hematopoietic cells in response to external stimuli, acts as an important bridge between the innate and adaptive immune responses. IL-6 together with IL-4 can promote Th2 polarization, while in combination with TGFbeta mediates Th17 differentiation. We examined early changes in gene expression in mouse CD4+ T cells induced by IL-6. Keywords: adaptive immune response
