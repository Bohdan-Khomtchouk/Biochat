TITLE
Global miRNA expression is temporally correlated with acute kidney injury in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are negative regulators of gene expression and protein abundance. Current evidence showed implication of miRNAs in acute kidney injury (AKI) that led to obviously increased morbidity and mortality. Herein, we investigated whether miRNAs be initiative regulators showing responsibility for pathological development of AKI.

DESIGN
Alteration in global miRNA expression profile was detected by miRNA microarray technique after renal bilateral ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) surgery at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hour (n = 8 per time point). Additionally, Sham-operated mice was established as controls, which underwent the same surgical procedure without placement of the vascular clamp.
