TITLE
Substitutional Analysis on Influenza PeB Binding

ORGANISM
unidentified influenza virus

SUMMARY
In search for peptides with higher or special binding affinity and for further understanding of the mode of action, a full substitutional analysis of peptide PeB using microarrays was performed. Thus, 152 PeB mutant variants were generated. In each of them, the full-length sequence was preserved except for only one amino acid from the eight loop-forming amino acids of the original PeB peptide (ARDFYDYDVFYYAMD) which was substituted with the 19 remaining natural amino acids. To assess binding, influenza material was labeled with a protein reacting fluorophore.

DESIGN
Microarray-based substitutional analysis of peptide PeB was performed using a PepStar® peptide library spotted on glass slides by JPT Peptide Technologies. The slides were used without additional treatment. For the labeling of proteins with a fluorescent dye, Dyomics DY-634 (λex = 635 nm, λem = 654 nm, Fluoro-spin 634 Kit (emp Biotech) was used, according to the manufacturer´s instructions. The following materials were labeled: NewYork H3N2, Aichi H3N2, Victoria H3N2 and California H1N1. Labeled analytes were incubated several hours or overnight at indicated concentrations using Femtotip buffer (FTP)30 (20 mM Tris, 30% glycerol, 3% polyvinylpyrrolidon 90, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.4) for dilution. The slides were washed twice in FTP and twice in ultrapure water and subsequently dried under a stream of nitrogen. Experiments were performed in triplicates using glycans (2,3'-/2,6'-sialyllactose) and proteins (Anti-H1/Anti-H3 antibodies, fetuin) as positive and negative controls.
