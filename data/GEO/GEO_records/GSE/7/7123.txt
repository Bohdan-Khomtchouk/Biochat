SUMMARY
Time series of gene expression arrays before and during treatment of Hepatitis C; days 0, 1, 2, 7, 14 and 28 for 69 participants (IDs 1 through 69 are used). Treating chronic hepatitis C using peginterferon alpha and ribavirin leads to sustained clearance of virus and clinical improvement in approximately 50% of patients. Response rates are lower among patients with genotype 1 than with genotypes 2 and 3 and among African American ( AA)  compared to Caucasian (CA) patients. Using DNA microarrays, gene expression was assessed in a group of 33 African American and 36 Caucasian American patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1 during the first 28 days of treatment. Results were examined with respect to treatment responses and to race. Patients showed a response to treatment at the gene expression level in RNA isolated from PBMC irrespective of degree of decrease in hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels. However, gene expression responses were relatively blunted in patients with poor viral response ( < 1.5 log10 IU/ml decrease at 28 days) compared to those in patients with a marked ( > 3.5 log10 decrease) or intermediate (1.5 to 3.5 log10 decrease) response. The number of genes that were up- or down-regulated by peginterferon and ribavirin treatment was fewer in patients with a poor response compared to those with an intermediate or marked viral response. However AA patients had a stronger interferon response than CA patients in general.  The induced levels of known ISGs such as OAS, MX1, IRF-7 and the toll like receptor TLR-7 was lower in  poor response patients than in marked or intermediate response patients.  Thus, the relative lack of viral response to interferon therapy of hepatitis C is associated with blunted interferon cell signaling. No specific regulatory gene could be identified as responsible for this global blunting or racial differences. Keywords: time-course study
