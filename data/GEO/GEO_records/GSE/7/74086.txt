TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of undifferentiated and differentiated murine embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wildtype murine embryonic stem cells were kept undifferentiated or treated with retinoic acid for 4 days. We used SABioscience p53 Signaling Pathway Array to quantitate gene expression of genes involved in survival and cell death from the immature and the differently activated cells.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  Undifferentiated and differentiated murine embryonic stem cells (biological triplicates) were treated separately as indicated in the summary. Equal amount total RNA from each sample was used for gene expression analysis.
