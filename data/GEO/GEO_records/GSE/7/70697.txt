TITLE
Cytokine-mediated differentiation reflects genome-wide loss of a uSTAT transcriptional program

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
uSTAT transcriptional program

DESIGN
HPC7 cells were fixed with either 1% formaldehyde for 10 mins. Chromatin was isolated, sonicated for 7 mins (30 sec on, 30 sec off), and specific antibodies were used to pull down the transcription factors of insterest after a pre-clearing step. Chromatin was washed, de-crosslinked, amplified, size selected by gel purification and sequenced.
