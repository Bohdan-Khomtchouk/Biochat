TITLE
Expression data from fully-expanded leaflet of Bambara groundnut (S19-3 genotype)

ORGANISM
Vigna subterranea

SUMMARY
Low temperature stress in a number of African countries, such as Botswana, at night can effect the growth and development of bambara groundnut, leading to losses in potential crop yield. Therefore, we made an attempt to identify and analyze the genes and gene modules associated with low temperature stress response in bambara groundnut using the cross-species microarray technique, as bambara groundnut has no microarray chip, coupled with network-based analysis.

DESIGN
Two plants of the bambara groundnut genotype ‘S19-3’ were grown in controlled environment growth rooms at Sutton Bonington Campus, University of Nottingham under a 12 hour photoperiod and at a constant temperature of 27°C.  Plants were grown in soil columns containing a growing medium of 1 part John Innes 2 compost to 1 part sand, and were watered as required. A single, fully-expanded leaflet was sampled from each of the three plants growing at 27°C, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Plants were given a further 3 days at 27°C to recover from sampling before being moved to a controlled environment room at 23°C. On the fifth day at 23°C a single fully-expanded leaflet was sampled and stored, as described above. After 3 further days plants were moved to 18°C, and then five days later were sampled again.
