TITLE
Expression data of 8 rice accessions under cold stress in seedling stage

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Low temperature is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting rice growth and productivity, it is urgent to reveal the genetic and molecular mechanisms of plant responses to low temperature stress and to search for useful genetic resources for improving low-temperature tolerance. the 8 accessions from China Core Collection include 4 cold tolerance accessions, 3 sensitivity accessions and 1  intermediate type accession. We used microarrays to detail variation of the gene expression after cold treatment and screen more cold-response genes in rice.

DESIGN
In order to getting more understanding of gene expression after cold treatment in rice seedling stage, we applied 8 accessions by cold stress screening in this Affymetrix microarrays, and each accession include 3 time-points samples: (1) before the cold treatment; (2) 6 hours after the cold treatment; (3) 24 hours after the cold treatment.
