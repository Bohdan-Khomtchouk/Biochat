TITLE
DNA methylation profiles of human blood samples from younger Tsimane and Caucasians

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to profile n=46 whole blood samples. The main goal of the study was to measure the epigenetic age (also known as DNA methylation age) of different ethnic groups. Here we focus on subjects younger than 35 years old. Groups include Tsimane Indians and Caucasian samples. To measure DNA methylation age, we used the epigenetic clock software described in Horvath S (n=2013) DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types. Genome Biology.2013, 14:R115. DOI: 10.1186/10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115 PMID: 24138928.

DESIGN
We analyzed whole blood samples from 24 Caucasians and 22 Tsimane Indians.
