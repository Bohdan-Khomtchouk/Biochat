TITLE
Characterization of chromatin accessibility through the DNaseI hypersensitivity assay in breast cancer cells treated with either Dex or E2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and forkhead box protein 1 (FoxA1) are significant factors in breast cancer progression.  FoxA1 is well-established as a pioneer factor for steroid receptor recruitment to chromatin.  Here we show that ER and GR have the ability to alter the genomic response of FoxA1 to specific binding sites within the genome.  These findings alter the classical understood mechanism of FoxA1 establishing a dynamic transcription factor that can be regulated by hormones.

DESIGN
We examined the ER and GR mediated affects on FoxA1 binding patterms
