TITLE
MYOCD overexpression in HCASMs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify novel genes especially lncRNAs linked to vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation, we performed RNA sequencing of adenovirusâ€“MYOCD transduced human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMs).  Simiilar amount of  empty Adenovirus was used as control.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from duplicate HCASMs tranduced with ad-MYOCD or empty control virus and submitted for RNA-Sequencing at the University of Rochester Medical Center Genomics Research Center. Briefly, RNA-Sequencing was done with the polyadenylated RNA component at a depth of 20 million reads per replicate using the Illumina HISeq 2500.
