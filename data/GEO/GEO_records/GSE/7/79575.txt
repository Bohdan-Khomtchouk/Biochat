TITLE
The mutual effect of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus in dual species biofilms as revealed by RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
We examined the differential gene expression of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus epidermidis in dual species biofilms. Therefore, we performed RNA-Seq on single and dual species biofilms and we compared the gene expression levels in dual species biofilms to those in single species biofilms.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from single and dual species biofilms of S. epidermidis ET-024 and S. aureus Mu50, converted to cDNA and RNA-Seq was performed. Three biological replicates were included.
