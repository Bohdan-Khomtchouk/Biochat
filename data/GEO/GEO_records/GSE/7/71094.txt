TITLE
Expression values from 6 time points during the regeneration of secondary vascular System (SVS)

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
Secondary vascular system (SVS) development resulted from cambial growth is a currently not well understood process. Therefore, more studies are needed to shed more lights on the molecular mechanisms underpinning the cambial activity. The regeneration of SVS from debarked trunk that can mimic the vascular cambium-driven wood formation has developed and could be used to revealed a larger number of differentially expressed genes during the stages of cambium formation and xylem differentiation in Populus tomentosa. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in 6 time points during the regeneration of SVS.
