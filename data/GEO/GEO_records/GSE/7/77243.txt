TITLE
Sensory experience restricts cortical plasticity by inducing IGF-1 in VIP neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq libraries purified from the visual cortices of neurons expressing Emx-, GAD2-, PV-, SST-, or VIP-Cre using the Ribotag allele.  Seq libraries are provided from mice raised in standard housing, or housed in the dark for two weeks (dark-housed), or dark-housed and then exposed to light for 1, 3, or 7.5 hours.  These seq libraries represent the genetic response of distinct types of cortical interneurons to altered sensory experience.

DESIGN
To explore how sensory experience affects gene expression, we examined this process in the visual cortex of adult mice that were housed in standard conditions, in complete darkness (i.e. dark-housed), or dark-housed and then exposed to light for increasing amounts of time. We generated mice that were heterozygous for alleles of either Emx-,Gad2-,Sst-,Vip- or Pv-Cre, and were also heterozygous for the Rpl22-HA (RiboTag) allele, which expresses an HA-tagged ribosomal protein specifically in Cre-expressing neurons. We performed RNA-Seq on RNA isolated from the dark-housed/light-exposed RiboTag-mice; Experiments were done in 3 biological replicates and the visual cortices of 3 mice were pooled per sample at each time-point and for each Cre line.
