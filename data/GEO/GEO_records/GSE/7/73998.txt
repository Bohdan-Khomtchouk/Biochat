TITLE
Genome wide expression profile of ada1 and gcn5 deletion strains in Saccharomycescerevisiae

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Ada1, Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex component, was isolated as boundary factor that separated silenced chromatin and euchromatin by previous screening, and Ada1 maintains SAGA complex integrity. SAGA complex is one of a histone modification complex that has multiple functions contributing to transcriptional activation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, silencing is occurred by Sir protein complex, which deacetylates histones and form high-order chromatin structure. Gcn5, SAGA complex component, has histone acetyltransferase activity, which is considered that antagonize to silencing by the screening. Ada1 and Gcn5 might have different functions in SAGA complex, we performed microarray analysis to find different functions of gene regulations by using ada1Δ and gcn5Δ strains. As the results, Ada1-regulated genes include more than halves of Gcn5-regelated genes, which occupied only a part of Ada1 regulated genes. These suggest that the differences of contribution to SAGA functions. When SAGA complex have a loss of Ada1, almost function was lost. On the other hand, Gcn5 play a role only as acetyltransferase in SAGA complex.
