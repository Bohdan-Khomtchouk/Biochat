TITLE
miRNA profiling during fracture repair

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further understand the molecular complexity of fracture repair, we investigated miRNA profiling during the first 14 days post fracture.

DESIGN
miRNA expression was investigated at post-fracture days 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 14 as well as in intact (unfractured bone).
