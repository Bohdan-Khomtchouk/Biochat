TITLE
ChIP-seq of histone methylation marks in YB5 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq of H3K4me2, H3K9me2, and H3K27me3 was performed in YB5 cells to determine the impact of baseline histone methylation patterns on gene reactivation by epigenetic therapy

DESIGN
Biological duplicates were performed for a total of 8 samples. For peak calling, duplicates were merged and MACS2 (H3K4me2) or SICER (H3K9me2 or H3K27me3) was used to determine significant peaks compared to Input
