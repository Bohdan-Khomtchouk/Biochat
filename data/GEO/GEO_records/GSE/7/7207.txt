TITLE
Preclinical CNS changes following peripheral murine RML prion challenge

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mice were challenged with either RML prions or mock brain homogenate intraperitoneally.  Whole brains were harvested and processed at 145 days post-inoculation, with mice reaching terminal stages of disease in this model at approximately 200 days post-inoculation.
