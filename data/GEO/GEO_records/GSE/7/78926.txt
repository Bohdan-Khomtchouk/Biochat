TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A proportion of superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, a type of less invasive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), would have metastasis after esophagectomy or endoscopic resection with poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to discover the whole-genome copy number alteration (CNA) profiles of superficial ESCC and compare the CNAs of superficial ESCC patients with and without metastasis after surgery. Thirty eight superficial ESCC cases, including 19 cases with metastasis and 19 cases without metastasis within 5 years after surgery, were analyzed CNAs by Affymetrix OncoScanâ„¢ FFPE Assay. A 39-gene signature was initially constructed to identify high risk of metastasis in superficial ESCC patients. In addition, amplification of 11q13.3 (FGF4) and deletion of 9p21.3 (CDKN2A) were identified as recurrent CNAs across all 38 superficial ESCC cases. And amplifications of 3p26.33 (SOX2-OT), 8q24.21 (MYC), 14q21.1 (FOXA1) and deletion of 3p12.1 (GBE1) were identified as recurrent CNAs among metastasis cases only. Our study provided a 39-gene signature tool to identified high risk metastasis in superficial ESCC and suggested that amplifications of SOX2-OT, MYC, FOXA1 genes and deletion of GBE1 gene might play a vital role in metastasis among superficial ESCC.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix FFPE Oncoscan Array was performed for 38 superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (pT1N0M0) samples, including 19 cases with metastasis after surgery within 5 years after surgery and 19 cases without metastasis.
