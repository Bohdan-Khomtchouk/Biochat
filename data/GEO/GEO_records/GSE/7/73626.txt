TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation study of hip and knee osteoarthritic and healthy cartilage reveals embryonic organ and skeletal system morphogenesis as major pathways involved in osteoarthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cartilage samples were collected from hip or knee joint replacement patients either due to primary OA or hip fractures as controls. DNA was extracted from the collected cartilage and assayed by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 ‎BeadChip array, which allows for the analysis of > 480,000 CpG sites.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from 5 hip osteoarthritic, 6 knee osteoarthritic and 7 hip healhty cartilage samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 ‎BeadChip array
