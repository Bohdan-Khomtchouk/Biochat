TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of Gluconobacter oxydans with different PQQ production

ORGANISM
Gluconobacter oxydans

SUMMARY
We reported that analysis of PQQ metabolism in Gluconobacter oxydasns strain at gene expression level. Acoording to present study that pqqB gene can strengthen the transport of PQQ. Wild type strain and pqqB-overexpression strain were compared to find other candidate key genes which can encoded proteins are involved in PQQ transport. Results provide important information of the response of pqqB-overexpression, such as genes encoded membrane proteins and other indirectly functional genes.

DESIGN
The mRNA of wild type (WT) and pqqB-overexpression mutant (TB) strains, collected at exponential growth phase, were generated by deep sequencingusing Illumina Miseq.
