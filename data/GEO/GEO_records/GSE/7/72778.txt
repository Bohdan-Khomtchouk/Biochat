TITLE
DNA methylation data from brain samples of human subjects with Huntington's disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to profile n=475 samples from various brain regions of subjects with Huntington's disease and control samples. The main goal of the study was to relate Huntington's disease status to measures of epigenetic age acceleration based on DNA methylation data. To measure DNA methylation age, we used the epigenetic clock software described in Horvath S (n=2013) DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types. Genome Biology.2013, 14:R115. DOI: 10.1186/10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115 PMID: 24138928.

DESIGN
We analyzed n=475 samples (215 Huntington's disease, 125 Alzheimer's disease, and 135 control samples). The samples represent various brain regions (frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, caudate nucleus, cingulate gyrus, cerebellum, hippocampus, etc) from 65 human subjects.
