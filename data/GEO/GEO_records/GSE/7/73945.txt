TITLE
Expression data from human dendritci cells that are transfected with piNC or td-piR(Glu)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression in dendritic cells  transfected with piNC or td-piR(Glu)

DESIGN
Human DCs transfected with piNC or td-piR(Glu) were for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
