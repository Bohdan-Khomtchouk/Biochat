TITLE
Map of DnaC localization in the presence or absence of PcrA (PcrA depletion)

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. JH642

SUMMARY
The replicative helicase, DnaC, was immunoprecipitated in cell extract prior to, or following conditional depletion of PcrA

DESIGN
The differential DnaC association at each genomic location was determined before/after PcrA depletion
