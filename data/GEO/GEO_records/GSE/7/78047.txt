TITLE
Expression data from human fetal cardiac MSCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The instrinsic regenerative capacity of human fetal cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) has not been fully characterised. Here we demonstrate that we can expand cells with characteristics of cardiovascular progenitor cells from the MSC population of human fetal hearts with only minor fluctuations over time in culture (from day 15 to day 48). We used microarray to compare the gene-expression profile of cultured human fetal cardiac MSCs over time (from day 15 to day 48).

DESIGN
MSCs from human fetal hearts were cultured on GelTrex in a defined medium stimulating the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Samples from three different time points (day 15, 27 and 48) were compared on microarray.
