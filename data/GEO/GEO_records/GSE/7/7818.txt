Specific inhibition of p300-HAT alters Global Gene Expression and Repress HIV replication

SUMMARY
Reversible acetylation of histone and nonhistone proteins plays pivotal role in cellular homeostasis. Dysfunction of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) leads to several diseases including cancer, neurodegenaration, asthma, diabetes, AIDS and cardiac hypertrophy. We describe the synthesis and characterization of a set of p300-HAT specific small molecule inhibitors from a natural nonspecific HAT inhibitor, garcinol, which is highly toxic to cells. We show that the specific inhibitor selectively represses the p300-mediated acetylation of p53 in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of p300-HAT down regulates several genes but significantly a few important genes are also upregulated. Remarkably, these inhibitors were found to be nontoxic to T cells, inhibit histone acetylation of HIV infected cells and consequently inhibit the multiplication of HIV. Keywords: Response to Inhibition of p300-HAT
