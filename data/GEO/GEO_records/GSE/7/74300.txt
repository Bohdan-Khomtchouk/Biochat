TITLE
Gene expression profile in the reicprocal F1 hybrids of two jewel wasp species Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Nasonia vitripennis x Nasonia giraulti

SUMMARY
We quantified genome-wide total and allele-specific expression in two non-social parasitoids wasp species Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti and their reciprocal F1 hybrids. No parent-of-origin effect in allelic expression was found for > 8,000 informative genes, suggesting lack of genomic imprinting in adult Nasonia. Gene expression divergence between Nv and Ng could be attributed to both significant cis- and trans- regulatory changes during evolution.

DESIGN
Profiling of expression levels in reciprocal F1 adults of Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti using Illumina mRNA-seq
