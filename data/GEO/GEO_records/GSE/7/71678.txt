TITLE
DNA methylation anaylsis of placenta samples exposed to variable levels of arsenic during pregnancy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide profiling of placental DNA methylation in relation to arsenic exposure. The Illumina 450k methylation array was used to profile 343 samples for which 3 different measurements of arsenic exposure were available during gestation. These samples have been collected from the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS).

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA was hybridized to the 450k platform and processed at the University of Minnesota Genomic Core
