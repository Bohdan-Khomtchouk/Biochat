TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of peritoneal macrophages Transcriptomes of Dnmt3a macrophage conditional knockout mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose:The purpose of this study is to measure the gene expression profile in Dnmt3a conditional knockout macrophages. Methods:Dnmt3a conditional knockout macrophages mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing,using Illumina. Results: We mapped about 20 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome, identified hundreds of genes with significant mRNA variation during Dnmt3a conditional knockout in macrophages.

DESIGN
Dnmt3a conditional knockout mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing
