TITLE
EIN2 mediates histone H3K14 and non-canonical histone H3K23 acetylation in the nucleus in ethylene response [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report that ethylene specifically elevated acetylation of histone H3 at K14 and the non-canonical acetylation of histone H3 at K23. We perform Chip-sequencing of H3K14Ac, H3K23Ac and H3K9Ac using chromatins isolated from 3-day old etiolated Col-0 seedlings treated with ethylene or air gas. Results show that ethylene specifically elevates H3K14Ac and non-canonical H3K23Ac in EIN3 targeted genes that are regulated at the transcriptional level by ethylene.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different histone modifications in 2 Arabidopsis lines which under 2 different treatment.
