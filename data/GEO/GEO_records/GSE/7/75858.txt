TITLE
Frontal Cortex Transcriptome Analysis of Mice Exposed to Electronic Cigarettes During Early Life Stages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our study demonstrated that e-cigarettes, both with and without nicotine, induced sex-dependent gene expression change. This RNA-seq study examined the expression profiles of brain frontal cortex samples from mice exposed to classic tobacco flavored bluâ„¢ e-cigarettes during gestation and lactation.

DESIGN
Brains were extracted and sectioned from ~1-month-old male and female offspring the week following exposure, RNA was isolated and purified from frontal cotrex tissues, and gene expression profiles were analyzed by RNA Sequencing.
