TITLE
RNA sequencing of siSNRNP40 in breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify gene expression profile changes upon SNRNP40 depletion, RNA-sequencing was performed on breast cancer cells transfected with siRNAs targeting SNRNP40.

DESIGN
Libraries were generated using ScriptSeq v2 RNA-seq Library Preparation Kit (Epicentre) and run on Illumina HiSeq 2500.
