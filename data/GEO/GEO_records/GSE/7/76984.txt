TITLE
ATAC-seq of Chd7 WT and mutant cerebellar granule neuron progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed ATAC-seq to profile the open chromatin lanscape in primary Chd7 WT and mutant GNPs. By analyzing the differentiate peaks between WT and mutant, we identified Chd7-dependent maintance of open chromatin at many neuronal genes.

DESIGN
ATAC-seq of Chd7 WT and mutant GNPs
