TITLE
The BTH-incuced WRKY62-dependent genes

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
WRKY62 is a transcriptional repressor regulated downstream of WRKY45, a central TF of the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway for defense response in rice. To characteraze SA signaling induced genes whose expressions were regulated by WRKY62, we analized genome-wide epression profiles in WRKY62-kd and NB rice using benzothiadiazole (BTH), SA singaling activator.

DESIGN
Nipponbare rice (Oryza sativa) and WRKY62-kd rice were treated with or without 30 ÂµM of BTH and analyzed after incubation for 0, 12 and 24h.
