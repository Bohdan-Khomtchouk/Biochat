TITLE
Development of gene expression in inflammatory bowel disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To further development of gene expression in inflammatory bowel disease(IBD), we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish IBD patients and healthy volunteers. Colon biopsies were obtained from IBD patients and healthy volunteers during endoscopy. There were 353 genes that showed greater than 4-fold differential expression (285 upregulated and 68 downregulated) between IBD patients and healthy volunteers.

DESIGN
Colon biopsies were obtained from 3 CD and age- ,sex- mathed healthy controlspatients and 3 healthy volunteers during endoscopy.
