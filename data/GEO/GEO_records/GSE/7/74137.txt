TITLE
Expression data from ectopic RUNX2 over-expression in Ca9-22 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the transcription targets of RUNX2 in OSCC cells, we preformed the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array with ectopic RUNX2 or empty vectors in Ca9-22 cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected from empty vector or RUNX2 expression Ca9-22 cells.
