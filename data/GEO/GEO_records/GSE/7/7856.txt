TITLE
Comparison between Backfat Tissue of Fat Type Pig and Lean Type Pig, among developmental phases

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify key genes associated with porcine muscle growth and adipose metabolism which different expression in porcine backfat tissue between Fat Type Pig(Taihu pig) and Lean Type Pig (Landrace), among developmental phases(Month 1,2,3,4,5). The gene expression analyses will increase understanding of impact factors of pork quality by identifying key genes and pathways controlling backfat development. Relative real-time RT-PCR was used to confirm differential expression of 3 different expression genes(ME,SCD and UCP3) which normalized by 3 housekeep genes(ACTB, TBP and TOP2B). Keywords: time course and breed comparison
