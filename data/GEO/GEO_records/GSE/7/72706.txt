TITLE
Transcriptome-wide high-throughput deep m6A-seq reveals unique m6A methylation differential patterns among three organs in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
m6A is a ubiquitous RNA modification in eukaryotes. Transcriptome-wide m6A patterns in Arabidopsis have been assayed recently. However, m6A differential patterns among organs have not been well characterized.  The goal of the study is to comprehensively analyze m6A patterns of numerous types of RNAs, the relationship between transcript level and m6A methylation extent, and m6A differential patterns among organs in Arabidopsis.

DESIGN
In total, 18 libraries were sequneced. For the 3 organs: leaf, flower and root, each organ has mRNA-Seq, m6A-Seq and Input sequenced. And each sequence has 2 replicats.
