TITLE
Expression data from biopsies of CIT study patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aimed to investigate the effect of increased cold ischemia time (CIT) on gene expression profiles of implantation and clinically indicated biopsies early after transplantation and the impact of basiliximab (BAS) versus rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) induction therapies on clinical outcomes and intragraft molecular features

DESIGN
A retrospective, single-centered cohort study was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of rATG versus BAS for induction in patients who received a renal transplantation from a deceased donor between January 2007 and December 2012. Recipients with CIT greater than 20 hours were included in this study. Patients were excluded if they had received a prior transplantation or dual organ transplantation. Patients were followed for 12 months post-transplantation or until patient death, graft lost or lost to follow up. Patients in the rATG group received 1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight given intravenously with the initial dose given intraoperatively. Subsequent doses were given daily through post-operative day 3, for a total dose of 4.5-6.0 mg per kilogram.  Dosing was adjusted based on daily white blood cell and platelet counts. BAS (20 mg given intravenously) was administered intraoperatively and the subsequent dose on day 3 post-transplantation. All patients received maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus, prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil. In total. 230 patients were transplanted with a CIT > 20 hours; 174 and 56 patients received rATG and BAS induction, respectively. Gene expression profiling ws carried out on a subset (n=28) of these patients' post transplant biopsies. Of those 28 patients, 16 received rATG and 12 received BAS induction treatment.
