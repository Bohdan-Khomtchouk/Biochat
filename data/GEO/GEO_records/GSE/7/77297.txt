TITLE
The effects of a phage protein gp70.1 on Pseudomonas aerugonosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
The phage protein gp70.1 encoded by Pseudomonas aerugonosa phage PaP3 was toxic to both P. aerugonosa and E. coli, microarry analysis was used to investigate the effects of gp70.1 on P. aerugonosa with three periods of bacterial growth.

DESIGN
Samples were taken from the PA3/pUCP24 (control) and PA3/pUCP24-orf70.1 lysates at lag, logarithmic and stable phase. Three independent experiments were performed at each time point.
