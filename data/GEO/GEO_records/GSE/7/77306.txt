TITLE
Gene expression profiles of B cells under various conditions

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To validate the functions that iron might play in B cell proliferation and function we used deferoxamine (DFO, a widely used iron chelator) to create an iron-deficient environment for cell culture in vitro.

DESIGN
We measured B cell proliferative responses to mitogenic stimuli under several conditions, primary splenic B cells cultured in normal medium, or in the presence of  DFO (deferoxamine, 20uM) ,or DFO accompanied with an additional supplement of FAC (Ferric ammonium citrate, 100uM) or FAC(100uM) alone in the medium, unstimulated or stimulated anti-IgM(10ug/ml) or LPS (2ug/ml) for 48h.
