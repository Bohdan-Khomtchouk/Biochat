TITLE
Abscisic acid effect on wild type and the abh1 mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Analysis of the abh1 mutant Arabidopsis plants following treatment with 50 uM abscisic acid (ABA). ABH1 encodes the large (80kDa) subunit of the nuclear mRNA cap binding complex and affects early ABA signal transduction events (Hugouvieux et al., 2001, Cell 106, 477). Keywords: stress response
