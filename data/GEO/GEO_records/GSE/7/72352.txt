TITLE
Influence of LKB1 on contraction-induced gene expression in skeletal muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Assessment of gene expression after muscle contraction with the hypothesis that the lack of LKB1 will alter gene expression, especially inflammation-related genes.

DESIGN
RNA was obtained from the gastrocnemius/plantaris/soleus complex from wild-type and skeletal muscle specific LKB1 knockout mice at rest or immediately after 15 minutes of in situ muscle contraction via sciatic nerve stimulation. 7 samples per group.
