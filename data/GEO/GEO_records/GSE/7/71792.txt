TITLE
Characterization of the gene expression profile of porcine iPS-like cells derived by two reprogramming techniques from translocated t(Y;14) fibroblasts

Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
In the present study we compare the effect of integrative and non-integrative strategies on pluripotency during pig somatic cells reprogramming to pluripotency. Microarray analysis was used to compare the gene expression profile of non reprogrammed porcine embryonic fibroblasts (PEF) and of iPS-like cells obtained by cell reprogramming of control amniocytes (PB20) or fibroblasts from animals carrying a t(Y;14) translocation (I, NI). We investigate the impact of different reprogramming techniques by using a first integrative method based on viral infection (PB20, I) and a second non-integrative method based on the use of Sendaï viruses (NI). Moreover, we analyzed the changes in gene expression profile upon embryoïd formation in the NI-iPS-like cells (EB).

DESIGN
We cultured one cell line of porcine embryonic fibroblast, one cell line of iPS-like cells derived from normal amniocytes (PB20), 2 cell lines derived from t(Y;14) fibroblast by the integrative technique (I3 and I4) both at early (ep) and late passages (lp), and three cell lines derived from t(Y;14) fibroblasts by the non-integrative method (NI12, NI13 and NI20). Embryoïd bodies from NI cell lines were obtained by 10 days of floating culture in a specific medium under low agitation (EB12, EB13 and EB20). Total RNA from cell pellets of each sample was extracted in triplicate using the Nucleospin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) and checked for quantity and quality. After the microarrays experimentation, quality control and normalization, 34 over 36 samples were conserved (represented here).
