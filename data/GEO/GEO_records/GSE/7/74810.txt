TITLE
Genomic Targets and Features of BarA-UvrY (-SirA) Signal Transduction Systems

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Using ChIP-exo, we have identified at single nucleotide resolution genomic binding sites for UvrY in E. coli and its homolog SirA in S. Typhimurium.

DESIGN
Two samples: (1) Genomic binding sites of UvrY (E. coli) (2) genomic binding sites of SirA (S. Typhimurium) were analyzed
