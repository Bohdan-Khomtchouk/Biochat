TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Caki2 cells re-expressing Polybromo-1 (PBRM1)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PBRM1 is a component of the PBAF chromatin remodelling complex and has been observed to be deregulated in a significant proportion of patients with clear-cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC). This study employs RNA-Seq to identify differentially expressed genes in cellular models of ccRCC by expressing PBRM1 in PBRM1-deficient Caki2 cells.

DESIGN
Using lentiviral mediated mechanism, stable Caki-2 cell line expressing PBRM1 was developed (Caki2-PBRM1). Empty vector inserted in Caki2 cells served as control (Caki2-Ã˜)
