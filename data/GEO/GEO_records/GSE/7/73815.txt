TITLE
Analysis of TCERG1 depletion by exon arrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TCERG1 is a highly conserved human protein implicated in interactions with the transcriptional and splicing machinery. To investigate TCERG1 function, we survey genome-wide changes in transcript and exon levels upon TCERG1 knockdown in HEK293T cells. Our data revealed that TCERG1 regulates different types of alternative spliced events, indicating a broad role in the regulation of alternative splicing.

DESIGN
Eight samples were analyzed, comprising two conditions, siEGFP (EG) and siTCERG1 (CA). Four independent experiments were carried out for each condition.
