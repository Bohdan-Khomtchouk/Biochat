TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing profile of leukemia from distinct cells-of-origin [Transcriptome profiles]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify genomic signatures predicitve of cell-of-origin in acute myeloid leukemia 50K bulk leukemia (GFP+) cells from the spleen of recipient mice were sorted directly into 350μl of RLT buffer (Qiagen) and flash-frozen.  Total RNA was isolated according to manufacturer’s protocols (Qiagen) including DNase treatment, and quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Nano kit. Amplified cDNA was sheared to approximately 300bp using a Covaris E220 Focused Ultrasonicator. RNA-seq library preparation used the TruSeq DNA sample prep kit v2 (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiles of purified cell populations of hematopoetic stem and progenitor cells to identify transcriptomic singatures associated with leukemia cell-of-origin
