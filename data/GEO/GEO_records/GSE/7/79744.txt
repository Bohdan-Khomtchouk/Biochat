Expression data 550cGy vs 0cGy KSL

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Precise study of HSCs during regeneration has been impeded by the rarity of the HSC population and depletion of phenotypic HSCs early following genotoxic stresses, such as total body irradiation (TBI).  We isolated bone marrow (BM) ckit+sca-1+lin- (KSL) cells, which are enriched for HSCs, from adult C57Bl6 mice before and at several time points following TBI, as a means to map the dynamic molecular response of HSC regeneration.

DESIGN
We isolated BM KSL cells and myeloid progenitor cells (c-kit+sca-1-lin- cells) at day +14 after irradiation and compared the gene expression profile of regenerating HSCs versus steady state HSCs (non-irradiated) and committed progenitor cells.
