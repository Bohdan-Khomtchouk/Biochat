TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of TIAR RNA ligands in mouse macrophages before and after LPS stimulation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TIA-1 related protein (TIAR) is a RNA-binding protein involved in several steps of gene expression such RNA splicing and translation. TIAR contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) allowing its interaction with specific sequences localized in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of several mRNAs.  In myeloid cells, TIAR has been shown to bind and regulate the translation and stability of various mRNAs encoding proteins important for the inflammatory response, such as TNFα, Cox-2  or IL-8 . Here, we generated two macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cell lines expressing either a tagged full-length TIAR protein or a RRM2-truncated mutant unable to bind RNA with high affinity . By a combination of RNA-IP and microarray analysis (RIP-chip), we identified mRNAs specifically bound by the full-length protein both in basal conditions and in response to LPS.

DESIGN
Microarray hybridization was performed on TIAR-FLAG-associated mRNAs or TIARΔRRM2-FLAG-associated mRNAs in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Enrichment of TIAR-FLAG-associated mRNAs and TIARΔRRM2-FLAG-associated mRNAS were normalized to total transcriptome of TIAR-FLAG and TIARΔRRM2-FLAG expressing-RAW264.7 cells respectively. After amplification and labelling, sample pairs were hybridized onto Mouse Exonic Evidence Based Oligonucleotide (MEEBO) arrays containing on average 38784 mouse 70mer oligonucleotide probes (Stanford University, US). Hybridizations were replicated with dye swap.
