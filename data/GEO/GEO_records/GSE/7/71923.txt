TITLE
miR-203 and miR-205 expression patterns identify subgroups of prognosis in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of the expression pattern of miRNAs at different stages of skin cancer progression in a panel of murine skin cancer cell lines miR-203 and miR-205 were differentially expressed in this panel, and were evaluated as biomarkers of prognosis in human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
