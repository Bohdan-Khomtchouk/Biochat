TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression in Marfan Syndrome smooth muscle cells (MFS-SMCs) in comparison to that in mutation corrected (mcMFS-SMCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression comparison between MFS- and mcMFS-SMCs

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from MFS- and mcMFS-SMCs, differentiated from equivalent induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs)
