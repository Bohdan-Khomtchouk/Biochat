TITLE
Testicular toxicity induced by carbendazim, iprodione, alone or in combination

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Using an ex-vivo testicular culture from rats, we carried out transcriptomic experiments to identify the pathway of toxicity ellicited by the fungicides carbendazim, iprodione alone or in combination. we used commercial Agilent Microarray GE 4x44K  Rat (V3) Gene Expression Microarray (G2514F) AMADID : 028282

DESIGN
Cultures were performed with and without fungicides. When required, CBZ, IPR or mixture was added beginning from day 2, at 50 nM or 500 nM for CBZ and at 50 nM or 500 nM for IPR; 50 nM each or 500 nM each for the mixture. For microarray experiments, three different pools of seminiferous tubules were exposed to two concentrations of CBZ, IPR or their mixture (50 nM and 500 nM) or to complete medium with vehicle (control cells) for 7, 14, and 21 days. Each condition of exposure to fungicides was compared with control cells at the same time point.
