TITLE
A high fat, ketogenic diet induces a unique metabolic state in mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of liver gene transcription during feeding of a ketogenic diet.  Ketogenic diets may alter physiologic and metabolic profiles in a direction that favors weight loss. C57BL/6J mice were maintained for six weeks on either chow or ketogenic diet. Mice eating KD had lower weights, 90% reduction in insulin levels and increased energy expenditure compared to animals fed chow. Despite consumpiton of a very high fat diet serum lipids remained normal.  Here we show that consumption of KD shifted liver metabolism to drastically increased fatty acid oxidation. Concurrently, expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis were markedly suppressed. Keywords: Hepatic profile
