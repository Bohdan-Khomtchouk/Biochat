TITLE
Evaluation of murine mast cells derived exosomal RNA versus their parental cells MC/9.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Exosomes are vesicles of endocytic origin released by many types of cells into the extracellular environment. In an attempt to further examine the exosome-mediated cellular communication, we show that exosomes from a mouse mast cell line (MC/9), exosomes from primary bone marrow derived mast cells, and exosomes from a human mast cell line (HMC-1) contain RNA but not DNA. Microarray assessments of exosome-derived RNA revealed that these vesicles contain mRNA from approximately 1200 genes, many of which are unique and not present in the cytoplasmic RNA pool in the donor cell. Keywords: Exosomal RNA versus their parental cells, MC/9
