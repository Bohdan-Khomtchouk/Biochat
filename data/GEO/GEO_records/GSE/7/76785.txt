Effect of anti-IL-15 administration on T cell and NK cell homeostasis in rhesus macaques (TCM)

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody treatment on T cell and NK cell homeostasis in rhesus macaques. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that repeated administrations of a rhesusized anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody would block IL-15 activity in vivo and result in changes to T and/or NK cell population dynamics that would reflect physiologic IL-15 function. The results provide important information on the specific role IL-15 plays in effector memory T cell and NK cell homeostasis, noting that effector memory T cells but not NK cells can be maintained in the absence of IL-15 signaling by the activity of other cytokines.
