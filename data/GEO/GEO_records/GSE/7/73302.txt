TITLE
A549 Gene Expression Following Treatment with a No-Observed-Effect Level of Cisplatin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the gene expression of A549 cells following 24 and 48 hours of treatment with a no-observed-effect level dose of cisplatin. The objective of the study is to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to sub-lethal doses of cisplatin. This study helps identify not only treatment responses but also changes in gene expression that may confer cytoprotective mechanisms that allow these cells to survive treatment and to develop treatment resistance.

DESIGN
A total of 12 samples were analyzed with two time points (24 and 48h treatments) and three replicates per condition (treated vs. untreated).
