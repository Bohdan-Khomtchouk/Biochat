TITLE
Comparison of globin RNA processing methods for genome-wide transcriptome analysis from whole-blood

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole blood rather than purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells is likely to become the prime tissue using expression microarrays for disease predication or prognosis however excess of globin mRNA may reduce probe detection sensitivity. In our study, we assessed whether whole-blood or globin-reduced RNA gives the most robust and sensitive results to detect small gene expression changes in response to hormone replacement therapy exposure. Each sample (N = 12) were hybridized according to 3 different protocols: no globin reduction (controls), globin reduction using peptid nucleic acids (PNA) and using magnetic beads in the GlobinClear kit from Ambion. Finally, 7 and 4 technical replicates were conducted in no globin reduction and PNA groups, respectively. Both globin reduction approaches were mostly efficient at reducing globin RNA from cRNA. Samples processed by GlobinClear kit gave a very distinct gene expression profiles from the controls while samples processed with PNA gave an intermediary profile closest to the non globin reduction group with a slight increased sensitivity of transcript detection but a loss of reproducibility. Overall, no sign of higher sensitivity in detection of gene expression changes followed by hormone exposure was observed after globin reduction which was therefore judged not beneficial.
