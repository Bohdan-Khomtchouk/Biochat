TITLE
Profiling of N6-Adenosine (m6A) Methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and fip37-4 LEC1:FIP37

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) represents the most prevalent internal modification on messenger RNA, and requires a multicomponent m6A methyltransferase complex in mammals. How their plant counterparts determine the global m6A modification landscape and its molecular link to plant development remain elusive. Here we show that FKBP12 INTERACTING PROTEIN 37 KD (FIP37) is a core component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, which underlies control of shoot stem cell fate in Arabidopsis. The mutants lacking FIP37 exhibit massive overproliferation of shoot meristems and a transcriptome-wide loss of m6A RNA modifications. We further demonstrate that FIP37 mediates m6A RNA modification on key shoot meristem genes inversely correlated with their mRNA stability, thus confining their transcript levels to prevent shoot meristem overproliferation. Our results suggest an indispensable role of FIP37 in mediating m6A mRNA modification, which is required for maintaining the shoot meristem as a renewable source for continuously producing all aerial organs in plants.
