ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out on peripheral blood CD14+ leukocytes from 21 stressed caregivers and controls (all adult).  The primary research question is whether gene expression differs in individuals from high stress vs low stress environments. Keywords: Risk prediction
