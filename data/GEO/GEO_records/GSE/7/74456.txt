TITLE
PAPTRAP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the mRNAs bound to ribosomes in peripheral astrocyte processes, thus suggesting local translation in astrocytes.

DESIGN
Isolation of a synaptoneurosome fraction from mouse cortex in which Astrocyte ribosomes were labeled with eGFP. Immunoprecipitation of GFP from this fraction to obtain astrocyte ribosomes away from the cell body. Performed RNA seq on these purified ribosomes and their bound mRNAs.
