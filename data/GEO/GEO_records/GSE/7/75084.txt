TITLE
Expression data from CD34+ HSPCs from patients with Multiple Myeloma before and after lenaldomide consolidation therapy.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about the effects of lenalidomide therapy on Bone Marrow HSPCs in patients with Multiple Myeloma. In this experiment, we examined the gene expression changes associated with a six months lenalidomide consolidation therapy in patients who underwent induction therapy and HDCT with ASCT and who all achieved a remission.

DESIGN
Paired Bone Marrow samples from patients with Multiple Myeloma before and after lenalidomide consolidation therapy.
