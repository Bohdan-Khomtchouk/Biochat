TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of nucleus accumbens gene expression after ethanol consumption in ratÂ 

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The study investigated ethanol-induced alterations in the transcriptome of adult male Wistar rats. The study was divided into two parts. Part 1: 10 animals were single housed during 8 weeks and exposed to 6% ethanol solution and water simultaneously or just water (24 hours/day, 7 days/week). Fluid intake and body weight were recorded twice weekly during 8 weeks. Animals were sacrificed immediately after the last consumption measurement and the nucleus accumbens were dissected and snap frozen until further processing. Part 2: 12 rats were single housed and exposed to continuous access to ethanol and water (24 hours/day, 7 days/week). After 4 weeks, animals were divided into 2 groups, equally balanced based on previous ethanol intake, and were given additional ethanol or water through a gavage tube daily during 3 weeks. This was followed by an additional 2 weeks of continuous ethanol access and then animals were immediately sacrificed and the nucleus accumbens were dissected and snap frozen until further processing. Next, the RNA was extracted from the cells using Qiagen RNeasy Lipid tissue mini kit and the RNA concentration and quality was measured using a BioAnalyzer. RNAseq was performed using standard Illumina protocols in collaboration with SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden. No difference in gene expression was detected between any groups.

DESIGN
Five samples from water consuming controls (experiment-1_water) and five from voluntary ethanol consuming (experiment-1_ethanol) rats. Six samples from ethanol consuming rats that received excessive amounts of water (experiment-2_water-gavage) or ethanol (experiment-2_ethanol-gavage) trough a gavage tube.
