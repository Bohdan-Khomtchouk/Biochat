TITLE
Screening of differentially expressed genes after IMB5046 treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effects of IMB5046 treatment on cells, we used the gene expression microarray to compare the  difference between the IMB5046-treated cells and control cells.  A431 cells were treated with 100 nM IMB5046 or 0.1% DMSO (vehicle) for 24 hr. A total of 441 genes were down-regulated and 383 genes were up-regulated by at least 2-fold between IMB5046-treated and control cells.The most obviuos changes in Gene Ontology biolocial process classification were related to cell death and immune response.

DESIGN
A431 cells were treated with 100 nM IMB5046 or (0.1% DMSO) vehicle for 24 h. Then, total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent and analyzed.
