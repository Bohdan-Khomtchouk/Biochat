TITLE
MBNL1-dependent modulation of transcript stability

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify MBNL1-dependent changes in MBNL1 target transcript stability, MBNL1 levels in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were stably knocked-down using short-hairpin RNAs. The cells were then treated with alpha-amanitin to inhibit transcription, RNA was isolated at 0 and 9 hours post-alpha-amanitin treatment, and the samples were transcriptomically profiled.

DESIGN
shRNAs targeting either MBNL1 or a control shRNA were stably expressed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. These cells were treated with 10ug/mL alpha-amanitin to inhibit transcription, and total RNA was isolated at 0 and 9 hours post-alpha-amanitin treatment.
