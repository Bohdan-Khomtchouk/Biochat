Normal and Renal Cell Carcinoma Kidney Tissue, Human

SUMMARY
Each total RNA sample is hybridized to two different arrays:  Affymetrix U133A (GPL96) and U133B (GPL97). For most of the normal tissue samples there is a renal clear cell carcinoma sample from the same patient.  There is no matching tumor sample for normal sample N1. For most of the renal clear cell carcinoma samples there is a corresponding adjacent normal tissue sample from the same patient.  There are no matching normal tissue samples for C011 or C032.
