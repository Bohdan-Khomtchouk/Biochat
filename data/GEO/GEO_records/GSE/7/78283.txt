TITLE
Expression data of HDAC3-deficient and sufficient medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Medullary thymic epithelial cells play essential role for induction of central self-tolerance by facilitating negative selection of self-reactive thymocytes and the generation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Although studies highlighted the non-canonical NFÎºB pathway as the key regulator of mTEC development, comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathways regulating this process still remains incomplete. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which is highly expressed by mTECs, on mTEC development and function.  We used Affymetrix mouse 1ST arrays to analyze the impact of the Hdac3 gene on the gene expression profile of MHC-II medullary thymic epithelial cells

DESIGN
Residual MHC-II low mTECs were flow-sorted from thymi isolated from HDAC3fl/fl (WT) and HDAC3fl/flFoxn1-Cre (HDAC3 cKO) 6weeks old mice. Typically, 10-30 HDAC3 cKOmice were pooled to obtain 30,000 sorted mTECs, which were then analyzed by gene expression profiling. Specifically, total RNA was extracted from ~30,000 pooled sorted cells using Trizol. Purified total RNA was then amplified using the MessageAmp RNA kit (Ambion). Biotinylated cRNA was then hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1-ST arrays by the genomics core at the Weizmann Institute
