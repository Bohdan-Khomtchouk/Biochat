TITLE
Broad and largely overlapping molecular changes arise in thymic and peripheral XCR1+ dendritic cells upon tolerogenic and immunogenic maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
DC were isolated from lymphoid organs as previously described (Vremec et al., 2000). DC subsets were sorted by flow cytometry according to the marker combinations described in the 'characteristics: phenotype' field for each sample for each individual series. GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST (GPL6246) and GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 (GPL1261) DAT files were processed using Affymetrix Gene Chip Operating System to generate .CEL files. Normalization of the raw Affymetrix expression data with Robust Multi-chip Analysis were performed through Bioconductor in the R statistical environment (version 3.0.2) using the oligo package (GPL6246) and the affy, affyPLM and yaqcaffy packages (GPL1261). For genes symbol with several probeSets, the most variant probSet has been selected. The two platforms where merged by the unique genes symbols. Quantile Normalization was applied on the merged expression arrays to generate Matrix 1. PCA analysis revealed a strong platform effect. Partial Least Square (PLS) was performed to remove the platform effect and yield Matrix2 which was used for subsequent analyses.  The data matrices contain log2 values.
