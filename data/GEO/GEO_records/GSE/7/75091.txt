TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of uterine natural killer cell gene expression from lean and obese women in early pregnancy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in uterine natural killer (NK) cells purified from either lean (control) or obese pregnanct women. The studys' aim is to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways in natural killer cells that are affected by maternal obesity. Results provide mechanitic insight into gene pathways altered in the condition of obeisty.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from immuno-magnetic bead purified natural killer cells from uterine decidual mucosa from 7 to 10 week old pregnancies from 13 lean (BMI 20-24.9) and 11 obese (BMI > 30) women. All women were between 19 and 35 years of age. In addition to BMI, blood serum CRP (hsCRP), a measure of inflammation, was measured via ELISA.
