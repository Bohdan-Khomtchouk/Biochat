TITLE
Inositol requiring enzyme 1Î± augments angiogenesis for diabetic wound healing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The microarray analysis is to investigate the different expression profile of microRNAs in bone marrow-derived progenitor cells from type 2 diabetic mice and healthy control mice.  microRNA expression profiles were compared between bone marrow-derived progenitor cells from either type 2 diabetic db/db mice or their in-colony control litter db/+ mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from bone marrow-derived progenitor cells from either type 2 diabetic db/db mice (Jackson lab, # 000642) or their in-colony control litter db/+ mice. N=3 per group.
