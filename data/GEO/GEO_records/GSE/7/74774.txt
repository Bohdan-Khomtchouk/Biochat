SUMMARY
Identification of midgut genes with sex-biased transcription and/or splicing under cell-autonomous control of transformer in adult intestinal stem cells Sex differences in physiology are commonly attributed to developmental and/or hormonal factors, but there is increasing realisation that cell-intrinsic mechanisms play important and persistent roles. Here we use the Drosophila melanogaster intestine to investigate the activity and significance of intrinsic sex in an adult somatic organ in vivo. We find that the adult intestinal epithelium is a cellular mosaic of different sex differentiation pathways, and displays extensive sex differences in expression of genes with roles in growth and metabolism. Cell-specific reversals of the sexual identity of adult intestinal stem cells uncover its key roles in controlling organ size, its reproductive plasticity and susceptibility to tumours. Unlike previous examples of sexually dimorphic somatic stem cell activity, the sex differences in intestinal stem cell behaviour arise from intrinsic mechanisms, which control cell cycle duration and involve a new doublesex- and fruitless-independent branch of the sex differentiation pathway downstream of transformer. Together, our findings indicate that the plasticity of an adult somatic organ is reversibly controlled by its intrinsic sexual identity, imparted by a new mechanism that may be active in more tissues than previously recognised.

DESIGN
Adult midgut transcriptomes of 15-day-old virgin females were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate using a Hiseq2000 using paired end 100bp reads. Genotypes were: control, transformer mutant  and transformer mutant female in which transformer was re-introduced in adult intestinal stem cells.
