TITLE
C. neoformans gene expression by SIR2 deletion in strains H99 and RC2 subjected to glucose starvation

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans

SUMMARY
Analysis of raw data demonstrated regulation of genes involved in transmembrane transport, transcription and translation; molecular functions that included transporter activity; and cellular components that included the cell membrane, ribosome, nucleolus, and mitochondria

DESIGN
Cryptococcus neoformans strains H99 and RC2 and respective SIR2 mutant were grown in rich media (2% glucose) or calorie restricted media (0.05% glucose) for 16h and total RNA was isolated for RNAseq
