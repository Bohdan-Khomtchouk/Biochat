TITLE
Molecular function of Lhx1 in early mouse development (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq using anti-Lhx1 antibody to map genomic binding of Lhx1 in stably transfected P19 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for two independent SF-Lhx1-cmER expressing P19 embryonic carcinoma cell clones and the parent P19 cell line.  These samples have paired input samples.
