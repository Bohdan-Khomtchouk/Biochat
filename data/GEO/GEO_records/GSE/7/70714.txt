TITLE
Host response in murine fecal peritonitis differs upon the specific fecal microbiota

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We systematically assessed the transcriptomic changes of circulating leukocytes from whole blood of mice that had undergone polymicrobial sepsis. We systematically assessed the transcriptomic changes of liver tissue of mice that had undergone polymicrobial sepsis. Data indicate strong dissimilarities in early gene expression during murine sepsis affecting several pathways such as Toll-like receptor signalling, MAPK signalling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine-signalling, and apoptosis during murine sepsis.

DESIGN
Sepsis can be induced in mice by injecting stool in peritoneal cavity of mice. These models are also known as Peritoneal Contamination and Infection (PCI) models. Heterologous samples were used to understand septic response after injecting fecal slurry from human. Homologous samples were used to understand septic response after injecting fecal slurry from mouse. [blood_het] RNA from murine circulating leukocytes from whole blood (n=4 for sepsis) was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis for comparison of transcriptomic responses. [blood_hom] RNA from murine circulating leukocytes from whole blood (n=3 for sepsis) was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis for comparison of transcriptomic responses. [liver_het] RNA from liver tissue (n=4 for sepsis) was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis for comparison of transcriptomic responses. [liver_hom] RNA from liver tissue (n=3 for sepsis) was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis for comparison of transcriptomic responses.
