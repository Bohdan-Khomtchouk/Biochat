TITLE
Identifying lincRNA as prognostic biomarker for clear cell renal cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing libraries were made for A-498 and 786-O to detect the transcripts regulated by the lincRNA comparing knockdown and the non-targeting control.

DESIGN
Two siRNAs were designed, non-target control and the siRNAs were introduced to the cell lines A-498 and 786-O separately by Lipofectamine 2000. After 16 hours total RNA were extracted. Barcoded cDNA libraries were then prepared from total RNA using the Illumina TruSeq RNAseq kit, and sequenced (single-end 36-bp reads) on an Illumina HiSeq instrument.
