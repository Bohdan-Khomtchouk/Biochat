TITLE
Impact of Tcf1 and Lef1 deficiency on mature CD8 thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptome between control and Tcf1/Lef1-deficient mature CD8 thymocytes

DESIGN
Control mice or those are deficient for Tcf1 and Lef1 transcription factors (deleted by CD4-Cre) were used to isolate thymocytes. The thymocytes were surface-stained to identify TCRbeta high, CD69–, CD24– CD8+ subsets. These cells were sorted for RNAseq analysis.
