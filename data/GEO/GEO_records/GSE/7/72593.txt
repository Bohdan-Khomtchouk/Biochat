TITLE
Circulating miRNA signature in bile of pateints with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) vs  cholangiocarcinoma (CC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA was isolated from bile of pateints with PAS or CC and global microRNA profiling was done using miRNome microRNA Profiler QuantiMir Human PCR Array (#RA660A-1, version 15; BioCat, Heidelberg, Germany)

DESIGN
Three arrays were performed for the PSC group with pooled RNA from n = 5 patients each and two arrays for the CC group with pools of RNA from n = 4 patients each
