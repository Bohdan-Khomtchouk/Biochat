TITLE
The differentially expressed genes of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 at different time after introduced fluoride

ORGANISM
Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans

SUMMARY
The deleterious fluoride ions, which released from fluoride in uranium during its bioleaching, strongly influenced microbial growth, energy intake, enzyme activity and relative metabolism. Whole-genome microarrays were used to obtain a comprehensive description of the molecular response by A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 at 4.8 mM fluoride stress.
