TITLE
Odorant Receptor Expression Frequency in Mature Olfactory Sensory Neurons Depends on Lhx2 [123Cre:Lhx2]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Conditional deletion of Lhx2, and to a lesser extent, Emx2 in olfactory neurons alters odorant receptor expression frequency. GeneChip microarrays were used to measure odorant receptor mRNAs and test whether their abundance was affected in knockout mice

DESIGN
Cre recombinase expression specific to immature and mature neurons was used to conditionally delete floxed Lhx2 and Emx2 genes.
