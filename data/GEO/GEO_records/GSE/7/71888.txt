TITLE
Transcriptional Profiles in Bursal B-Lymphoid DT40 Cells Infected with Very Virulent Infectious Bursal Disease Virus

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) causes a highly contagious, immunosuppressive disease in chickens. The virus mainly infects immature B lymphocytes in the bursa of Fabricius (BF). Chicken B cell line DT40, an avian leukosis virus-induced B cell line, supports very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) infection in vitro and thereby serves as a good model for investigating the infection and pathogenesis of this virus. However, a transcriptome-wide understanding of the interaction between vvIBDV and B cells has not yet been achieved. This study aimed to employ time-course DNA microarrays to investigate gene expression patterns in DT40 cells after infection with vvIBDV strain LX.

DESIGN
6 samples.including DT40 cells infected with vvIBDV strain LX at an MOI of 5 EID50 and collected at the 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 hours post-infection (pi) and mock ones.
