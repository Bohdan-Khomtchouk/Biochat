TITLE
The effect of estradiol and MTDH on gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
During TCGA data analysis, we found that expression of many genes was correlated with the expression of MTDH in estrogen receptor (ESR) positive cancers. The effect of estradiol and MTDH on gene expression in endometrial cancer cells was further analyzed.

DESIGN
ECC1 cells and ECC1 MTDH-deficient cells were treated with or without estradiol for 24 hours. Gene expression regulated by MTDH and estradiol were analyzed by microarray.
