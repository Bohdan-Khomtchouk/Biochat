ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of enrichment for H3K27ac and H3K27me3 in in vitro generated CSCs, following the knockdown of the histone linker H1.0

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis of biological replicates from SSEA1+ in vitro transformed human skin fibroblasts in the presence or absence of H1.0
