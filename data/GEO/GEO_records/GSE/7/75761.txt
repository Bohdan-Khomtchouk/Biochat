TITLE
RNAseq data from in vitro-stimulated (6 hours) murine nfkb2fl/flCD19-Cre and CD19-Cre splenic B cells purified by magnetic cell separation (BAFF)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNAseq analysis of BAFF in vitro-stimulated (6 hours) murine nfkb2fl/flCD19-Cre (furtheron designated as REL) and CD19-Cre (furtheron designated as WT) splenic B cells identifies genes regulated by the transcription factor NF-kB2 in BAFF-stimulated B cells.

DESIGN
Splenic B cells from 12-week old relfl/flCD19-Cre and CD19-Cre littermate mice were isolated by magnetic cell separation from splenic mononuclear cells and stimulated in vitro for 6 hours with BAFF. RNA was isolated and submitted for RNA-sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument for 30 million single-ended reads.
