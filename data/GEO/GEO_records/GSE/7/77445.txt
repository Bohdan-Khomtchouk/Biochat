TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation levels and altered cortisol stress reactivity following childhood trauma in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation likely plays a role in the regulation of human stress reactivity. In a genome-wide analysis of blood DNA methylation in 85 healthy individuals a locus in the Kit ligand (KITLG) gene (cg27512205) had the strongest association with cortisol stress reactivity (p=5.8x10-6). Replication was obtained in two independent samples, one using blood (N=45, p=0.001) and the other using buccal cells (N=255,p=0.004). KITLG methylation strongly mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and cortisol stress reactivity (32% mediation). Its genomic location (CpG island shore within an H3K27ac enhancer mark) provide further evidence that KITLG methylation is functionally relevant for the programming of stress reactivity. Our results extend preclinical evidence for epigenetic regulation of stress reactivity to humans and provide leads to enhance our understanding of the neurobiological pathways underlying stress vulnerability.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from whole blood of 85 healthy controls exposed to psychosocial stress task (TSST-G) was hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
