TITLE
Dynamics of DNA methylation patterning during in vitro propagation of human spermatogonial stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autotransplantation of in vitro proliferated spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) has been advocated as a way to restore fertility in childhood cancer survivors. In this study we determined the effects of cell culture on DNA methylation patterning in human SSCs, to evaluate the safety of future clinical application of SSC autotransplantation.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA of 34 human spermatogonial stem cell samples, 4 sperm samples and 3 seminoma samples were hybridized to Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchips
