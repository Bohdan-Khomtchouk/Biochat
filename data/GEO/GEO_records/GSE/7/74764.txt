TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for the HDF and MDA-MB-231 cells that received TP4 (a cationic antimicrobial peptide) treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks therapeutic target and is difficult to treat. We report a cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAP), tilapia piscidin 4 (TP4), derived from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), selectively toxic to TNBC. Here we aim to identify potential target in TNBC cell response to TP4 treatment by microarray study and to further address the role of TP4-resposive genes involved in TNBC cell death.

DESIGN
TNBC (MDA-MB-231) cells and control (HDF) cells were treated with TP4 at 14 ug/mL for 6hr. Duplicated total RNA samples (i.e. two mock treated and two TP4 treated groups in each cell-line) were collected for further microarray study.
