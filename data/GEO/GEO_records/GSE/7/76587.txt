TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of newly generated dentate granule cells using TU-tagging reveals pattern shifts in gene expression during circuit integration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced total 10 virus infected mouse hippocampus: 3 samples of lentivirus infected, 4 samples of 1st batch retrovirus infected as batch A, and 3 samples as batch B retrovirus infected.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels using TU-tagging approach that differ the newborn neurons from mature neurons.
