TITLE
Identification of genes involved in cold shock response in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
A rapid decline in temperature poses a major challenge for poikilothermic fish. The gene expression of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss having undergone such a cold shock (0 °C) and a control (5 °C) were compared in a microarray-based study.
