TITLE
Comparison of WapCre;Rank;Brca1;p53 and WapCre;Brca1;p53 mouse primary mammary tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcriptional profile of WapCre;Rank;Brca1;p53 and WapCre;Brca1;p53 mouse primary mammary tumor cells was determined by mRNA sequencing and uncovered differences in their molecular signatures including genes involved in oncogenesis, basic metabolism, RNA metabolism, or the regulation of mammary stem cells.

DESIGN
Transcriptome comparison of mouse WapCre;Rank;Brca1;p53 and WapCre;Brca1;p53 primary mammary tumors
