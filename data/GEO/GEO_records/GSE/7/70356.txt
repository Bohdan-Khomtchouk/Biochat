TITLE
Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1: paraquat-treated and phenazine methosulfate-treated

ORGANISM
Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. oleivorans DR1 cells in the presence of paraquat and phenazine methosulfate

DESIGN
To identify genes involved in oxidative stress response in A. oleivorans DR1, cells were grown to exponential phase (OD600 ~0.4) and treated with paraquat (1 mM) and phenazine methosulfate (200 Î¼M) over a period of 15 min. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.
