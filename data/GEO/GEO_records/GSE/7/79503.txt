TITLE
SIRT6 suppresses pancreatic cancer through control of Lin28b [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Chromatin remodeling proteins are frequently dysregulated in human cancer, yet little is known about how they control tumorigenesis. Here, we uncover an epigenetic program mediated by the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) that is critical for suppression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most lethal malignancies. SIRT6 inactivation accelerates PDAC progression and metastasis via upregulation of Lin28b, a negative regulator of the let-7 microRNA. SIRT6 loss results in histone hyperacetylation at the Lin28b promoter, Myc recruitment, and pronounced induction of Lin28b and downstream let-7 target genes, HMGA2, IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3. This epigenetic program defines a distinct subset representing 30-40% of human PDAC, characterized by poor prognosis and an exquisite dependence on Lin28b for tumor growth. Thus, we identify SIRT6 as an important PDAC tumor suppressor, and uncover the Lin28b pathway as a potential therapeutic target in a molecularlydefined PDAC subset.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq experiments to examine H3K56ac histone modifications in murine PDAC cells that are Sirt6 wild type (WT), Sirt6 knock-out (KO), and Sirt6 KO cells engineered to express Sirt6 WT (Sirt6 KO + Sirt6 WT Restored).
