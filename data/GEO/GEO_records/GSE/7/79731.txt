TITLE
Gene expression data from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected WT and miR-155-/- bone-marrow derived macrophages [timecourse]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
How the complex interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the host is regulated during infection is still not well understood. Using a systems biology approach, we demonstrate here that miR-155 is one of several microRNAs that regulate host gene expression over the first 48 hours of Mtb infection in macrophages. miR-155 regulates the cell survival of Mtb-infected macrophages through SHIP1/AKT signaling. Using timecourse gene expression data, we constructed a miRNA regulatory network for the innate immune response to Mtb infection by WT macrophages. The network suggested a role for seven miRNAs in regulating the host response to Mtb, with miR-155 being one of them. We then validated a role for miR-155 by comparing the response between WT and miR-155-/- macrophages.

DESIGN
Three replicates of WT C57BL/6 BMMs were collected at 0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours post-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, H37Rv strain (MOI 5). The regulatory network was then validated with WT and miR-155-/- BMM samples collected at 0 and 8 hours post-infection (three replicates each). This dataset represents three replicates of WT C57BL/6 BMMs were collected at 0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours post-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, H37Rv strain (MOI 5).
