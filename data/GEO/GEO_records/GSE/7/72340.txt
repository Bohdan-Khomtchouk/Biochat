TITLE
An Investigation of Circulating microRNA Profile in Clinical Cases of Subarachnoid Hemorrhages of Hong Kong

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
circulating microRNA analysis in Subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) patients and Heathy controls circulating microRNA profiling has been shown for  biomarker discovery for early disease detection in serum, which is stable and accessible. we describe our progress and propose a workflow to investigate and directly compare the circulating microRNA profiles of SAH patients and healthy individuals, in order to characterize potential biomarkers for SAH. Then we verified the top microRNA by quantitative PCR. Informatics analysis of KEGG provided important mechanistic insight to their potential involved pathways. Finally we demonstrated a possible workflow and initial results which indicated that circulating miRNAs can be potential biomarkers of SAH.
