TITLE
Microarray expression profile of long noncoding RNAs in EGFR-TKI resistance of lung adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Prolonged cancer treatment will induce the development of acquired resistance to EGFR TKI. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of EGFR-TKIs resistance, we generate EGFR-TKI-resistant HCC827-8-1 cells to be analyzed by microarray with their parental HCC827cells.

DESIGN
gefitinib resistant HCC827-8-1 cells with three replications; gefitinib-sensitive HCC827 cells with three replications
