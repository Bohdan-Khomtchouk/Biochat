TITLE
ChIP-seq for H3K27Ac and H3K4me3 in a pre-B-cell model of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, no stimulation or treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We wanted to identify regions of active and open chromatin in a pre-B-cell model of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). We did not stimulate or treat the cells, we merely maintained them in culture. We chose these conditions because we were building a computational model and needed a baseline read of histone activation.

DESIGN
For each histone mark, we had one sample where we immunoprecipitated with an antibody for the histone mark of interest and we had one control where we immunoprecipitated with an IgG control.
