TITLE
Conservation and modification of genetic and physiological toolkits underpinning diapause in bumble bee queens

ORGANISM
Bombus terrestris

SUMMARY
Here, we examined the transcriptomic changes associated with diapause and CO2 treatment in B. terrestris queens before, during and post diapause and in the short and long term after CO2 treatment

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptomic changes in 25 queens assinged to 5 different groups: 5-10 days old mated, 5-10 days old mated right after CO2 treatment, 2.5 months old diapausing queens that were kept under 4 C for 9-10 weeks and two different egg-layer founders: 4 months old, post diapause and 1.5 months old post CO2 treatment
