TITLE
IGF2BP3 controls cancer cell invasiveness by modulation RISC function

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine IGF2BP3 regulation of RNA targets in human pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines

DESIGN
Included are iCLIP-seq libraries for IGF2BP3 from PL45 and Panc1 PDAC cell samples, RIP-seq samples from PL45 and Panc1 PDAC cells, RNA-seq data sets from control and IGF2BP3 knockdown in PL45 and Panc1 PDAC cells, and small RNA-seq samples from Panc1 cells
