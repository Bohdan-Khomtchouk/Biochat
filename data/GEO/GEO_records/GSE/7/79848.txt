TITLE
RNA-Seq Quantification of Xenobiotic Processing Genes in Various Sections of the Intestine in Comparison to the Liver of Male Mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed to quantify and compare the mRNA abundance of all major XPGs in liver and intestine using RNA-Seq.  The mRNA profiles of 304 XPGs, including phase-I, phase-II enzymes, phase-II cosubstrate synthetic enzymes, xenobiotic transporters, as well as xenobiotic-related transcription factors, were systematically examined in liver and various sections of the intestine in adult male C57BL/6J mice.  By two-way hierarchical clustering, over 80% of the XPGs had tissue-divergent expression, which partitioned into liver-, small intestine-, and large intestine-predominant patterns.  Among the genes, 54% were highest expressed in liver, 21% in duodenum, 4% in jejunum, 6% in ileum, and 15% in large intestine.  The highest expressed XPG in liver was Mgst1, in duodenum Cyp3a11, in jejunum and ileum Ces2e, and in large intestine Cyp2c55.  Interestingly, XPGs in the same family usually exhibited highly different tissue distribution patterns, and many XPGs were almost exclusively expressed in one tissue and minimally expressed in others.  In conclusion, the present study is among the first and the most comprehensive investigation of the real mRNA abundance and tissue-divergent expression of all major XPGs in mouse liver and intestine, which aids in understanding the tissue-specific biotransformation and toxicity of drugs and other xenobiotics.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of liver and four sections of intestine of wild-type (WT) mice were generated by RNA-Seq, in triplicate, by illumina HiSeq 2000.
