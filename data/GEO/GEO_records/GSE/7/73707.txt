TITLE
Escherichia coli: untreated versus 5-azacytidine-treated expression profiles

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

SUMMARY
DNA microarray experiments were used to compare gene expression profiles of untreated and 5-azacytidine treated Escherichia coli at both logarithmic phase and early stationary phase The goal was to determine the effect of cytosine DNA methylation loss on gene expression (5-azacytidine is a methylation inhibitor)
