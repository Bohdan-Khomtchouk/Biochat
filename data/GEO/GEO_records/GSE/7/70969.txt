TITLE
Tip5/Baz2a Regulates Chromatin Architecture and Gene Expression to Maintain Self-renewal and Pluripotency of Embryonic Stem Cells [microarray]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It is unclear how gene networks that regulate self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells are established. We searched for factors that contribute to forming functional chromatin architecture in ES cells and identified Tip5 (also called Baz2a) as a genome organizer, folding chromatin and recruiting chromatin remodeling/epigenetic factors to genes. Tip5 binds specialized genomic sequences called base-unpairing regions (BURs) and localizes near heterochromatin. Through chromatin looping Tip5 recruits the polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) subunits and Jarid2 to target genes far from Tip5-bound BURs and alters their histone profiles. In ES cells Tip5 represses PRC2-bound developmental genes and regulates non-PRC2-bound genes that are enriched for G-protein coupled receptor signaling. Tip5 knockdown caused misexpression of these genes important for ES cell maintenance, leading to rapid ES cell differentiation and impaired pluripotency. These data suggest that Tip5 regulates multiple processes through ES cell-specific genome organization to maintain ES cell stemness.

DESIGN
Total RNA harvested from wild-type E14 cells was and compared to Tip5-knockdown E14 cells at passage 3 after each transfection of triplicate
