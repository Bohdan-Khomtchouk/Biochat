TITLE
Expression data from a cell model of Huntington disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Huntington disease (HD) is associated with increased nuclear accumulation of the repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) which govens a huge gene network. An alternative REST splicing event (∆E3) eliminates a motif essential for nuclear targeting of REST. We used Affymetrix’s GeneChip® Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array to compare global transcription between STHdhQ111/Q111 cells (a cell model of HD) treated with specific antisense oligos (ASOs) inducing  ∆E3 and a control oligo, with a comparison to normal STHdhQ7/Q7 cells.

DESIGN
STHdhQ111/111 cells were treated with specific ASOs (inducing ∆E3) or a control oligo, and STHdhQ7/Q7 cells treated with a control oligo was used for a normal control. 3 representative total RNA samples (one for each group) of high quality were subject to transcriptional profiling.
