TITLE
A Systems Approach to Understanding Human Rhinovirus and Influenza Virus Infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human rhinovirus and influenza virus infections of the upper airway lead to colds and the flu and can trigger exacerbations of lower airway diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Despite modest advances in the diagnosis and treatment of infections by these viruses, novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets are still needed to differentiate between the cold and the flu, since the clinical course of influenza can be severe while that of rhinovirus is usually more mild. In our investigation of influenza and rhinovirus infection of human respiratory epithelial cells, we used a systems approach to identify the temporally changing patterns of host gene expression from these viruses. After infection of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) with rhinovirus, influenza virus or co-infection with both viruses, we studied the time-course of host gene expression changes over three days.  From these data, we constructed a transcriptional regulatory network model that revealed shared and unique host responses to these viral infections such that after a lag of 4-8 hours, most cell host responses were similar for both viruses, while divergent host cell responses appeared after 24-48 hours. The similarities and differences in gene expression after epithelial infection of rhinovirus, influenza virus, or both viruses together revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in innate immune activation and regulation. These differences help explain the generally mild outcome of rhinovirus infections compared to influenza infections which can be much more severe.

DESIGN
Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were infected with rhinovirus, influenza virus or both viruses and RNAs were then profiled at 10 time points (2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 26, 48, 60 and 72hrs)
