TITLE
Expression data of preneoplastic lung neuroendocrine cells and L-Myc signature

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify the global gene expression changes driven by L-Myc during SCLC development, mRNA expression profiles were compared using total RNAs from preneoplastic precursors of SCLC and the cells transformed by overexpression of L-Myc.

DESIGN
Gene expression microarays of preneoplastic precursor cells of SCLC (preSC) and L-Myc-, C-Myc-, and N-Myc-overexpressing preSCs with biological replicates
