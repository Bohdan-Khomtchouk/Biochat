TITLE
Dormant and after-ripened seeds are distinguished by early transcriptional differences in the imbibed state

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptome of dormant and after-ripened imbibed seeds of the Arabidopsis accession Cape verde Islands. We analyzed the transcriptional changes in temporal and spatial detail by sampling at four imbibition time-points (3, 7, 12 and 24 hours after sowing) and two seed compartments (RAD and MCE).

DESIGN
Gene expression in imbibed dormant and after-ripened seeds was compared. For each sample three replicates were used.
