TITLE
High-throughput RNA-sequencing of human macrophages infected with Mycobacterium abscessus Smooth and Rough variants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mycobacterium abscessus is an emerging pathogen causing pulmonary infections in those with inflammatory lung disorders, such as Cystic Fibrosis (CF), and is associated with the highest fatality rate among rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM). Phenotypically, MAB manifests as either a Smooth (MAB-S) or a Rough (MAB-R) morphotype, which differ in their levels of cell wall glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) and in their pathogenicity in vivo. As one of the primary immune cells encountered by MAB, we sought to examine the early transcriptional events within macrophages, following infection with both MAB-S or MAB-R. We sampled the small RNA (sRNA) transcriptome of THP-1-derived macrophages infected with both MAB-R and MAB-S at 1, 4 and 24 hours post-infection (hpi) using RNA-seq. MAB-S elicited a more robust transcriptional response at the miRNA level, reflecting higher cytokine levels in culture supernatants. However, and a direct comparison identified no differentially expressed miRNAs between MAB-R- and MAB-S-infected cells. Most of the induced miRNAs have previously been associated with mycobacterial infection and overall miRNA expression patterns were similarly highly correlated between the morphotypes.

DESIGN
THP-1-derived macrophages were infected in parallel with the MAB-R and MAB-S morphotypes. Poly-A selected RNAs were purified and sequenced at 1, 4 and 24 hours post-infection, and compared with uninfected controls.
