TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of PBX3 Regulated Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to analyze the transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) after PBX3 overexpression in SMMC-7721 cells.

DESIGN
SMMC-7721 cells were transfected by PBX3 expression lentivirus and blank lentivirus as control. Total RNA was extraced by Qiagen kit and the mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
