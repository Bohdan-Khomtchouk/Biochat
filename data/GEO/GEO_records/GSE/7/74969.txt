TITLE
Microbiota regulate the ability of lung dendritic cells to induce IgA class switch recombination and generate protective GI immune responses

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analyses of gene expression between CD103+ lung DCs, CD24+ lung DCs and CD64+ lung macrophages in Specific pathogen free (SPF) and germ free (GF) mice. Hypothesis tested was that the IgA class switching function of lung DCs is regulated by genes differentially expressed in GF mice compared to SPF mice. Results obtained provide important insights into the mechanisms of IgA induction by lung DCs

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from flow sorted, lung CD103+ DCs, CD24+ lung DCs and CD64+ lung macrophages from SPF and GF mice
