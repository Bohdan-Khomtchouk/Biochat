TITLE
Comparing active and repressed expression states of genes controlled by the Polycomb/Trithorax group proteins

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins are responsible for the maintenance of stable transcription patterns of many developmental regulators, such as the homeotic genes. We have used a ChIP-on- Chip approach to map the distribution of several PcG/TrxG proteins as well as histone modifications across the two homeotic complexes ANT-C and BX-C. Our data indicate the colocalization of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) with Trx and the DNA binding protein Pleiohomeotic (Pho) at discrete sequence elements as well as significant chromatin assembly differences in active and inactive regions. Trx binds to the promoters of active genes and noncoding transcripts. Most strikingly, in the active state Pho covers extended chromatin domains over many kilobases. The histone modifications investigated, seem to be mutually exclusive, with histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 covering inactive chromatin domains whereas hyperacetylated histone H4 is present only at active genes.
