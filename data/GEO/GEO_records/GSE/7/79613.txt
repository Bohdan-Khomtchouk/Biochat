TITLE
iPSCs Reveal Protective Modifiers of the BMPR2 mutation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to compare transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) in controls, unaffected BMPR2 mutation carriers and affected familial pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, to elucidate a protective feature in iPS derived endothelial cells from the mutation carriers.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of iPSC-ECs from unrelated control (n=3), unaffected BMPR2 mutation carriers (n=3) and FPAH patients with BMPR2 mutation (n=5).
