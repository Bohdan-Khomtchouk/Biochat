TITLE
Comparing regeneration and fibrosis using Acomys and Mus

ORGANISM
Acomys cahirinus

SUMMARY
This project is designed to find differentially expressed genes between regeneration and fibrosis in Acomys (regenerator) and Mus (non-regenerator)

DESIGN
A 4mm biopsy punch was made in the ears of 15 animals in each species (30 animals total).  Tissue was collected at 5 times points, (D0,D5,D10,D15,D20) post injury from 3 mice of each species.  2 species * 5 time points * 3 animals per time point * triplicate runs per sample * paired-end reads = 180 raw data files
