TITLE
HIPSTR lncRNA knockdown in H1BP cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIPSTR is a conserved lncRNA that is transcribed antisense to TFAP2A gene. Unlike previously reported antisense lncRNAs, HIPSTR expression does not correlate with the expression of its antisense counterpart. HIPSTR depletion in HEK293 and H1BP cells predominantly affects genes involved in early organismal development and cell differentiation.

DESIGN
H1BP cells were transfected with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting HIPSTR (ASO #0, ASO #1 or ASO #2) or control scrambled ASO (ASO CTL); transfections with each targeting ASO were done in duplicate, transfections with control ASO were done in triplicate.
