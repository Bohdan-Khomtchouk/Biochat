TITLE
Modulation of immunomodulatory peptide activity by 2-deoxy-d-glucose

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify the role of glycolysis in the activity of immunomodulatory peptides with respect to macrophage function using the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose

DESIGN
Primary human monocyte derived macrophages were treated with 2-deoxy-d-glucose, the immunomodulatory peptide IDR-1018 or a combination of the two for 4 hours. Control samples of untreated macrophages were included. The study was completed in tripiclate (three independent, healthy donors).
