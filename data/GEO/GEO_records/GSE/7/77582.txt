TITLE
Pho and Ph, H3K27me3 and Cg ChIP-seq data in Drosophila third instar larval brains and discs

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Genome-wide binding profile of PcG proteins- Ph, H3K27me3 and Cg in Drosophila third instar larval brains and disks, in duplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed.

DESIGN
Drosophila third instar larval brains and discs were dissected and fixed with 2% HCHO before sonication. After sonication, chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out.
