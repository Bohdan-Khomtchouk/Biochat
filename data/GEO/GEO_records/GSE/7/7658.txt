TITLE
Gene Expression Profile of Hematopoietic Stem Cells during Zebrafish Development

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In order to detect transcriptional differences between primitive and definitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during regular development in the zebrafish embryo, gata1-GFP+/+(18 somites),  lmo2-GFP+/+ (18 somites and 35 hpf)1 and cd41-GFP+/+ (35 hpf) cells from transgenic embryos were individually separated from GFP-/- cells by flow cytometry at the indicated stages. For each individual population, pools of 600 - 1500 transgenic embryos were collected.  After RNA extraction, labelled cRNA was hybridized onto Affymetrix microarrays. Individual experiments were performed with 2 or 3 biological replicates. Keywords: cell type comparison
