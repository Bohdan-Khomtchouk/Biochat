TITLE
Using single-cell RNA-Seq for unbiased analysis of developmental hierarchies (single cell RNA Seq of Irf8 KO GMP)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single cell RNA seq and bioinformatic analysis is used to characterize myeloid differentiation to uncover novel transcriptional networks and key drivers of hematoipoietic development

DESIGN
Single cell RNA seq of different hematopoietic populations integrated with Chip seq involving multiple markers
