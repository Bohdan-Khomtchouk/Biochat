TITLE
The potential functions of FOXL2 in different phases of chicken granulosa cells by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
RNA-seq were performed to study the altered transcriptions by overexpression of FOXL2 in pre-hierarchical (SGCs) and pre-ovulatory granulosa cells (BGCs)

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in two kind of granulosa cells transfected by FOXL2 overexpression or control plasmid,respectively
