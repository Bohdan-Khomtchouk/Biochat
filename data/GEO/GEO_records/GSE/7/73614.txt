TITLE
Can High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer TCGA Gene Expression Signatures be seen in High Grade Endometrioid or Clear Cell Ovarian Cancer?

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of the study was to examine the transcriptional profile of ovarian cancer cancers in order to develop validated clinically useful prognostic signatures with the potential to guide therapy decisions.  Fresh frozen samples were prospectively collected from a series of 107 consecutive women with high-grade serous ovarian, primary peritonial, or fallopian tube cancer as well as high grade clear cell and endometrioid cancer who underwent surgery by a gynecologic oncologist at Mayo Clinic between 1994 and 2005. All patients received postoperative chemotherapy with a platinum agent, and 75% received a taxane. All patients signed an Institutional Review Board approved consent for bio-banking, clinical data extraction and molecular analysis. Median follow-up time was 35 months (range, 1-202 months). Fourteen patients (8%) were included in the TCGA study.

DESIGN
High grade serous, clear cell and endometrioid ovarian tumors (n=107) were compared to a reference pool of 106 ovarian samples. Mixed reference includes normal, benign, borderline, and malignant sample of various histolgies.
