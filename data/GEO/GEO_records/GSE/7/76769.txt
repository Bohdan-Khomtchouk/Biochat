TITLE
Transcriptome of psychrophilic fungus Mrakia psychrophila cultured at different temperature at 4,12,20 degree centigrade

ORGANISM
Mrakia psychrophila

SUMMARY
Mrakia psychrophlila is a psychrophilic fungus widely spread all over the world. The cold adaptation mechanism of Mrakia psychrophila is unknown. Using RNA sequencing, differentially expressed genes of Mrakia psychrophila cultured at 4, 12 and 20 degree centigrade are identified. The result may be benefit for understanding cold adaptation of microorganisms.

DESIGN
Examination of differentially expressed genes of psychrophilic fungus cultured at three different temperature. Raw data submitted to SRA: SRP066938
