TITLE
Long non-coding RNA Linc-RAM enhances myogenic differentiation by interacting with MyoD

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs are important regulators of diverse biological prosesses. Here, we report on functional identification and characterization of a novel long intergenic noncoding RNA with MyoD-regulated and skeletal muscle-restricted expression that promotes the activation of the myogenic program, and is therefore termed Linc-RAM (Linc-RNA Activator of Myogenesis). Linc-RAM is transcribed from an intergenic region of myogenic cells and its expression is upregulated during myogenesis. Notably, in vivo functional studies show that Linc-RAM knockout mice display impaired muscle regeneration due to differentiation defect of satellite cells. Mechanistically, Linc-RAM regulates expression of myogenic genes by directly binding MyoD, which in turn promotes the assembly of the MyoD-Baf60c-Brg1 complex on the regulatory elements of target genes. Collectively, our findings reveal the functional role and molecular mechanism of a lineage-specific Linc-RAM as a regulatory lncRNA required for tissues-specific chromatin remodeling and gene expression.

DESIGN
We first investigated the global effect of Linc-RAM on gene expression by RNA-Seq analysis during myogenic differentiation using RNAs isolated from differentiating C2C12 myoblasts in which Linc-RAM was either stably overexpressed or knocked down.
