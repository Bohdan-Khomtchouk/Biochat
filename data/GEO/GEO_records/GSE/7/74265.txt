TITLE
Gene expression signature and mitochondrial DNA copy number variation in ulcerative colitis patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Specimens were obtained from non-neoplastic colorectal mucosa for RNA ayalysis. Samples were obtained either from surgically resected specimens or during surveillance coloscopy. The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.The correlation between mtDNA CNV and mitochondria-related gene expressions were investigated.

DESIGN
Thirty patients who underwent surgical resection or surveillance coloscopy were included in this study. The copy number of mitochondria DNA was measured by absolute quantification using QuantStudio SD digital PCR system. Samples were classified into mtDNA-Low and mtDNA-High at the median.
