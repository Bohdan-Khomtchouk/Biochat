TITLE
RNA sequencing of Control, ΔCop1β, ΔCop1β and ΔCop1β ΔETV1/4/5β islets

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identify genes which are differentially expressed in ΔCop1β compared to control islets and are also  signficantly rescued in ΔCop1Β ΔETV1/4/5β

DESIGN
Islets were harvested from 5 biological replicates of the followig genotypes: Control, ΔCop1β and ΔCop1Β ΔETV1/4/5β. Islets were individually handpicked and total RNA was isolated and purified for library preperation and Next Generation Sequencing.
