TITLE
Molecular profiling of the developing lacrimal gland

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although normal function of the lacrimal gland (LG) is essential for vision (and thus, for human well-being), the LG remains rather poorly understood at molecular level. The purpose of this study was to identify new genes and signaling cascades involved in LG development.

DESIGN
To characterize and compare lacrimal glands isolated from embryonic and adult mice, we studied gene expression in these glands using Mouse Exonic Evidence Based Oligonucleotide (MEEBO) microarrays. To perform this experiment, RNA extracted from lacrimal glands of 3-month-old (adult) mice and embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) fetuses was used for microarray analysis. A total of three independent biological replicates of E16.5 lacrimal glands and three independent biological replicates of adult lacrimal glands were obtained for comparative profiling.
