TITLE
Differential expression of GFP+ and RFP+ TriPyMT cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tri-PyMT cell is a breast tumor cell line established from Tri-PyMT (MMTV-PyMT/fsp1-Cre/Rosa26-RGFP) primary breast tumors. The cells switch from RFP+ to GFP+ during epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Differential expressed genes between EMT and non-EMT tumor cells will reveal interesting targets for anti-EMT approaches.

DESIGN
Tri-PyMT cells were culture in medium with serum (10%FBS). Cells were treated with or without 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (4ÂµM) for 7 days and sorted by flow cytometry into RFP+ and GFP+ subpopulations for RNA extraction and subsequent RNA-Seq analysis.
