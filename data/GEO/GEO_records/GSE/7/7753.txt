TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling in Peripheral Blood in Untreated New Onset Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) has been strongly associated with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).  To better understand the pathogenesid of sJIA and to facilitate the search for MAS biomarkers, we examine gene expression profiles in untreated new onset sJIA. 17 new onset sJIA patients were included in the study.  5 of the 17 patients showed evidence of subclinical MAS and 2 eventually developed overt MAS. Keywords: disease versus control
