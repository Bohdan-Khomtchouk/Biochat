TITLE
Expression data from XP-A and XP-V cells after UVC exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
XPA is required for Nucleotide Excision Repair system, which could function to repair DNA damage induced by the UV. UV damage on the genomic DNA cannot be removed, thus persistence of damage could affect the transcriptional machinary. We used the microarray to investigate the global expression profiles in the XP-A and XP-V cells in the low dose of UVC comparing with fibroblast from healthy person.

DESIGN
Human primary fibroblasts were developed from the skin of healthy person and two XP patients (XP-A and XP-V). We evaluated global expression profiles comparing the UVC-exposed (0.5J/m2, 5J/m2) with non-exposed sample.
