TITLE
Investigating the influence of the homoebox transcription factor IRX1 on gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate differential gene expression in HEK293T cells after transfection of the transgene of  Iroquois 1 (IRX1). Microarray analysis revealed differential gene expression patterns of HEK293T cells after transient expression of IRX1. In total 8400 genes were deregulated by IRX1.

DESIGN
IRX1 transfection
