TITLE
Gene expression pattern of pulmonary CD11c+ cells from middle-aged and young mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of function of CD11c+ cells from middle-aged and young mice at gene level. This experiment provided insight into the different genes that plays roles in inflammation, immune response and mainly arachidonic acid cascade that are differentiall expressed in CD11c+ cells from middle aged and young mice.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from pulmonary CD11c cells (separated using magnetic beads) from middle-aged and young mice
