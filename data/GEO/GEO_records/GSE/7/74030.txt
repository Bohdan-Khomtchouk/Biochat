TITLE
Analysis of the transcriptome of Lactococcus garvieae in presence or absence of Staphylococcus aureus and under a low or a high level of aeration by RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Lactococcus garvieae has a biopreservative potential against Staphylococcus aureus through its growth inhibition in dairy products. This inhibition involves the production of hydrogen peroxyde by L. garvieae under a high aeration level but little is known about the underlying metabolism. It has already been suggested that this inhibition involves another effector, still unidentified. In this experiment, we aimed to determine the changes in L. garvieae transcriptome depending on the aeration level or on the presence of S. aureus. The results led us to a better understanding of the relationship between the hydrogen peroxide metabolism and the inhibition of S. aureus and to suggest the involvement of other pathways wich may be related to the other and still unidentified effector.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates of mRNA samples from four L. garvieae cultures: pure culture under a high aeration level, pure culture under a low aeration level, co-culture with S. aureus under a high aeration level and co-culture with S. aureus under a low aeration level. Total of 12 samples.
