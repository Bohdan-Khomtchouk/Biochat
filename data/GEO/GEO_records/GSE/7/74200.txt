TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of sperm DNA methylation from monozygotic twin bulls

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Epigenetics (DNA methylation) profiling of sperm from Monozygotic (MZ) twin bull brothers comparing with each other

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, DNA methylation analysis of sperm from Monozygotic twin bull brothers which were hybridized  as dye-swap in two-color arrays in a dye-balanced design.
