Expression data of endothelial cells from mouse hindbrain and genetic Wnt-medulloblastoma and Shh-medulloblastoma mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The childhood brain tumour medulloblastoma includes four subtypes with very different prognoses. Here, we show that paracrine signals driven by mutant Beta-Catenin in WNT-medulloblastoma – an essentially curable form of the disease – induce an aberrant fenestrated vasculature that permits the accumulation of high levels of intra-tumoural chemotherapy and a robust therapeutic response. In contrast, SHH-medulloblastoma – a less curable disease subtype – contains an intact blood brain barrier, rendering this tumour impermeable and resistant to chemotherapy. Remarkably, the medulloblastoma-endothelial cell paracrine axis can be manipulated in vivo, altering chemotherapy permeability and clinical response. Thus, medulloblastoma genotype dictates tumour vessel phenotype, explaining in part the disparate prognoses among medulloblastoma subtypes and suggesting an approach to enhance the chemoresponsiveness of other brain tumours. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression within endothelial cells from normal mouse hindbrain and genetic mouse models of different medulloblastoma subtypes to identify and verify up-regulated and down-regulated genes

DESIGN
Endothelial cells were isolated from adult mouse hindbrain and genetic mouse models of Wnt and Shh-medulloblastoma using Cd-144 and Cd-105 antibodies based magnetic sorting. RNA was extracted and used for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to identify changes in endothelial gene expression patterns based on the surrounding microenvironment, so we purified endothelial cells from normal mouse brain or tumors from genetic mouse models. These include the Shh-medulloblastoma model (Ptch+/-; Ink4c -/-) and Wnt-medulloblastoma model (Blbp-Cre; mutant Ctnnb1+/-; p53-/-; mutant Pik3ca +/-)
