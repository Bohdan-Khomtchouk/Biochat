TITLE
ND and HFD memory phenotype CD4 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarray analysis to identify specific molecular mechanisms controlling Th17 cell differentiation in HFD mice

DESIGN
Memory phenotype CD4 T cells derived from ND or HFD mice were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
