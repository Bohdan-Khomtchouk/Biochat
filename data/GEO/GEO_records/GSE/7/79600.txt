TITLE
Memory CD8+ T cells require stress-levels of acetate for optimal function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
How systemic metabolic alterations during acute infections impact immune-cell function remains poorly understood. Hess and colleagues demonstrate that acetate rapidly increases during infections, which drives acetylation of GAPDH in memory CD8+ T cells and thereby catalyzes the rapid recall response.

DESIGN
Comparison of mRNA profile of control vs. 3d acetate exposed memory OT-I T cells
