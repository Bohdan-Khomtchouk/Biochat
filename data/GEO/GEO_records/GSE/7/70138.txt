TITLE
L1000 Connectivity Map perturbational profiles from Broad Institute LINCS Center for Transcriptomics LINCS PHASE *II* (n=354,123; updated March 30, 2017)

ORGANISM
Connectivity Map

SUMMARY
The Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is an NIH program which funds the generation of perturbational profiles across multiple cell and perturbation types, as well as read-outs, at a massive scale. The LINCS Center for Transcriptomics at the Broad Institute uses the L1000 high-throughput gene-expression assay to build a Connectivity Map which seeks to enable the discovery of functional connections between drugs, genes and diseases through analysis of patterns induced by common gene-expression changes. The platform is GPL20573: Broad Institute Human L1000 epsilon For questions or assistance with this dataset, please email the CMap support team at: clue@broadinstitute.org
