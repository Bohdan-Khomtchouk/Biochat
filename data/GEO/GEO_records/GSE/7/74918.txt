TITLE
Metabolic inhibition of Clostridium thermocellum M1570 by pentose sugars.

ORGANISM
Ruminiclostridium thermocellum

SUMMARY
Differential RNA-Seq analyses to investigate the basis for metabolic inhibition of Clostridium thermocellum M1570 by xylose.   The M1570 strain was developed in the C. thermocellum DSM 1313 Î”hpt background strain. Lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) and phosphotransacetylase (Pta) genes are deleted (Argyros DA, Tripathi SA, Barrett TF, Rogers SR, Feinberg LF, Olson DG, Foden JM, Miller BB, Lynd LR, Hogsett DA, Caiazza NC: High ethanol titers from cellulose by using metabolically engineered thermophilic, anaerobic microbes. Appl Environ Microbiol 2010, 77:8288-8294 )

DESIGN
Differential RNA-Seq analyses was used to investigate the basis for metabolic inhibition of Clostridium thermocellum M1570 by xylose. Cultures were grown in serum bottles containing 40 mL of MTC medium with or without 15 g/L xylose and were harvested at mid-exponential phase. Quadruplicate cultures were used for each experimental condition tested.
