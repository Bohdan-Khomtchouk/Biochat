TITLE
Transcriptional Response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv to Bedaquiline

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
Bacteria commonly adapt to stresses by altering gene expression.  To understand the response of M. tuberculosis (MTB) to bedaquiline, we performed transcriptomics over a time-course on MTB bacilli exposed to the drug.

DESIGN
Bacteria were harvested at 1, 6, 24, 48, 96 hrs after being exposed to concentrations of bedaquiline (no drug, 1.5μM, 15μM) during a 7-day drug exposure time course experiment (as indicated in each sample title). RNA was isolated and applied to custom Agilent tiled arrays. Please note that experiments were performed technically as dual channel (eg, Cy3 and Cy5-labeled samples hybridized to the same array) but processed the  results as though they are single channel (Cy3 and Cy5 signals are calculated). Therefore, there are two sample records per each raw data file and the raw data file associated with each sample is indicated in the corresponding sample description field.
