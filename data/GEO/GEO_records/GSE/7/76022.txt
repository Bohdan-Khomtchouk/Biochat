TITLE
Identification of genes involved in apoptosis-induced by cold atmospheric pressure plasma in human lymphoma U937 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) is known as a source of biologically active agents, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Recent medical investigations have focused on applying CAP to cancer treatment. There is also growing evidence that exposure of cells to CAP or CAP-activated medium induces apoptosis in cancer cells, and ROS and/or RNS are considered to be effective agents to CAP-induced apoptosis. More recently, we demonstrated that Ar-CAP or Ar containing 2.5 % of N2 (Ar-N2-CAP) significantly induced apoptosis in human lymphoma U937 cells. However, a detailed molecular mechanism underling the induction of apoptosis by CAP in cancer cells is unclear. In the present study, to identify genes involved in the induction of apoptosis by CAP in human lymphoma U937 cells, global-scale gene expression analysis was performed using a GeneChip® system.

DESIGN
Human lymphoma U937 cells were treated with Ar-CAP or Ar-N2-CAP. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells, and quality of the RNA was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with a Human Genome U133-plus 2.0 array. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.
