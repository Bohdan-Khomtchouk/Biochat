TITLE
TET2 Regulates Mast Cell Differentiation and Proliferation through Catalytic and Non-catalytic Activities.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dioxygenases of the TET family impact genome functions by converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Here, we identified TET2 as a crucial regulator of mast cell differentiation and proliferation. In the absence of TET2, mast cells showed disrupted gene expression and altered genome-wide 5hmC deposition, especially at enhancers and in proximity of down-regulated genes. Impaired differentiation of Tet2-ablated cells could be compensated or further exacerbated by modulating the activity of other TET family members, and mechanistically it could be linked to the dysregulated expression of C/EBP family transcription factors. Conversely, the marked increase in proliferation induced by the loss of TET2 could be rescued exclusively by re-expression of wild-type or catalytically inactive TET2. Our data indicate that in the absence of TET2, mast cell differentiation is under the control of compensatory mechanisms mediated by other TET family members, while proliferation is strictly dependent on TET2 expression.

DESIGN
Chromatin-IP was performed as described (Ostuni et al. PMID: 23332752).  5–15 × 10^6 fixed primary bone marrow-derived mast cells were lysed with RIPA buffer and, after chromatin shearing by sonication, incubated overnight at 4°C with protein G Dynabeads coupled with 3–10 μg of anti-H3K4me1 antibody.
