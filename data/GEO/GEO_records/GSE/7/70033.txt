TITLE
The role of PCNA ubiquitylation during unperturbed genome replication in S.pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
To establish if PCNA ubiquitylation affects the DNA replication kinetics of specific loci, we compared rates of  DNA replication across the genome between rad18+ and rad18-delta cells using the BrdU-IP sequencing method.

DESIGN
We mapped BrdU-incorporation at 300-bp resolution and subsequent informatics analysis was performed to generate datasets of replication kinetics.
