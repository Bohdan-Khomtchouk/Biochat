TITLE
Expression analysis of human naïve and memory CD8 T cells at resting stage and following short-term stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Memory T cells (TM) play a prominent role in protection and auto-immunity due to their ability to mount a more effective response than naïve T cells (TN). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying enhanced functionality of TM are not well defined, particularly in human TM. We examined the global gene expression profiles of human CD8+ TN and TM before and after stimulation. There were 1,284, 1,373 and 1,629 differentially expressed genes between TN and TM at 0 hr, 4 hr and 24 hr after stimulation, respectively, with more genes expressed to higher levels in TM. Genes rapidly up-regulated in TN cells were largely involved in nitrogen, nucleoside and amino acid metabolisms. In contrast, those in CD8+ TM were significantly enriched for immune-response-associated processes, including cytokine production, lymphocyte activation and chemotaxis. Multiple cytokines were rapidly up-regulated in TM cells, including effector cytokines known to be produced by CD8+ T cells and important for their functions, as well as regulatory cytokines, both pro- and anti-inflammatory, that are not typically produced by CD8+ T cells. These results provide new insights into molecular mechanisms that contribute to the enhanced functionality of human CD8+ TM and their prominent role in protection and auto-immunity.

DESIGN
Naïve and memory phenotype CD8 T cells were purified by FACS from healthy individuals and cultured in vitro with the stimulation of anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs for 0 hr, 4 hr and 24 hr. Total RNA was purified from un-stimulated and stimulated naive and memory CD8 T cells and hybridized to individual single-color arrays.The purification and stimulation protocol was performed two independent times.
