TITLE
Hoxa5 undergoes dynamic DNA methylation and transcriptional repression in the adipose tissue of mice exposed to high-fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we report the genome-wide DNA methylation analyses by MeDIP-seq, performed on epididymal fat of mice fed either high-fat or regular chow diet.

DESIGN
Mice have been fed in high-fat (HFD) or regular chow diet (STD) for 5 months. Epididymal fat of both mice (HFD and STD) was extracetd and used for genome-wide DNA methylation analyses by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq).
