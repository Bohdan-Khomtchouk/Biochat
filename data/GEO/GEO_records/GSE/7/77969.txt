TITLE
Gene expression profiles of human immature dendritic cells after 12h of co-cultivation with Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and LPS

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a whole-transcriptome study, cellular responses of DCs confronted with the fungi A. fumigatus, C. albicans or the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were investigated. Therefore, DCs of four independent donors were harvested after 12 hours co-culture with A. fumigatus, C. albicans and LPS and analyzed with Affymetrix whole genome expression arrays. In general, transcriptomic analysis revealed a clustering of the A. fumigatus- and C. albicans-stimulated DCs. However, LPS and fungi-dependent gene expression showed more common similarities compared to the untreated control.

DESIGN
Human DCs were generated from 4 independent, healthy blood donors. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) were either left untreated or co-cultivated with Aspergillus fumigatus 46645 germ tubes, Candida albicans SC5314 (MOI1) t or LPS (1Âµg/ml) for 12h.
