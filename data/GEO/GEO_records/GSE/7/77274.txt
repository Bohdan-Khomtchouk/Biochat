TITLE
Estradiol facilitates functional integration of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons into striatal neuronal circuits via activation of integrin α5β1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To realize cell transplantation therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), the grafted neurons should be integrated into the host neuronal circuit in order to restore the lost neuronal function. Here, using wheat germ agglutinin-based trans-synaptic tracing, we show that integrin α5 is selectively expressed in striatal neurons that are innervated by midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons from the mouse experiments. Additionally, we found that integrin α5β1 was activated by the administration of estradiol-2-benzoate (E2B) in striatal neurons of adult female rats. Importantly, we observed that the systemic administration of E2B into hemi-parkinsonian rat models facilitates the functional integration of grafted DA neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells into the host striatal neuronal circuit via the activation of integrin α5β1. Finally, methamphetamine-induced abnormal rotation was recovered earlier in E2B-administrated rats than in rats that received other regimens. Our results suggest that the simultaneous administration of E2B with stem cell-derived DA progenitors can enhance the efficacy of cell transplantation therapy for PD.

DESIGN
0.5 µL of 1% WGA Alexa Fluor 488 solution was stereotactically injected into the bilateral SNpc (from the bregma: A -3.0, L ±1.2, V -4.2 and TB 0) of mouse. Two days after injection, a striatum sample was dissected from the mouse brain and dissociated into a single cell population by Accumax (Innovated Cell Technologies, Inc., CA, USA). To separate a two-cell population, Alexa Fluor 488+ cells and Alexa Fluor 488- cells were sorted using a FACSAria III cell sorter. Dead cells were identified and eliminated by 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) staining.
