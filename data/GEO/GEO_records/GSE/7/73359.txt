TITLE
RNA-SEQ analysis of fission yeast strains mutant for components of SHREC

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
This project aims to identify molecular effects of loss of individual SHREC components on fission yeast transcriptional program RNA-seq was utilized to compare transcript levels between wild type, clr1D, clr2D, clr3D, mit1D and chp2D fission yeast

DESIGN
Three biological replicate samples from wild type, clr1D, clr2D, clr3D, mit1D and chp2D were used.
