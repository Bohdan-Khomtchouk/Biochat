TITLE
Transcriptome response to ODC downregulation and reduced polyamine titres in tobacco

ORGANISM
Nicotiana tabacum

SUMMARY
Although a lot is known about polyamines (PAs) and their functions, scientists have not yet been able to completely understand and elucidate their mode of action and interactive molecular partners. An attempt has been made in this direction by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of a key biosynthetic gene in PA metabolic pathway, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), under a constitutive promoter and to correlate various morphological and physiological abnormalities observed in response to reduced PA titres with a genome wide transcriptome analysis of ODC-knockdown tobacco RNAi line. The analysis has not only thrown up a number of candidate genes whose expression could be directly or indirectly affected by cellular PA levels but has also been very informative with regards to the regulation of PA pathway.

DESIGN
Tobacco wild-type and transgenic lines were grown under the culture room conditions of 16 h light at 25Â°C Agilent  Tobacco Gene Expression 4x44k K (AMADID: 021113) , Labeling kit: Agilent Quick-Amp labeling Kit (p/n5190-0442)
