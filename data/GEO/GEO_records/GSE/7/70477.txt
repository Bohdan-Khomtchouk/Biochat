TITLE
Differential transcriptional networks regulated by high sugar consumption in normal and high-fat-fed mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
High sugar consumption, as well as high-fat diet, is a known cause of obesity and metabolic syndrome. However, the synergistic effect of high-sugar and high-fat consumption rarely has been evaluated, especially in terms of transcriptional regulation. Therefore, we focused on the effect of high sugar consumption on hepatic transcriptional networks in normal and high fat-fed mice. C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups and were provided either 23%(w/v) sugar solution or plain water with either high-fat or normal-fat diet for 10 weeks. As a result, high sugar consumption significantly altered lipid metabolism-related genes in normal fat-fed mice; however, in high fat-fed mice, high sugar consumption altered inflammation-responsive genes rather than lipid metabolism. After all, these modulations eventually increased lipid accumulation in the liver and caused systemic metabolic disturbances. These observations for the first time suggested that high sugar consumption along with high-fat diet could lead to the development of severe metabolic syndrome via altering hepatic transcriptional networks.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from liver tissues in C57BL/6J mice supplied either plain water or 23% (w/v) sugar drink with either normal- or high-fat diet for 10 weeks.
