TITLE
Gene expression response to Pax7 in murine myoblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pax7 is a paired box transcription factor that is central to skeletal muscle satellite cell function Microarrays were used to examine gene expression after primary murine satellite cell-derived myoblasts were retrovirally infected with constructs encoding Pax7, PAX7-FOXO1A, dominant negative Pax7-ERD and retroviral control.

DESIGN
Primary murine satellite cell-derived myoblasts were expanded and then divided and each infected with a different construct. After a further 48 hours in culture, RNA was isolated.
