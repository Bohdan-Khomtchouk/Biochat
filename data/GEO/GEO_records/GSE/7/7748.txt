TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of rhesus monkey nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Derivation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) genetically identical to a patient by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) holds the potential to cure or alleviate the symptoms of many degenerative diseases while circumventing any immunorejection issues.  However, no primate nuclear transfer embryonic stem (ntES) cell lines have been derived to date.  Here, we used a modified SCNT technique to produce rhesus macaque SCNT blastocysts at a relatively high efficiency from adult donor cells and we successfully derived two primate ntES cell lines from 304 oocytes (an overall efficiency of 0.7%).  Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA analysis confirmed the ntES cell lines were derived from rhesus monkey SCNT blastocysts and both rhesus monkey ntES cell lines exhibited a normal ESC morphology, expressed key stemness markers, were transcriptionally indistinguishable from control ESC lines and differentiated into multiple cell types.  This is, to our knowledge, the first confirmed derivation of primate ntES cell lines. Keywords: rhesus monkey somatic cell nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells
