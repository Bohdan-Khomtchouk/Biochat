TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing of skeletal muscle for PRMT7 knockout mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that whole body PRMT7-/- adult mice display a significant reduction in in muscle mass. RNA sequencing was performed to identify potential PRMT7 targets. We found that top canonical pathways affected by the loss of PRMT7 includes cell cycle and senescence.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from tibialis anterior muscles harvested from 3 WT and 3 PRMT7 null mice at 8months. RNA sequencing was performed to compare mRNA in skeletal muscles between WT and KO mice.
