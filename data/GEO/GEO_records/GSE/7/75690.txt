TITLE
Expression data from CD8alpha positive dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We screened a number of interferon inducible genes that may be involved in impeding HBV replication and found an anti-HBV activity in ISG20. ISG20 is an IFN-inducible 3’- to 5’-exonuclease, that degrades DNA and RNA and reduces antigen production in hepatocyte-derived cells A range of candidate genes whose expression was dependent on type I IFN stimulation were identified by gene arrays

DESIGN
Total RNA from CD8α+ DCs was extracted from mouse spleens 8h after polyI:C (50 μg) stimulation by RNeasyTM kit. Total RNA (10 μg) from each sample was used to prepare cRNA. Gene expression was analyzed with GeneChipTM
