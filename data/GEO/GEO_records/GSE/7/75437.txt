TITLE
Transcriptome analyses of the Laccaria bicolor-Populus trichocarpa mycorrhiza

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq2000 technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from the ectomycorrhizal fungi Laccaria bicolor colonizing roots of Populus trichocarpa. Samples were taken after 3 months of contact in order to identify mycorrhiza-regulated transcripts. 100bp reads were generated and aligned to the Populus trichocarpa ( ) reference genome.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Populus trichocarpa roots colonized by Laccaria bicolor for three months as well as from control roots were generated by using one lane of 1X100bp Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing per sample.
