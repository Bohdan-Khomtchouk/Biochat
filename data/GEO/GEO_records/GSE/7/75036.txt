TITLE
Differential expression signature of EpiCAM/CD45 positive cells in ascitic fluid from serous ovarian cancer patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential transcriptome signature of FACS purified cell population (EpiCAM/CD45 dual positive cells vs EpiCAM only) from the ascites of human serous ovarian cancer. Primary objective: To characterize the phenotypic expression of stem cells markers, elucidation of differential gene expression and oncogenic functions in EpiCAM/CD45 dual positive vs EpiCAM cells. Methods: Cell Sorting (FACS) from ascites of human serous ovarian cancer patients, apoptotic assay, Drug sensitivity assay, tumor spheroid assay, Cell invasion and cell migration assay.
