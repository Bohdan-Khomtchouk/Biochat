TITLE
Sex-dependent and strain-dependent gene liver gene expression

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A series of dual-channel gene expression profiles obtained using Agilent Mouse TOE 75k microarrays was used to examine the sex-dependent differences in gene expression across three outbred mouse strains, 129J x Black Swiss, 129J x BALB/c, and ICR.  This series is comprised of samples obtained from 3 pools of randomly chosen independent cDNA samples of male and female 129Jx BALB/c mice and 3 randomly chosen independent cDNA samples of male and female 129J x Black Swiss mice and 5 randomly chosen independent cDNA samples of male and female ICR mice.  The ICR mice were randomly distributed into three and two member pools for each sex and two of the 5 samples for each sex were independently hybridized separately as well.  Comparison of the sex-specific genes for the three outbred strains generated lists of strain-dependent and strain-independent sex-specific genes. Keywords: sex response and strain response
