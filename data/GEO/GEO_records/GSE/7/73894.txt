TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of psoriatic and normal skin tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of psoriatic (PP), paired uninvolved psoriatic (PN) and normal skin tissues (NN). The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs in 135 PP, 41PN and 62 NN tissues which were obtained from those who underwent skin biospsies. We not only revealed a genome-wide methylation level pattern for psoriasis, but also identified a strong association between the skin-specific DNAm of 9 DMS and psoriasis.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 217 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
