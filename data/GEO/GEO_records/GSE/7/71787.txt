TITLE
Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 treated with several carbon sources I

ORGANISM
Sphingobium sp. SYK-6

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of RNA extracted from Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 treated with 10 mM dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (DCA), 10 mM vanillate, or SEMP (10 mM sucrose, 10 mM glutamate, 0.34 mM methionine, and 10 mM proline) comparing labeled SYK-6 genomic DNA.

DESIGN
Dual channel experiment, RNA from cells treated with DCA, vanillate, or SEMP vs. genomic DNA. 3 control of genomic DNA, independently grown and harvested.
