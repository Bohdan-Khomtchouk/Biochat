TITLE
Expression dynamics, relationships, and transcriptional regulations of diverse transcripts in mouse spermatogenic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We were interested in how the complex mammalian transcriptomes were established. Using spermatogenesis as a model system, we address this question first by profiling the mRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs and examining their relative abundances in 4 types of SPCs (priSG-A, plpSC, pacSC, rST).

DESIGN
F1 pups of DBA/2 and C57BL6 mice were used for cell isolation and SSC culture. priSG-A, plpSC and pacSC were isolated from prepubertal mice undergoing the first wave of spermatogenesis while rST were from 60 dpp adult mice.
