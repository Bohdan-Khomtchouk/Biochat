TITLE
Gene expression in Aspergillus nidulans at different developmental stages

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis was used to compare different developmental stages of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans.  Cells were grown for various times and comparisons made between: 1. Isolated conidia (0 hours) and isotropically expanding cells (3 hours). 2. Isotropically expanding cells (3 hours) and polarly extending cells (5 hours). 3. Undifferentiated vegetative hyphae (18 hours) and synchronously conidiating cultures (42 hours). Keywords: Developmental stage comparison
