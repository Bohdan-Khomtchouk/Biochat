TITLE
Expression profiling in grade I and grade II meningiomas and in normal control brain samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Experiment: Establishment of expression profiles in grade I and grade II meningiomas and in normal control brain samples. We extracted DNA from specimens and performed mutational analysis in meningiomas and extracted RNA that was processed and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from 14 meningioma samples for expression profiling. 3 controls are normal brain tissue from the Affymetrix data resource center ( ): Affymetrix_TisMap_Brain_01_v1_WTGene1, Affymetrix_TisMap_Brain_02_v1_WTGene1, Affymetrix_TisMap_Brain_03_v1_WTGene1. The RMA-normalized data for these samples are available in the supplementary file 'GSE77259_normalized_data_for_normal_brain_controls.txt'.
