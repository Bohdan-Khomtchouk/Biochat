TITLE
GlpR functions as a global DeoR-type regulator of metabolic gene transcription in the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii

ORGANISM
Haloferax volcanii

SUMMARY
Investigation of gene expression in ∆glpR mutant strains vs wild type in response to glycerol and glucose.

DESIGN
H. volcanii H26 (∆pyrF parent strain) and KS8 (∆glpR) transcriptomes were compared following growth in minimal medium supplemented with glucose and glycerol. Three biological replicate trials were performed for each strain under each condition.
