TITLE
Microbial community structure of a lotic aquatic system receiving wastewater effluent

ORGANISM
riverine metagenome

SUMMARY
Total bacterial DNA was isolated from water and sediment samples from a local watershed and 16S rRNA sequences were analyzed using the Illumina MiSeq v3 platform in order to generate snapshots of bacterial community profiles.

DESIGN
A total of 56 samples were collected that represent water and sediment samples from 14 sample sites over two different time points (November 18 and 25, 2011).
