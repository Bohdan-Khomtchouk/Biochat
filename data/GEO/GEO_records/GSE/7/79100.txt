TITLE
Epigenome-Wide Methylation Profile in Normal Human Kidney: Sex, Age, and Ethnic Differences

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Epienome-wide DNA methylation profiling of normal human kidney tissue samples. The Illumina HumanMethylation450K Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs in normal human kidney samples. Samples included 15 male and 16 female normal human kidney samples tissue.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 31 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K Beadchip
