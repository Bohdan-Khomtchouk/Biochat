TITLE
Comparison analysis of 2 week old C57BL6J lung exposed to 2 weeks of cigarette smoke compared to age-matched controls

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that gene expression in the cigarette smoke (CS) exposed neonatal lung and age-matched controls will be divergent.  CS exposed lung will have divergence of immune response genes and  structural genes.  The lungs of (6) 2 week old neonatal mice exposed to 2 weeks of CS were compared to the lung of (4) 2 week old age-matched control mice.  We utilized microarray analysis to examine transcriptional differences between smoke exposed neonatal lung and age-matched controls. Keywords: comparative expression profiling
