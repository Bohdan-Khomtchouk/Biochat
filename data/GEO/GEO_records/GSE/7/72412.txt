TITLE
MicroRNA expression profile between human colorectal cancer SW480 and SW620 cell line

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Two isogenic human colorectal cancer cell lines (primary SW480 cell line and its lymph node metastatic variant SW620 cell line),as an in vitro metastatic model. We have demonstrated that SW620 cell line possesses high metastasis potential  and  SW480 cell linepossesses low metastatic potential.
