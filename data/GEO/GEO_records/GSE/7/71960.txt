TITLE
Research resource: global identification of estrogen receptor Î² target genes in triple negative breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this work was to identify all estrogen receptor beta target genes using RNA sequencing in MDA-MB-468 triple negative breast cancer cells engineered with inducible expression of full length estrogen receptor beta.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells with inducible ERb expression (MDA-468-ERb cells) were treated in triplicate with vehicle (control, no ERb) or doxycycline (plus ERb) for 48 hr prior to treatment with 0.1% DMSO vehicle or 10 nM 17b-estradiol for 4 hr.
