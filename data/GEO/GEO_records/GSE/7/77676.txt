TITLE
The Distinct Transcriptional and Metabolic Profiles Associate with Empathy in Spiritual/Religious Trained Buddhists: A Pilot Study of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism Priests

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The microarray analyses revealed that the “priest-type” transcripts included up-regulated genes of type I interferon innate anti-viral responses (MX1, RSAD2, IFIT1, IFIT3, IFI27, IFI44L, and HERC5), and down-regulated genes of C17orf97 (ligand of arginyltranseferase 1), hemoglobin γA (HBG1), keratin associated protein (KRTAP10-12), and sialic acid Ig-like lectin 14 (SIGLEC14) at baseline.

DESIGN
Ten qualified Shingon Esoteric Buddhist priests and 10 age-matched healthy controls were recruited.  Subjects provided peripheral blood samples for the analysis of gene expression
