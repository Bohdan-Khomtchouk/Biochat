TITLE
RNA-Sequencing for Additional Molar Germs Transcriptomes at Stages of Early Development in Miniature Pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms of the regulatory network of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs during sequential formation of additional molars remain poorly characterized in diphyodont mammals. The diphyodont miniature pig has proved to be a valuable model for studying human molar morphogenesis. Here, we performed RNA-seq on miniature pigs at three molar developmental stages to examine their differential gene expression profiles and potential regulatory networks during additional molar morphogenesis. Many new unannotated genes plus putative long non-coding RNAs were identified. Our data provide fundamental knowledge and a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms governing cascade initiation of additional molars.

DESIGN
Additional molar germs mRNA profiles from early developmental stages at E50, E60 and E70 in Miniature pigs' were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq 2000
