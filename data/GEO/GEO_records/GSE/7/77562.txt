TITLE
Ecdysone signaling induces two phases of cell cycle exit in Drosophila cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Pulsed ecdysone signaling remodels cell cycle dynamics, causing distinct primary and secondary cell cycle arrests, similar to those observed in the wing during metamorphosis.

DESIGN
This was a timecourse transcriptome analysis of the Drosophila pupal wing during metamorphosis by RNAseq. Timepoints include the proliferative wandering L3 larval stage (-10h APF), the temporary G2 arrest (6h APF) the final cell cycle (18h APF) the permanent cell cycle arrest (24h APF), and stages of terminal differentiation including vein differentiation, wing hair formation and cuticle protein production (36 and 44h APF)
