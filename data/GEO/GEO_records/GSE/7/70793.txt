TITLE
Transcriptional and translational analysis of wild-type and Mincle-KO macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of total RNAs from wild-type and Mincle-KO macrophages stimulated with TLR2 ligand and co-stimulated with TLR2 ligand and Mincle ligand. And analysis of total and polysomal RNAs from wild-type macrophages co-stimulated with TLR2 ligand and Mincle ligand in the presence or absence of DHS inhibitor (GC7). Mincle is a C-type lectin receptor for trehalose dimycolate, a mycobacterial cell wall component. And results provide insight into the crosstalk between the TLR2 and Mincle signaling pathways by RNA-seq assay and identifying potential targets of Mincle-mediated translational control by polysome profiling assay.

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived macrophage mRNA profiles of wild type (WT) and Mincle-KO mice were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq-2000.
