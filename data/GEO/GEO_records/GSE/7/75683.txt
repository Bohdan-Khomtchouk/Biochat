TITLE
GRα-independent transcriptional activity of hGRβ in GR Liver Knockout Mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used AAV as a vector to deliver hGRβ to the liver of GR Liver Knockout mice. We collected liver samples for microarray analysis to investigate any phenotype as well as the underlying specific signaling pathway. In particular, we would like to determine if and how hGRβ overexpression in liver affects mGRα’s gene transcription profile in GR Liver Knockout  mice.

DESIGN
GR Liver Knockout mice were treated with PBS,  AAV-GFP and AAV-hGRB, respectively.  Each treatment group has four replicates.
