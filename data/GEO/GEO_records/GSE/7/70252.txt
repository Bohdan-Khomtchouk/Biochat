TITLE
Indirect Flight Muscle (IFM) expression profiling of actin and myosin nulls in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of IFMs from 1-2 day old adult male flies of 3 genotypes: Canton-S, IFM-specific actin null (Act88FKM88) and IFM-specific myosin null (Mhc7). Results provide insight into how muscles respond to the absence of major scaffold proteins, and whether these transcriptional responses are filament-specific or generic to the tissue.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from the IFMs of 1-2 day old adult male flies of 3 genotypes (Canton-S, Act88FKM88, Mhc7), labeled, and hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Drosophila Genome 2.0 microarrays. 9 microarray experiments from 3 independent biological replicates of each genotype. Data was analyzed using RMA method, and significance was tested using SAM version 3.02, with cut-off parameters of 10% FDR and minimum 2-fold change in expression levels.
