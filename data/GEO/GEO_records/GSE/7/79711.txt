TITLE
White adipose tissue browning in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated gene expression signatures in subcutaneous inguinal adipose tissue obtained from wild type and R6/2 mice with the aim to identify gene expression changes and signalling pathway alterations in adipose tissue relevant to HD. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array. Target genes were technically validated using real-time quantitative PCR.

DESIGN
12 subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue samples were analyzed by affymetrix: 6 wild-type samples; 6 R6/2 mouse samples.
