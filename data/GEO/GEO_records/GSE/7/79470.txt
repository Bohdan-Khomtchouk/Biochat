TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Analysis of human embryonic stem cells derived MESP1-mTomato reporter cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: To compare the transcriptome of MESP1-mTomato reporter cells at undifferentiated state, mesoderm differentiation day 3 mTomato+ and mTomato- cells and MESP1+ cells undergoing endothelial differentiation in 2D and 3D. Methods: total RNA from sorted MESP1+, MESP1- and hESCs (in biological duplicates) was extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with RNase free DNase. Libraries prepared following the instruction of TruSeqâ„¢ RNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina) and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000. Results: genes differentially expressed in MESP1-mTomato+ and mTomato- cells were identified. Conclusions: the gene expression profile of MESP1-mTomato cells indicates that they are cardiovascular progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Perform RNA-seq of undifferentiated hESCs,  mesoderm differentiating MESP1+, MESP1- cells, and endothelial differentiating MESP1+ cells in 2D and 3D.
