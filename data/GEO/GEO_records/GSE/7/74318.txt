TITLE
The imprinted Phlda2 gene modulates a major endocrine compartment of the placenta to regulate placental demands for maternal resources

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent work suggests that imprinted genes may regulate the signalling function of the placenta by modulating the size of the endocrine compartment. Our work provides in vivo evidence that this hypothesis is well founded. Affymetrix Mouse Microarray analysis of E16.5 placneta was used to demonstrate gene expression changes in the mutant placenta.

DESIGN
E16.5 Phlda2+/+(129) (non-transgenic; 1X), Phlda2-/+(129) (maternal KO; 0X) and Phlda2+/+BACx1(129) (single copy Phlda2 transgene; 2X) placenta were used (N=3-4 of each genotype, two independent litters) were used to extract RNA and hybridize to Affymetrix microarrays.
