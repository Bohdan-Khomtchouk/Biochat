TITLE
Expression data from Human Ishikawa cells treated with Genistein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of changes in gene expression during treatment with Genistein in vitro. Ishikawa cells were maintained and grown (to confluency or at a desired cell density between 500,000 - 1 million cells/mL) in DMEM/F-12 Medium (supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum + 1X penicillin/streptomycin) in xenoestrogen-free Corning plasticware.  Cells were gently washed in warm PBS and transferred to phenol red-free DMEM/F-12 Medium (supplemented with 10% Charcoal-Stripped Fetal Bovine Serum + 1X penicillin/streptomycin) in Corning Cell Culture Cluster wells overnight and then challenged with 10pM (very low, vL), 1 nM (low, L), 10nM (high, H), and 1uM (very high, vH) levels of Genistein.  Prior to collection, cells were washed in warm PBS, resuspended & briefly incubated in TRI-Reagent, & finally collected (in quintuplicate replicates) at time each specific time point: 8 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours.  Following RNA isolation, the best RNA yields for each quadruplicate set was selected for target preparation and GeneChip processing.

DESIGN
60 total samples:  5 Doses [Vehicle Control, Very Low (1 pM), Low (100 pM), High (1 nM), Very High (1 uM)]; 3 Timepoints [8 hour, 24 hour, 48 hour]; 4 Replicates each
