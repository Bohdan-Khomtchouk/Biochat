TITLE
Gene expression profiles of MBP-specific T cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
2nd generation sequencing was used to compare expression profiles of MBP-specific T cells retrieved from blood, CSF, spinal cord meninges and parenchyma. The overall expression profiles were found to be very similar.However, genes regulated during T cell activation were found to be upregulated in T cells from spinal cord meninges and parenchyma compared to blood and CSF.

DESIGN
2nd generation sequencing of MBP-specific T cells retrieved from blood and CNS compartments during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
