TITLE
Identification of miRNAs associated with dark-induced senescence in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To find the miRNAs that may be involved in dark-induced leaf senescence, we identified miRNAs by microarray platform using Arabidopsis thaliana leaves from both whole darkened plants (DPs) and individually darkened leaves (IDLs). Control, IDLs and DPs were treated for 2, 4 or 6 d in the same climate chambers (16 h light/8 h dark, 250 mmol m-2 s-1).

DESIGN
7 samples were analyzed, namely the control, DP-2, DP-4, DP-6, IDL-2, IDL-4 and IDL-6. DP means Arabidopsis thaliana leaves from both whole darkened plant. And IDL means that leaves were covered by a black plastic bag and aluminum foil to reduce heat, whereas the rest of the plant remained in light. Every sample was collected in 28 plants from the 6th to 10th rosettes.
