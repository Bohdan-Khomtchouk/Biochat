TITLE
Differential gene expression analysis of iodide treated rat thyroid follicular cell line PCCl3

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The inhibitory effect of supra physiological iodide concentrations on thyroid hormone synthesis (Wolff-Chaikoff effect) and thyrocyte proliferation is largely know as iodine autoregulation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which iodide excess modulate thyroid functions remains unclear. In this work, we analyzed the rat follicular cell PCCl3 transcriptome profile under untreated and treated conditions with 10-3M sodium iodide (Na/I). Serial Analysis of Gene Expression revealed several transcripts differentially expressed in response to the iodide showing that excess iodide affects almost all aspects of thyroid cell function and differentiation acting on the iodine autoregulatory mechanism through a complex process. Keywords: comparative genomic analysis
