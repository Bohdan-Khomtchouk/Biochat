TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of human neural progenitor cells and neurons with DISC1 interruption

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: Genetic and clinical association studies have identified disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) as a candidate risk gene for major mental illness. DISC1 is interrupted by a balanced chr(1;11) translocation in a Scottish family, in which the translocation predisposes to psychiatric disorders. We investigate the consequences of DISC1 interruption in human neural cells using TALENs or CRISPR-Cas9 to target the DISC1 locus. We sought to compare the gene expression profiles of human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons with interruption of the DISC1 gene in exon 2 (affecting all known coding transcripts) or exon 8 (near the site of the Scottish translocation, affecting longer transcripts). Methods: Wild-type and DISC1-targeted iPSCs (wild-type = " WT " , exon 8 single allelic frameshift mutant = " ex8_wm " , exon 8 biallelic frameshift mutant = " ex8_mm " , exon 2 biallelic frameshift mutant = " ex2mm " ) were differentiated to NPCs and neurons using an embryoid aggregate method. NPC or neuronal cultures were used for RNA harvest and subsequent paired-end stranded sequencing of > 50M reads/sample and 3-6 biological replicates per group. Results: We find that a subset of genes related to neuronal differentiation and development are dysregulated with DISC1 disruption at the NPC timepoint, whereas expression of genes related to neuronal function and signaling are altered at the neuronal timepoint. This study implicates DISC1 as a regulator of neuronal development.
