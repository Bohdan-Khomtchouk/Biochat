TITLE
RNA Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of BV-2 Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq, we report here that BV-2 microglial cells have a distinct transcriptomic signature and express a unique cluster of transcripts in response to 4 hrs LPS.

DESIGN
Examination of effects of LPS-stimulated BV-2, were generated by deep sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000(101 cycles PE lane).
