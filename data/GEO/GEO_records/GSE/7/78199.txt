TITLE
BASP1 modifies the Tamoxifen response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report that WT1 transcriptional repressor protein BASP1 interacts with oestrogen receptor alpha (Erα), and interaction which in enhanced in the presence of Tamoxifen. We utilised RNASeq to identify common BASP1 and ERα target genes as well as Tamoxifen responsive genes that are altered in the absence of BASP1.

DESIGN
Total mRNA sequencing analysis of MCF7 cells treated with either siRNA against BASP1 or negative control siRNA, with and without Tamoxifen treatment. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
