TITLE
Puberty-specific promotion of mammary tumorigenesis by a high animal fat diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression for genes differentially expressed between early vs. late tumor onset and high fat diet (HFD) vs. low fat diet (LFD) in mice.

DESIGN
2 class analysis of early vs late tumor onset samples; 5 LFD late tumor onset, 3 HFD early tumor onset, 6 HFD late tumor onset, 4 LFD-HFD late tumor onset, 3 HFD-LFD early tumor onset, 3 HFD-LFD late tumor onset
