TITLE
Gene expression profiles of rat liver tissues after diethylnitrosamine treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Hepatic cancer (HC), as one of the common malignancies in the world, is characterized by malignant cell prolifeHCion and growth, and hepatocarcinogenesis covers the stages of non-specific liver injury, liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, dysplasia nodules and finally liver carcinoma We used HC Genome 230 2.0 microarray to further highlight the regulatory role of rat liver tissues after diethylnitrosamine treatment.

DESIGN
The rat model of hepatic cancer (HC) was established, and the expression profiles of liver tissues from HC were detected at 5, 8, 12, 16 and 18 weeks using Rat Genome 230 2.0 array. Then the significantly changed genes related to HC were identified. The relevance of gene expression profiles and biological processes was analyzed by bioinformatics and systems biology.
