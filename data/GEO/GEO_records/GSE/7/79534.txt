TITLE
The genes regulated by JAK2 and Lnc-BM in breast cancer brain metastasis cells (231-BM, derived from MDA-MB-231 cells) treated with Oncostatin M (OSM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A long noncoding RNA (Lnc-BM) mediates JAK2 activity in 231-BM cells treated with OSM. Emerging evidence has shown that the effect of JAK2 is mainly mediated by three downstream signaling pathways including the AKT, MAPK, and STAT1/3/5 pathways. To determine the signaling pathways that are regulated by Lnc-BM, we performed gene expression microarray analysis on cells with Lnc-BM depletion or JAK2 KO and compared them to their corresponding controls following OSM stimulation.

DESIGN
We performed cDNA microarray analysis to compare Lnc-BM stably knockdown 231-BM cell or JAK2 knockout (KO) 231-BM cell with its respcective control cells treated with or without OSM.
