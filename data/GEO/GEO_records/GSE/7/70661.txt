TITLE
Taf4 is required for preinitiation complex formation at genes associated with neuronal differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Occupancies of promoters by TBP, PolII, TFIIB as well as chromatin marks H3K4Me3 and H3K27ac were compared in embryonic stem cells (ESC) and in embryoid bodies (EB) treated with retinoic acid (RA) derived from the WT and Taf4a-/- lineages. Reduced occupancies for these factors and decreased signals for H3K4Me3 and H3K27ac were observed for genes associated with neuronal differentiation in EB of Taf4a-/- line compared to EB of WT line.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq experiment was performed for TFIIB, Pol II, H3K4me3, H3K27ac and TBP in wt and TAF4-/- mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and embryoid bodies (EB) treated with retinoic acid (RA).
