TITLE
Genomics insights into high pressure adaptation in a Thermococcus sp. from the world’s deepest hydrothermal vents

ORGANISM
Thermococcus

SUMMARY
The present study describes the isolation of a Thermococcus sp. strain 175 from the world‘s deepest hydrothermal vent sites known thus far – The Mid-Cayman Rise.consisting of two hydrothermal venting systems Bee Bee (or Piccard), at 4950m depth and Von Damm (or Walsh) at 2300m The strain is capable of growth over 0.1MPa (atm. Pressure) to 120MPa, the widest known range of pressure dependent growth. The study further explores piezophilic adaptation using comparative genomic tools. Insights into the transcriptome of this strain providers the first look into the transcriptional machinery of peizophilic Thermococci.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from cells grown at HighPressure (three replicates HP1,HP2,HP3) and at atmospheric pressure (reference also in triplicate Atm1,Atm2.Atm3) and sequenced.
