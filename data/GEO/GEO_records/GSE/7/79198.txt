TITLE
Gene expression data from long term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC, Lin-Sca-1+c-kit+CD34-CD135-) isolated from control, MxCre Jak2VF/+ and MxCre Jak2VF/+ EZH2-/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Inactivating EZH2 mutations have been associated with myelofibrosis (MF). Moreover, EZH2 mutations co-exist with the JAK2V617F mutation in a significant cases of MF. To determine the effects of concomitant loss of EZH2 and JAK2V617F mutation in hematopoiesis, we generated Ezh2-deficient Jak2V617F-expressing mice. To gain insights into the mechanisms by which Ezh2 deficiency promotes the development of MF in Jak2V617F knock-in mice, we performed microarray gene expression analysis on sorted LT-HSC from control, MxCre;Jak2VF/+ and MxCre;Jak2VF/+ EZH2-/- mice.

DESIGN
Microarray analyses were performed on LT-HSC sorted from control, MxCre Jak2VF/+ and MxCre Jak2VF/+ EZH2-/- mice BM cells at 12 weeks after pI-pC injections. Three biological replicates for each genotype, i.e., a total of nine samples were utilized for microarray analyses.
