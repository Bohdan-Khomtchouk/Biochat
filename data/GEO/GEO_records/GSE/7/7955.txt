TITLE
Transcriptional response of rat cerebrocortical tissue following acute exposure to permethrin or deltamethrin.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Pyrethroids are neurotoxicants that disrupt nervous system function by interacting with a variety of membrane bound ion channels on neuronal plasma membranes.  This study is designed to investigate the transcriptional events downstream of pyrethroid-induced disruption of nervous system excitability.  Adult, male Long-Evans rats were orally dosed in vivo with a single dose of either permethrin (1, 10, or 100 mg/kg) or deltamethrin (0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg) at levels that produce only modest behaviroal effects in the whole animal (Wolansky et al. 2006).  Transcriptional profiles were obtained from frontal cerebrocortical tissue 6 hours after acute exposure.  The primary goals were 1) to identify dose-responsive biomarkers of effect for pyrethroids and 2) identify sensitive intracellular signaling or metabolic pathways sensitive to pyrethroid compounds.
