TITLE
Expression data from fully-expanded leaflet of Bambara groundnut genotype (S19-3)

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Low temperature stress in a number of African countries, such as Botswana, at night can effect the growth and development of bambara groundnut, leading to losses in potential crop yield. Therefore, we made an attempt to identify and analyze the genes and gene modules associated with low temperature stress response in bambara groundnut using the cross-species microarray technique, as bambara groundnut has no microarray chip, coupled with network-based analysis.
