TITLE
Array CGH analysis for intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IVLBCL is a rare distinct disease entity of extranodal large B-cell lymphoma . The disease is characterized by selective growth of tumor cells in the lumina of small vessels and by the absence of remarkable lymphadenopathy. We have developed patient derived xenograft IVLBCL mouse models from primary patient bone marrow samples. This dataset includes the array CGH analysis of IVLBCL tumor cells from the mouse xenograft models.

DESIGN
DNA was extracted from spleens or a liver of the four xenograft mouse models (IVLBCL #1, #2, #3, and #4). For one of the four models (IVLBCL #3), additional DNA was obtained from a kidney, a bone marrow and an adrenal grand of the mouse model.    Total seven DNA samples were then analyzed to identify copy number alterations for IVLBCL.
