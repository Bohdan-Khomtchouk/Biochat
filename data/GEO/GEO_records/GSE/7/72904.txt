TITLE
HDAC4 gene therapy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BL/6N animals received either adeno associated virus leading to overexpression of luciferase or Histone deacetyase 4 aminoacids 1-201. After 6 weeks of expression, animals got transaortic banding (TAC) to induce pathological cardiac remodeling. We compared both groups to C57BL/6N animals with sham surgery and overexpression of luziferase.

DESIGN
3 male animals per group at an age of 8 weeks were included in the microarray analysis, treated with adenoassociated virus (AAV) containing a coding sequence for Luziferase or Histone Deacetylase 4 (HDAC4, aminoacids 1-201) under the control of the MLC-promoter. Both groups were then exposed to transaortic constriction. As a control to HDCA4 served AAV treatment with overepression of luziferase and sham-op as a control to TAC-surgery.
