TITLE
Identification of CdnL, a putative transcriptional regulator involved in repair and outgrowth of heat-damaged Bacillus cereus spores

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579

SUMMARY
Heat-treated spores show delayed and slower germination and outgrowth compared to untreated spores presumably due to spore damage repair. This study was performed to identify genes possibly involved in spore damage repair in B. cereus. In this study we compared the transcriptomic profiles of untreated and heat-treated spores during germination and outgrowth in BHI at 30C.

DESIGN
Matrix is compatible with the Agilent-017343 array design. Elermeiers with BHI were inoculated with untreated or heat-treated (1 min at 95C) B. cereus spores (final volume 20ml, final spore concentration 10^8 sp/ml) and incubated with aeration (200rpm) at 30C untill harvesting. Elermeiers were harvested for untreated spores 10, 20, 30 and 50 min and for heat-treated 50, 90, 120 and 150 minutes after adding BHI. Samples from experimental duplicates were hybridized on the arrays with at least 3 technical replicates for each experimantal replicate.
