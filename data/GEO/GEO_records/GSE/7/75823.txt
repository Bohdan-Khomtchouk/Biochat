TITLE
Sequencing Universal Human Reference RNA by Smart-seq and early barcoding library preparation methods

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Many library preparation methods are available for gene expression quantification. Here, we sequenced and analysed Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR) prepared using Smart-Seq2, TruSeq (public data) and a protocol using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that all include the ERCC spike-in mRNAs to investigate the effects of amplification bias on expression quantification.

DESIGN
UHRR 10 and 12 replicates for Smart-seq2 and UMI-seq library preparation methods, respectively.
