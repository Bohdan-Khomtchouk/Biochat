TITLE
Overexpression of PHF8 promotes an EMT-related gene signature in MCF10A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PHF8 exerts distinct functions in different types of cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying its specific functions in each case remain obscure. To establish whether overexpression of PHF8 regulates the TGF-β induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we treated MCF10A-Mock (control) and MCF10A-PHF8wt (overexpressing wild-type PHF8) cells with TGF-β1 for 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours and performed RNA-seq in biological duplicates. Our data indicated that EMT gene signatures were significantly enriched in MCF10A-PHF8 cells with TGF-β1 treatment at all time points, strongly indicating that PHF8 overexpression induces a sustained EMT signaling program.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of MCF10A-Mock (control) and MCF10A-PHF8 with TGF-β1 treatment for 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours were generated by RNA-seq, in duplicate, using HiSeq2500 instrument.
