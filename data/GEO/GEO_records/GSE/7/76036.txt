TITLE
Investigation of small RNA and RNA-seq transcripts from soybean (Glycine max) DCL1 mutants

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
In plants, DICER-LIKE1 is a critical enzyme in the biogenesis pathway of plant miRNAs. Zinc-finger nucleases were used to generate single and double-mutants of soybean DCL1 homologs. We created several small RNA libraries to investigate the effect on miRNA abundance in these various mutants. RNAseq transcript data was also generated in order to investigate targets of those impacted miRNAs.

DESIGN
Genome-wide small RNA profiling was done by Illumina TruSeq sample preparation followed by high-throughput sequencing with Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.Â
