TITLE
KRAS mutation (G12V) expression by pBABE-Puro vector in NCI-H1703 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to determine genes affected by expressing KRAS mutation (G12V) in NCI-H1703 cells This data was used in Meng Wang et. al. Cancer Research 2016 to determine the alterations of gene expression profiling associated with expression of KRAS mutation (G12V).

DESIGN
The experiment uses a pBABE-Puro vector encoding KRAS G12V and a corresponding empty vector control.
