TITLE
Homo sapiens PBMCs: pre-vaccination (stimulation  vs. no stimulation with EV71 antigen) vs. post-vaccination (stimulation  vs. no stimulation with EV71 antigen)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To characterize the primary and recall responses to EV71 vaccines, PBMCs from 19 recipients before and after vaccination with EV71 vaccine were collected. 14 samples pre-vaccination and 16 samples post-vaccination were detected by microarray and their gene expression signatures after stimulation with EV71 antigen were compared.

DESIGN
Four-condition experiment,pre-vaccination PBMCs (stimulation  vs. no stimulation with EV71 antigen) vs. post-vaccination PBMCs (stimulation  vs. no stimulation with EV71 antigen)
