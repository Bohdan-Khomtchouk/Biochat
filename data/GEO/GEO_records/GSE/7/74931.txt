TITLE
The impact of anaerobiosis on expression of the iron-responsive Fur and RyhB Regulons [ChIP-chip]

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
As descirbed in the manuscript The impact of anaerobiosis on expression of the iron-responsive Fur and RyhB Regulons we performed a control ChIP-chip experiment in an E. coli strain lacking the transcription factor Fur to identify regions Fur-independent enrichment.

DESIGN
We performed ChIP-chip on E. coli K12  lacking the transcription factor Fur using an affinity purified anti-Fur antibody to identify areas of enrichment (false positives) under anaerobic growth conditions. Custom anti-Fur antibodies were purified over a His6-Fur bound HiTrap NHS-activated HP column (GE Healthcare) as previously described (PMID: 21478858). Western blot analyses showed that the purified antibody was specific for Fur.
