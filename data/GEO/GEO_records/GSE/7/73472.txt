TITLE
In vivo characterization of Linc-p21 reveals functional cis-regulatory DNA elements

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have sequenced wildtype and mutant heart, liver, lung, and hindlimb from E14.5 embryos of the mutant lncRNA strain Trp53cor1tm1.1Vlcg (lincp21), and performed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in mouse myoblast cells (C2C12).

DESIGN
Comparison between wildtype and mutant organ transcriptomes in the Trp53cor1tm1.1Vlcg strain. Additionally, we include a comparison between MPRA signal vector tag distributions and C2C12 tag distributions.
