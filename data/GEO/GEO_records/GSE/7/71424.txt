TITLE
Maternal Nurtritional Programming in the Ovine Mammary Gland

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
Developmental programming is the concept that environmental factors, particularly during foetal life, can alter development, metabolism and physiology of an organism and this can have consequences later in life. There is growing interest in developmental programming in livestock species, particularly effects of maternal pregnancy nutrition, which is easy to manipulate. Recent research, using a sheep model, has shown that milk production in ewe offspring may be susceptible to maternal nutritional programming, such that over nutrition (ad libitum) of the pregnant dam, compared with maintenance nutrition, may impair their first lactation performance and result in the weaning of lighter lambs. RNA-seq was performed to identify gene expression differences as a result of maternal nutrition in ewe offspring during their first parity.  Samples were collected in late pregnancy and during lactation, allowing us to examine gene expression changes during maturation of the ovine mammary gland.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were sequenced for each of the treatment conditions (maternal nutrition: sub-maintenance, maintenance, and ad libitum) and time points (late pregnancy and lactation).  Each biological replicate consisted of RNA from multiple individuals (late pregnancy n=3, lactation n=2).
