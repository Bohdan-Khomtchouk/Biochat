TITLE
cDNA microarray data after influenza A virus infection in mouse lung tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The defense mechanisms that are provided by the innate immune system are a formidable barrier to influenza virus and a special immune system exists at distinct respiratory epithelium to combat invasion by influenza virus. Innate immune mechanisms for antiviral resistance are mediated by an increase of interferonsâ€™ secretion and type I and III IFNs represent the prototypical resistance mechanism as they induce diverse of Interferon stimulated genes that serve as effectors to limit viral replication.

DESIGN
To evaluate the change of gene expressions after IAV infection, we performed gene expression analysis using the Illumina MouseWG-6 v2 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA)made by Affimetrix, which comprised of more than 770,000 unique 25-mer oligonucleotide features constituting more than 28,000 genes, and each gene is represented on the array by 45,281 probes. The data were processed using the robust multi-array analysis algorithm, which performs a background correction, a normalization step, and a probe-level summary.
