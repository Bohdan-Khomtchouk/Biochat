TITLE
Effect of 4-hydroxytamoxifen and Shld1 on mouse embryonic stem cells (RW4)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two induction systems, one based on the destablization domain (FKBP) and the other based on mutated ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor, require constant application of Shld1 and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) to cells respectively, so we sought to quantify the extent to which these chemical inducers affect transcriptional networks. RW4 mouse ES cells were treated with Shld1 and 4-OHT respectively for 2 days and then subjected to gene expression profiling by microarray. Cells mock-treated with 95% ethanol as vehicle were used as controls. For each condition, two biological replicates were performed .

DESIGN
RW4 ESCs were treated with 1 μM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, Sigma) for the ERT2 based induction system and 1μM Shld1 (Clontech) for FKBP based induction system, respectively.
