TITLE
Analysis of Gene Expression Under Nitrogen Fixing Conditions in Geobacter sulfurreducens

ORGANISM
Geobacter sulfurreducens

SUMMARY
In this study, expression analysis using electrochemically synthesized Combimatrix 12K DNA microarrays was validated in G sulfurreducens.  Growth under nitrogen fixing conditions and growth in ammonium amended medium, respectively, were the experimental and control conditions.  Expression analysis using this platform was also compared to expression analysis on whole cDNA microarrays. Keywords: two-condition comparison
