TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of orf19.5100/MLT1 ABC transporter  knockout in Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Recent reports have been suggested involvement of ABC transporters in various physiological roles.To get better insight about possible involvement of vacuolar ABC  transporter MLT1/orf19.5100 in different physiological roles transcriptional profiling have been peformed and compared between WT(SC5314) Candida albicans cells vs  putative orf19.5100 knockout cells after 6hrs growth of culture.The assay as peformed in biological duplicate sample.

DESIGN
