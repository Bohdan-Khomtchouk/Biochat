TITLE
Comparative analysis of gene expression in HAT4-nulls and HAT2-heterozygous knockout cells, versus wild type Leishmania donovani cells

ORGANISM
Leishmania donovani

SUMMARY
Histone acetylations are known to impact gene transcription. Here, we have attempted to examine the role of Leishmania donovani histone acetyltransferases HAT4 and HAT2 in regulating global gene expression. The transcriptome of HAT4-null promastigotes (Samples 2A, 2B) and HAT2-heterozygous knockout promastigotes (Samples 3A, 3B) have been compared with the transcriptome of wild-type Leishmania promastigotes (Samples 1A, 1B) and fold change in gene expression with respect to the control wild-type has been determined.

DESIGN
DNA microarray analysis was carried out with biological replicates, using RNA isolated from logarithmically growing promastigotes in two separate experiments. Bioanalyzer profiles of the isolated RNA samples were used to assess purity and integrity of the isolated RNA. Samples 1A and 1B: analyses carried out using RNA isolated from wild-type Leishmania donovani promastigotes. Samples 2A and 2B: analyses carried out using RNA isolated from HAT4-null promastigotes. Samples 3A and 3B: analyses carried out using RNA isolated from HAT2-heterozygous knockout promastigotes.
