TITLE
DNA methylome patterns of zebrafish cells under cold pressure

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In this study, MeDIP-seq and RNA-seq were performed to reveal a genome-wide methylation profile of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryonic fibroblast cell line (ZF4) and its variation under cold environment.This study puts a new insight into the genome-wide epigenetic regulation under cold environment.

DESIGN
ZF4 cells were cultured at 28 °C as control and at 18 °C for 5 days and 30 days, seperately. Each condition has three biological replica.
