TITLE
Gene expression profiling of human and murine in vitro muscle differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA sequencing of human and murine myoblasts and myotubes was extracted, depleted of ribosomal RNA and subjected to Illumina stranded paired end library prep and sequencing. Samples from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients-derived myoblasts were included  in this study

DESIGN
12 samples were analysed: murine C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes differentiated for 4 days, each in two biological replicates; human 9208 myoblasts and myotubes differentiated for 6 days, each in two biological replicates; human Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients derived myoblasts and myotubes differentiated for 10 days.
