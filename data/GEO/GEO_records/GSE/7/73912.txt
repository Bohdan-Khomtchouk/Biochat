TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of RNAs bound by DDX5 and RORgt in cultured T helper 17 cell [ChIRP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare RNAs bound by DDX5 and RORgt in cultured T helper 17 cell in wildtype background. Methods: Th17 mRNA profiles of 48hrs in vitro cultured T helper 17 cells from wild-type mice were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HighSeq. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and TopHat followed by CuffDiff. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results: Among the 3444 RefSeq non-coding RNAs and 46449 NONCODE non-coding RNAs, 2533 were found to be expressed in Th17 cells (FPKM > 1). 210 of them were enriched in DDX5 pull-down and 119 of them were enriched in RORgt pull-down. Conclusions: Our study suggest that a subset of 31 ncRNAs were co-enriched in DDX5 and RORgt pull-down.

DESIGN
DDX5 or RORgt-associated-RNA profiles of 48hr in vitro cultured Th17 from wild type (WT) mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HighSeq
