TITLE
Transcriptional profiling through RNA-seq of zebrafish larval liver after exposure to biliatresone, a biliary toxin.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We sequenced liver mRNA isolated from biliatresone-treated zebrafish larvae and DMSO-treated controls in order to elucidate the molecular pathways induced by biliatresone, a biliary toxin that is responsible for outbreaks of biliary atresia in Australian liverstock.

DESIGN
Liver mRNA profiles of biliatresone-treated zebrafish larvae and DMSO-treated controls were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicates.
