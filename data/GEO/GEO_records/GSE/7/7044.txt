TITLE
Profiling of Rgt1-regulated gene transcripts (37ยบ C) in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
C. albicans glucose sensing and signaling is important for full virulence in the mammalian host.  To better understand this phenomenon, we investigated the Hgt4 glucose-sensing pathway, focusing on the downstream transcriptional repressor CaRgt1.  CaRgt1-regulated gene transcripts were identified by comparing total RNA extracted from wild type and rgt1 mutant strains.  Cells were grown at 37 degrees C in the presence of glycerol, conditions under which CaRgt1 was expected to repress gene transcription. Keywords: cell type comparison
