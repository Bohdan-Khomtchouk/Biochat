TITLE
Effect of levetiracetam on gene expression in Drosophila head

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We recently developed a fly model of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced long-term behavioral plasticity. Pharmacological validation suggests this model to be kindling-like. Hence, our model is of relevance in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of epileptogenesis as well as in screening potential antiepileptogenic agents. Levetiracetam (LEV) is considered to have antiepileptogenic activity. Our fly model also predicted similar activity in LEV. Since the mechanism of action of LEV is not clearly known, we have examined the gene expression profiles of fly heads secondary to three days long chronic LEV treatment in Drosophila. Our results provide novel insights in to the drugâ€™s mode of action. Keywords: Drug Response
