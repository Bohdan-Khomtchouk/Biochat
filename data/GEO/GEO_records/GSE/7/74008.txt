TITLE
Alcohol-free fermented berry beverage phenolics attenuate diet-induced obesity and blood glucose in C57BL/6J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objectives of this study were to understand the effect of phenolic compounds from fermented berry beverages on hyperglycemia and obesity in vivo using mice fed a high fat diet. Our hypothesis was that consumption of a fermented blueberry-blackberry beverage and its phenolic compounds would reduce the development of obesity and hyperglycemia in diet-induced obese mice. Body composition, histomorphological analysis of pancreatic islets and liver, and expression of genes involved in obesity and hyperglycemia were evaluated in order to explain the modulation of diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia due to treatments.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from frozen pancreatic tissue of mice after 12 weeks of high-fat diet, 5 groups treated with sitagliptin, alcohol-free berry beverage (AFFB), 0.1X phenolic extract, 1X phenolic extract and 3X phenolic extract respectively, were compared to the control (water). Four replicates were included for each one of the treatments.
