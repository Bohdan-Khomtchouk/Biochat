TITLE
Gene Regulation by HDAC7 in Thymic Selection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) is highly expressed in CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes and functions as a signal-dependent repressor of gene transcription during T cell development. In this study, we express HDAC7 mutant proteins in a T cell line and use DNA microarrays to identify transcriptional targets of HDAC7 in T cells. Gene expression changes are compared to differential gene expression profiles associated with positive and negative thymic selection.  This analysis reveals that HDAC7 regulates an extensive set of genes that are differentially expressed during both positive and negative thymic selection. Many of these genes play important functional roles in positive and negative selection, primarily via coupling between antigen receptor and downstream signaling events. Keywords: microarray gene expression profiling, comparison of perturbation of HDAC7 gene function with differential expression during thymic selection
