TITLE
Methylomes and Transcriptomes of Human Pluripotent-to-Cardiomyocyte Differentiation [MBD-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this report, Tompkins et al describe the derivation, differentiation stage-specific purification, and genome-wide analysis of cardiomyocytes derived from hESCs. Key features of the molecular programs that define human cardiac muscle cell differentiation were described and researchers observed that cells may harbor epigenetic DNA methylation “memories” that reflect the gene activation history of important developmental genes.

DESIGN
For MBD-seq Cardiomyocyte differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (H7). 4 time point series. D3 and D4 samples FACS sorted for primitive and cardiac mesoderm isolation, respectively. Cardiomyocytes were percoll density purified (cTnT > 90%)
