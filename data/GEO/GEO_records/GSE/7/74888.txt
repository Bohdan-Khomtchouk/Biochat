TITLE
Effect of deletion of liver Mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) on energy metabolism in high fat diet fed mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of the livers from Mfn1 WT and Mfn1 LKO mice fed with high fat diet. We hypothesised that deletion of Mfn1 will lead reduced mitochondrial fusion thus leading to an increase in the number of smaller but higher functional mitochondria and increase in mitochondrial proteins.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated livers from a six hours fasted Mfn1 WT or Mfn1 LKO mice.
