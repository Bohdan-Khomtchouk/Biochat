TITLE
Expression data from UMUC3 cells transduced with non-targeted shRNA and shRNA specific to AGL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Loss of Amylo-alpha-1-6-glucosidase-4-alpha-glucanotransferase (AGL) drives bladder cancer growth. Low AGL expression predicts poor patient outcome. Currently no specific therapeutically tractable targets/pathways exist that could be used to treat patients with low AGL expressing bladder tumors. To address this issue we carried out a transcriptome analysis in human bladder cancer cells with and without AGL expression to identify pro-tumorigenic pathways upregulated with AGL loss. We identified and validated that hyaluronic acid (HA) synthase 2 (HAS2) expression and subsequent HA synthesis is upregulated with AGL loss. We validated that HAS2 and consequent HA synthesis drive tumor growth and that genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of these respectively is a viable therapeutic option in xenograft models. We further established that bladder cancer patients with low AGL expression and high HAS2 expression have poor outcome. Together, this data provide preclinical evidence for personalized targeting of HAS2/HA signaling in patients with low AGL expressing tumors.

DESIGN
AGL knockdown in UMUC3 was achieved using shRNA TRCN0000035082 (Sigma-Aldrich). MISSIONÂ® pLKO.1-puro non-mammalian shRNA control plasmid DNA (SHC002, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as control. Each condition had two biological replicates.
