TITLE
Next-generation sequencing for the fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) binding mRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study are to investigate the mRNAs that bind to the FTO protein in the white fat tissue from mice. Methods: 1. White fat from CAG promoter driven transgenic Flag-tagged FTO mice were extracted with RNA protected. 2. Flag-FTO proteins were immunoprecipitated with control IP using IgG. 3. The immunoprecipitated RNAs were deep sequenced and analyzed. Results: We focused on the mRNAs which have functions related to lipid metabolism and homeostasis.

DESIGN
Immunoprecipitated RNAs profiles from Flag-FTO IP and IgG IP were generated by deep sequencing.
