TITLE
Analysis of melanosomal, exosomal and cellular miRNAs of melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA microarray profiling was performed for exosomes and secreted melanosomes of MNT-1 cells as well as WM3682 and WM3314 cells and melanosomes isolated from cell homogenates. The aim of this study is to compare the miRNA content of exosomes and secreted melanosomes and to assess differences in the miRNA profiles of different melanoma cell lines and their melanosomes.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from MNT-1 exosomes and secreted melanosomes (2 replicates each) that were isolated from the conditioned medium of MNT-1 melanoma cells by differential ultracentrifugation. In addition, total RNA was isolated from WM3682 and WM3314 melanoma cells and melanosomes (1 replicate each). These latter melanosomes  were isolated from cell homogenates by filtration through a 0.45 Âµm filter, followed by FACS sorting.
