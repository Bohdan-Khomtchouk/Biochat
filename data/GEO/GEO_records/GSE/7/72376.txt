TITLE
Response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from  15 healthy donor and 15 patients with type 1 diabetes to type 1 diabetogenic protein (GAD65, IGRP, PPI, ZnT8) and influenza virus M derived peptide stimulation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD4 T cell responses are characterized based on a limited number of molecular markers selected from exisiting knowledge. The goal of the experiment was to assess antigenic-peptide specific T-cell responses in vitro without bias using microarrays.

DESIGN
PBMCs were isolated from 15 healthy donors and 15 patients with type 1 diabetes. The cells were stimulated with peptides derived from type 1 diabetogenic protein (GAD65, IGRP, PPI, ZnT8) and influenza virus M for 24 hours. Unstimulated cells were cultured without the peptides for 24 hours.
