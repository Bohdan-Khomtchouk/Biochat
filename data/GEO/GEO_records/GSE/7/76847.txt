TITLE
Expression data from mouse intestinal organoids I

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
APC inactivation is the early process in the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer. We established organoid cultures from intestines of genetically modifeid mice harboring Apcfl/fl and R26CreERT2 allele We used microarrays to determine the alterations in intestinal stem cells in response to APC inactivation.

DESIGN
Organoids were treated with 4OHT to induce recombination of APC or left untreated, and collected at 4 or 6 days after treatment. RNA were extracted and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
