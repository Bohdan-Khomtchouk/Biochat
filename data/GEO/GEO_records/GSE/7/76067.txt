TITLE
Gene expression alterations in SoxC knockdown sea urchin embryos

ORGANISM
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus

SUMMARY
Transcription factor SoxC is required for all neural development in purple sea urchin S. purpuratus embryos. To begin to develop a gene regulatory network for neural development, we used RNA-Seq to compare transcript populations in SoxC knockdown and control embryos.

DESIGN
SoxC function was knocked down by morpholino oligo injection. RNA from about 1000 embryos were collected for both control and knockdown samples.
