TITLE
Expression data from colorectal cancer and liver metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the driver factors in liver metastasis of colorectal cancer, and seek for possible biomarkers, we applied array trascriptome detection using approaches tailored to FFPE derived RNA Integrated analysis identified metastasis related genes with potentially high clinical significance.

DESIGN
We used matched primary cancer tissue, liver metastasis samples from same patient and primary control with no liver metastasis in order to compare their genomic and transcriptomic profile.
