TITLE
Human Toxome Project, E2 and PPT induction of MCF-7 cells (NC series)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The central goal of the project is to define, experimentally verify, and systematically annotate pathways of endocrine disruption, as a proof of concept of mapping pathways of toxicity by systems toxicology. Microarray gene expression profiling is one of several -omics approaches used.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in MCF-7 cells after exposure to doses of 0.01 nM, 0.1 nM or 1nM estradiol (E2), 5 nM propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) or vehicle control for 4 or 8 hours. The experiment was repeated at two different institutions, Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and Brown University (BU), where three biological replicates were produced for each condition.
