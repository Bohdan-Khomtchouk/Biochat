TITLE
Characterization of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm-released cells (BRC) transcriptome upon interaction with whole human blood and its cellular and soluble components

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus epidermidis

SUMMARY
The release of cells from S. epidermidis biofilms formed on medical devices has been associated with the onset of bloodstream infections resulting in increased morbidity and mortality among infected patients. In order to better understand the role of BRC in the pathogenesis of S. epidermidis biofilm-related infections, the transcriptome of these cells was evaluated upon exposure to human blood components. The major alterations observed were involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids and import and export of substances through ABC transporters. In addition, the transcription of genes involved in biotin metabolism was found significantly up-regulated suggesting this pathway as a possible target for future therapeutic strategies.

DESIGN
S. epidermidis BRC transcriptomic profile before and after 2 hours of interaction with whole human blood, PMN or MN cells, plasma and TSB
