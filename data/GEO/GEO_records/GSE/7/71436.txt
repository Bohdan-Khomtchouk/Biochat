TITLE
Gene expression profiling of prostate infiltrating hematopoietic cells in TRAMP mice subjected to immunotherapy

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goal of the analysis was to identify the mechansisms accounting fo the synergy of T cells redirected to the tumor associated large T antigen and T cells redirected to the Uty minor histocompatibility antigen

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling on CD45+ cells isolated from the prostate of mice treated with Allo/Y, Tumor or Tumor+Allo/Y ACT at one week after T cell transfer, the time of acute prostate infiltration. Samples recovered from mice treated with the combined Tumor+Allo/Y ACT and sacrificed after 28 days were also included in the experimental design to take into account changes occurring over time. Three mice per group were used.
