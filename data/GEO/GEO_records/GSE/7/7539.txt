TITLE
A PhoP point mutation discriminates between the virulent H37Rv and avirulent H37Ra strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
To uncover mutations underlying the attentuation of H37Ra, we embarked on sequencing its genome using a novel massive parallel pyrosequencing technology. Comparison with the virulent H37Rv parental strain revealed only few polymorphisms, one of which was located in the DNA binding domain of the transcriptional regulator PhoP. Keywords: Expresion profiling
