TITLE
How C/EBPa creates an elite cell state for reprogramming to pluripotency [4C]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse Bcell, upon ectopic expression of the transcription factor Cebpa for 18h, can be reprogrammed to iPS with extremely high efficiency. To understand the molecular control of this phenomena we performed multiple high throughtput functionnal genomic analysis.

DESIGN
Circularized chromosome conformation capture assay (4C) taking as view point Klf4 promoter and a putative enhancer situated a -100kb upstream
