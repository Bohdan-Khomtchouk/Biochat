TITLE
Differential RNA-seq analysis comparing APC-defective and APC-restored SW480 colorectal cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identify genes that are differentially regulated as a consequence of restoration of full-length functional APC in a colorectal cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
Examine mRNA expression level changes between SW480 (APC defective) and SW480+APC (SW480 cells with restored functional APC) cells, whilst accounting for any non-specific expression changes by comparison to SW480+control vector.
