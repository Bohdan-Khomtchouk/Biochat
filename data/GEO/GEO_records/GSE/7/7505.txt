Microarray profiles of radiation response in the NCI60 cell lines

SUMMARY
The 60 cell lines of the NCI Anti-Cancer Drug Screen (NCI60) constitute the most extensively characterized in vitro cancer cell model, and have been tested for sensitivity to over 100,000 potential chemotherapy agents.  We have used the NCI60 cell lines and three additional lymphoblast lines to develop a database of responses of cancer cells to ionizing radiation.  We compared clonogenic survival, apoptosis induction, and gene expression response by microarray analysis.  While several studies have measured relative basal gene expression in the NCI60, this is the first comparison of large-scale gene expression changes in response to genotoxic stress.  We found genes differentially regulated in cells with low survival after 2 or 8 Gy γ-rays.  In contrast to reported basal gene expression patterns, little tissue-of-origin effect was detected in the radiation response pattern of gene expression, with the exception of lymphoblastoid cell lines.  The most striking patterns in the radiation data were a set of genes upregulated preferentially in the p53 wild-type lines, and a set of cell-cycle regulatory genes strongly down-regulated across the entire NCI60 panel.  The response of these genes to γ-rays appears to be unaffected by the myriad of genetic differences across this very diverse cell set, and represents the most universal gene expression response to ionizing radiation yet observed.
