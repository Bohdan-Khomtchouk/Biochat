TITLE
Ikaros-induced gene expression chages upon Ikaros re-expression in the ILC87 Ikaros-deficient tumor cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to analyze gene expression changes in the Ikaros null ILC87 T cell tumor line after re-expression of Ikaros.

DESIGN
ILC87 cells were transduced to stably express the 4-hydroxytamoxifen-inducible (4OHT) Ikaros1-ER fusion protein. ILC87-Ik1-ER cells were treated with mock (EtOH) or 4OHT for 1 day and the global gene expression changes were assessed by microarray analysis.
