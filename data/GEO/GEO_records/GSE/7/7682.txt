TITLE
Gene expression in Su(Hw) null larvae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We examined the effects of loss of su(Hw) on gene expression in both carefully staged 3rd instar larvae (selected at the soft white pre-pupae stage) and wing imaginal discs from these animals.  su(Hw) null animals were generated by crossing su(Hw)v mutants with a deficiency (Df(3R)ED5644), homozygous individuals were recognised be the lack of the dominat Tb marker carried on the TM6B marker. Keywords: ChIP-chip
