TITLE
RNA-seq  analysis of Bacteroides xylanisolvens XB1AT grown on pectin or xylan

ORGANISM
Bacteroides xylanisolvens

SUMMARY
Dietary fiber degradation is a key function of the human gut microbiota.  The aim of this study was to increase our knowledge on the degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharide degradation by a prominent human gut bacterial species, Bacteroides xylanisolvens. The transcriptome analysis of B. xylanisolvens XB1AT revealed the existence of six and two genomic loci dedicated to the degradation of pectins and xylan, respectively. These loci or PUL ( " Polysaccharide Utilization Loci " ) are known to encode enzyme systems in Bacteroides that are specific to a particular polysaccharide.

DESIGN
Simple two-way comparisons between pectin or xylan sources (treatment) and glucose or xylose (control), collected during mid- and late-log phase.  Three replicates per condition.
