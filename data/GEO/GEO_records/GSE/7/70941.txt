TITLE
Comparison of immune cells between mice strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A number of macrophage and macrophage-like cells are responsible for immune response to challenges. Despite their shared role, these immune cells differ in the inflammatory response and impact on physiology and behavior.  The purpose of this study was to  profile mRNA levels (transcriptome) to better understand differences between immune cells under homeostasis using two mouse strains.

DESIGN
total RNA samples were obtained from 12 mice per strain and immune cell type and were subjected to paired-end RNA sequencing
