TITLE
Enhancer and transcriptomic changes in skeletal muscles in response to physical exercise

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We address the transcriptomic changes in skeletal muscle after bouts of exercise

DESIGN
We performed RNA-seq and GRO-seq in mouse after treadmill running in both WT and HDAC3-depleted skeletal muscles.
