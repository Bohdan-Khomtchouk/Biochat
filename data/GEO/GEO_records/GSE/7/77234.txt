TITLE
Transcriptome comparison of LUBEL catalytic dead mutants to their parental line

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Effect of LUBEL catalytic dead mutation in immune response

DESIGN
Mutation was introduced in the LUBEL catalytic region by CRISPR/Cas9 techonology in Drosophila melanogaster and their transcriptome was compared in control (sample 23930 to 23941) and e.coli pricked samples (sample 28984 to 28995).
