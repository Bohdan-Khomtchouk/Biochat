TITLE
ChIP-seq of circadian transcription factors in MLL-AF9 leukemia cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq of two core circadian TFs which were found to be important in leukemia proliferation, in order to identify potential target genes regulated by the circadian rhythm.

DESIGN
Here, we performed ChIP-seq for the core circadian transcription factors CLOCK and ARNTL (BMAL1) in NOMO-1 and THP-1 cells.
