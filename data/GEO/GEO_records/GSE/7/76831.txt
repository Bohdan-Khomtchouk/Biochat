TITLE
Functional neurons generated from T cell-derived iPSCs for neurological disease modeling [MBD-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we determine the genomic methylation profile by MBD-seq of T cell derived iPSCs and aHDF derived iPSCs.

DESIGN
T cell derived iPSCs and aHDF derived iPSCs subjected to MBD-seq analysis.
