TITLE
ChIP-Seq analysis of Helios and histone modifications in CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The maintenance of immune homeostasis requires regulatory T cells (Tregs). Given their intrinsic self-reactivity, Tregs must stably maintain a suppressive phenotype to avoid autoimmunity. We report that impaired expression of the transcription factor (TF) Helios by FoxP3+ CD4 and Qa-1-restricted CD8 Tregs results in defective regulatory activity and autoimmunity in mice. Helios-deficient Treg develop an unstable phenotype during inflammatory responses characterized by reduced FoxP3 expression and increased effector cytokine expression secondary to diminished activation of the STAT5 pathway. CD8 Treg also require Helios-dependent STAT5 activation for survival and to prevent terminal T cell differentiation. Definition of Helios as a key transcription factor that stabilizes regulatory T-cells in the face of inflammatory responses provides a genetic explanation for a core property of regulatory T-cells.

DESIGN
This is an examination of the transcription factor Helios with 2 different histone modifications in both CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs.  Appropriate control sequence files for ChIP input are also included.
