TITLE
Angiogenesis study of Gd@C82(OH)22 nanoparticle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
we report a novel nanomedicine (Gd@C82(OH)22 ) effectively inhibit  human breast tumor growth by antiangiogenesis in vivo. To further identify which angiogenic factor(s) were affected on mRNA level, the " RT² Profiler™ PCR Array Mouse Angiogenesis (APMM-024, SuperArray Bioscience Corporation) " was used. Keywords: nanomedicine, Gd@C82(OH)22, angiogenesis, MCF-7, breast cancer
