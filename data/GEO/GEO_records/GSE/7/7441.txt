Transcriptional profile of primary astrocytes expressing ALS-linked mutant SOD1.

SUMMARY
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is caused by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons. Mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are found in about 20% of patients with familial ALS. Mutant SOD1 causes motor neuron death through an acquired toxic property. Although, molecular mechanism underlying this toxic gain-of-function remains unknown, evidence support the role of mutant SOD1 expression in non-neuronal cells in shaping motor neuron degeneration. We have previously found that in contrast to non-transgenic, SOD1G93A-expressing astrocytes induced apoptosis of co-cultured motor neurons. This prompted us to investigate whether the effect on motor neuron survival was related to a change in the gene expression profile. Through high-density oligonucletide microarrays we found changes in the expression of genes involved in transcription, signaling, cell proliferation, extracellular matrix construction, response to stress and steroid and lipid metabolism. Decorin, a small multifunctional proteoglycan, was the most up-regulated gene. Down-regulated genes included the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and the RNA binding protein ROD1. We also analyzed the expression of selected genes in purified motor neurons expressing SOD1G93A and in spinal cord of asymptomatic and early symptomatic ALS-rodent model. The expression of mutated SOD1 in astrocytes cause gene expression changes with potential consequences for its interaction with motor neurons. The astrocyte-specific gene expression profile contributes to the identification of possible candidates for cell type-specific therapies in ALS Keywords: Cell type comparison
