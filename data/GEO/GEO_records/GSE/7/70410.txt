TITLE
Deletion of hyaluronan synthase 3 inhibits neointimal hyperplasia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Gene Expression Microarrays were used to analyze differentially expressed genes after carotid artery ligation. The aim of this experiment was to detect genes regulated in Has3 deficient as compared to wildtype controls that might be involved in neointimal hyperplasia.

DESIGN
Neointimal hyperplasia was induced in female Has3 deficient mice and wildtype controls by ligation of the left common carotid artery. Carotid transcriptome was analyzed 5 days after surgery in ligated and non-ligated carotid arteries.
