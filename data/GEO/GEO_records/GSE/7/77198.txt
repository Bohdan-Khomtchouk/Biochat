TITLE
mRNA-seq of nuclear RNA extracted from T4 and T5 neurons of D. melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
T4 and T5 neurons are components of the neuronal circuit for motion vision in flies. To identify genes involved in neuronal computation of T4 and T5 neurons, we perfomed transcriptome analysis. Nuclei of T4 and T5 neurons were immunoprecipitated, total RNA was harvested and used for mRNA-seq with Illumina technology. In two biological replicates, we mapped 154 and 119 million reads to D. melanogaster genome. mRNA-seq provided information about expression levels of 17,468 annotated transcripts in the T4 and T5 neurons.

DESIGN
Cell type â€“ specific transcriptome analysis of the RNA isolated from immunoprecipitated nuclei, performed in two biological replicates
