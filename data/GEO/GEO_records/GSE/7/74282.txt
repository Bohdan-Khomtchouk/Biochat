TITLE
Deletion of nuoG in recombinant BCG vaccine against TB

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The current tuberculosis vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), provides insufficient protection. We deleted the NADH dehydrogenase 1 subunit G (nuoG) gene from BCG ΔureC::hly, the most advanced live vaccine candidate in clinical development. Removal of nuoG enhanced co-localisation of LC3 to bacteria in human host cells. BCG ΔureC::hly ΔnuoG vaccination was safer than BCG and improved efficacy of BCG ΔureC::hly by reducing tuberculosis load in murine lungs 1000-fold.

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed as single-color hybridizations on Agilent SurePrint G3 catalog whole genome mouse 8x60K microarrays (Agilent-028005) according to supplier's recommendations. In total 48 samples were analyzed. Uninfected and M.bovis BCG SSI samples were used as control and reference samples.
