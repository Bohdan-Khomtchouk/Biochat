TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Ccng1-/-Ccng2-/- double knockout (DKO) deficientÂ mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine if lack of CycG1 and/or CycG2 causes genome-wide alterations of gene expression, we performed DNA microarray analysis on G1KO, G2KO and DKO MEFs at their logarithmic growth phase. Notably, the fold change values are much larger in DKO MEFs compared with those of G1KO or G2KO MEFs, which suggested that loss of both CycG1 and CycG2 caused uncontrolled expression of these genes because they are mutually regulated by CycG1 and CycG2. Moreover, the fold change of up- or down-regulated genes in DKO MEF are much larger than those of G1KO or G2KO MEFs, suggesting that functions of CycG1 and CycG2 somehow overlap and complement each other in G1KO and G2KO MEFs.

DESIGN
Microarray analyses were performed as single-color experiments regarding among WT, G2KO and DKO MEFs.
