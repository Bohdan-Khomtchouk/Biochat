TITLE
Gene expression patterns  from mice hearts with myocardial infarction pretreated with miR-433 inhibition or not

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was to identify the role of miR-433 and to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms in cardiac remodeling post myocardial infarction.

DESIGN
To determine if inhibition of miR-433 is sufficient to prevent cardiac fibrosis in vivo, mice were injected via tail vein with 80 mg/kg miR-433 antagomir or the scramble control for 3 consecutive days and subjected to left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation.Twenty-one days post myocardial infarction, gene arrays were conducted to compare the difference of gene expressions between miR-433 antagomir (n=3) or scrambled negative control (n=3) post myocardial infarction.
