Expression data from glucosamine-treated human synovial MH7A cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the major joint diseases. Glucosamine (GlcN) is widely used as a dietary supplement for OA. However, its precise mechanisms are not well understood. GlcN is utilized for the O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification of proteins, which participates in the regulation of cellular functions. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the effect of GlcN and alloxan (O-GlcNAc transferase inhibitor, which prevented O-GlcNAc modification) on the gene expression using DNA microarray. GlcN downregulated or upregulated genes. Furthermore, among the GlcN-downregulated or upregulated genes, the expression of 62.7% of the genes was restored by alloxan.. Thus, it is suggested that GlcN regulates the gene expression by an O-GlcNAc modification-dependent or -independent mechanism.

DESIGN
Human synovial MH7A cells in 6-well plates were incubated in the presence or absence of GlcN (5mM), and then stimulated with 15 pg/ml IL-1β for 13h. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with 5 mM alloxan, and then incubated with 2 mM alloxan and 5mM GlcN, followed by stimulation with IL-1β. We prepared 5 kinds of cell samples. 1; Non-treated cells. 2; IL-1β-stimulated cells. 3; GlcN-treated  IL-1β-stimulated cells. 4; GlcN and alloxan-treated  IL-1β-stimulated cells. 5;  alloxan-treated  IL-1β-stimulated cells. All expreriments were repeated three times.
