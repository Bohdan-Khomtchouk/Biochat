TITLE
Validation of THS-seq method, and comparison of published ENCODE DNase-seq data, self-generated ATAC-seq data and published ATAC-seq data, and THS-seq data for quantitation of chromatin accessibility.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromatin accessibility captures the binding status of protein factors to chromosomes in vivo, and has been considered a highly informative proxy for functional protein-DNA interactions. Existing DNase I and Tn5 transposase based assays generally require tens of thousands to millions of fresh cells. Applying Tn5 tagmentation to single cells yields very sparse maps. Here we present a transposome hypersensitive sites sequencing assay (THS-seq) for highly sensitive characterizations of chromatin accessibility.
