TITLE
Expression data from C57BL/6 mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Given the dearth of new antibiotics, host-directed therapies (HDTs) are especially desirable. Since IFN-gamma (IFNγ) plays a central role in host resistance to intracellular bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we searched for small molecules to augment the IFNγ response in macrophages. Using a novel screen we identified a compound belonging to the rocaglate family(CMLD009433) that synergize with a sub-threshold concentration of IFNγ to enhance macrophage activation. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression mediated by the rocaglate CMLD009433(C9433) and identified upregulation of several important regulatory genes important for host defense.

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived macrophages from C57BL/6 mouse treated with 0.2U/ml IFNγ in presence and absence of of CMLD009433(C9433) were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
