TITLE
Adaptation of Propionibacterium freudenreichii to long-term survival under gradual nutritional shortage

ORGANISM
Propionibacterium freudenreichii

SUMMARY
Propionibacterium freudenreichii CIRM-BIA138 was grown for 11 days in YEL medium at 30Â°C without any addition of nutrients. RNA was extracted  from bacteria harvested 24 H post-inoculation (exponential phase) and 72 H post-inoculation and was depleted from  ribosmic sequences. RNA samples were sequenced on Hiseq 2000 generating single reads of 50 bp.

DESIGN
Comparison of genes expressed in stationary growth phase (biological triplicate) in a context of nutritional shortage with those expressed in exponential growth phase (biological triplicate).
