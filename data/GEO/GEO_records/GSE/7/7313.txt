TITLE
Expression data from non-infected and Salmonella Typhimurium infected mesenteric lymph nodes

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
A first generation Affymetrix GeneChip® Porcine genome array was used to profile the gene expression in porcine mesenteric lymph nodes over a time course of infection with S. Typhimurium, including the acute (8 hours post inoculation (hpi), 24 hpi, 48 hpi) and chronic (21 days post-inoculation (dpi)) stages of infection. Our objectives were to 1) identify and examine the stereotypical gene expression response within host MLN to S. Typhimurium infection, 2) characterize global host responses by revealing the specific features of the host’s innate immunity pathways, and 3) explore if and how S. Typhimurium may escape the host immune response and develop into a carrier state. Our study has attempted to investigate the features of host gene expression profiling during S. Typhimurium infection at the acute and chronic infection stages and to explore the mechanism by which S. Typhimurium can escape from the host immune response and develop a carrier state in the host. In conclusion, by using the Affymetrix porcine GeneChip, 848 differentially expressed genes were identified in porcine MLN during infection and several specific features of host response were revealed by gene cluster and pathway analysis. Our data are the first report to investigate global host responses to S. Typhimurium in porcine MLN, and this new study provides data applicable for studying enteric salmonellosis of pigs, as well as humans. Keywords: time course
