TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of control and podoplanin knockdown lymphatic endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the transcriptome changes after podoplanin was knocked down in human lymphatic endothelial cells

DESIGN
Human lymphatic endothelial cells were transfected with control siRNA and podoplanin siRNA (N=2 for each group). After 48 hours, total RNA was isolated and processed for RNA-seq.
