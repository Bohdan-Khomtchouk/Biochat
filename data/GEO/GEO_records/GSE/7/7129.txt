TITLE
Xenopus cDNA microarray identification of genes with endodermal organ expression

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
The endoderm is classically defined as the innermost layer of three Metazoan germ layers. During organogenesis, the endoderm gives rise to the digestive and respiratory tracts as well as associated organs such as the liver, pancreas, and lung. At present, however, how the endoderm forms the variety of cell types of digestive and respiratory tracts as well as the budding organs is not well understood. In order to investigate the molecular basis and mechanism of organogenesis and to identify the endodermal organ-related marker genes, we carried out microarray analysis using Xenopus cDNA chips. To achieve this goal, we isolated the Xenopus gut endoderm from three different stages of Xenopus organogenesis, and separated each stage of gut endoderm into anterior and posterior region. Competitive hybridization of cDNA between the anterior and posterior endoderm regions, to screen genes that specifically expressed in the major anterior organs, revealed 891 candidates. We then selected 104 clones for in situ hybridization analysis. Here, we report the identification and expression patterns of the 104 Xenopus endodermal genes, which would serve as useful markers for studying endodermal organ development.
