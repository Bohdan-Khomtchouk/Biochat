TITLE
Effect of sodium valproate on gene expression in Drosophila head

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We recently developed a fly model of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced long-term behavioral plasticity. Pharmacological validation suggests this model to be kindling-like. Hence, our model is of relevance in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of epileptogenesis as well as in screening potential antiepileptogenic agents. Sodium valproate (NaVP) is an antiepileptic drug, and in the process of developing our fly model we generated gene expression profile of flies’ head secondary to treatment of the insects with NaVP. Our results provide novel insights in to the drug’s mode of action. Keywords: Dose response
