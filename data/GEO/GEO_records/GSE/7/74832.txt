TITLE
Analysis of Fusarium verticillioides gene expression in response to 2-benzoxazolinone (BOA)

ORGANISM
Fusarium verticillioides

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in F. verticillioides FRC M-3125 when exposed to 50 ug/ml 2-benzoxazolinone (BOA).  Cultures were harvested two hours after exposure.  Assessed in reference to control cultures of M-3125 exposed to ethanol (1% final concentration) since BOA was dissolved in ethanol.

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate control cultures of F. verticillioides FRC M-3125 in PDB containing 1% ethanol and two separate experimental cultures of M-3125 grown in PDB plus the added treatment of 50 ug/ml ethanolic BOA.  The cultures were incubated for two hours on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at 27C in the dark and then harvested by vacuum filtration and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The chips were a F. verticillioides custom 14K array based on platform GPL14669.
