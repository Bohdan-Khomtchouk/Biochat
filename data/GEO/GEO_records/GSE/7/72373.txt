TITLE
Response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with allergy to cat and silver birch wood derived antigenic peptide stimulation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD4 T cell responses are characterized based on a limited number of molecular markers selected from exisiting knowledge. The goal of the experiment was to assess antigenic-peptide specific T-cell responses in vitro without bias using microarrays.

DESIGN
PBMCs were isolated from 2 donors with allergy. The cells were stimulated with antigenic peptides derived from silver birch wood and cat for 24 hours. Unstimulated cells were cultured without the peptides for 24 hours.
