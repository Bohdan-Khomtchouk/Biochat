TITLE
Profiling of RWPE cells stably over-expressing ETV1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RWPE benign prostatic epithelial cells were infected with a lentivirus expressing ETV1 or GUS (control), and stable clones were isolated by puromycin selection. ETV1 over-expression, recapitulating ETS gene rearrangements observed in vivo, confers invasiveness in the benign prostate cell line RWPE. Keywords: genetic modification
