TITLE
Expression data from primary myoblasts with active Beta-catenin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regeneration of the adult skeletal muscle tissue relies on a population of muscle stem cells called satellite cells. During tissue repair, satellite cells exhibit active canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. To identify genes that become transcribed following activation of the Wnt/Î²-Catenin pathway in satellite cells, we performed microarray analysis of primary myoblasts expressing an active form of beta-catenin

DESIGN
Primary myoblasts were prepared from the limb muscles of Pax7-CreERT2*Beta-cetenin-Exon3-loxP/+ mice. Conditional activation of the beta-catenin gene was validated by genotyping PCR and Western Blotting. RNA was extracted from three independent cultures for each conditions.
