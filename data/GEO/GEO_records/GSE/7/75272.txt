TITLE
The role of Hoxa9 and Meis1 in development of acute myeloid leukemia (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
OBJECTIVE: MEIS1, a HOX cofactor, collaborates with multiple HOX proteins, such as HOXA9, to accelerate the onset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through largely unknown molecular mechanisms. To further resolve these mechanisms, we conducted a structure-function analysis of Meis1 and gene expression profiling, in the context of Hoxa9 leukemogenesis. RESULTS: We show, in a murine bone marrow transplantation model, that the homeodomain of Meis1 is required for leukemogenic collaboration with Hoxa9. Gene expression profiling of a Hoxa9 preleukemic cell line transduced with wild-type or Meis1 homeodomain mutant reveal deregulation of multiple genes including a set not previously implicated as Meis1 targets.

DESIGN
Murine bone marrow cells transduced with Hoxa9-GFP + empty MIY vector were compared to Hoxa9+Meis1 cells or Hoxa9+Meis1 with deleted homeodomain (DHD) cells and cultured for three or four weeks before harvest for miRNA expression array. Four independent experiments were performed for each of the three different conditions included in the study. Cells from all samples were also transplanted into lethally irradiated mice to test for their transforming and leukemic potential.
