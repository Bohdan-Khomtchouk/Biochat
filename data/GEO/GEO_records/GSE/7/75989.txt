TITLE
Targeted Pten deletion plus p53-R270H mutation in mouse mammary epithelium induces aggressive claudin-low and basal-like breast cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
WAP-Cre:Ptenf/f:p53lox.stop.lox_R270H composite mice were generated by genetic crossing. In these mice, Pten is deleted and a R270H p53 mutation in the DNA binding domain is induced upon expression of Cre recombinase in pregnancy-identified alveolar progenitors. Tumors were characterized by histology, marker analysis, various bioinformatics methods, high-throughput (HTP) FDA-drug screen as well as orthotopic injection to quantify tumor initiating cells (TICs) and tail-vein injection to identify lung-metastasis. Expression data comparing 2 types of Pten-deficient tumors (spindle and poorly differentiated) with other modles of mouse mammary tumors

DESIGN
2 types of  Pten deletion plus p53-R270H mutation tumors (spindle and poorly differentiated) was compared with MMTV-Neu, Spindle Pten-p53-deficient tumors, and wild-type mammary gland cells.
