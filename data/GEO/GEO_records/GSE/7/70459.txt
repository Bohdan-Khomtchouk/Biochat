TITLE
Expression data from post-natal rat Achilles tendons

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have compared the gene expression profile of post-natal 1 day and 7 day rat Achilles tendons.

DESIGN
Post-natal 1 day and 7 day rat Achilles tendons were collected. Each sample contains at least two individuals. Total RNA was extracted and fragmented biotin-tagged cRNA was hybridized to Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array.
