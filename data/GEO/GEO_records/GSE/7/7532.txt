TITLE
Differentially expressed genes under different stress conditions in rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Rice is one of important crop and, the genome has been already completely sequenced. Moreover we collected more than 30K rice FL-cDNA clones as transcriptome resources. However, the cDNA collection did not reveal the transcription activity and specificity of expression. So, we designed 60-mer oligo array based on the array system of Agilent Technologies (GPL477) as custom array. For validation of the array, we tested the reproducibility of labeling and hybridization. After this validation, 22K rice oligo array was supplied from Agilent Technologies (GPL892). 2: reproducibility of hybridization-2: We made a dye-swap experiment to validate dye-effect and data reproducibility between arrays. We hybridized shoot (as control) and stress-treated shoot. This data also indicated the diversity of gene expression profile among stress response. In addition, array data of samples treated for 24 hours have been already published on NCBI-GEO (GSE2415) Keywords: variety among tissues
