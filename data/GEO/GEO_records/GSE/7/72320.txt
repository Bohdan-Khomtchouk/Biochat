TITLE
Gene expression profiling of MDA231 cells with alterations involving beta-oxidation pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to confirm the role of fatty acid β-oxidation in Src regulation, we performed gene expression analysis in MDA231 cells from in vivo model treated with ETX or knockdown of CPT1 or CPT2 using shRNA. As expected, inhibition of β-oxidation showed a gene expression pattern that is opposite to the published Src regulated gene pattern. The known Src up-regulated genes are down-regulated and Src down-regulated genes are up-regulated in β-oxidation inhibited cells. Western Blotting further confirmed the gene expression pattern. Knockdown of CPT1 or CPT2 inhibited Src Y416 autophosphorylation as observed with ETX.

DESIGN
MDA231 cells were treated with ETX or knockdown of CPT1 or CPT2 using shRNA. Gene expression profiles were taken for each group and compared with control group (shRNA scramble). Multiple group comparison [MDA231-Scramble (C), MDA231-Scramble +ETX (D), MDA231-shCPT-1 (E) and  MDA231-shCPT-2 (F)]
