TITLE
Prior Knowledge Transfer Across Transcriptional Datasets Using Compositional Statistics [Tumor]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An expert-pathologist-reviewed epithelial ovarian cancer reference library (n = 50) used to assign the histopathology of epithelial ovarian cell lines using compositional statistics and random gene-sets

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we applied Gene Expression Compositional Assignment (GECA) to epithelial ovarian cell lines (GSE73637), using first a reference library of solid tumors (expO [ ]) and then a second library of expert pathologically-reviewed epithelial ovarian cancer samples
