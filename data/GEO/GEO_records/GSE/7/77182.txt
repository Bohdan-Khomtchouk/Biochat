TITLE
LNCRNAs and mRNAs in a Gynecological Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in human diseases. This study aimed to investigate the tissue and serum lncRNAs that are differentially expressed between patients with endometriosis, a gynecological disease, to evaluate the potential of these lncRNAs as non-invasive markers for the disease. Genome-wide profiling of lncRNA expression patterns revealed that many lncRNAs were abnormally expressed between sera and tissues of the patient samples.

DESIGN
the Glue Grant Human Transcriptome Array, which contained approximately 39,223 lncRNAs. The arrays were performed with 5 sets of pooled samples, including a pool of 10 endometriosis serum samples, a pool of 10 control serum samples, a pool of 5 eutopic (EU) endometrium tissue samples, a pool of 5 ectopic (EC) endometrium tissue samples and a pool of 5 negative tissue controls.
