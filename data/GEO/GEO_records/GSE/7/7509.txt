TITLE
Gene expression changes in anti-FcgRIIb treated DCs and monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to activate immunity is linked to their maturation status. In prior studies we have shown that selective antibody-mediated blockade of inhibitory FcgRIIB receptor on human DCs in the presence of activating immunoglobulin (Ig) ligands leads to DC maturation and enhanced immunity to antibody-coated tumor cells. Here we show that Fcg receptor (FcgR) mediated activation of human monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs is associated with a distinct gene expression pattern, including several inflammation associated chemokines as well as type 1 interferon (IFN) response genes including the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Keywords: response to antibody
