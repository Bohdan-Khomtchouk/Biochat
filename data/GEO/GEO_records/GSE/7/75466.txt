TITLE
Establishment of Afatinib-Resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells Derived from Tumor Xenograft Model [No treatment]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment aimed to indentify signifcant expression genes in afatinib-resistant HCC827 cell lines. The nude mice bearing subcutaneous tumors were administerd with afatinib at different intensities and dosages (5â€“100 mg/kg). Finally, well-growing tumors were harvested and dissocciated by 450 units/ml collagenase IV and maintained in culture dishs. All the gene expression profiles of resistant cell lines were comapared to parental HCC827 cell.

DESIGN
When cell lines isolated from xenograft tumors grew at 70% confluence, total RNA was isolated by using Qiagen RNEasy mini kit. The RNA integrity and QC reports were carried out based on manufacturer's manual. Labeled cRNA was hybridized to Illumina Human HT-12 Beadchips v4. Data were analysed by GeneSpring GX software (Agilent Techologies).
