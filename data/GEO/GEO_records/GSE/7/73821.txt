TITLE
Global Gene Expression of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA300 During Human and Mouse Infection

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus USA300_FPR3757

SUMMARY
Little is known about the expression of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) genes during infection conditions. Here, we described the transcriptome of the clinical MRSA strain USA300 derived from human cutaneous abscesses, and compared it with USA300 bacteria derived from infected kidneys in a mouse model. Remarkable similarity between the transcriptomes allowed us to identify genes encoding multiple proteases and toxins, and iron- and peptide-transporter molecules, which are upregulated in both infections and are likely important for establishment of infection. We also showed that disruption of the global transcriptional regulators agr and sae prevents in vivo upregulation of many toxins and proteases, protecting mice from lethal infection dose, and hinting at the role of these transcriptional regulators in the pathology of MRSA infection.
