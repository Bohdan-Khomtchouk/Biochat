TITLE
Cell-specific gene expression patterns in TB patients and household contacts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Monocytes and granulocytes were isolated from blood of TB patients and household contacts. RNA was isolated and gene expression was measured using microarrays.

DESIGN
House-hold contacts were matched to TB patients by gender and age. From each subject, two profiles (monocytes and granulocytes) were collected.
