TITLE
Expression data from DNMT3A in human gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is a major epigenetic mechanism that plays an important role in the early tumorigenic process.However, little is known about the roles of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) in gastric carcinogenesis. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression underlying gastric cancer and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Differential expression profiles between control and MKN45-DNMT3A cells were examined via microarray.
