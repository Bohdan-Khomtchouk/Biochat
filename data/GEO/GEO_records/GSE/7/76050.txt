TITLE
Human Papillary thyroid cancer cell line, BCPAP control vs. miR-146b-5p mimic transfected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of human papillary thyroid cancer cells comparing control untreated BCPAP cells with BCPAP cells transfected with miR-145b-5p mimic.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, BCPAP cells vs. miR-146b-5p transfexted BCPAP cells. Biological replicates: 1 control sample, 1 transfected sample.
