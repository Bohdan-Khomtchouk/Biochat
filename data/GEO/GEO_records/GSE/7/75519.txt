TITLE
Gene microarray of sorted Vg9Vd2 subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression at RNA level by 4 different cell sorted Vg9Vd2 subsets (Subset 1=CD28+CD27+, Subset2=CD28-CD27+, Subset 3=CD28-CD7-CD16-, Subset 4 = CD28-CD27-CD16+). Results highlight differences in RNA expression characterising these four cell populations into distinct phenotypic subsets with distinct functional potential

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from cell sorted fresh peripheral blood Vg9Vd2 T cell subsets (Subset 1=CD28+CD27+, Subset 2=CD28-CD27+, Subset 3=CD28-CD7-CD16-, Subset 4 = CD28-CD27-CD16+). Subsequently cDNA was made from RNA and finally converted to cRNA prior to array hybrdisation
