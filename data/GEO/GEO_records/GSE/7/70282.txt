TITLE
Differentially expressed genes analysis between dihydroberberine, sunitinib and dihydroberberine plus sunitinib.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insights into the mechanisms of dihydroberberine, sunitinib and dihydroberberine plus sunitinib on inhibition to A549 cells, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify different genes between dihydroberberine, sunitinib and dihydroberberine plus sunitinib-treated sample and control.

DESIGN
A549 cells were cultivated in the absence or presence of 25μmol/L dihydroberberine, 2μmol/L sunitinib, 25μmol/L dihydroberberine plus 2μmol/L sunitinib for 48 h, followed by the Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray
