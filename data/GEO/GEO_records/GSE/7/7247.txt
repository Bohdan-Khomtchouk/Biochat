TITLE
Dendritic Cells Compare the Similarity of Endogenous and Exogenous Antigens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we demonstrate by the use of extensive controls and stringent statistical analysis that dendritic cells differentially regulate hundreds of different genes based upon sequence similarity of endogenously- and exogenously-loaded antigens and in a T-cell independent fashion.  When endogenously and exogenously-derived antigens are identical, dendritic cells upregulate many different components of the Th-1 response, favoring the priming of CD8+ effectors and promulgating cellular immunity. Keywords: Loading methodology comparison
