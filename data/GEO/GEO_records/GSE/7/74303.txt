TITLE
Identification of Predictive Gene Markers for Multipotent Stromal Cell Proliferation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
Identification of genes that can predict the proliferation potential of multipotent stromal cells. Gene expression study by microarray and confirmation with RT-qPCR. Gene expression by microarray includes the 54 arrays originally present in GSE56362 and 9 additional arrays added to GSE56362 on October 23, 2015. These additional microarray datasets were completed in a randomized block design in combination with the microarray data originally present in GSE56362.
