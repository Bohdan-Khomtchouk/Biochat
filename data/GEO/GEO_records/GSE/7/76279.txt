TITLE
CXCR5+ Follicular Cytotoxic T cells Control Viral Infection in B Cell follicles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) specific CD8+ T cells (P14) were transferred into congenic WT mice followed by LCMV(DOCILE) infection. CXCR5-expressing (CXCR5+) or CXCR5 non-expressing (CXCR5-) P14 were purified on day 8 after infection, and total mRNA were sequenced from these populations. mRNA of P14 from uninfected mice (Naive P14) was also sequenced.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA level in CXCR5 expressing P14 (CXCR5+P14) and non-expressing P14 (CXCR5-P14) from LCMV infected mice day 8 post infection. mRNA of P14 from uninfected mice (Na√Øve P14) was also examined.
