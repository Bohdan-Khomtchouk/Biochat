TITLE
Expression data from mammary epithelial HC11 cells stably transfected with NF1-C2 or FoxF1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NF1-C2 suppresses tumorigenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by repressing FoxF1. Forkhead Box F1 promotes breast cancer cell migration by upregulating lysyl oxidase and suppressing Smad2/3 signaling

DESIGN
Biological replicates: 3 Wild type HC11 cells, 3 FoxF1-transfected HC11 cells and 3 NFI-C2-transfected HC11 cells, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.
