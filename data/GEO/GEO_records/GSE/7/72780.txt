TITLE
Intestinal epithelial cells from Crohn's Disease patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inflammatory Bowel Diseases are associated with marked alterations of IECs with a subsequent loss of barrier function. To identify alterations in signaling pathways in intestinal epithelium upon inflammation, we analyzed the transcriptome of IECs from patients suffering from Crohn’s disease.

DESIGN
Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from the terminal ileum of Crohn´s Disease patients (4 uninflamed and 5 inflamed areas). RNA was isolated and subjected to Affymetrix gene chip analysis
