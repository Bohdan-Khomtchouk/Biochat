TITLE
miRNA  Expression data from synovium in mouse serum transfer arthritis model (STA) model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To find regulated miRNAs during peak inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we have collected synovium from  mouse STA model at day 0  (Non Arthritic) and day 10 (Peak Inflammation). For miRNA profiling, we used high-throughput BioMark Real-Time PCR system (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA)

DESIGN
We analyzed expression of 750 miRNA in Non-arthritic synovium pooled from 3 mice and Arthritic synovium at peak inflammation pooled from 10 mice. Two biological replicates for each time points. Two technical replicates per sample.
