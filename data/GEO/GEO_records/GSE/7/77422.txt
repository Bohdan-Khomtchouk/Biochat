TITLE
The effect of Abl kinases on non-small cell carcinoma global transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the signaling pathway(s) required for ABL1/ABL2-dependent non-small cell carcinoma cells metastasis

DESIGN
Samples were analyzed by pair of either control versus ABL Kinase inhibitor GNF5, Or using scrambled shRNA versus ABL1/ABL2-specific shRNAs.
