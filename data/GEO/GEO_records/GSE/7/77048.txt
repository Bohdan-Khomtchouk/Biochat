TITLE
Expression data from human microvascular endothelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Exosomes can serve as a vehicle to transfer membrane receptors, proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs to recipient cells and thereby alter the gene expression of the recipient cells. We used microarray to analyze the gene expression of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) treated with EPCs-derived exosomes (EPC-Exos) or an equal volume of PBS, and identified the significantly altered genes during the process.

DESIGN
HMECs were treated with EPC-Exos or an equal volume of PBS for 24 hours.Total RNA from HMECs was extracted for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.The differentially expressed genes (DEGs; absolute fold change â‰¥1.5, p value < 0.05) were biologically interpreted and their involved regulatory signaling pathways were further explored.
