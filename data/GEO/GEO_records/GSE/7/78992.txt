TITLE
Analysis of differential gene expression in Drosophila dIME4 null mutants [paired-end]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Methylation of mRNA at the N6 position of adenosin is known for a long time, but its function remains poorly understood. Here generated a null mutant in the catalytic subunit of the m6A mRNA methylosome, dIME4, in Drosophila to determine the impact of loss of m6A on gene expression using Illumina sequencing.

DESIGN
Since dIME4 is preferentially expressed in the nervous system and dIME4 null mutants are viable, we compared gene expression and alternative splicing in wild type (2 samples) and dIME4 mutants (3 samples) with genetic background matched w control females in neuron enriched head/thorax.
