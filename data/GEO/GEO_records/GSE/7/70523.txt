TITLE
Gene expression profiling of infrequently and frequently dividing cells in the mouse epidermis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Infrequently (LRCs) and frequently (non-LRCs) dividing cells in the mouse epidermis are moleculary distinct.

DESIGN
Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) from back skin cells of quadruple-transgenic mice harboring K5-tTA, pTRE-H2B-GFP, K14-CreER and Rosa-tdTomato transgenes.
