TITLE
Subtelomeric p53 Binding Prevents Accumulation of DNA Damage at Human Telomeres

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Telomeres and tumor suppressor protein TP53 (p53) function in genome protection, but a direct role of p53 at telomeres has not yet been described.  Here, we have identified non-canonical p53 binding sites within the human subtelomeres that suppress the accumulation of DNA damage at telomeric repeat DNA.  These non-canonical subtelomeric p53 binding sites conferred transcription enhancer-like functions that include an increase in local histone H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation and stimulation of subtelomeric transcripts, including telomere-repeat containing RNA (TERRA).   p53 suppressed formation of telomere-associated Î³H2AX and prevented telomere DNA degradation in response to DNA damage stress.  Our findings indicate that p53 provides a direct chromatin-associated protection to human telomeres, as well as other fragile genomic sites.  We propose that p53-associated chromatin modifications enhance local DNA repair or protection to provide a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function of p53.

DESIGN
p53 binding was analyzed by ChIP-Seq in HCT116 cells treated with camptothecin or untreated control.
