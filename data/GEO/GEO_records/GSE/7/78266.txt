TITLE
Rice genes responsive to Glu

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Treatment of rice roots with glutamate (Glu) induces systemic disease resistance against rice blast in leaves. To analyze the effect of Glu on the transcriptome of rice, rice roots were treated with Glu solution, and then fourth leaves were harvested and analyzed by Agilent rice microarray.

DESIGN
Rice plants were treated with Glu (10 mM) or mock (water) solution and leaves were analyzed at 9 and 24 h in two biological replicates.
