TITLE
Developmental gene expression of Xenopus laevis J strain [stage]

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Comprehensive RNA-seq experiments to measure the expression of homoeologs across different developmental stages, as a part of the Xenopus laevis genome project. This work is funded by Agency Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT; " Genome Science " Grant ID 221S0002).

DESIGN
Collect mRNA from whole embryos; two clutches were used (Taira dataset for one pair, Ueno dataset for the other pair)
