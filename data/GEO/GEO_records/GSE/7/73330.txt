TITLE
AMP18 Dual Effects

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AMP-18 inhibits growth of cancer cells, but stimulates growth of normal cell lines. Microarray assay was performed to identify gene expression profiles between a head/neck cancer. Cell line (SCC61) and a normal cell line  (HaCaT) with and without AMP-18 treatment at 2 and 24 hour.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from triplicated groups of SCC61 and HaCaT cells  treated with and without AMP-18 from 2 and 24 hour was subjected to microarry assay. Please note that Detection pvalues are provided as a supplementary file (Detection-pvalues.txt).
