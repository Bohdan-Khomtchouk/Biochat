TITLE
Refining mouse annotations via targeted RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this work we aim to improve the understanding of the mouse transcriptome complexity, investigate the expressed fraction of the genome and ameliorate the available mouse annotations. We utilized CatureSeq, a recently described strategy meant to enhance the sequencing coverage of low abundant genes. In our experimental design we generated oligonucleotide probes to select annotated and putative long-noncoding RNA and splice junctions. This allowed us to improve dramatically the sequencing throughput of the targeted regions. As a consequence our approach permitted the simultaneous identification of thousands of exons and the expansion of the already known ones

DESIGN
The mouse gene assembly is anlaysed by targeted RNA sequencing of lncRNA and splice junctions. 8 mouse tissues and 16 samples are considered in the analysis. Each sample was added with external RNA controls. The controls are polyadenylated transcripts of known concentration designed to be added to an RNA analysis experiment after sample isolation.
