TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and ZmMADS47 RNAi mutant Transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Analysis of  gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that ZmMADS47 RNAi mutant influence the expression of nutritional metabolism genes. Results provide important information of the gene expression level regulation of zein family.

DESIGN
Maize kernel mRNA profiles of 15DAP wild type (WT) and ZmMADS47 RNAi mutant were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2000 (Zea mays).
