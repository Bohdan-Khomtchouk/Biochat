TITLE
hESC MIXL1+ MIXL1- microarray

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of isolated hES cells from day 3 of cardiac differentiation was used to identify differences between MIXL1eGFP+ and MIXL1eGFP- transcriptomes. We identified 6,757 differentially regulated genes, of which 2,520 were upregulated â‰¥2-fold in the eGFP+ (MIXL1+) mesoderm population

DESIGN
A stencil differentiation protocol was used to isolate mesodermal cells based on GFP expression from the MIXL1 locus. Microarray analysis of isolated cells from day 3 of differentiation was used to identify differences between MIXL1eGFP+ and MIXL1eGFP- transcriptomes.
