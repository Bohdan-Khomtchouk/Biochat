TITLE
Morphological and Genetic Mechanisms of Regeneration in Hemichordates

ORGANISM
Ptychodera flava

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression level changes during the regeneration of the hemichordate posterior during the first 96 hours of regeneration.

DESIGN
Animals were bisected, then collected at eight experimental timepoints - 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, with a minimum of four replicates for each timepoint. Additionally, four healthy and intact animals were bisected and immediately collected to serve as reference controls.
