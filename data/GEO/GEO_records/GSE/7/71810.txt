TITLE
Gene expression data from human tonsillar B lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
B lymphocytes are important mediators of adaptive immunity. They drive na√Øve T cells to different T-helper profiles. Th2 responses are implicated in allergic reactions. The goal of this study was to characterize the gene expression profile of B cells under Th2-skewing conditions.

DESIGN
B lymphocytes were isolated from human tonsils and cultured for 24 hours under Th2-skewing stimulation (anti-CD40 and IL4 treatment) or with no stimulation. RNA was isolated from 4 biological replicates for each condition. 8 samples in total were hybridized to Affymetrix gene expression microarrays. variable: treatment: antiCD40-IL4: antiCD40-IL4_1, antiCD40-IL4_2, antiCD40-IL4_3, antiCD40-IL4_4 variable: treatment: unstimulated: Control_1, Control_2, Control3, Control_4 repeat: biological replicate: antiCD40-IL4_1, antiCD40-IL4_2, antiCD40-IL4_3, antiCD40-IL4_4 repeat: biological replicate: Control_1, Control_2, Control3, Control_4
