TITLE
TGFβ signaling directs serrated adenomas to the mesenchymal colorectal cancer subtype [organoids]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to determine the effects of TGFβ at the premalignant stage of CRC development. Organoid cultures were isolated from normal colon and from tubular adenomas. One normal colon culture was genetically engineered using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to carry the BRAFV600E mutation.

DESIGN
Organoid cultures of three different tubular adenomas and two normal colon samples, and one BRAFV600E-mutant organoid culture received TGFβ or control treatment after which gene expression was analyzed by microarray (Affymetrix U133+ PM Genechip Array).
