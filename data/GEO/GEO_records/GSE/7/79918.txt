TITLE
Ancestral (bi-)polarization control module in free-living and obligate intracellular bacteria

ORGANISM
Caulobacter vibrioides

SUMMARY
We report here the zitS DNA binding by ZitP and PopZ in Caulobacter crescentus. Also the parS site bound by ParB are showed. From chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of ParB, ZitP and PopZ DNA binding. We find that ZitP and PopZ binds DNA close to the parS site. This study provides evidence that PopZ and ZitP participates in DNA segregation in C. crescentus.

DESIGN
DNA binding of ParB, ZitP and PopZ was analysed by chromatin immunoprecipitation-deep sequencing, and found to bind zitS site surrounding the parS site
