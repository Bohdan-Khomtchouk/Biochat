TITLE
Psoralen binding across the Escherichia coli chromosome

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We used trimethylpsoralen intercalation to map supercoiling across the E. coli chromosome. We treated E. coli cells with trimethylpsoralen and exposed them to UV light. Psoralen enters cells, intercalates between DNA base pairs, and crosslinks the two strands of DNA at a rate proportional to the local superhelical density. We then fragmented DNA and hybridized crosslinked and non-crosslinked DNA fragments separately to tiling microarrays.
