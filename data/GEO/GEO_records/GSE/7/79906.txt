TITLE
Gene Expression of brain cortex microvessels in two rat models of acute liver failure (ALF)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Evaluation of early transcriptional changes in blood brain barrier genes involved in the patogenesis of brain edema associated with ALF. Two different well stablished rat models were analyzed: Portacaval anastomosis plus hepatic artery ligation and portacaval anastomosis plus total hepatectomy.

DESIGN
ALF was induced by portocaval anastomosis (PCA) and 24 hours after the surgery animals underwent hepatic artery ligation (HAL) or total hepatectomy (HEP). Sham rats were subjected to a fictitious two-step surgery. Between 8 and 12 hours after the last surgery rats were euthanized by decapitation, to avoid anesthetic effects, and cortical microvessels isolated.
