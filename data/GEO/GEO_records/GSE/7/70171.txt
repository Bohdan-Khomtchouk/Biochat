TITLE
De novo generation of somatic stem cells from differentiated cells [neuron]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of YAP/TAZ as factors able to convert differentiated cells into stem cells of the same tissue, we compared the expression profiles of neural stem cells (NSCs) obtained by doxycycline-inducible expression of YAP (yNSCs) in neurons with original neurons and neural stem cells (NSCs) treated in the same way.

DESIGN
We collected RNA from NSCs, yNSCs, and neurons. Samples were then processed for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicas (A, B, C) were used for each sample, for a total of 9 samples.
