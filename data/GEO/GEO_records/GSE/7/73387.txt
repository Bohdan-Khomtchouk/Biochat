TITLE
Alteration of Gene Expression Profile in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats Treated with Protein Hydrolysate of Blue Mussel (Mytilus edulis) by DNA Microarray Analysis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to investigate the antihypertensive effect of enzymatic hydrolysis of blue mussel protein (HBMP) in rats. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were orally administration with high- or low-dose of HBMP for 28 days. Major components of the renin-angiotensin (RAS) system in serum of SHRs from different groups were analyzed, and gene expression profiling were performed in the kidney of SHRs, using the Whole Rat Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray. Results indicated although genes involved in RAS system were not significantly altered, those related to blood coagulation system, cytokine and growth factor, and fatty acids metabolism were remarkablely changed. Several genes which were seldom reported to be implicated in pathogenesis of hypertension also showed significant expression alterations after oral administration of HBMP.

DESIGN
SHRs were randomly divided into three groups (n=10): control group (rats were orally administered with water, 3mL), low-dose group (rats were orally administered with HBMP, 10 mg/kg/day, 3mL), and high-dose group (rats were orally administered with HBMP, 20 mg/kg/day, 3mL). After orally administered with HBMP for 4 weeks, all rats were killed and the kidneys were dissected. For each group, equivalent amounts of RNA from four individual rats were mixed, and transcribed to Cy3-labeled cRNA using the Agilent Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Then, Cy3-labeled cRNA from each group was hybridized to the Whole Rat Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray ver. 3.0 (4X44k, G2519F-028282) (Agilent Technologies), following the manufacturer's hybridization protocol.
