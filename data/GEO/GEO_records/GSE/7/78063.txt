TITLE
Pseudouridylation in Naf1+/- mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pseudo-seq was used to measure differences in the extent of pseudouridine (Ψ) modification in rRNA from mice haploinsufficient for the H/ACA biogenesis factor Naf1 compared to wild- type. We measured telomerase RNA levels as well as a sample of box H/ACA RNAs and found they were all decreased in Naf1+/- mice.  Nevertheless, Naf1+/- mice had minimally decreased levels of pseudouridylation at the rRNA sites queried.  This was not associated with any phenotypic abnormalities in vivo in these mice which we examined for hematopoeitic, liver, testes and brain defects.

DESIGN
CMC treatment of RNA followed by next generation sequencing was used to measure the extent of pseudouridylation at mapped mouse rRNA Ψ sites.
