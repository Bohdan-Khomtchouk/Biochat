TITLE
nanoCAGE reveals 5’ UTR features that define specific modes of translation of functionally related mTOR-sensitive mRNAs

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mTOR regulates mRNA translation. Whereas ribosome-profiling suggested that mTOR exclusively stimulates translation of TOP (containing a 5’-terminal oligopyrimidine [5’TOP] motif) and TOP-like mRNAs, polysome-profiling implied that mTOR also modulates translation of non-TOP mRNAs. We show that ribosome-, but not polysome-profiling, is biased towards identification of TOP mRNAs as differentially translated while obscuring detection of changes in non-TOP mRNA translation. Transcription start site profiling by Nano-Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (nanoCAGE) revealed that many mTOR-sensitive mRNAs do not have 5’TOP motifs. Moreover, nanoCAGE showed that 5’ UTR features distinguish two functionally and translationally distinct subsets of mTOR-sensitive mRNAs: i) those with short 5’ UTRs enriched for mitochondrial functions such as respiration, that are translated in an eIF4E, but not eIF4A1-dependent manner and ii) mRNAs encoding proliferation- and survival-promoting proteins, that harbor long 5’ UTRs, and require both eIF4E and eIF4A1 for their efficient translation. Selective inhibition of translation of mRNAs harboring long 5’ UTRs via suppression of eIF4A leads to uncoupling of expression of proteins involved in respiration (e.g. ATP5O) from those protecting mitochondrial integrity (e.g. BCL-2) ultimately resulting in apoptosis. Conversely, simultaneous translational downregulation of both long and short 5’ UTR mRNAs by mTOR inhibitors results in suppression of mitochondrial respiration and predominantly cytostatic effects.  Therefore, 5’ UTR features define differential modes of translation of functionally distinct mTOR-sensitive mRNAs, which explains discrepancies between the effects of mTOR and eIF4A inhibitors on neoplastic cells.
