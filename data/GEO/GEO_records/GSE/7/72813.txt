TITLE
Gene expression analysis of transplanted wt and Matn4-/- hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed at identifying the differences in expression levels between wt and Mant4-/- HSCs after transplantation, to determine the mechanism through which Mant4-/- gain a proliferative advantage.

DESIGN
mRNA expression was analyzed from Matn4-/- and wt HSCs  isolated 4 weeks after transplantation into lethally irradiated recipients. 3 biological replicates were used per group.
