TITLE
Differential expression of genes in photoreceptor and other retinal cells in developing retina

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze cell lineage specific global transcriptional changes during retinogenesis, we sequenced mRNA from developing retina fractioned to Cd73+ photoreceptors and Cd73- other cells, in addition to the whole retina at embryonic period.

DESIGN
Examination of global mRNA expression patterns of mouse retinal cells by RNA sequence
