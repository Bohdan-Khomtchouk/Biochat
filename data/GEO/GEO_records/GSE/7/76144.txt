TITLE
Changes in transcriptome during excisional cutaneous murine wound healing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using microarray analysis, we explored the differences in gene expression in wounded and intact skin using murine model. Injured skin samples were examined at days 1 and 4 post injury. The results provide the detailed molecular profile of the the genetic response to injury.

DESIGN
Two full-thickness dermal wounds were made on the opposite sides of the midline of each mouse using a 4 mm punch biopsy instrument. Wounds were made through the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue layers while leaving the fascia intact. At a specified time point after the wounding (1 and 4 days), mice were sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation. The wounds and surrounding tissues or intact skin samples were removed with an 8 mm biopsy punch.
