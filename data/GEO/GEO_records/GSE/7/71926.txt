TITLE
Identification of a Highly Immunogenic Mouse Breast Cancer Sub Cell Line, 4T1-S

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recently, cancer immunotherapy has been paid much attention because of its improved efficacy and low frequency of adverse effects. A mouse breast cancer cell line, 4T1, has been known as poorly immunogeneic and highly metastatic cell line. In this study, we have identified a sub cell line of 4T1, designated as 4T1-Sapporo (4T1-S), which could induce a strong immune response against the same line. When 4T1-S was subcutaneously injected, striking enlargement of draining lymph nodes and increase of activated T cells were observed. The strong immune responses could not be observed when 4T1-S was injected to nude mice, indicating that this phenomenon is mediated by T cell response. Identification of 4T1-S characteristics may help to improve immunotherapy against breast cancer.

DESIGN
4T1-A1, 4T1-A2, 4T1-S1, 4T1-S2
