TITLE
Gene expression profiling in metabolically heterogeneous human lung tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the impact of genetic and environmental factors that influence cancer cell metabolism in vivo, we conducted intra-operative 13C-glucose infusions in NSCLC patients. We determined that regional glucose metabolism was correlated with tumor perfusion as assessed by pre-surgical dynamic gadolinium enhancement.Â  Tumors or tumor regions showing high or low perfusion were collected and subjected to RNA-seq analysis.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis was performed to evaluate gene transcriptional levels in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues showing high or low perfusion as measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI.
