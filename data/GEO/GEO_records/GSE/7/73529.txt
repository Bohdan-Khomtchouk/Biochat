TITLE
Transcriptional regulation in the ovary of estrogen-deficient mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis coupled with quantitative RT-PCR analysis identified seven genes (Fgd5, Gulo, Phex, Serpina5, Sfrp4, Kif26b and Tdgf1) of which the mRNA expression levels in ArKO ovaries were significantly different from those in the WT ovaries in the basal state, and were not normalized by E2 supplementation

DESIGN
4 samples, wild-type ovary without treatment,  wild-type ovary 4 hours after 5 IU of eCG, estrogen-deficient ovary without treatment and estrogen-deficient ovary 4 hours after s.c injection of estrgen at 18 mg/kg.
