TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of Blumeria graminis triticale on different hosts

ORGANISM
Blumeria graminis

SUMMARY
With this experiment we aimed do identify eventual genes that are differentially expressed by the fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis triticale when it grows on two different hosts (wheat and triticale)

DESIGN
We used to fungal isolates, for each of them we infected wheat and triticale and we extracted RNA (and sequenced) from the infected plant tissue. Three technical replicates for each combinations plant-pathogen were used
