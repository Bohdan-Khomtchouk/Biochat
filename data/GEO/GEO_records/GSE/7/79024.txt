TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Six2-positive nephron progenitors from mouse embryo

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Nephron progenitors in the embryonic kidney propagate while generating differentiated nephrons. However, the progenitors in mice terminally differentiate shortly after birth. We defined culture conditions to selectively propagated nephron progenitors in vitro in an undifferentiated state. To understand how expression profiles of Six2+ cells changed during culture in vitro compared with in vivo, we performed microarray analysis of Six2+ cells at E11.5 (starting material) and P0 (experiencing 8 days in vivo), and cultured Six2+ cells at E11.5 for 8 days or 19 days.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis were performed with isolated Six2-positive nephron progenitors from transgenic mice embryo at E11.5 or P0, and cultured E11.5 Six2+ cells for 8 or 19 days in conditioned media. P0 non-progenitors represent Six2-GFP-negative cells at P0.
