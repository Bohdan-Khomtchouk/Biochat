TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of a Streptococcus pyogenes mutant lacking the eukaryote-type ser/thr phosphatase (SP-STP)

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
We report the mRNA expression profile of Streptococcus pyogenes Type M1 strain M1T15448-derived mutant lacking Serine threonine phosphatase.

DESIGN
Measuring transcriptome profiling in M1T1DSTP mutants vs M1T1-WT  5448 strain
