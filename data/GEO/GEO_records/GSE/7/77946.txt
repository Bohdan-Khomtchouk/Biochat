SUMMARY
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of myeloid leukemia characterized by   differentiation block at the promyelocyte stage. Besides the presence of chromosomal   rearrangement t(15;17) leading to formation of PML-RARA fusion, other genetic   alterations have also been implicated in APL. Here, we performed comprehensive   mutational analysis of primary and relapse APL to identify somatic alterations which   cooperate with PML-RARA in the pathogenesis of APL. We explored the mutational   landscape using whole-exome (n=12) and subsequent targeted sequencing of 398   genes in 153 primary and 69 relapse APL. Both primary and relapse APL harbored an   average of eight non-silent somatic mutations per exome. We observed recurrent   alterations of FLT3, WT1, NRAS and KRAS in the newly diagnosed APL, while   mutations in other genes commonly mutated in myeloid leukemia were rarely detected.   The molecular signature of APL relapse was characterized by emergence of frequent   mutations in PML and RARA genes. Our sequencing data also demonstrates incidence   of loss-of-function mutations in previously unidentified genes, ARID1B and ARID1A,   both of which encode for key components of the SWI/SNF complex. We show that   knockdown of ARID1B in APL cell line, NB4, results in large scale activation of gene   expression and reduced in vitro differentiation potential.
