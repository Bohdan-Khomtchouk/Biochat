TITLE
Regulation of gene expression after FGF2-induced gyrification of mouse brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyze the cortical transcriptome under physiological or FGF2-perturbed conditions. Using system biology approaches (DGE, WGCNA and kinase enrichment analysis) we identify networks of co-expressed genes involved in neuronal differentiation and cortical patterning that are either up- or down-regulated in vivo after FGF2 perturbation.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from dorsal telencephalons of E13.5 embryos, from anterior brain regions  (rostral to the hippocampus). A total of 3 FGF-2 injected embryos were analyzed and compared to three age-matched vehicle-injected controls.
