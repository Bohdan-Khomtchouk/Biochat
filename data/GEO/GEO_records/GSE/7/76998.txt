TITLE
Transcriptomic Dynamics during Differentiation Process of Human Pluripotent Cells into Hepatocyte-like Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Examine characteristics of hESCs and hiPSCs during directed in-vitro differentiation into HLCs.

DESIGN
We generated HLCs from both hESCs and hiPSCs by directed in-vitro differentiation, and analyzing their transcriptome at representative time points during the differentiation using RNA sequencing.
