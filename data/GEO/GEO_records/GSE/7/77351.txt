TITLE
Deep transcriptome analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblast following simultaneous overexpression of Stella, Oct4 and Nanos2 (SON)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We constructed a polycistronic lentiviral vector to overexpress 3 germ cell specific genes (Stella, Oct4 and Nanos2)  in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) and evaluated the transcriptome portrait in partially reprogrammed cells.We sequenced RNA samples from bulk cell population of two biological duplicates of MEF-GFP (control) and MEF-SON (overexpressed) 21 days post infection. Differential expression analysis of 50 M pair-end read per samples showed overexpression of neurogenesis, blood vessel and proliferation related genes and downregulation of chondroitin sulphate metabolic process, nitric oxide production and innate immune response genes.

DESIGN
Examination of whole transcriptome following concurrent overexpression of Stella, Oct4 and Nanos2 in MEFs.
