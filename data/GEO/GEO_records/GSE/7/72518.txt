TITLE
Gene expression profiling of M0, M1 and M2a macrophages after 7 days of culture

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The relative contribution of polarized macrophages to the maintenance of tolerance is unknown. We examined their roles by in vivo adoptive transfer immunotherapy of M0, M1 and M2a macrophages as pre-treatment of colitis. In other experiments, M2a macrophages were used as pre-treatment or treatment of established colitis followed by immunotherapy with nTreg cells. Survival, weight gain, tissue infiltration, iTreg and Th17 cell development, T cell activation, and the frequency of proinflammatory cytokines were used as outcome measurements. Pre-treatment with M2a but not M1 macrophages increased the development of iTreg and Th17 cells. M2a macrophages used as pre-treatment or in treatment of established colitis allowed for successful therapy with nTreg cells. M1 and M2a macrophages have distinct gene expression profiles.

DESIGN
M0, M1 and M2a macrophages were cell sorted and were used to generate total RNA for each array set, which was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChips in accordance to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Three sets of arrays were performed, and the results were averaged. The subset of probe sets whose expression increased or decreased by two-fold or more relative to M0 cells as a common standard was identified and used for further analysis.
