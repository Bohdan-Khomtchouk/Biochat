TITLE
Expression data from mouse neonatal hindlimb muscles

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
During neonatal development, skeletal muscle grows dramatically by myonuclei accretion to existing fibers and hypertophic growth of fibers with protein synthesis. To understand molecular mechanism underlying neonatal muscle growth, we used microarray to profile the global program of gene expressions especially involved in myoblast fusion, migration, and muscle fiber growth by itself.

DESIGN
Mouse hindlimb muscles at postnatal day (P) 2, 7, and 14 were isolated and used for RNA extraction and hybridyzation on microarrays. We used three biological replicates for each time point.
