TITLE
IMR-90 cells: Collagen Mesh Time Course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A series of chips with some repeated measurments. Each chip represents a pool of 4 collagen/chondroitin sulfate tissue engineering scaffold meshes seeded with 1 x 10^6 IMR-90 Human Fibroblasts. mRNA was isolated at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after seeding. Keywords = tissue engineering mesh, collagen, chondroitin sulfate, biomaterials design Keywords: time-course
