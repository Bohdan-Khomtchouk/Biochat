TITLE
Expression data from human SGBS adipocytes under hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hypoxia in adipose tissue is suggested to be involved in the development of a chronic mild inflammation, which in obesity can further lead to insulin-resistance. The effect of hypoxia on gene expression in adipocytes seems to play a central role in this inflammatory response observed in obesity. However, the global impact of hypoxia on transcriptional changes in human adipocytes is unclear. Therefore, we compared gene expression profiles of human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes under normoxic or hypoxic conditions to detect hypoxia-responsive genes in adipocytes by using whole human genome microarrays.

DESIGN
Human SGBS adipocytes were cultured in a hypoxic environment (1% O2) for 3, 6 and 16 hours and the control group was cultured under normoxic conditions (21% O2). Total RNA was prepared from control and treated SGBS cells, in triplicate experiments, and probes were hybridized on ‘Human Genome U133 2.0’ arrays (Affymetrix).
