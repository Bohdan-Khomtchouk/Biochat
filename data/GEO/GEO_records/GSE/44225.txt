TITLE
Gene expression in human fungal pathogen Coccidioides immitis changes as mycelia differentiate into spherules and mature

ORGANISM
Coccidioides immitis RS

SUMMARY
Coccidioides immitis (C. immitis) is a dimorphic fungus that causes disease in mammals including human beings. It grows as a mycelium in the soil but differentiates into a pathogenic structure called a spherule in the host. We compared the transcriptome of C. immitis mycelia and day 2 and day 8 spherules grown in vitro using a custom custom oligonucleotide microarray from Nimblegen.

DESIGN
C. immitis RS strain isolated from infected mice was grown on agar. Arthroconidia was harvested and inoculated into mycelial spores. RNA was extracted from spores at different days post-inoculation and hybridized to a custom Nimblegen array, in order to identify differentially expressed genes between mycelia and spherules.
