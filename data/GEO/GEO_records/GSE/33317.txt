TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse prostate stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mouse prostate tissue exhibits strong power of regeneration, indicating the exisistence of prostate stem cells. Previously we showed that a single mouse prostate cells defined by Lin-CD44+CD133+Sca-1+CD117+ phenotype can generate a prostate after transplantation in vivo. In this study, we compared gene expression profiles of mouse prostate stem cells ( Lin-CD44+CD133+Sca-1+CD117+) and prostate non-stem cells (Lin-CD44-CD133-Sca-1-CD117-).

DESIGN
Primary mouse prostate cells were isolated from BL6 mice. Lin-CD44+CD133+Sca-1+CD117+ and Lin-CD44-CD133-Sca-1-CD117- cells were sorted via FACS, and microarray was performed to compare gene expressions between the two groups of cells.
