TITLE
Sequence-specific mono-uridylation of mature miRNAs by Zcchc6 and Zcchc11

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Recent small RNA sequencing data has uncovered extensive modification of the 3’ end of mature microRNAs (miRNAs). This non-templated nucleotide addition can impact miRNA gene regulatory networks through the control of miRNA stability or by interfering with the repression of target mRNAs. The miRNA modifying enzymes responsible for this regulation remain largely uncharacterized. Here we describe the ability for two related terminal uridyl transferases (TUTases), Zcchc6 (TUT7) and Zcchc11 (TUT4), to 3’ mono-uridylate a specific subset of miRNAs involved in cell differentiation and Hox gene control. Zcchc6/11 selectively uridylate these miRNAs in vitro, and we biochemically define a bipartite sequence motif that is necessary and sufficient to confer Zcchc6/11 catalyzed uridylation. Depletion of these TUTases in cultured cells causes the selective loss of 3’ mono-uridylation of many of the same miRNAs. Interestingly, upon TUTase dependent loss of uridylation we observe a concomitant increase in non-templated 3’ mono-adenylation. Our results uncover the molecular basis for sequence specific miRNA mono-uridylation by Zcchc6/11, highlight the precise control of different 3’ miRNA modifications in cells, and have implications for miRNA regulation during development.
