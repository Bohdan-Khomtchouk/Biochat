TITLE
RNA-seq quantification of expression changes upon unc-62 knockdown in adult Caenorhabditis elegans.

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-seq to quantify gene expression changes in adult worms upon knockdown of transcription factor unc-62/Homothorax. unc-62 is a developmental regulator that binds proximal to age-regulated transcripts and modulates lifespan. In the intestine (in which tissue-specific unc-62 knockdown increases lifespan), we identify multiple effects of unc-62 knockdown linked to extension of longevity. First, unc-62 RNAi decreases the expression of yolk proteins (vitellogenins) that aggregate in the body cavity and become toxic in old age. Second, unc-62 RNAi results in a broad increase in expression of intestinal genes that typically decrease expression with age, suggesting that unc-62 activity balances intestinal resource allocation between yolk protein expression and fertility on the one hand and somatic functions on the other.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling by Illumina HiSeq of 3 biological replicates of day 4 adult Caenorhabditis elegans that were fed either control or unc-62 RNAi beginning at day 1 of adulthood.
