TITLE
Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen identifies protein-coding genes and microRNAs important in FLT3-ITD+ AML (MV4-11) cellular growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The functional relevance of many microRNAs in the context of tumor biology remains unclear. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we performed a global loss-of-function screen to test the impact of individual microRNAs on the growth of FLT3-ITD positive leukemia cells. This approach identified both evolutionarily conserved and non-conserved human microRNAs that function to suppress or promote tumor cell growth, revealing that microRNAs are extensively integrated into the molecular networks that control tumor cell physiology. Our study describes a powerful genetic approach by which the function of individual microRNAs can be assessed on a global level, and its use will rapidly advance our understanding of how microRNAs contribute to human disease.

DESIGN
Loss-of-function CRISPR-Cas9 screen identifies genes whose loss leads to increased or decreased FLT3-ITD+ cell growth over 23 day time-course

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
