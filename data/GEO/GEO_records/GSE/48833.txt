TITLE
Identification and functional analysis of SHISA2 overexpressed in high-grade prostate cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified a novel molecular target and diagnostic biomarker, SHISA2, as an overexpressed gene in high-grade prostate cancer (PC) cells. To understand the association of SHISA2 overexpression with the aggressiveness of high-grade PC, we performed gene expression analysis using a cDNA microarray.

DESIGN
Gene expression patterns of PC-3 cells transfected with the two shRNA expression vectors (siSHISA2 and siCONTROL) were compared.
