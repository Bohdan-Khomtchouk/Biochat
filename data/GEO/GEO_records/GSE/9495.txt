TITLE
Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus infection of E. coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli ; Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus

SUMMARY
The transcriptional response of E. coli being predated by Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus Keywords: Transcriptional analysis

DESIGN
5 biological replicates with 2 technical replicates each of E. coli cells only and E. coli cells 15 minutes post-infection arrays 4 arrays, with samples swapped for each biological replicate. Gel image files generated by the ImageQuant scanning software. Each raw data txt file has the " control " samples which are the E. coli samples reading on the entire array and thus with the 2 technical replicates, and the " data " samples to which it is compared by Arrayvision. the " data " samples of ec1 to ec5 are Bdellovibrio only controls 2 technical replicates). The " data " samples of t1 to t5 are the test samples. Hence t1 to t5 are the raw data files for samples test1 to test10 and ec1 to ec5 are the raw data files for all of samples ec-1 to ec-10 and bd-1 to bd-10.
