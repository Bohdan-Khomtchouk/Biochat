TITLE
Profiling of long non-coding RNAs associated with atrial fibrillation in patients with rheumatic heart valvular disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial tissues from 5 AF patients and 5 non-AF patients that were collected for lncRNA expression microarray analyses to explore the role of lncRNA in the pathogenesis of AF.rhythm (SR) patients with rheumatic heart valvular disease,we have employed

DESIGN
Five specimens of right auricular dextra were obtained from patients of rheumatic heart valve disease with permanent AF and with SR respectively. Expression profiling of lncRNA and mRNA were performed on SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K v2 Microarray, and the functions of lncRNAs were predicted by gene ontology analysis (GO analysis), kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis(KEGG analysis).
