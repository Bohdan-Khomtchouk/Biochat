TITLE
A machine learning classifier trained on cancer transcriptomes detects NF1 inactivation signal in glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in pathologically confirmed glioblastoma (GBM) samples. These data were used to test a classifier that was generated to distinguish GBM tumor samples with loss of neurofibromin 1 (NF1) function

DESIGN
Microarray analysis was performed on total RNA isolated from flash frozen GBM samples.
