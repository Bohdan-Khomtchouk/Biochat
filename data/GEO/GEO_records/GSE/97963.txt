TITLE
Real-Time PCR analysis of Embryoid Body differentiation of Human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human pluripotent stem cells were differentiated by size-controlled embryoid body (EB) formation in defined neutral, ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm conditions.  EB's were analysed at 4, 10 and 16 days post induction by real-time PCR using the Fludigm Deltagene primers and probes.

DESIGN
575 samples (with replicates) from undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells, Embryoid body samples at day 4, 10 and 16 post induction of differnetiation, in four conditions and Teratoma samples from the same cell lines
