TITLE
Murine Rat Brain Injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Summary: Brain trauma is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, both in adult and pediatric populations. Much of the functional deficit derives from delayed cell death resulting from induction of neurotoxic factors that overwhelm endogenous neuroprotective responses. Hypothesis: Gene expression profiling across species and models may help identify candidate molecular pathways induced by brain injury, some of which may provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Specific Aim: To identify the potential molecular mechanisms underlying such delayed responses, we compared gene expression patterns using high-density oligonucleotide arrays at 4, 8, 24 and 72 hours after moderate levels of lateral fluid percussion-induced brain injury in rats and lateral controlled cortical impact injury in mice.
