TITLE
Gene expression profile of IGROV1 cells after in vitro treatment with CpG-ODN

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CpG-ODN is a potent immuno-stimulatory molecule. In order to exclude a direct effect of murine CpG-ODN on IGROV1 human ovarian cancer cell line a gene expression experiment was performed.

DESIGN
The ovarian cancer cell line IGROV-1 was obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI medium 1640 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma) and 2 mM glutamine (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ). Cells were maintained at 37°C in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. 1x106 IGROV-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and, after seeding, cells were treated with 10uM of CpG-ODN in culture medium [phosphorothioated ODN1826 (5’-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3’), TriLink Biotechnologies (San Diego, CA, USA)] for 24 hours. At the end of treatment, cells were collected and RNA extracted.
