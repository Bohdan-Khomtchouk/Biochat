TITLE
Gene expression profile of IGROV1 cells after in vitro treatment with CpG-ODN

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CpG-ODN is a potent immuno-stimulatory molecule. In order to exclude a direct effect of murine CpG-ODN on IGROV1 human ovarian cancer cell line a gene expression experiment was performed.
