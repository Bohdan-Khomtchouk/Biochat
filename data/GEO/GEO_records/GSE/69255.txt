TITLE
Effect of neutrophils and vincristine on RL follicular lymphoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression levels in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cells exposed to neutrophils and chemotherapy. We aimed to see the impact of normal peripheral blood neutrophils on the sensitivity of lymphoma B cells to anticancer agents. The results provide insight into the genes that may be involved in the mechanism by which neutrophils attenuate the sensitivity of lymphoma B cell to chemotherapy.

DESIGN
RL cells were cultured alone or co-cultured with neutrophils, in the presence or absence of vincristine for 2 hours. RL cells were purified after labeling with anti-human CD15-Biotin then anti-Biotin Microbeads followed by magnetic column separation. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed. The experiment was performed in triplicate.
