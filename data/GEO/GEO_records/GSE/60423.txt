TITLE
MicroRNA expression changes in Bone Marrow Stromal Cells from Myeloma Patients vs Normal Patients, and From Normal Patients cultured with or without Myeloma cells in 3D culture

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objectives of this study were to assess differences in Bone Marrow Derived  Menenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) during co-culture with myeloma cells, and to assess differences in myeloma patient MSCs compared to normal donor MSCs.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, a Bone Marrow Derived Menenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) were analyzed  after FACS sorting from 2 week culture in osteogenic media lacking dexamethasone in 3D silk scaffold matrices either in co-culture with the multiple myeloma cell line GFP+Luc+MM1.S or Alone, as controls. Also, monocultures of MSCs grown in 2D, in MSC expansion media, from Normal Donor Controls (ND) or Multiple myeloma patients (MM) were analyzed. Analysis was done looking at microRNA expression in samples with the nanoString microRNA platform for 800 microRNAs.
