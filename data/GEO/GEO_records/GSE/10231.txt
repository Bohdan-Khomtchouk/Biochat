TITLE
Gene expression oocyte quality in the hen

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to assess the impact of oocyte competence on subsequent fertility. Based on knowledge already accessible in mammals and on bioinformatics tools including the chicken genome sequence, we focused on the expression of genes involved in the processes of fertilization and of early embryo development. The study was performed using two complementary approaches: a descriptive study of standard laying hens and then a differential study performed with hens from experimental lines expressing broad variations of achieved fertility (approximately 20 per cent). A differential kinetic study is performed on INRA lines selected on the basis of their fertility potential in purpose of hopefully access gene markers of fertility performance. Keywords: oocyte competence, fertility

DESIGN
All the samples were bissected from the F1 oocyte stage , and DPF+ and DPF- samples were compared in order to find differentially expressed genes that could explain the difference in fertility occuring between the two divergently selected lines. HG+ and HG- samples were compared in order to find differentially expressed genes that could explain the difference in fertility occuring between a single line. Indeed we hypothesize that mechanisms and genes related to fertility between 2 lines or in a single one might be different. This study had 8 samples (a biological replicate of each sample) : DPF+ F1 1 and DPF+ F1 2 DPF- F1 1 and DPF- F1 2 HG+ F1 1 and HG+ F1 2 HG- F1 1 and HG F1 2
