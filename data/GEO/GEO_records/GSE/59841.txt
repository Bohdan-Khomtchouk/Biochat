TITLE
GIST cell cycle dysregulation is required for progression to high-risk disease but not for resistance to kinase inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: To understand the transcriptional consequences of a TP53 modulation in the GIST cell context, we treated GIST430 with increasing doses of the MDM2-inhibitor nutlin-3 (racemate).

DESIGN
In this study, 3’ end RNA Sequencing (3SEQ) was used to expression profile GIST430 cell lines treated with DMSO and Nutlin-3, 2.5µM or 10µM for 18h. Then the gene expression profiles between these concentrations were compared.

PLATFORM
