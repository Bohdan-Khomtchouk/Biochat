TITLE
Gene expression profiling of caffeic acid phenethyl ester-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells-2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), derived from various plant sources, has been shown to ameliorate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in vivo, and this has been attributed to its ability to reduce the oxidative stress. Here we investigated the cytoprotection of CAPE against menadione (MD)-induced oxidative stress in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to evaluate potential gene expression involvement. CAPE exhibited dose-dependent cytoprotection of HUVEC that required preincubation. A gene screen with microarrays was performed to identify the potential cytoprotective gene(s) induced by CAPE. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was highly upregulated by CAPE and this was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting. Keywords: gene expression in HUVEC, CAPE cytoprotective dose response
