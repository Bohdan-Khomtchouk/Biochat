TITLE
Expression analysis of Danio rerio semaphorin6a and plexinA2 morpholino-injected embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in Danio rerio semaphorin6A and plexinA2 morphant animals, compared to the wild-type strain. The morphants analyzed in this study are further described in Ebert AM, Childs SJ, Hehr C, Cechmanek PB, McFarlane S. 2014. Sema6a and Plxna2 mediate spatially regulated repulsion within the developing eye to promote eye vesicle cohesion. Development 141(12):2473-2482.

DESIGN
A twelve chip study using total RNA recovered from four replicates of control, semaphorin6a morpholino-injected and plexinA2 morpholino-injected 18 hour postfertilization rx3:GFP zebrafish embryos. Samples were run on a NimbleGen Zebrafish Gene Expression 385K Microarray
