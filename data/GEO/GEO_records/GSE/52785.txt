TITLE
Analysis of transgene siRNAs and ARL-8-dependent siRNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We analyzed the C. elegans small RNA response to high copy transgene sequences expressed in the soma in a wild type and an eri-6/7 mutant background. We also analyzed small RNA defects in the arl-8(tm2472) mutant. Transgene siRNAs are 22 nt long, mostly antisense, and correspond to the promoter, coding regions, the 3'UTR and plamsid sequences present on the transgene.  Transgene siRNAs are decreased in the eri-6/7 mutant. In the arl-8 mutant, 26G siRNAs in the ALG-3/4 dependent endogenous RNAi pathway are decreased.

DESIGN
Sequencing small RNAs from C. elegans transgenic strains and mutants.
