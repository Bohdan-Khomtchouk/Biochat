TITLE
Expression data in Arabidopsis Col-0 with cold acclimation (CA) treatment and subsequent cold deacclimation (DA) treatment.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand mRNA expression pattern during cold acclimation and deacclimation, transcriptional profiling of cold acclimation and deacclimation-treated plants were analyzed using Agilent-015059 Arabidopsis 3 Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis Col-0 were grown on MS plate for 2 weeks (16 hours light / 8 hours dark). Two week-old Arabidopsis samples (NA, non acclimation) were treated with cold (2 ÂºC) for 7 days (CA7d) under 12h/12h light/dark conditions. Deacclimation-treated samples (DA6h, DA12h, DA24h) were grown at normal growth temperature under long day conditions after cold treatment for 7 days. Then total RNA was prepared from the whole seedling and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each array were carried out using the independent biological samples.
