TITLE
Transcriptomic profiling of cardiac remodeling in high phosphate exposed cardiomyoblasts

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by vascular calcification and cardiac remodeling. CKD induced cardiac hypertrophy precedes cardiac fibrosis and is associated with left ventricular dysfunction. Elevated phosphate concentration due to renal failure is known to be involved in cardiac remodeling.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic analysis of differentially expressed genes in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts treated with high phosphate by RNA-Seq and pathway analysis.
