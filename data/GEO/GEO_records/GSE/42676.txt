TITLE
Functional genomics in perinatal asphyxia and fetal asphyctic preconditioning in the brain

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Fetal asphyctic (FA) preconditioning is effective in attenuating brain damage incurred by a subsequent perinatal asphyctic insult. Unraveling mechanisms of this endogenous neuroprotection, activated by FA preconditioning, is an important step towards new clinical strategies for asphyctic neonates. Genomic reprogramming is thought to be, at least in part, responsible for the protective effect of preconditioning. Therefore, we investigated whole genome differential expression in the preconditioned rat brain.

DESIGN
FA preconditioning was induced on embryonic day 17 (E17) by reversibly clamping the uterine circulation. Perinatal asphyxia (PA) was induced while pups were being born by caesarean section; the uterine horns, including pups, were placed in a water bath for 19 minutes. FAPA pups underwent both procedures. Control (C) pups did not undergo FA or PA procedures, but were born by caesarean section. Pups were sacrificed at 3 time-points: 96 hours after FA (E21), 6 hours after birth/PA (P0), and 96 hours after birth/PA (P4).
