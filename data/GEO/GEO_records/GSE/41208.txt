TITLE
In vitro generation of long-lived human Plasma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of B-cells from a model differentiation series: from Na√Øve B-cells, through a proliferative plasmablast stage to long-lived antibody secreting plasma cells.

DESIGN
B-cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of three adult donors and differentiated in vitro (see individual samples for culture conditions)
