TITLE
Sputum cell gene expression following allergen challenge

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sputum cells collected before (visit 2) and after (visit 4) allergen challenge in asthma patients were isolated and RNA purified for analysis on gene expression arrays. Human subject recruitment part of NIH sponsored protocol as part of the Eosinophil Program Project Grant (PI: Dr. Nizar Jarjour)

DESIGN
Sputum cell RNA collected from induced sputum cells before and 48 hours after whole-lung allergen challenge.
