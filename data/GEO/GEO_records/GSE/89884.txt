TITLE
DLX3 binding sites in Supabasal Keratinocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DLX3 is a homeodomain transcription factor involved in epidermal differentiation.  Here we investigated the distribution of DLX3 DNA binding sites in suprabasal differentiating keratinocytes using ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
Suprabasal keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal mice epidermis by Percoll gradient and used for ChIP-seq analysis using anti-DLX3 and anti-H3K4me3 antibodies.

PLATFORM
