TITLE
Microarray analysis of gene expression in HDAC9-knockdown macrophages.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of HDAC9 in innate immnue, we measured the gene expression profile in HDAC9-knockdown macrophages in the absence of innate stimuli by gene-chip in order to find wherther HDAC9 knockdown affect the innate immune factor. We found knockdown of HDAC9 barely affected transcription of innate immnue signaling transducers. HDAC9, as a class IIa HDAC, shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Here we showed that high expression of cytoplasmic HDAC9, maybe play a Post-translational regulation role in macrophages.

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages transfected with control siRNA, as control group, or transfected with HDAC9 siRNA,as experimental group, and 48 hr later extracted total RNA
