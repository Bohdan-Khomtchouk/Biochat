TITLE
Flag-RBM47 HITS-CLIP in brain metastatic derivatives of MDA-MB-231

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Brain metastatic breast cancer cells were subjected to HITS-CLIP to identify the targets of the RNA binding protein RBM47 MDA231-BrM2a is characterized in PMID: 19421193;  Related data published together with these data are found in GSE53779

DESIGN
Non-clonal brain metastatic breast cancer cells stably expressing Flag-tagged, wild-type RBM47 under a doxycline-inducible promoter were treated for three days with doxycycline then  UV-irradiated and subjected to Flag HITS-CLIP

PLATFORM
