TITLE
Gene Expression Response to Interferon Treatment at 12h and 24 in A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to use global gene expression profiling to understand human lung epithelial cellular responses to interferon treatment.

DESIGN
A549 cells were treated individually with IFN-α (10 ng ml−1; Sigma I4276), IFN-β (500 U ml−1; Sigma I4151) and IFN-γ (10 ng ml−1; Sigma I32265) or mock-treated. At 12 and 24 h post-treatment, cells were harvested (n = 3 wells per condition) and total RNA was extracted and analysed by microarray. Individual well replicates were pooled for each array by combining equal masses of total RNA (n=1 array per time point for each treatment and control).
