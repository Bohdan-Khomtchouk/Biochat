TITLE
Age and Nursing Affect the Neonatal Porcine Uterine Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Age- and lactocrine-sensitive elements of the neonatal porcine uterine developmental program are undefined. Here, effects of age and nursing for 48 h from birth (postnatal day = [PND] 0) on the uterine transcriptome at PND 2 were identified using RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
Pig uterine tissues were obtained from neonatal gilts (n = 4/group) within 1 h of birth [postnatal day (PND) 0], or 48 h after nursing ad libitum (PND 2N), or feeding a commercial milk replacer (PND 2R).
