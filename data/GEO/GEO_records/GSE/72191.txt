TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Cucumber and Botrytis cinerea Transcriptome Changes During Infection

ORGANISM
Cucumis sativus

SUMMARY
Purpose:  The goals of this study are using RNA-seq to obtain cucumber and Botrytis cinerea transcriptome changes during infection Methods: mRNA profiles of anti-infection samples and interaction sample  were generate  by deep sequencing,using Illumina Hiseq 2500. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT–PCR validation was performed using  SYBR Green assays Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow,In total, 248,908,688 raw reads were generated; after removing low-quality reads and those containing adapter and poly-N, 238,341,648 clean reads remained to map the reference genome.  There were 3,512 cucumber (differential expression genes) DEGs and 1,735 B. cinerea DEGs. GO enrichment and KEGG enrichment analysis were performed on these DEGs to study the interaction between cucumber and B. cinerea. To verify the reliability and accuracy of our transcriptome data, 5 cucumber DEGs and 5 B. cinerea DEGs were chosen for RT-PCR verification. Conclusions:To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of large-scale transcriptome changes of cucumber during the infection of Botrytis cinerea. These results will increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the cucumber defense Botrytis cinerea and may be used to protect plants against disasters caused by necrotrophic fungal pathogens.

DESIGN
