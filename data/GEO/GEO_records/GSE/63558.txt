TITLE
Mesenchymal cancer cell-stromal crosstalk promotes niche activation, epithelial reversion and metastatic colonization

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The experiment was design to address the intrinsic differences between metastatic cancer stem cells in the primary tumour and during metastatic colonization in the mouse mammary gland tumour model MMTV-pyMT.

DESIGN
Total RNA was prepared from the  indicated cancer cells freshly isolated, stained and  FACS sorted either from primary tumours or from lungs upon intravenous injection of cancer cells.
