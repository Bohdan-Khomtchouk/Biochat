TITLE
Distribution of p27- and PCAF binding sites (BS) on the chromatin of HCT116 cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptional programs regulated by PCAF and p27 in the colon cancer cell line HCT116 by ChIP-seq. We identified 269 protein-encoding genes that contain both p27 and PCAF binding sites being the majority of these sites different for PCAF and p27

DESIGN
4 samples were analyzed in total. 2 input samples: asynchronously growing (input PCAF) and G0 synchronized (input p27) HCT116 cells. 2 reference samples: PCAF_ChIPseq and p27_ChIPseq
