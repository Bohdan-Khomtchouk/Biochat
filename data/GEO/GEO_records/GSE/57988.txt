TITLE
Knock out of NOTCH1-bound MYC enhancer (N-Me)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Gene Expression in KO mice lacking the NOTCH1-bound MYC putative enhancer located at +1.43K downstream of the MYC gene. Enrichment of MYC signature genes were analyzed by GSEA. Results show that MYC expression signature is indeed significantly enriched.

DESIGN
Conditional Knockout or WT mice were treated with Tamoxifen or Veicle
