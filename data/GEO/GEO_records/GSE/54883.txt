TITLE
The coding and noncoding architecture of the Caulobacter crescentus genome

ORGANISM
Caulobacter crescentus NA1000

SUMMARY
Caulobacter crescentus undergoes an asymmetric cell division controlled by a genetic circuit that cycles in space and time.  We provide a universal strategy for defining the coding potential of bacterial genomes by applying ribosome profiling, RNA-seq, global 5’-RACE, and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data to the 4-megabase C. crescentus genome.  We mapped transcript units at single base-pair resolution using RNA-seq together with global 5’ RACE.  Additionally, using ribosome profiling and LC-MS, we mapped translation start sites and coding regions with near complete coverage.  We found most start codons lacked corresponding Shine-Dalgarno sites although ribosomes were observed to pause at internal Shine-Dalgarno sites within the ORF.  These data suggest a more prevalent use of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence for ribosome pausing rather than translation initiation in C. crescentus.  Overall 19% of the transcribed and translated genomic elements were newly identified or significantly improved by this approach providing a valuable genomic resource to elucidate the complete C. crescentus genetic circuitry that controls asymmetric cell division.

DESIGN
Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data were collected in Caulobacter crescentus NA1000 cells grown in M2G and PYE media to map transcript and ORF features in the genome.
