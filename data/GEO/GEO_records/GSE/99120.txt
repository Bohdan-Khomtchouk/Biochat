TITLE
RNA-Seq of hematopoietic stem cells from vehicle and estrogen-treated mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: The goals of this study were to determine genes in HSCs that are regulated by estrogen. Methods: mRNA profiles of vehicle and estrogen treated wild-type (WT) and Esr1fl/fl;Mx1-Cre (ERa-KO) HSCs were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 and Ion Torrent Proton platforms. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level using DE-Seq2. qRTâ€“PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of vehicle and estrogen treated wild-type (WT) and Esr1fl/fl;Mx1-Cre (ERa-KO) HSCs were generated by deep sequencing using Ion Torrent platform

PLATFORM
GPL18635 Ion Torrent Proton (Mus musculus)
