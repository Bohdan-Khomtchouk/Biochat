TITLE
Sequencing of messenger RNAs with N6-methyladenosine modifications in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with and without forced expression of FTO

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify potential mRNA targets of FTO whose m6A levels are affected by FTO in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, we conducted m6A-seq for messenger RNAs isolated from AML cells with and without forced expression of FTO.

DESIGN
We retrovirally transduced MSCV-PIG-FTO (i.e., human FTO) or MSCV-PIG (i.e., CTRL/Control) into human MONOMAC-6/t(9;11) AML cells and then selected individual stable clones under selection of puromuycin (0.5ug/ml). Four stable lines including two each FTO-overexpressing lines (i.e., FTO+ 1 and FTO+ 2; or FTO_1 and FTO_2) and control lines (i.e., WT 1 and WT 2; or Ctrl_1 and Ctrl_2) were selected for genome-wide m6A-sequencing (m6A-Seq) assays. The m6A-seq procedure was performed as detailed in Dominissiniâ€™s method (Dominissini D., et al. Nat Protocols. 2013; 8: 176-189.). Polyadenylated RNA was extracted using FastTrack MAG Maxi mRNA isolation kit (Life technology). RNA fragmentation Reagents (Ambion) was used to randomly fragment RNA. M6A antibody (Synaptic Systems) was applied for m6A pull down. And final library preparation was constructed by TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Final library was quantified by BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip then deeply sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500.
