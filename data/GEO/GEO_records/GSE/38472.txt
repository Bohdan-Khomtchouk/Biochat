TITLE
Replication-Timing Boundaries Facilitate Cell-type and Species-specific Regulation of a Rearranged Human Chromosome in Mouse

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In multicellular organisms, developmental changes to replication timing occur in 400-  800 kb domains across half the genome. While clear examples of epigenetic control of  replication timing have been described, a role for DNA sequence in mammalian  replication timing has not been substantiated. To assess the role of DNA sequences in  directing these changes, we profiled replication timing in mice carrying a genetically  rearranged Human Chromosome 21 [Hsa21]. In two distinct mouse cell types, Hsa21  sequences maintained human-specific replication timing, except at points of Hsa21  rearrangement. Changes in replication timing at rearrangements extended up to 900 kb  and consistently reconciled with the wild-type replication pattern at developmental  boundaries of replication-timing domains. Our results demonstrate DNA sequencedriven  regulation of Hsa21 replication timing during development and provide evidence  that mammalian chromosomes consist of multiple independent units of replication timing  regulation.

DESIGN
Profile comparison of fibroblast and T-cell cultures from trans-chromosomic mice and human and mouse controls.
