TITLE
Saccharomyces cerevisiae response to Octanoic and Decanoic acids

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study, we present an investigation of the yeast response to the exposure to octanoic and decanoic acids, two major fermentation inhibitors. Aerobically grown cells of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae U13 wine strain have been exposed to 0,05 mM of octanoic and decanoic acid. We have compared the variations of expression induced by the acid challenges in comparison to a reference non trated modality, as well as the two acid responses. The transcriptome analysis is build in a triangular design in which the RNA extracted from three modalities :  reference (non treated cells) , cells exposed to  octanoic acid, and cells exposed to decanoic acid are compared.

DESIGN
12 samples have been analyzed in a triangular design (4 samples per modalit√©), four references (non treated cells), four samples exposed to octanoic acid, four samples exposed to decanoic acid
