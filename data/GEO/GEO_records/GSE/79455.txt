TITLE
Genome-wide microRNA expression profiling in tunicamycin treated NIH3T3 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NIH 3T3 cells were challenged with tunicamycin for 2, 5 or 10h. MICRO-RNAs that are upregulated or down regulated were identified by micro-ARRAY.

DESIGN
NIH 3T3 cell were challenged with 2ug/ml tunicamycin for 2, 5 or 10 hrs. Total RNA was purified using miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Microarray was carried out using GeneChipÂ® miRNA Arrays (Affymetrix, CA) and results were analyzed using GENESPRING software.  ANOVA and T-tests were used to calculate fold change and p-values.  Spotfire (Somerville, MA) software was used to generate heat maps.
