TITLE
Genome-wide Transcriptional Analysis of Genes Associated with Desiccation Stress in Anopheles gambiae

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes play an important role in malaria transmission. In sub-Saharan Africa, the dry season can last several months. The mechanisms for mosquito population to survive through the dry season are poorly understood.  One possible mechanism is that adults increase their desiccation tolerance over the dry season. Genetic analyses have shown that inversions 2La, 2Rb, 2Rc, 2Rd and 2Ru are associated with aridity resistance, however little is known about the transcriptional response of genes in response to desiccation. The results of the present study demonstrate that desiccation affects expression of genes associated with several mosquito physiological mechanisms, including those that protect against water loss, but all structural related genes decreased their expression. The identified differentially expressed genes in response to desiccation stress can lay a foundation for better understanding of molecular mechanisms underling dry-season survival of An. gambiae mosquitoes, so it may provide a different option for malaria vector control.
