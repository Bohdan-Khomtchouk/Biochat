TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the ethanol tolerant strain HG228 in comparison to its parental strain Escherichia coli MG1655

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli ; Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment is to identify the pathways that are deregulated as part of an adaptive response to high levels of ethanol in the media.

DESIGN
Ethanol tolerant cells (HG228) grown in minimal media plus 1.5% (v/v) ethanol were hybridized against E. coli MG1655 grown under similar conditions. The experiment was done in duplicates using biological replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL10286 Escherichia coli whole-genome tiling array (2 x 105K)
