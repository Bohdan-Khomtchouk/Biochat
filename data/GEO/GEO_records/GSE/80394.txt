TITLE
Expression data from yeast exposed to Caspofungin (wild type strain and rlm1, slt2, msn2/4 and bcy1 mutants) and Aminocandin (wild type strain)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We did transcription profiling on the effect of rlm1 (MAPK Slt2 transcription factor) deletion, slt2 (MAPK of Cell wall intregity pathway) deletion, bcy1 (Regulatory subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)) deletion and msn2/4 (Stress-responsive transcriptional activators) deletion in genes involved in Caspofungin response (2 hours of treatment). In addition, we analyzed the genome-wide expression profile of the wild type strain in response to Aminocandin (2 hours of treatment).

DESIGN
For Caspofungin treatment, six biological samples for wild type strain, three biological samples for rlm1, slt2 and msn2/4 mutants and two biological samples for bcy1 mutant were analyzed . Two biological samples were analyzed for wild type strain in response to Aminocandin. Two microarray experiment were carried out for each biological sample:  1. absence of the drug   2. presence of 15 ng/ml of Caspofungin or Aminocandin for two hours
