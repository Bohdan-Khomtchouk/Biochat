TITLE
Global DNA methylation changes in Nile tilapia gonad during high-temperature induced masculinization

ORGANISM
Oreochromis niloticus

SUMMARY
In fish, the sex determining mechanisms can broadly be classified as genotypic (GSD), temperature-dependent (TSD), or genotypic plus temperature effects (GSD+TE). For the fish species with TSD or GSD+TE, extremely high or low temperature can affect its sex determination and differentiation. For long time, the underlying changes in DNA methylation that occur during high or low temperature induced sex reversal have not been fully clarified. In this study, we used Nile tilapia as a model to perform a genome-wide survey of differences in DNA methylation in female and male gonads between control and high temperature induced groups using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP). We identified the high temperature induction-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and performed functional enrichment analysis for genes exhibiting DMR. These identified differentially methylated genes were potentially involved in the connection between environmental temperature and sex reversal in Nile tilapia.

DESIGN
In this study, four samples (control females, CF; control males, CM; induced females, IF; induced males, IM) were analyzed.
