TITLE
Gene expression analysis of human lymphoblastoid cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-immortalised B cells, LcL) obtained from subjects of different age (young 28-40 years, centenarians > 95 years) were analysed for gene expression at basal culture conditions and after 48 hours of serum starvation. Lymphoid B cells from centenarians were more resistant to apoptosis induction and displayed a more developed lysosomal compartment, the most critical component of phagic machinery. In addition, cells from centenarians were capable of engulfing and digesting other cells, i.e. their siblings (even entire cells). This behavior was improved by nutrient deprivation, but strikingly, it was unaffected by the autophagy-modulating drugs rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, and 3-methyladenine, an autophagy inhibitor.

DESIGN
12 samples, divided into 4 groups: young basal, young starved, centenarians basal and centenarians starved.
