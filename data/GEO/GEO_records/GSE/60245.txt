TITLE
The effects of putative lipase and wax ester synthase/acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase gene knockouts on triacylglycerol accumulation and transcriptome expression in Gordonia sp. KTR9.

ORGANISM
Gordonia sp. KTR9

SUMMARY
Gene disruption of KTR9_0186 resulted in a 2-fold increase in TAG content in nitrogen starved cells. Lipase mutants subjected to carbon starvation, following nitrogen starvation, retained 75% more TAGs and retained pigmentation. Transcriptome expression data confirmed the deletion of KTR9_0186 and identified the up-regulation of key genes involved in fatty acid degradation, a likely compensatory mechanism for reduced TAG mobilization. The Gordonia sp. KTR9 strain used in this study has been previously described (PMID 16332812)

DESIGN
A 12 x 135K array study using total RNA recovered from triplicate cultures of KTR9 under carbon starvation and triplicate cultures of KTR9 0186 Mutant under carbon starvation.
