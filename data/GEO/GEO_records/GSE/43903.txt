TITLE
Gene expression data from human induced Pluripotent Stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human induced Pluripotent Stem cells (hiPSc) and their differentiated progeny have great potential for modelling disease. To realise this potential, robust protocols need to be developed for deriving authentic differentiated cell lineages and these lineages need to be rigorously characterised. We have generated hiPSc using retrovirus-mediated delivery of reprogramming factors, and have used them for characterising mid-brain dopaminergic neurons. hiPSc lines have been screened using SNP array to assess chromosomal stability, and validation of the pluripotency of the hiPSc lines is provided by Pluritest assessment of transcriptome datasets. A mature physiological cellular model of human dopaminergic neurons.

DESIGN
human iPSc lines were derived from normal human dermal fibroblasts.
