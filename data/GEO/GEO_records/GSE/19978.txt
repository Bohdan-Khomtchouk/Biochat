TITLE
Different gene expressions in root tips between CLE10 and CLE25 treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Cellâ€“cell communication is critical for tissue and organ development. In plants, secretory CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-related (CLE) peptides function as intercellular signaling molecules in various aspects of tissue development. However, little is known about intracellular signaling pathways functioning in vascular development downstream of the CLE ligands. To elucidate CLE signaling pathway, we performed GeneChip analysis.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis roots were treated with chemically synthesized CLE10, or CLE25 at 1000 nM for 12 hours. Comparisons between CLE10 and CLE25 treatment will highlight the genes involved in the cause of different effects.
