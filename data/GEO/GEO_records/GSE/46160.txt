TITLE
RIP-Seq analysis of Trypanosoma brucei ELAV-like protein Tb927.8.6650

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma brucei

SUMMARY
A tagged ectopic version of the ELAV-like protein Tb927.8.6650 of T. brucei was expressed in stable cell lines and pulled down. Co-purifying transcripts were analyzed by sequencing to identify RNAs associated with Tb927.8.6650.

DESIGN
Stable procyclic form cell lines expressing tetracycline-inducible TAP-tagged Tb927.8.6650 were created. Cells were harvested 48h after tet-induction, followed by tandem affinity purification of Tb927.8.6650, extraction of co-purified RNA, and sequencing.
