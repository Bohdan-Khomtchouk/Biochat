TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis petioles in early stage dense canopy

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Growth in dense stands induces shade avoidance responses. Early responses to neighbors seem to be assoctaed with touch, not light signalling. We studied gene expression in petioles during early canopy development when leaf hyponasty was visible but altered phytochrome signalling was not yet detectable.

DESIGN
Plants were grown in small pots that were either kept single, or put in a high density of 2066 plants/m2. Gene expression measured in petioles when canopies had reached a leaf area index of 0.9.
