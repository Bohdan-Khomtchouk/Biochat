TITLE
Neocortical and hippocampal gene expression in kainate- and nicotine-injected juvenile mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To examine irreversible changes in the developing brain following seizures, juvenile inbred mice were intraperitoneally injected with kainate and nicotine. Keywords: seizure induction

DESIGN
Kainate and nicotine were dissolved in sterile saline, and intraperitoneally injected into postnatal day 23 males at a dose of 15 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively. Control mice received a comparable injection of saline. The injection was repeated three times at 2-hour intervals in the daytime, and after one week, the P30 survivors were sacrificed for sample preparation. Neocortices and hippocampi were isolated from mice that had received the repeated injections of saline, kainate, and nicotine (n=6, 5, and 6 mice, respectively).
