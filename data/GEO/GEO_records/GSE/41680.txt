TITLE
TRANSCRIPTIONAL EFFECTS OF INHIBITING EGFR IN KERATINOCYTES

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EGFR activation is important in human epithelial malignancies, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, lung, colon, pancreatic and other cancers. Therapies targeting EGFR are currently used to treat such cancers, but one significant drawback to EGFR inhibitor therapies is the associated skin toxicity. This toxicity usually presents as papular or pustular folliculitis, dry skin with pruritus and hair and nails abnormalities. The side effects often limit the usefulness of EGFR inhibitors in cancer treatment. The transcriptional changes caused by EGFR inhibition in epidermal keratinocytes have not been extensively explored. To define the transcriptional changes caused by inhibition of EGFR in primary human epidermal keratinocytes, we treated these cells with Tyrphostin and compared treated and control cultures in parallel, using Affymetrix microarrays. Using metaanalysis approaches, we integrated the observed changes with a large set of already existing data on transcriptional profiling in epidermal keratinocytes. We found that EGFR inhibition suppresses expression of genes associated with keratinocyte proliferation, attachment and motility. Apoptosis is facilitated by both induction of proapoptotic and suppression of antiapoptotic genes. Surprisingly, EGFR inhibition induces expression of markers of epidermal differentiation.
