TITLE
DNA methylomes at base resolution of mouse embryonic fibroblasts in G1 and G2 phase of cell cycle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dramatic change in DNA methylation patterns and levels both globally and/or locus-specifically is associated with the process of cell lineage specification and somatic reprogramming. We found the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1), the enzyme that maintains 5-methylcytosine (5mC) after DNA replication, is tightly regulated by the progression of cell cycle. Upregulation of Dnmt1 was observed in cells with shortened G1 and G2 phase. We hypothesize that 5mC level is not completely recovered by Dnmt1 immediately after DNA replication. In the attempt to clarify DNA methylation status before and after DNA replication, we performed Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) to map genome-wide DNA methylation separately in G1 and G2 phase of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Cells of different cell cycle phases were sorted by flow cytometry after Propidium iodide (PI) staining. We find an average of 2% decrease of global DNA methylation in G2 phase compared with G1, with the trend more magnificent in high CpG density regions. Generally, the results indicate that the G1 phase of cell cycle is an important time window for the stability of DNA methylation inheritance.
