TITLE
ChIP-Seq of TBP in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The TATA binding protein (TBP) is a transcription factor that binds specifically to a DNA sequence called the TATA box upstream of the transcription start site. To gain insight into the genes occupied by TBP, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed to determine the genome-wide binding targets.

DESIGN
DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. ChIP was performed using an antibody against TBP.
