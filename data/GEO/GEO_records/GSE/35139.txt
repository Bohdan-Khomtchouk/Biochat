TITLE
Congenic dissection of a major QTL for methamphetamine sensitivity implicates epistasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified a congenic mouse with an introgressed region from the A/J donor inbred strain on an inbred C57BL/6J background that showed a reduced locomotor stimulant response to methamphetamine.   We conducted microarray analysis of the striatum from drug-naive female and male mice that were 6-9 weeks old.   The congenic region is on chromosome 11 and spans approximately 84-96 Mb.  There were two groups of mice used in the analysis:  B6 control mice versus congenic mice.  Congenic mice were collapsed across heterozygous and homozygous genotypes. All mice are on a C57BL/6J background.  Congenic mice differ only on chromosome 11 where they contain the introgressed A/J alleles from 84-96 Mb.

DESIGN
14 C57BL/6J wildtype mice and 14 B6.A/J congenic mice (84-96 Mb region from A/J strain) were examined for gene expression differences using striatal tissue (left and right punches pooled).  All mice were drug-na√Øve and were 6-9 weeks old at the time of sacrifice.
