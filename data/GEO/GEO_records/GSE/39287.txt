TITLE
Breakpoint analysis of transcriptional and genomic profiles uncovers novel gene fusions spanning multiple human cancer types (exon expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Custom Agilent 8 x 15K microarray interrogating exon level expression of a set of genes previously known to be involved in oncogenic rearrangements.  The goal of this study was to discover novel gene fusions by screening for exonic expression transitions within individual genes.

DESIGN
Sixteen cancer samples and cell lines, including eight positive controls with known gene fusions and eight sarcoma specimens, where gene fusions have yet to be discovered, were hybridized against a common reference mRNA control (pooled from 11 diverse cell lines)
