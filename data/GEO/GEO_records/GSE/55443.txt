TITLE
Candidates for bile acid-dependent PPARÎ±-target genes in mouse intestinal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In addition to their role as a digestive detergent, bile acids have the ability to modulate the expression of genes. The intestinal content of cholic acids (CA) fluctuated in response to the daily feeding-fasting cycle; therefore, we hypothesized that the temporal accumulation of CA may affect the expression of genes in intestinal epithelial cells. To screen bile acid-regulated genes, we performed oligonucleotide microarray analyses using RNA isolated from the CA-treated intestinal cells of mice. Several types of genes were screened as candidates for bile acid-regulated genes. They included genes that encoded lipid metabolism-related proteins, receptors, transcriptional factors, and plasma-membrane transporters.

DESIGN
Total 2 samples were derived from [1] vehicle (0.05% DMSO and 0.25% ethanol)-treated intestinal epithelial cells of mice and [2] cholic acid (CA)-treated intestinal epithelial cells of mice.
