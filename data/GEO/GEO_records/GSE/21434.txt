TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of the T. thermophilus HB8 response to tetracycline (low concentration)

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA in Thermus thermophilus HB8 wild-type strain at 5 min after the addition of 10 mM tetracycline.

DESIGN
Three wild-type strain of T. thermophilus HB8 were pre-cultured at 70 degC for 16 hours in 3 mL of TT medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. The cells (2 mL) were inoculated into 1 L of the same medium and then cultivated at 70Â°C for 5 hours (A600 value being ~0.47). Then the 10 mM of tetracycline was added into the medium, and continued cultivation. Cells were collected at 5 min time point after the addition of tetracycline, and then crude RNA was extracted. The expression of each mRNA was analyzed on a GeneChip.
