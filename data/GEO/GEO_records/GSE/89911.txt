TITLE
Identification of Zfs1 RNA targets

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We report RNAs associated with Zfs1 protein, identified by RIP-Seq, and also RNA differentially expressed in the zfs1∆ mutant

DESIGN
RNA-seq experiments were performed from cells growing in minimal media (EMM) at 25°C. In immunoprecipiation experiments, RNA associated with Zfs1-TAP protein was sequenced (strain FR1401). RNA associated to GFP-TAP protein was also sequenced to control for inespecific binding (strain FR1424). In differentially expression experiments, RNA was extracted from the wild type strain (PN4)  and from  the zfs1∆ mutant (FR434)
