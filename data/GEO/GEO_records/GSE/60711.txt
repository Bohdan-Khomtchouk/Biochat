TITLE
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of mouse lungs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Balb/cJ mouse received control RNAi or RNAi to 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (Ogg1) intranasally prior to the exposure for 1 h to a) glucose oxidase (1 mU) to induce OGG1-BER or  b) OGG1-BER product 8-oxoguanine (1 μM). We used SABiosciences Mouse Inflammatory Cytokines & Receptors PCR Array (PAMM-011A) to quantitate inflammatory gene expression dependent on OGG1 and its product 8-oxoguanine.

DESIGN
After intranasal challenge with glucose oxidase or 8-oxoguanine, mice were sacrificed and lungs were collected and processed to obtain RNA. Total pooled (n=5) RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript® III First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen), mixed with equal amounts of 2X SYBR Green Supermix (Qiagen) and 20 μl of reaction mixture was added to each well of the PAM-011A array. The reaction was evaluated using an ABI PRISM® 7000 Sequence Detection System using recommended settings by SABiosciences.
