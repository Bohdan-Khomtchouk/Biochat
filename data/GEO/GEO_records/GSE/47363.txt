TITLE
The impact of miR-542-3p on gene expression profile in U2OS cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression change in U2OS cells expression synthetic miR-542-3p mimics.

DESIGN
Forty-eight hours after transfection with negative miRNA mimics or miR-542-3p mimics, U2OS cells were subjected to RNA isolation.
