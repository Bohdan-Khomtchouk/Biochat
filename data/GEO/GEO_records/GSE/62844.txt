TITLE
Rfx6 target genes in the Min6b1 cell line, a pancreatic beta cell model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Increasing evidence suggests that loss of beta cell characteristics may cause insulin secretory deficiency in diabetes but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that Rfx6, whose mutation leads to neonatal diabetes in man, is essential to maintain key features of functionally mature beta cells in mice. Rfx6 loss in adult beta cells leads to glucose intolerance, impaired beta cell glucose sensing and to defective insulin secretion. This is associated with reduced expression of core components of the insulin secretion pathway including GLucokinase, the Abcc8/SUR1 subunit of  KATP channels and voltage-gated Ca2 channels, which are direct targets of Rfx6. Moreover, Rfx6 contributes to the silencing of the vast majority of “disallowed” genes, a group usually specifically repressed in adult beta cells, and thus to the maintenance of beta cell maturity. These findings raise the possibility that changes in Rfx6 expression or activity may contribute to beta cell failure in man.

DESIGN
Two ChIP-Seq experiments have been performed : 1) anti-HA ChIP-Seq on 3HA-Rfx6 transfected Min6b1 cells and 2) anti-HA ChIP-Seq on Min6b1 cells
