TITLE
Mouse whole kidney, Dot1lAC vs. Dot1lf/f mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of whole kidneys of adult Dot1lAC mice  comparing control kidneys of their littermates Dot1lf/f mice fed a normal pellet Na+ diet. Goal was to determine the effects of inactivation of histone H3 K79 methyltransferase Dot1l in Aqp2-expressing cells in Dot1lAC on global kidney gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Dot1lAC vs. Dot1lf/f. Biological replicates: Total kidney RNAs from 4 mice/genotype were mixed within the same genotype.
