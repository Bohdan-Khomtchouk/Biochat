TITLE
The neuronal transcription factor NeuroD and its impact on the regulation of dendricity and pigmentation of melanocytes in postinflammatory hyperpigmentation of human skin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to test the gene expression profile in postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, micoarray studies were performed.

DESIGN
Totally 14 subjects ( 7 at each phase) were treated by suction blister, and samples from treated area and corresponding control area ( from the same subjects) were taken at 1 week(t1), 2 weeks(t2), 4 weeks(t3), 6 weeks(t4), and 16 weeks(t5) after treatment. Paired samples from subject 6382 at  6th week were missing for microarray hybridization. Therefore, there are 138 array chips available for statistical analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
