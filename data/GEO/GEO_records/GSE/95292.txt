TITLE
Mantle cell lymphoma gene expression profiling array UPF1.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset contains 9 Illumina array spots with a samples of interest from the 12 spot array Illumina HumanHT-12. The following samples was analyzed, all samples were sorted using CD19-microbeads (Miltenyi): -patient´s primary lymphoma cells obtained from leukemized blood (P7-PBMC) -non-malignant B-cells isolated from peripheral blood of 5 healthy donors (CTRL) -lymphoma cell line designated UPF1G established from the patient´s primary lymphoma cells before cytarabine-based therapy 63 and 163 days from ex vivo culture (UPF1G-D63, UPF1G-D163) -lymphoma cell line designated UPF1H established from the patient´s primary lymphoma cells after cytarabine-based therapy 85 and 185 days from ex vivo culture (UPF1H-D85, UPF1H-D185) -UPF1G cells isolated from subcutaneously growing murine xenograft (UPF1G-SC) and from malignant murine ascites (UPF1G-A) -UPF1H cells isolated from subcutanouesly growing murine xenograft (UPF1H-SC) For xenotransplantation, NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice (referred to as NSG mice) were used.

DESIGN
Unsummarized data can be obtained from package using data(UPF1) command.
