TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of miRNAs in hepatic fibrosis and normal tissues.

SUMMARY
Aim: Hepatic fibrosis is a major worldwide medical problem and can develop into liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). Until now, there are no effective drugs for liver ﬁbrosis because the molecular mechanism of progression of liver fibrosis is not fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of small non-coding functional RNAs that play a key role in many biological processes. The purpose of this study was to clarify how the aberrant expression of miRNAs participates in development of the liver fibrosis in rat liver fibrosis model.  Methods: Fibrotic and paired normal liver tissues were collected and assesssed by deep sequencing technology. MiRNA proﬁling results were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and bioinformatics was used to predict miRNA targets.  Results: Nine deregulated miRNAs were induced in porcine serum (PS)-induced hepatic fibrosis versus normal liver. Further analysis revealed several signaling pathways (e.g., gap junction and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction) may be associated with hepatic fibrogenesis.  Conclusion: Several miRNAs are dysregulated in PS-induced hepatic fibrosis and seem to be closely associated with hepatic fibrogenesis. These results provide an experimental basis for understanding the mechanism of hepatic fibrosis.

DESIGN
We sequenced two samples, including case and control. Each sample has two replicates.
