TITLE
Gene expression in a resistance artery in 2 models of hypertension in the rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We investigated morphometric structure and gene expression by microarray analysis in a small diameter artery, branch of the saphenous artery (a resistance artery), in representative models of renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-dependent and glucocorticoid hypertension, using the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced hypertensive rat, respectively. Sixteen-week-old male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and age-matched spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used. Keywords: Comparison of global gene expression in resistance arteries of normotensive and genetically hypertensive rats and ACTH-treated rats.
