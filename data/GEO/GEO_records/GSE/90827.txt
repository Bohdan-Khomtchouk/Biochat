TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of Dmrta2 KO neural progenitor cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to use RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed by cortical neural progenitor cells upon loss of Dmrta2. Datasets were gathered from two separate mESC lines, Dmrta2-/- and a control Dmrta2-flox/flox

DESIGN
Three biological replicates samples were sequenced for each mESC line. The Dmrta2-flox/flox dataset was used as a control.
