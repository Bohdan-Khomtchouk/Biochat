TITLE
Cell Reprogramming experiment (reprogramming cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Cells were reprogrammed from cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes, in various conditions. These are the iCM cells (induced cardiomyocytes). There are both human and mouse arrays here, as seen below.

DESIGN
Microarrays were used to measure the overall degree to which cellular repogramming was successful, by comparing the reprogrammed cells to reference populations of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs).
