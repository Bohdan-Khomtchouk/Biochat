TITLE
Heterogeneity in SDF-1 production defines the vasculogenic potential of c-kit+ cardiac progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Five Cardiac Progenitor Clones Isolated were from the left ventricle of mouse heart. The 5 cardiac progenitor clones differ in morphology and vasculogenic potential. Total RNA was isolated and hybridized on mouse Affymetrix MOE_430_2 arrays to compare basal gene expression levels and correlate the gene expression with fuctional studies.

DESIGN
Five cardiac progenitor clones were analyzed. No fold changes were calculated. Hierachical clustering based on Gene Ontologies was examined based .
