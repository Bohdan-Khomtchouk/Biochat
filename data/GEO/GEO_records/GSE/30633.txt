TITLE
Mycobacterium smegmatis: I-SceI homing endonuclease generated genomic DNA damage (site(+), mgm182) vs control (site(-), mgm181)

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Mycobacterium smegmatis comparing a strain undergoing I-SceI generated DNA damage at a single genomic locus versus a control strain with no I-SceI recognition sequence in its genome (and thus not undergoing double strand DNA breaks Gene designations are from the original annotation, not the updated

DESIGN
Five conditions investigated: Log phase cultures without induction of I-SceI expression (T=0, -Atc), Log phase cultures induced to express I-SceI by the addition of ATc for 45 minutes (T=45, +ATc), Stationary cultures control without induction of I-SceI expression (T=0, -Atc), Stationary phase cultures induced to express I-SceI by the addition of ATc for 15 minutes (T=15, +ATc), and Stationary cultures induced to express I-SceI for 45 minutes by the addition of ATc (T=45, +ATc). 3 biological replicates of each strain for each experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL13909 JCVI PFGRC Mycobacterium smegmatis 22K v3 array designed primarily based on strain MC2 155 [ORF-centered version]
