TITLE
mRNA expression data for rat liver treated for 24h with RG3487 (180mg/kg po.) vs vehicle only (deionized water)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis followed by gene onthology pathway analysis revealed that “cell cycle” and “growth and proliferation” pathways were significantly affected in the high dose group at the 24h time point. No consistent gene expression changes related to nuclear receptor activation, in particular target genes of CAR, PXR or PPAR were observed at the 24h time point

DESIGN
Rat liver tissue was harvested 2h hours after treatment of rats with test compound or vehicle. Tissue was harvested in RNA-Later (Ambion Cat No 7021) for RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL1355 [Rat230_2] Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array
