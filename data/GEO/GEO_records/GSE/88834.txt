TITLE
H3K23me2 is a new heterochromatic mark in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
The lysine 23 of histone H3 (H3K23me2) positively correlates with H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, marks enriched in heterochromatic regions (Ho, J.W. et al., 2014; Garrigues, J.M. et al., 2015; Liu, T. et al., 2015), and negatively correlates with H3K36me2/3 and H3K23/27ac, modifications enriched in actively transcribed regions. Similarly to the reported distribution of H3K9me3 (Ho, J.W. et al., 2014; Garrigues, J.M. et al., 2015), H3K23me2 is enriched on autosomal arms and is depleted from the central regions of the autosomes and from most of the lenght of the X chromosome.

DESIGN
Genome-wide H3K23me2 distribution in wild type embryos.
