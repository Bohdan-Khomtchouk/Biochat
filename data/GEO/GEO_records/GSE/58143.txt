TITLE
Gene expression profile of gastric cancer stem cells after CD44 knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We did the microarray to further compare the changes of gene expression between gastric cancer stem cells with CD44 knockdown by lentivirus and gastric cancer stem cells by scamble short hairpin RNA.

DESIGN
Gastric cancer stem cells (Lentivirus) were infected with lentivirus that expressed human CD44-speciÔ¨Åc short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Control group of gastric cancer stem cells (Vector group) were only infected with scramble shRNA.

PLATFORM
