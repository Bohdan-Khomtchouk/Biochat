TITLE
Global expression profiling of ruptured and unruptured human intracranial aneurysms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The primary aim of the present study was to identify differences on the transcription level between ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms as well as normal intracranial arteries in human. Keywords: Expression profiling by array

DESIGN
Global gene expression profiling was performed in human intracranial aneurysms both ruptured (n=8) and unruptured (n=6) as well as in control intracranial arteries (middle meningeal artery, MMA; n=5) using oligonucleotide microarrays.

PLATFORM
