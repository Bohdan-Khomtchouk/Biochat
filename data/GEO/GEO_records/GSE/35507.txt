TITLE
CSB3 transcriptome analysis (Arabidopsis thaliana)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
In this study we show the comparative transcriptome of constitutive subtilisin3 (csb3) plants, an Arabidopsis mutant showing strikingly enhanced resistance to biotrophic pathogens. CSB3 encodes a 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase, the enzyme controlling the penultimate step of the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate via the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in the chloroplast. It has been proposed that CSB3 represents a point of metabolic convergence modulating the magnitude of SA-mediated disease resistance to biotrophic pathogens. We show that csb3 have increased expression  of a set of genes encoding defense-related proteins and enzymes,  which includes two subtilisins. In essence our results substantiates an important role of these two subtilases in the activation of defense-related signaling pathways against biotrophic pathogens.

DESIGN
5 five-week-old plants were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ÂºC. Samples from Col-0 and csb3 were compared.
