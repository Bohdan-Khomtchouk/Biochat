TITLE
Whole blood transcriptome analysis of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp, mycoides-infected cattle confirms immunosuppression but does not reflect local inflammation

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
In order to assess the use of whole blood transcriptome analysis to study cattle-Mmm interactions, we performed this study on 6 cattle, comparing the blood transcriptome before infection with the beginning of the clinical signs. Statistical analysis enabled Mmm-infected animals to be clearly distinguished from healthy ones. Functionnal analysis revealed that 680 genes were differentially expressed, confirming previous results as immunosuppression. Surprisingly, whoole blood transcriptome analysis didn't reflect inflammation, a highly characteristic local sign of these disease. This absence on inflammation signs results were confirmed by RT-qPCR.

DESIGN
Whole blood gene expression was measured for each of 6 animals before infection and at the beginning of the clinical signs of CBPP. A paired sample statistical analysis was performed to identify diferentially expressed genes between healthy and infected status.
