TITLE
Comparative genome-wide analysis of human BM IL3Rα-high precursors show a more MΦ-, DC- and OC committed gene expression profile, as compared to IL3Rα-low precursors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the lineage relationship between IL3Rαhigh- and IL3Rαlow precursor cells and to find potential molecules involved in their differentiation, we compared the IL3Rαhigh- and IL3Rαlow precursor populations from three independent donors by mRNA deep sequencing and used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)- and Multi-experimental Viewer (MeV) to analyze the differentially expressed genes (p < 0.001). Analysis of the protein coding genes showed that the samples from IL3Rαhigh precursor cells clustered together, as did the IL3Rαlow samples. This indicated that the gene expression patterns of these cells are likely to be conserved. Further analysis revealed a list of (649) differentially expressed molecules between the two populations.  Among these, most notably, genes involved in the differentiation of cell in general, amongst which differentiation of MΦ, OC and antigen presenting cells appeared to be activation increased.
