TITLE
Expression data from Irinotecan resistant LoVo cells comapred to parental LoVo cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Irinotecan, an analogue of camptothecin, is frequently used in combination with various anticancer drugs or as a single agent in treatment of colorectal cancer. But drug resistance of tumor is still a major obstacle to overcome for the success of cancer treatment. In this study, We established chronic irinotecan resistant cell line for new marker to increase the sensitivity to irinotecan and investigated gene expression profiles of the irinotecan-resistant colorectal cancer cell line.

DESIGN
To create stable CRC cell line chronically resistant to Irinotecan, LoVo cell was exposed to an initial Irinotecan concentration of 0.1 μmol/L in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. When the growth of the cultured cells reaches at 80% confluency,  cells were passaged twice at same drug concentration to ensure adaptation and then concentration of Irinotecan was sequentially increased in the same manner to 8 μmol/L and then we investigated the gene expressions between parental colorectal cancer cell line, LoVo and Irinotecan resistant LoVo cell lines
