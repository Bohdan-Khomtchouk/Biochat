TITLE
LIN28 cooperates with Wnt signaling to drive invasive intestinal and colorectal adenocarcinoma in mice and humans

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we investigated the role of LIN28 in intestinal tumor initiation and invasive progression. We generated animal models with just intestinal LIN28B overexpression, or in combination with Apcmin/+ background. The animals develop intestinal and colorectal tumors with histology ranging from adenoma to adenocarcinoma.

DESIGN
total RNA isolated from mouse small intestinal tumors with LIN28B overexpression, or duodenum and colon Apcmin tumors and LIN28B;Apcmin tumors

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
