Biology of adenocarcinomas of the esphagus and stomach

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients were recruited at the Departments of Abdominal Surgery and Endoscopy of the Hospital do Cancer AC Camargo (São Paulo/Brazil) during a 4-year period (2001 to 2004). All patients signed a pre-informed consent and the study was approved by the internal ethics committee. Tissue samples were either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (when obtained by surgery) or collected in RNAlaterTM (Ambion®, Austin, Texas USA, when obtained by biopsy).  For all samples, diagnosis was confirmed by H & E staining at the time of RNA extraction. Biopsy samples of the esophageal and gastric mucosa obtained by endoscopy had information of the correct anatomical location using a standard diagram. Frozen samples were dissected and only those having at least 70% of tumor cells were processed. A total of 71 samples were analyzed: 39 esophagus and esophagogastric junction samples (9 normal mucosa, 6 esophagitis mucosa, 10 Barrett's mucosa - 4 for the long type and 6 for the short type, and 14 tumor samples of adenocarcinoma) and 32 stomach samples (6 normal body and antrum mucosa, 5 normal cardiac mucosa, 9 intestinal metaplasia mucosa, 7 samples of intestinal type adenocarcinoma and 5 samples of diffuse type carcinoma). For Barrett's samples, diagnosis required evidence of intestinal metaplasia together with tongues or segments of red columnar-appearing epithelium extending upwards from the esophagogastric junction. A long Barrett's esophagus was defined as longer ?3cm and a short Barrett's esophagus by ?3cm of columnar epithelium (Spechler, 2004). The tumor samples of esophagus and esophagogastric junction were not differentiated. For the gastric adenocarcinoma samples were used the Laurén's classification (Laurén, 1965) and the others gastric sample were previously described (Meireles et al, 2003). Keywords: other
