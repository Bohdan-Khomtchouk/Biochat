TITLE
Fetal metabolic programing increases the susceptibility of cardiovascular diseases in the offspring due to maternal high-fat-diet during diabetic pregnancy

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Increasing trends of obesity in childbearing women with a concurrent gestational diabetes are often associated with adverse fetal metabolic cues. Not only the carbohydrates but also fats are considered to contribute additional dietary fuels to the fetal hearts. To examine the hitherto unknown epigenetic mechanisms on the offspring’s cardiometabolic health due to maternal high-fat (HF) diet (40% kcal) or streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic pregnancy, or both, we carried out an epigenetic characterization of neonatal heart tissue using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequening and a previously validated rat model. Chromatin landscape of offspring’s heart tissue revealed differential peaks distribution on various promoter regions mapped to the rat genome due to histone (H3) modifications by acetylation (H3Ac) or trimethylations of lysine 4 and 27 (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, respectively). Ongoing evaluations include gene ontology and disease ontology analyses. Together, it is expected that the findings will show that maternal HF-diet with or without gestational diabetes changes the cardiac histone signature in rat offspring, potentially leading to development of novel disease prevention strategies.

DESIGN
Examination of 3 different histone modifications in rat heart tissues.
