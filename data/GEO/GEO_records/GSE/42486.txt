TITLE
Expression analysis of miR-139-5p mimic-treated EC109 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in miR-139-5p mimic-treated EC109 cells, compared to the scrambled negative controls.

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate cultures of miR-139-5p mimic-transfected EC109 cells and two separate cultures of scrambled negative control-transfected EC109 cells.  Each chip measures the expression level of 44,049 genes from human esophageal cancer cell EC109 with three 60-mer probe pairs per gene.
