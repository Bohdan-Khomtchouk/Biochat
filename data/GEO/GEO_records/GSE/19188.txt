TITLE
Expression data for early stage NSCLC

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified a tumor signature of 5 genes that aggregates the 156 tumor and normal samples into the expected groups. We also identified a histology signature of 75 genes, which classifies the samples in the major histological subtypes of NSCLC. A prognostic signature of 17 genes showed the best association with post-surgery survival time. The performance of the signatures was validated using a patient cohort of similar size

DESIGN
A genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed on a cohort of 91 patients. We used 91 tumor- and 65 adjacent normal lung tissue samples. We defined sets of predictor genes (probe sets) with the expression profiles. The power of predictor genes was evaluated using an independent cohort of 96 non-small cell lung cancer- and 6 normal lung samples
