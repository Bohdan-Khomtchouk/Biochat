TITLE
Cell cycle gene expression control

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Gene expression data for cdc28-13 yeast released synchronously into the cell cycle.

DESIGN
cdc28-13 yeast were arrested in G1 for 3 hours at 37 degrees.  Cells were rapidly cooled to 25 C by mixing with an equal volume of media at 13 C, and time points were taken every 10 minutes. Cells were rapidly pelleted, and mRNA was isolated and hybridized against midlog mRNA.

PLATFORM
GPL1864 Yeast spotted cDNA microarray
