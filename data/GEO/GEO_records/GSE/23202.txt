TITLE
Expression data from Williams-Beuren Syndrome ES cell line (ESSP9)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Data present the expression analysis of two biological replicates of a mouse ES cell line with hemizygous deletion of WBSCR

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying WBS phenotype and identified distinct classes of deregulated genes.
