TITLE
RNA sequencing analysis of abdominal adipose tissue in 7 week old juvenile broiler chickens divergently selected for high or low body weight

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Chickens divergently selected for either high growth (HG genotype) or low growth (LG genotype) at SRA-INRA, France were used to profile abdominal adipose gene expression at 7 wk of age. The HG and LG chickens are different in various phenotypic and metabolic measurements, including growth rate, abdominal fat, plasma glycemia, insulinemia, T4, T3, triglyceride and NEFA. The HG and LG chickens are valuable as a model for biomedical and agricultural traits. Massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was completed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 System for transcription analysis of HG and LG abdominal fat. Need information on data processing, statistical analysis, and differential expression. Keywords: abdominal fat, divergently selected chickens, growth, transcriptional profiling, differentially expressed genes

DESIGN
Abdominal fat mRNA profiles of high growth (HG genotype) or low growth (LG genotype) chickens at 7 weeks of age were generated by deep sequencing (on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system).

PLATFORM
GPL16133 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Gallus gallus)
