TITLE
Subcutaneous adipose tissue: comparison of weight maintainence and weight regain following an 8-week low calorie diet

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The present study was designed to identify determinants that foreshadow successful weight maintenance. More specifically, we examined whether subcutaneous adipose tissue (scAT) gene expression of participants who experience successful weight maintenance following caloric restriction differed from that of participants who regain weight.

DESIGN
Forty women followed a dietary protocol consisting of an 8-week low calorie diet (LCD) and a 6-month weight maintenance phase. At the end of the protocol, participants were classified as weight maintainers (WM; 0-10% weight regain) and weight regainers (WR; 50-100% weight regain). Anthropometric measurements, plasma parameters, and scAT biopsies were taken before and after the LCD. Adipose tissue gene expression profiles were studied in all individuals before and after the LCD.
