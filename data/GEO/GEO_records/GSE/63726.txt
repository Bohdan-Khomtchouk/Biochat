TITLE
Gene expression profiles of fractionated cells from cirrhotic rat livers

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed in each of hepatocyte fraction and non-parenchymal cell fraction enriched with activated hepatic stellate cells/myofibroblasts from cirrhotic rat livers induced by repeated, low-dose diethylnitrosamine (DEN) treatment.

DESIGN
Male Wistar rats received weekly IP injections of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) at 50 mg/kg or vehicle control (PBS) for 18 weeks. Rats were weighed at the end of each week. Animals were sacrificed at 19 weeks after a one-week washout period to eliminate acute effects of DEN. Liver was perfused and hepatocyte and non-parenchymal cell (enriched with hepatic stellate cells) fractions were separated by gradient-based method. Isolated cell fractions were stored at -80Â°C until RNA extraction. Animals received humane care according to the criteria outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Academy of Sciences. All animals were maintained in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care.
