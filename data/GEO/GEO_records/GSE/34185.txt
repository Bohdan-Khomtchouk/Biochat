TITLE
Affymetrix gene arrays of leukemic BM samples from 24 mice including 9 primary

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify such targets of leukemia-related miRNAs such as miR-196b, we conducted Affymetrix gene arrays of leukemic BM samples from 24 mice including 9 primary (including 3 each of negative control, MLL-AF9, and miR-196b+MLL-AF9) and 15 secondary (including 3 negative control, 6 MLL-AF9, and 6 miR-196b+MLL-AF9) recipient mice

DESIGN
A total of 24 mouse bone marrow samples including 9 primary (including 3 each of negative control, MLL-AF9, and miR-196b+MLL-AF9) and 15 secondary (including 3 negative control, 6 MLL-AF9, and 6 miR-196b+MLL-AF9) obtained from the in vivo mouse bone marrow reconstitution assays were analyzed by use of Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetirx, Santa Clara, CA)
