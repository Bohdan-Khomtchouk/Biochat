TITLE
Whole-genome decay rate measurements in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with HNRPA2B1 siRNAs versus controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of MDA-MB-231 samples taken at 0, 1, 2 and 4hr timepoints upon exposure to alpha-amanitine, comparing the siRNA-mediated HNRPA2B1 knock-downs versus mock-transfected controls

DESIGN
4 biological replicates for each time point for the siRNA transfections and controls respectively

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
