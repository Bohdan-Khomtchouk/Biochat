TITLE
LncRNA and mRNA expression data  involved in benzene hematotoxicity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Benzene is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and an established human hematotoxicant and leukemogen. New insights into the pathogenesis of benzene hematotoxicity are urgently needed. Long non-coding RNA（lncRNA）can regulate gene expression and widely participate in the various physiological and pathological processes. Microarray analysis was used to identify the differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA that were likely to be critical for benzene hematotoxicity. An integrated analysis of lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles was performed to identify key hub genes, pathways and biological processes.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood samples were randomly obtained from four patients of chronic benzene poisoning, three benzene-exposed workers and three health controls without benzene exposure. The occupational history, age, gender, lifestyle such as smoking, drinking, recent drug use situation and medical history in each group were matched. Total RNA was extracted and an integrated analysis of lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles was performed by GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array (Affymetrix).
