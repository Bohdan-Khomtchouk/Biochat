TITLE
Phosphorylated and Sumoylation-Deficient Progesterone Receptors Drive Proliferative Gene Signatures During Breast Cancer Progression (Illumina gene expression analysis)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Anlaysis of the differential gene expression between T47D cells expressing wild type (WT) progesterone receptor isoform B (PR) or SUMOylation-deficient PR molecules.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from T47D breast cancer cells that express either WT PR-B or mutant PR-B (K388R, SUMO-deficient), treated with or without synthetic PR ligand R5020 for 6 h.

PLATFORM
