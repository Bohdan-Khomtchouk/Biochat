TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of Zfpm1 Function in Early Zebrafish Embryogenesis and Postembryonic Heart Development

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Through analyzing RNA-seq datasets in zfpm1 mutant embryo (36hpf) and maturing heart (21 dpf), we characterized the effects of loss of zfpm1 on the transcriptomic landscape.

DESIGN
Using RNA-seq to identify the downstream genes of zfpm1 on embryogenesis and cardiac chamber maturation.

PLATFORM
GPL23085 HiSeq X Ten (Danio rerio)
