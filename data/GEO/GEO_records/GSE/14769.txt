TITLE
Time course of bone marrow-derived macrophages simulated with LPS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The innate immune system is a two-edged sword; it is absolutely required for host defense against infection, but if left uncontrolled can trigger a plethora of inflammatory diseases.  Here we used systems biology approaches to predict and validate a gene regulatory network involving a dynamic interplay between the transcription factors NF-κB, C/EBPδ, and ATF3 that controls inflammatory responses.  We mathematically modeled transcriptional regulation of Il6 and Cebpd genes and experimentally validated the prediction that the combination of an initiator (NF-κB), an amplifier (C/EBPδ) and an attenuator (ATF3) forms a regulatory circuit that discriminates between transient and persistent Toll-like receptor 4-induced signals. Our results suggest a mechanism that enables the innate immune system to detect the duration of infection and to respond appropriately.

DESIGN
Bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated with LPS for 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 240 and 360 minutes.
