TITLE
RNA Seq of C2C12 cells stimulated with Control, Jag1-expressing or Jag1Ndr-expressing cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing of control or Notch1-expressing mouse cells co-cultured with control, Jag1WT, or Jag1Ndr-expressing human cells. Deep sequencing and bioinformatical separation of mouse and human reads reveals transcripts specifically regulated in mouse receptor-expressing cells.

DESIGN
Mouse C2C12 control and C2C12-FLNotch1, and human HEK-293-Flp-In cells (Hansson et al., 2010): HEK293-Flp control (Flp Ctrl), HEK293-Flp-Jag1WT (Flp Jag1+), HEK293-Flp-Jag1Ndr (Flp Jag1Ndr) were used in this experiment. In one 12-well plate, we seeded 3 wells of mouse C2C12 control cells and 3 wells of C2C12-FLN1 cells, with 3.6x105 cells in 1 mL antibiotic-free medium per well. Cells were allowed to settle for 8 hours. C2C12 control and C2C12-FLN1 cells were transfected with pcDNA5 (1.6 ug/well). All transfections were done using Lipofectamine® 2000 (InvitrogenTM, cat. no. 11668-019) with Opti-MEM® I Reduced Serum Medium (Gibco®, cat. no. 31985-062), according to manufacturer’s instructions. The following day (18 hours post transfection), 3.6x105 cells in 0.5 mL antibiotic-free medium of Flp Ctrl, Flp Jag1+, or Flp Jag1Ndr cells were added. Cells were co-cultured for 6 hours, then lysed in 350 uL per well Buffer RLT (QIAGEN, cat. no. 79216) with 1% 2-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich®, cat. no. M3148) and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction.
