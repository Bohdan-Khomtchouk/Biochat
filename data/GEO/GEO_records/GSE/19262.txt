TITLE
NPA-induced vascular overgrowth in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used N-(1-naphthyl) phthalamic acid (NPA)-induced vascular overgrowth in Arabidopsis leaves to look for differential up-regulation of genes in NPA-treated tissues that may be involved in vascular differentiation. Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants were grown for approximately 2 weeks on solid ATS medium (1) containing a final concentration of 10 um NPA (dissolved in DMSO) or an equivalent volume of DMSO (control). At this stage plants had approximately 6 rosette leaves. RNA was prepared from entire shoot tissues of control (DMSO) or NPA-treated plants.(1) Lincoln et al., 1990. Plant Cell 2: 1071-1080.

DESIGN
2 samples were used in this experiment.
