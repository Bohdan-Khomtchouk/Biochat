TITLE
Effect of fatty acids from CLA-enriched egg yolk on MCF-7 adenocarcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It was analyzed whole genome microarray data to describe the changes in gene transcription profile in human MCF-7 cancer cells under the influence of fatty acid extracts from CLA-enriched and non-enriched egg yolks.Those results might be found useful in assessing the application of CLA-enriched egg as a nutraceutics in cancer prevention.

DESIGN
Six-condition experiment: CLA, KT, cis9,trans11-CLA, trans10,cis12-CLA, KT+cis9,trans11-CLA and KT+trans10,cis12-CLA vs MCF-7 adenocarcinoma cell line. Two control of expreriment.  Three biological replicates and three technical replicates.

PLATFORM
