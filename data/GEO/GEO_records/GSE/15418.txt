TITLE
Analysis of non-coding RNAs in drn1∆ deletion strains

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The turnover of introns spliced from pre-mRNA occurs first by debranching the lariat intron followed by destruction of the linear intron by other nucleases.  We have identified a novel component of intron turnover, DRN1 (YGR093W).  In order to identify RNAs affected by Drn1 turnover, we used a microarray containing probes specific to ~400 yeast non-coding RNAs to analyze a strain deleted for Drn1.  These data implicated Drn1 in the turnover of a number of introns spliced from ribosomal-protein genes.

DESIGN
Two-color experiment with biological replicate and dye swap.
