TITLE
Differential gene expression after treatment of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells with CpG-oligo D19

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human monocyte-derived dendritic cell cultures devoid of contaminating plasmacytoid dendritic cells were treated with the D-type CpG-oligonucleotide D19, with the non-CpG-oligonucleotide control D, or were left untreated. Cells of all treatment groups stemmed from the same donor. 6 h after addition, cells were harvested, and total RNA was prepared for analysis of D19-dependent differential gene expression on Affymetrix HG-U 133A 2.0. Keywords: agent response

DESIGN
One sample per treatment-group. No replicates.

PLATFORM
