TITLE
Hsa-miR-375 in early breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose of the current study was to identify miRs that can differentiate between patients with and without local relapse after breast conserving therapy in early stage breast cancer, which is especially important in the context of individualized treatment selection.

DESIGN
The study was conducted in a pilot and a validation phase. First, 32 patients were screened for the most de-regulated miRs in a panel of 1250 miRs by microarray technology. Second, the candidate miRs were analyzed in an independent cohort of 115 patients using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
