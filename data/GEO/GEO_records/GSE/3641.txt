TITLE
Schistosoma japonicum gender-associated differentially expressed genes

ORGANISM
Schistosoma japonicum

SUMMARY
Suppression subtractive hybridization(SSH) libraries of Schistosoma japanicum female and male worms were constructed by using Clontech  PCR-selectTM  cDNA subtraction kit. S.japonicum cDNA microarrays were fabricated using female and male cDNA clones originating from SSH libraries. female-associated and Male-associated differentially expressed gene clones were obtained, Analysis of gender-associated differentially expressed genes helps to determine which genes are important to sexual maturation of schistosome and better understand schistosome biology and host-parasite relationship, facilitate the discovery of novel gene products that could represent targets for the development of new drugs and vaccines to control chitosomiasis. Keywords: gender-associated
