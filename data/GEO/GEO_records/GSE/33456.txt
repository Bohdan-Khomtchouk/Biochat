TITLE
Regulation of ykrL (htpX) by Rok and YkrK, a novel type of regulator in Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Expression of ykrL of Bacillus subtilis, encoding a close homologue of the Escherichia coli membrane protein quality control protease HtpX, was shown to be upregulated under membrane protein overproduction stress. Using DNA affinity chromatography, two proteins were found to bind to the promoter region of ykrL: Rok, known as a repressor of competence and genes for extracytoplasmic functions, and YkrK, a novel type of regulator encoded by the gene adjacent to ykrL, but divergently transcribed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed Rok and YkrK binding to the ykrL promoter region as well as YkrK binding to the ykrK promoter region. Comparative bioinformatic analysis of the ykrL promoter regions in related Bacillus species revealed a consensus motif, which was demonstrated to be the binding site of YkrK. Deletion of rok and ykrK in a PykrL-gfp reporter strain showed that both proteins are repressors of ykrL expression. In addition, conditions which activated PykrL (membrane protein overproduction, dissipation of the membrane potential, salt- and phenol stress) point to the involvement of YkrL in membrane protein quality control.

DESIGN
Samples for transcriptome analyses were induced at the exponential-growth phase (OD600 = 0.8) with 0.1% subtilin (subtilin containing supernatant of subtilin producing B. subtilis strain ATCC 6633). Cells were harvested 30 min after induction. Three independent cultures of each strain (target strains and controls) were used, and cells were sampled for microarray experiment. One of each strain was collected in double volume for technical replicates.
