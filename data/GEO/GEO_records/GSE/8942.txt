TITLE
Mouse colon expression in wild type and STAT5b deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulation of epithelial barrier function is dependent upon precise control of cell survival and activation of inflammatory pathways in response to the enteric flora. These experiments tested differential colon gene expression relative to these pathways in wild type and STAT5b deficient mice. Keywords: Single time point in wild type and STAT5b deficient mice.

DESIGN
Colon RNA was isolated from adult wild type and STAT5b deficient mice.
