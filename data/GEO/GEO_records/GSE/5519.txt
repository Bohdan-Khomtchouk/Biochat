TITLE
Expression data from H157 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells with and without DJ-1 expression knocked-down

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DJ-1 expression protects H157 cells from cell death, using siRNA oligomers we knocked down DJ-1 and evaulated gene expression using Affymetrix U133A GeneChip arrays. Keywords: siRNA comparison

DESIGN
H157 cells were transfected every 24 hours with siRNA oligomers for 3 consecutive days, lysed 96 hours after the first transfection, and total RNA extracted.  cRNA was generated and used to probe Affymetrix U133A GeneChip microarrays.
