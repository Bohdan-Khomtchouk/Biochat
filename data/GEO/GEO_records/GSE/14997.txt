TITLE
Expression data from young and adult mice after over expression of self MHC class l protein in skeletal muscle.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Over expression of MHC Class l protein in skeletal muscle causes myositis. Phenotype after expression in young mice is  more severe. We performed gene expression profiling on young and adult mice after over expression of self MHC class l protein in skeletal muscle

DESIGN
Muscle from young ( early) , adult (Late) and cntrol (control) mice , n=3 each group, was used for gene expression profiling
