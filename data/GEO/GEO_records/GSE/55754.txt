TITLE
Bmi1 defines long-term adult cardiac stem cells in heart homeostasis and repair

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have found the existence of a Bmi1+ population in the adult heart contributing to the organ low-rate turnover and repair with the generation of new cardiomyocytes. We show that the Bmi1+ population is a sub-population of the cardiac Sca-1+ progenitor cells.  We have analyzed the gene profile by deep-sequencing (RNA-Seq) of Bmi1+ and Sca-1+Bmi1- cells in homeostatic heart condition. On the other hand, we have compared gene profile by deep-sequencing (RNA-Seq) of Bmi1+ cells in homeostatic condition versus Bmi1+ cells 5 days after myocardial infarction (MI).  Analysis of RNA-Seq data revealed a differential expression signature between both subsets of cardiac stem/progenitors cells in homeostatic condition and also differences between Bmi1+ cells after AMI versus homeostatic condition.

DESIGN
Examination of gene profile of 2 different cardiac stem /progenitors subsets (Bmi1+ and Sca-1+Bmi1-) co-existing inthe adult heart under steady state. Examination of gene profile of Bmi1+ cardiac stem cells in homeostatic condition versus MI
