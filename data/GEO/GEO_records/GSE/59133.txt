TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of atmbd4, atmbd6 and atmbd11 mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Methyl CpG Binding (MBD) proteins are a class of protein that binds with methylated DNA. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana there are 13 MBD proteins are there. To understand the gene regulation we performed microarray analysis of mutants of three genes (atmbd4, atmbd6 and atmbd11). Ten day old seedlings of these three mutant were compared  with the wild type plants grown in same condition.

DESIGN
Surface sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were grown in MS media. Ten days old seedlings were used for isolation of RNA. The wild type plants along with T-DNA mutants of atmbd4, atmbd6 and atmbd11 were used to isolate the RNA. Three biological replicates of each sample were analyzed representing wild type, atmbd4, atmbd6 and atmbd11 of Arabidopsis.
