TITLE
Amiloride modulates alternative splicing in leukemic cells and re-sensitizes Bcr-AblT315I mutant cells to imatinib

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have discovered that amiloride can produce a genome-wide effect on alternative splicing of various RNA transcripts, most importantly including those of the apoptotic factors, in K562 leukemic cells.

DESIGN
Target was prepared from 4 biological replicates of 0.5 mM amiloride-treatment for 24hr and 3 control untreatment from K562 cells and hybridized to the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array. The values of the hybridized probesets were normalized and analyzed for gene expression using Partek software.
