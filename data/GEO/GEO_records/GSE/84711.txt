TITLE
Characterizing transcriptional responses of the Ishikawa cell line to ethinyl estradiol (EE; CAS #57-63-6) following 72 hour exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A toxicity pathway approach was taken to develop an in vitro assay using human uterine epithelial adenocarcinoma (Ishikawa) cells (ECACC cat#99040201) as a replacement for measuring an in vivo uterotrophic response to estrogens. As part of validating the use of this cell line, gene arrays were performed to confirm functional transcriptional responses to ethinyl estradiol (EE)

DESIGN
Ishikawa cells were treated with EE for 72 hours and then total RNA was isolated for gene expression anaylsis.  6 replicates were performed across 7 doses of EE.

PLATFORM
