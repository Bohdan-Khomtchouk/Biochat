TITLE
Expression data of Normal versus Mutant MPS VII Bl6 mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarray to detect pathway differences in the hippocampus in mucopolysaccharidosis type VII ( MPS VII ), a mouse model of a lysosomal storage disease Pathway changes were similar to those found in different strain where MPS VII mutation was backcrossed on a C3h-heouj background and implicated immune, vesicle and other pathways

DESIGN
8 samples, no replicates, made up of half normals and half MPS mutant mice
