TITLE
Expression data from male and female Schlager hypertensive (BPH/2J) and normotensive (BPN/3J) kidneys

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of kidneys from 12 week BPH/2J hypertensive and age matched normotensive BPN/3J controls - males and females. The results provide insights into the genes that are involved in hypertension in both males and females, as well as highlight mechanisms that underlye sex differences in hypertension. We show that female data can be used to refine candidate genes and pathways, as well as highlight potential mechanisms to explain the differences in prevalence and severity of disease between the sexes.

DESIGN
Male and female kidneys from 12 week old hypertensive (BPH/2J) and normotensive (BPN/3J) mice were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We used data obtained from male and female kidneys to identify common genes that are involved in the development of hypertension in males and females
