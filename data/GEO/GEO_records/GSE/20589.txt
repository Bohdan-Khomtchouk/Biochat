TITLE
Microarray analysis identifies the gene signature of surviving motor neurons in human SOD1-related motor neuron disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling has been performed previously on motor cortex and spinal cord homogenates and of sporadic ALS cases and controls, to identify genes and pathways differentially expressed in ALS. More recent studies have combined the use of laser capture microdissection (LCM) with gene expression profiling to isolate the motor neurons from the surrounding cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, in order to determine those genes differentially expressed in the vulnerable cell population â€“ i.e. motor neuron. The aim of the present study is to combine LCM and microarray analysis to determine those genes and pathways differentially expressed in MNs from human SOD1-related MND and to establish potential pathways for therapeutic intervention. Keywords: Human motor neurons

DESIGN
The aim of this study was to determine the gene expression profiles from a small subset of cases which all carry mutations in the SOD1 gene. Expression profiles from isolated motor neurons in SOD1-related ALS cases were compared to those from control motor neurons, in order to establish the pathways implicated in SOD1-related motor neuronal cell death. The 'control' samples were originally submitted to GEO as GSE19332.
