TITLE
Dynamics of epigenetic regulation of gene expression during Plasmodium falciparum life cycle

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
In order to study the role of chromatin remodeling in transcriptional regulation associated with the progression of the P. falciparum intraerythrocytic development cycle (IDC), we mapped the temporal pattern of chromosomal association with histone H3 and H4 modifications using chromatin-immunoprecipitation coupled to microarray (ChIP-on-chip).

DESIGN
Genome-wide distribution of 13 histone modifications for 6 h time points of the 48 h P. falciparum IDC was done using ChIP-on-chip and compared to corresponding transcriptional profiles across the genome
