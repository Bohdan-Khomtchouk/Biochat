TITLE
Light-regulated genes in Cryptococcus neoformans

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans

SUMMARY
Light is a universal environmental signal perceived by many organisms, including the fungi in which light regulates both common and unique biological processes depending on the species. We conducted a whole-genome microarray analysis on the basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans to identify light-regulated genes.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, cells grown in complete darkness or exposed to white light.  Six biological replicates independently grown and harvested.  One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL8638 Duke Cryptococcus neoformans serotype D (JEC21) 8K
