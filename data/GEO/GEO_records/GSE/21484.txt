TITLE
Light-regulated genes in Cryptococcus neoformans

ORGANISM
Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans JEC21

SUMMARY
Light is a universal environmental signal perceived by many organisms, including the fungi in which light regulates both common and unique biological processes depending on the species. We conducted a whole-genome microarray analysis on the basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans to identify light-regulated genes.
