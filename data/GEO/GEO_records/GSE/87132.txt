TITLE
Expression profiling of control and Yap/Taz conditional knockout mouse incisor labial cervical loops

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand expression changes caused by deletion of Yap and Taz in the mouse incisor labial cervical loops, we performed microarray analysis. As 100% CreER recombination was not possible, mutant samples would have contained some wild type cells. Nonetheless, these results identified genes that are up- or down-regulated in the absence of Yap and Taz and led us to uncover changes in cell differentiation, as well as mTOR signaling.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from isolated labial cervical loops of 8 weeks old Yap/TazcKO mice were compared with control samples.
