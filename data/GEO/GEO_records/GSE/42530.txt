TITLE
Expression data from one year old leaves of Populus simonii by NaCl treatments

ORGANISM
Populus simonii

SUMMARY
We take the one year old plant for 100 mMol/L NaCl treatments 24 hours and controls. Use the Affymetrix poplar gene chip to decrypt the gene functions and mechanisms in Populus simonii leaves. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression during NaCl treatments.

DESIGN
Populus simonii leaves were taken from 100 mMol/L NaCl treatments 24 hours and controls for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.S1, S2 and S3 from NaCl treatments, CK1, CK2 and CK3 controls.
