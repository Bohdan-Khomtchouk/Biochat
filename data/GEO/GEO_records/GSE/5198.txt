TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of mouse ileum in response to colonization with a zebrafish or mouse gut microbiota

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression in the small intestine (ileum) of mice that were either (i) germ-free, (ii) colonized with a conventional mouse cecal microbiota, (iii) colonized with a conventional zebrafish gut microbiota, or (iv) colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Keywords: response to microbial colonization
