TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of mouse ileum in response to colonization with a zebrafish or mouse gut microbiota

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared gene expression in the small intestine (ileum) of mice that were either (i) germ-free, (ii) colonized with a conventional mouse cecal microbiota, (iii) colonized with a conventional zebrafish gut microbiota, or (iv) colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Keywords: response to microbial colonization

DESIGN
Adult germ-free NMRI mice were colonized with either (i) a conventional mouse cecal microbiota harvested from adult Swiss-Webster mice (5 biological replicates), (ii) a conventional zebrafish intestinal microbiota harvested from adult C32 zebrafish (3 biological replicates), or (iii) a culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (5 biological replicates). 14 days after colonization, total RNA was prepared from the ileum of each animal, with total RNA prepared from adult germ-free NMRI mouse ileum serving as negative controls (5 biological replicates). RNA was used as template to generate cRNA for hybridization to Affymetrix 430 v2 Mouse GeneChips.
