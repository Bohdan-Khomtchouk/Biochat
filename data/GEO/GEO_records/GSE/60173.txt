TITLE
Telomeric ORFs (TLOs) in Candida spp. encode Mediator subunits that regulate distinct virulence traits

ORGANISM
Candida dubliniensis

SUMMARY
Analysis of the interaction of Candida dubliniensis protein Tlo1p with DNA by ChIP-chip HA-tagged Tlo1p in Candida dubliniensis was used to identify Tlo1 interacting regions of DNA in global ChIP-chip analysis

DESIGN
Experiment was carried out on cells grown at 30ËšC in YEPD broth
