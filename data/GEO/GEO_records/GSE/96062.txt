TITLE
Expression data from primary adipocytes, ASCs, and ASC-adipocytes with or without IRF1 overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through employing a comparative transcriptomics approach, we identified IRF1 as differentiatlly regulated between primary and in vitro derived genetically matched adipocytes. We demonstrated IRF1 expression in adipocytes contributes to upregulation of inflammatory processes.

DESIGN
Primary adipocytes and genetically matched ASCs were compared with in vitro derived ASC-adipocytes, with or without IRF1 expression.
