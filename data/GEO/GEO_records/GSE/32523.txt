TITLE
shRNA knockdown of ZMIZ1 in human T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cell line CEM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human T-cell Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia cell line CEM was transfected with either shRNA against ZMIZ1 or scrambled shRNA.  Four (non-paired) biological replicates of each condition had mRNA assays performed using Affymetrix HG_U133_plus_2 arrays, with 54675 probe-sets.  A supplementary Excel workbook holding the same processed data as the series matrix file is provided, with some probe set annotation, and a simple statistical comparison. The raw (.CEL) files are also provided. Keywords: Expression profiling by array
