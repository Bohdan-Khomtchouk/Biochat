TITLE
RNA-seq data from NSCs and tumorspheres generated using the RCAS/TVA-CRISPR/Cas9 system

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been gradually established that the vast majority of human tumors are extraordinarily heterogeneous at a genetic level. To accurately recapitulate this complexity, it is now evident that in vivo animal models of cancers will require to recreate not just a handful of simple genetic alterations, but possibly dozens and increasingly intricate. Here, we have combined the RCAS/TVA system with the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools for precise modelling of human tumors. We show that somatic deletion in neural stem cells (NSCs) of a variety of known tumor suppressor genes (Trp53, Cdkn2a and Pten), in combination with the expression of an oncogene driver, leads to high-grade glioma formation. Moreover, by simultaneous delivery of pairs of guide RNAs (gRNAs) we generated different gene fusions, either by chromosomal deletion (Bcan-Ntrk1) or by chromosomal translocation (Myb-Qk), and we show that they have transforming potential in vivo and in vitro.

DESIGN
Bcan-Ntrk1 tumorspheres, Myb-Qk gRNA transduced NSCs, Ctrl gRNA transduced NSCs, Cdkn2a gRNA PDGFB tumorspheres, Pten gRNA PDGFB tumorspheres, and Trp53 gRNA PDGFB tumorspheres. 2 replicates each.

PLATFORM
