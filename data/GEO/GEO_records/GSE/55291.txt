TITLE
Noncoding RNA transcriptome analysis during cellular reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing technology to examine the noncoding transcriptome of cells undergoing reprogramming to the pluripotent state.

DESIGN
Examination of noncoding RNAs in reprogrammming cells.  We examined iPS cells grown in standard ES cell culture conditions, as well as iPS cells grown in " 2i " conditions (small molecule inhibition of Mek and Gsk3).  We also compared our iPS samples to male and female ES cells (mES, fES).
