TITLE
Brinker regulates wing disc growth in part via repression of Myc expression

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms regulating tissue size represent an unsolved puzzle in developmental biology. One signaling pathway controlling growth of the Drosophila wing is Dpp. Dpp promotes growth via repression of the transcription factor Brinker. The transcriptional targets of Brinker that control cell growth and proliferation, however, are not yet fully elucidated. We report here a genome-wide ChIP-seq of endogenous Brinker from wing imaginal discs. We identify the growth regulator Myc as a target of Brinker and show that Myc together with the microRNA bantam explain a large fraction of the growth inhibition caused by Brinker. This work sheds light on the effector mechanisms by which Dpp signaling controls tissue growth.
