TITLE
SOX9 Drives WNT Pathway Activation in Prostate Cancer [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX9 is critical for prostate development and is implicated in prostate cancer, we used transcriptome profiling in combination with SOX9 ChIP-seq to identify genes and pathways it regulates in normal or neoplastic epithelium. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in TMPRSS2/ERG fusion positive prostate cancer cell line with high basal expression of SOX9 by comparing the expression changes between SOX9 knockdown versus control.

DESIGN
TMPRSS2/ERG fusion positive VCaP cell line with high basal SOX9 expression were transiently transfected with either control or two independent SOX9 SiRNAs for 72 hours. RNA were then extracted and subsequently hybridized to Affymetrix GeneCHIP Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Arrays. Transcriptome profiling were done in biological duplicates by comparing SOX9 knockdown against control and differential gene expression was assessed.
