TITLE
CAST x C57 QTLs Effect on Gene Expression for Chromosomes 2, 11, and 17

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Three congenic mouse strains were profiled with microarrays and were analyzed using a QTL/Microarray approach to identify candidate genes that regulate biometric phenotypes: HG2D (HG.CAST-(D2Mit329-D2Mit457)), HG11 (HG.CAST-(D11Mit260-D11Mit255, MGI reference: 3771218), and HG17 (HG.CAST-(D17Mit196-D17Mit190); MGI reference: 3771215). All these congenic strains isolate CAST/EiJ (CAST) alleles in a C57BL/6Jhg/hg (C57) background and bare the hg deletion in the high growth locus on chromosome 10. F2 animals from intercrossing congenic males and C57 control females were profiled for gene expresion on brain, liver and gonadal white fat. To detect differential expression produced by allelic effects of biometric QTLs on chromosomes 2, 11, and 17.

DESIGN
Three strains were profiled: HG2D, HG11, and HG17, isolating CAST alleles in a high growth (HG) background on chromosomes 2, 11, and 17 respectively. Four biological replicates were assayed per strain for brain, liver and gonadal white adipose tissue. Experiments for each chromosomes were done independently. Only genotype comparisons within tissue in each strain were performed.
