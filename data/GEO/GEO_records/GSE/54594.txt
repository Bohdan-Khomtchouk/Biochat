Dose-specific transcriptional responses in thyroid tissue in mice after 131I administration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptomic profiling of normal mouse thyroid tissue following 131At irradiation In the present investigation, microarray analysis was used to monitor transcriptional activity in thyroids in mice 24 h after 131I exposure. The aims of this study were to 1) assess the transcriptional patterns associated with 131I exposure in normal mouse thyroid tissue and 2) identify novel biomarkers for 131I exposure. Methods: Adult BALB/c nude mice were i.v. injected with 13, 130 or 260 kBq of 131I and killed 24h after injection. The corresponding absorbed doses delivered to the thyroid gland were 0.85, 8.5, or 17 Gy. Mock-treated mice were used as controls. Total RNA was extracted from thyroids and processed using MouseRef-8 Whole-Genome Expression BeadChips (Illumina). Nexus Expression 2.0 software were used for analysis. Results: In total, 497, 546, and 90 transcripts were regulated in the thyroid after 0.85, 8.5, and 17 Gy, respectively. These were involved in several biological functions, e.g. oxygen access, inflammation and immune response, and apoptosis/anti-apoptosis. Approximately 50% of the involved transcripts at each absorbed dose level were dose-specific and 18 transcripts were commonly detected at all absorbed dose levels. The Agpat9, Plau, Prf1, and S100a8 gene expression displayed a monotone decrease in regulation with absorbed dose, and may function as dose-related biomarkers for 131I exposure. Conclusion: Distinct and substantial differences in gene expression and affected biological functions were detected at the different absorbed dose levels. The transcriptional profiles were specific for the different absorbed dose levels. We propose that the Agpat9, Plau, Prf1, and S100a8 genes are novel potential absorbed dose-related biomarkers for 131I exposure.
