TITLE
Gene expression in 2,3-Pentanedione Induced Bronchiolitis Oblliterans

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Fibrotic and nonfibrotic bronchial tissues were collected from lungs of pentandione exposed rats by laser capture microdissection. Analogous tissue was collected from air-exposed controls. Miroarray analysis revealed a number of DEGs

DESIGN
Male Wistar Han rats were exposed to either air or 200 ppm 2,3-pentanedione for 2 wks. Fibrotic bronchial lesions were collected form exposed rats and analogous bronchial tissue was collected from controls.  RNA was extracted and amplified to cDNA which was hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays to Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array. Transcript profiles from control and treated rats were compared.
