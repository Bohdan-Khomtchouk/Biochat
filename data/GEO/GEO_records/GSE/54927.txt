TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Drosophila wing pouch following CR32027 RNAi

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The eukaryotic cell cycle, driven by both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms, is the central molecular oscillator underlying tissue growth throughout animals.  While genome-wide studies have investigated cell cycle-associated transcription in unicellular systems, global patterns of periodic transcription in multicellular tissues remain largely unexplored.  Here we define the cell cycle-associated transcriptome of the developing Drosophila wing epithelium and compare it with that of cultured Drosophila S2 cells, revealing a core set of periodic genes as well as a surprising degree of context-specificity in periodic transcription.  We further employ RNAi-mediated phenotypic profiling to define functional requirements for over 300 periodic genes, with a focus on those required for cell proliferation in vivo.  Finally, we investigate the role of novel genes required for interkinetic nuclear migration. Combined, these findings provide a global perspective on cell cycle control in vivo, and highlight a critical need to understand the context-specific regulation of cell proliferation. Two RNAi lines of CR32027, a non-coding RNA gene identified in this study, are examined for transcriptional changes relative to wt.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiles of two RNAi knockdowns, CR32027-IR1 and CR32027-IR2, are examined  in Drosophila wing pouch relative to OreR wt in triplicate by RNA Seq.
