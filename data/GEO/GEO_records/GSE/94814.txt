TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of WT vs. Reck vascular KO P0 mouse brains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined, compared, and analyzed the transcriptome profile (RNA-seq) of WT vs Reck vascular KO (Reck flex2/Î”ex1; Tie2Cre) P0 mouse brains. Specifically, cortical transcriptomic differences (between WT and mutant genotypes) were compared separately from subcortical transcriptomic changes.

DESIGN
Cortical and subcortical mRNA profiles from P0 mice, in triplicates, for WT and Reck vascular KO animals (12 samples total).
