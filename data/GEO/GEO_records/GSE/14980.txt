TITLE
Consequences of GATA1 expression in Gata1- G1ME Murine Megakaryocyte/Erythrocyte Progenitor Cell Line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
G1ME cells are GATA1-deficient murine bipotential megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitor cells derived from Gata1-negative murine ES cells.  In order to assess the impact of GATA1 on gene regulation and cell differentiation, an expression construct was used to transiently produce high levels of GATA1.  Cells transduced with this construct or a vector control were harvested at 18 and 42 hours, and gene expression was analyzed using Affymetrix MOE430 version 2 arrays.

DESIGN
Both vector control and GATA1-expressing cells were isolated by FACS for GFP and 18 and 42 hours.  Biologic triplicates were performed for each construct at each timepoint.
