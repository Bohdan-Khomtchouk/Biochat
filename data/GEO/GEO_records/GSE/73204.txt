TITLE
HiCUP: pipeline for mapping and processing Hi-C data

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
HiCUP is a pipeline for processing sequence data generated by Hi-C, a technique used to investigate the three-dimensional organisation of a genome. The pipeline maps data to a specified reference genome and removes artefacts that would otherwise hinder subsequent analysis. HiCUP also provides an easy-to-interpret yet detailed quality control report that may be used by researchers to refine their experimental protocol for future studies. The software is freely available and has already been used for processing Hi-C data in several recently published peer-reviewed research articles.    This experiment investigates the impact of using HiCUP to remove putative PCR amplification products in heavily duplicated Capture Hi-C libraries.

DESIGN
Examination of three Capture Hi-C libraries

PLATFORM
GPL15103 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Mus musculus)
