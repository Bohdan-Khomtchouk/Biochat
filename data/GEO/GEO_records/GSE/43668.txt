TITLE
Small RNA pyrosequencing in the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica reveals strain-specific small RNAs that target virulence genes

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
We provided a full spectrum analysis for E. histolytica AGO2-2 associated 27nt small RNAs. Additionally, comparative analysis of small RNA populations from virulent and non-virulent amebic strains indicates that small RNA populations may regulate virulence genes.

DESIGN
AGO2-2 bound small RNAs from E. histolytica strain HM-1:IMSS were immunoprecipitated and sequenced using 454 technology. Three independant sequencing runs were perfomed using the same RNA sample. In addition, size selected small RNAs from E. histolytica strain Rahman were sequenced with the same technology. One sequencing run was performed on this sample.
