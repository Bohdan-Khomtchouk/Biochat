TITLE
Expression profile in HEK293T cells transfected with control or ZAPS expression vector

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of HEK293T cells overexpressing ZAPS (zinc finger antiviral protein, short form; NP_078901), which is a member of the PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase)-superfamily. Results of gene profiles provide insight into the role of ZAPS in innate immunity.

DESIGN
HEK293T cells were transfected with ZAPS expression vector or control, and forty-eight hours later, total RNA was prepared for the subsequent cDNA systhesis and microarray analysis (GeneticLab Pathology Center Co., Ltd) with the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). Data analysis was performed with GeneChip Operating Software (Affymetrix).
