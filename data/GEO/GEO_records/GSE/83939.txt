TITLE
mRNA-seq analysis of HCT116 cells following gene overexpression of IDO1 with or without Indole treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effect of indole on protection against colon injury and the role of IDO1 expression, we examined the effect of indole on hIDO1-overexpressing and empty vector control HCT116 cells by global gene expression profiling.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels from hIDO1-overexpressing and control HCT116 cell lines treated with 1mM indole or DMF for 24 hours using two replicates each.

PLATFORM
GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)
