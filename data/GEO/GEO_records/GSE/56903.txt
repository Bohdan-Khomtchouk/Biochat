TITLE
Expression data from murine myogenic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle has great regenerative capacity, which is dependent on muscle stem cells, also known as satellite cells. We established the purification system of myogenic cells. We used microarrays to identify specific genes during the muscle regenerative process.

DESIGN
Myogenic cells were purified at regenerative stages for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. CTX-2d, 3d,  5d, or 14d are the samples derived from injured muscles 2 days, 3days, 5 days  or 14 days after cardiotoxin-injection, respectively.
