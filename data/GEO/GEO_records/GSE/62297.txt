TITLE
Whole-genome expression profiling of C. elegans larvae and adults

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Temperature, as a universal enviromental factor, has prolonged effect on physiological and pathological functions of different species. In order to expolore the temperol effect of temperature on C.elegans longevity, we used microarray to check the whole-genome expression profiling of L4 larvae and Day3-old adults of C.elegans maintaining at different temperature

DESIGN
Adult worms are collected after maintained at 25 degree and 15 degree for 3days from later L4 stage, while Larva worms are collected after growing at 25 degree and 15 degree from embryo to late L4 stege. Then total RNA are extracted with TRI reagent(Life Technologies) from~120 adults or ~300 larvae. The concentrations and quality of total RNA are checked with Thermo Nanodrop 2000c(Thermo Scientific,WilminGton,DE) and Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA samples were hybrydized with Affymetrix C. elegans Gene 1.1 ST Array Strip. Preparation of cDNA, hybridization, quality controls and scanning of arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at the microarray core facility of University of Michigan .
