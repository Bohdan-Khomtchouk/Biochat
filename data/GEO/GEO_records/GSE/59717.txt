TITLE
Wide-spread disruption of transcription termination in HSV-1 infection:  Next generation sequencing of total and newly transcribed (4sU-RNA) RNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were infected with wild-type simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) strain 17 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Newly transcribed RNA was labelled by adding 500ÂµM 4-thiouridine (4sU) to the cell culture media for 1h. Total cellular RNA was isolated using Trizol. Newly transcribed RNA was purified following the protocol described in Raedle et al. JoVE 2013.

DESIGN
Newly transcribed RNA was labelled in one hour intervals during the first eight hours of HSV-1 infection. All nine 4sU-RNA samples as well as total cellular RNA of every second hour of infection were sent for sequencing. Two independent biological replicates were analysed.
