TITLE
The role of qseE, qseF and qseG in the regulation of EHEC virulence

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Escherichia coli 8624 and the isogenic mutants in qseE, qseF and qseG are compared to determine the role that each of the genes play in regulation of the transcriptome.  These results are verified by qRT-PCR and reveal the important role of this three-component signaling system.

DESIGN
Escherichia coli 8624 and the isogenic mutants in qseE, qseF and qseG are compared to determine the role that each of the genes play in regulation of the transcriptome. Single Affymetrix E. coli 2.0 Arrays are used as a starting point for this study and these results are further verified by qRT-PCR.
