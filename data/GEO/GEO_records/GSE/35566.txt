TITLE
Expression profiles of a panel of MSS and MSI colon cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling was used to identify genes differentially expressed in MSS (microsatellite stable) and MSI (microsatellite unstable) colon cancer cell lines.  Data submitted in support of manuscript entitled Villin expression is frequently lost in poorly differentiated colon cancer, Diego Arango, Sheren Al-Obaidi, David S. Williams, Jose Dopeso, Rocco Mazzolini, Georgia Corner, Do-Sun Byun, Carmel Murone, Lars TÃ¶gel, Nikolajs Zeps, Lauri A. Aaltonen, Barry Iacopetta and John M. Mariadason, American Journal of Pathology, 2012.

DESIGN
5 microsatellite stable (MSS) and 5 microsatellite unstable (MSI) colon cancer cell lines profiled.  Each cell line grown and arrayed in duplicate, and the duplicates averaged for each cell line before calculating means for MSS and MSI lines.
