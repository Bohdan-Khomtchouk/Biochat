TITLE
RNAseq Mycobacterium Tuberculosis

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
We analyzed the genes expressed, or the transcriptome, of bacilli (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) growing in fatty acids as sole carbon source. Using new technologies to massively sequence of RNA molecules we identified a group of genes that provides novel insight regarding the metabolic pathways and transcriptional regulation of latent M. Tuberculosis.

DESIGN
Comparative Transcriptomics between two carbon source (Dextrose, Long Fatty Acids), at two states of growth (Exponential and Stationary Phase)
