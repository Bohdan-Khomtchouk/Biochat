TITLE
Expression Profiles of Responders versus Non-Responders with AML or MDS to the Novel Mitochondrial Inhibitor CPI-613

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine if there are differences in the gene expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) who responded to CPI-613 when compared to those patients who did not respond we generated gene expression profiles from four responding patients and compared them to four non-responders. None of the gene expression profiles have been previously published. Here we describe the origins and provide associated clinical annotations with the hope that other investigators will be able to utilize this data in their own research.

DESIGN
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 4 patients (3 MDS, 1 AML) who responded to treatment with CPI-613 and four patients (all with AML) who did not respond. Total RNA was isolated and gene expression levels were profiled on the Affymetrix Gene Atlas U219 array strips.
