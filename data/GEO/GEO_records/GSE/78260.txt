TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of tomato introgression line during fruit development.

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
We performed transcriptome analyses throughout fruit development using the tomato cultivar M82 and its near-isogenic line IL8-3, with interesting and useful traits such as a high content of soluble solids. To identify genes that show differential expression between M82 and IL8-3 fruits, we used a custom microarray containing 43,803 tomato probes. Some genes, such as cell wall invertase and sucrose synthase genes, which are encoded by LIN6 (Solyc10g083290) and TOMSSF (Solyc12g009300) respectively, are well known to play a key role in the sink function of fruit. In this study, the levels of LIN6 and TOMSSF transcripts were higher in IL8-3 than in M82 fruit at 20 and 30 DAF, which are developmental stages for starch accumulation and increased hexose content, respectively, in IL8-3 fruit (Ikeda et al. 2013), and decreased to the level of M82 at ripening stage. Similar patterns were observed in many metabolites of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway as well as metabolites in starch and sucrose metabolism.

DESIGN
Gene expressions during fruit development were analyzed. Three biological replicates were prepared for each stage, and a total of 24 samples were analyzed.
