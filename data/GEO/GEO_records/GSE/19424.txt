TITLE
A rapid transcriptome response is associated with desiccation resistance in aerially-exposed killifish embryos

ORGANISM
Fundulus heteroclitus

SUMMARY
The changes in the transcriptome of Fundulus heteroclitus embryos incubated in water or in air from the blastula stage was investigated.

DESIGN
Embryos at blastula stage were sampled after different times under water or air, and at the same temperature, and compared by using a cDNA microarray containing 15.658 probes.
