TITLE
Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells and Cancer

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of FACS-sorted and splenic control mouse cells, comparing splenic cells from FVBneuN vs Neu+ expressing FVBneuN mice with Gr1+ CD11b+ sorted tumor-infiltrating mononuclear or splenic myeloid-derived suppressor cells

DESIGN
4 groups or conditions. Biological replicates: 2 or 3 per condition. One replicate array per sample. manuscript: van Deventer, H, J Burgents, QP Wu, R Woodford, WJ Brickey, I Allen, E McElvania-Tekippe, J Serody, and J Ting. (2010) The inflammasome component Nlrp3 impairs antitumor vaccine by enhancing the accumulation of tumor-associated myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Cancer Research. variable: cell type: splenic cells from normal FVB-neuN mice, splenic cells from Neu+ tumor-bearing FVB-neuN mice, Gr1+ CD11b+ sorted cells from tumor, Gr1+ CD11b+ sorted cells from spleen repear: biological replicate: #1, #2, #3
