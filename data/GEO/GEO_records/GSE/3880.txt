TITLE
Gene expression profiling in colonic adenoma and carcinoma in situ

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The majority of colon carcinomas are known to develop in tubular adenomas through multi-stage carcinogenesis.  Recently, we have reported a simple and reproducible method for the expression profiling using microdissected cells from formalin-fixed tissue samples (Lee et al, World J Gastroenterol, 11:1937-1945, 2005).  Using the method, we analyzed the expression profiling in colon tubular adenoma/carcinoma sequence.  Epithelial cells of carcinoma, tubular adenoma, and normal colon mucosa were microdissected from colon tubular adenomas containing focal adenocarcinomas. Keywords: disease (colon cancer) state analysis

DESIGN
Microarray (GenePlorer TwinChip Human-8K)  hybridizations were duplicated for adenomas, and carcinoma. normal  vs adenoma :4 array  repeated normal vs carcinoma : 4 array  repeated

PLATFORM
GPL1818 GenePlorer™ TwinChip™ Human-8K
