TITLE
Identification and validation of gene expression changes upon removal of Dicer in the murine limb mesenchyme

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wild type and Dicer null embryonic mouse limbs were analaysed using Affymetrix arrays to identify gene expression changes. Genes that were up-regulated in Dicer-null limbs were canidates for being miRNA targets. Potential miRNA target genes were validated using qRTPCR.
