TITLE
Global gene expression profiling using total RNA [BMM, MPI and SPG]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells leads to distinct populations of mononuclear phagocytes.Various  macrophages exhibit distinct biological properties. Here wanted to delineate and characterize gene expression patterns in bone marrow derived macrophages Here wanted to delineate and characterize gene expression patterns in two newly established, self-renewing, in vitro grown non-transformed lines (MPI cells) and in the SP37A3 immature myeloid dendritic cell line. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in MPI cells and to compare them to other types of mononuclear phagocytes.

DESIGN
[BMM] Total cellular RNA from ex vitro differentiated bone marrow derived macrophages was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays to carry out cluster analysis and overlap and gene set analysis for enriched pathways. [MPI and SPG] Total cellular RNA from independently established MPI lines and a splenic immature dendritic cell line was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays to carry out cluster analysis and overlap and gene set analysis for enriched pathways.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
