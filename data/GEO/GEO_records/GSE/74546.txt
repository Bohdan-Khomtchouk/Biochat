TITLE
Expression data of genes from the gustatory cortex follwing novel taste learning

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Novel taste memories, critical for animal survival, are consolidated to form long term memories which are dependent on translation regulation in the gustatory cortex We used microarray for identification of genes involved in novel taste learning at two time points- 1 and 3 hours following memory formation for novel taste

DESIGN
Adult rats were separated into two groups- novel tatse (0.1% sacchain) and water, two time points were used 1, 3 hours following learnin. Rna was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarray
