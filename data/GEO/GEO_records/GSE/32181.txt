TITLE
A549 expression profile induced by high levels of extracellular GPBP-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Patients undergoing immune complex-mediated GN display increased levels of circulating GPBP-1 (cGPBP-1). To assess the relationship between high levels of cGPBP-1 and the onset of these diseases we incubated A549 cells with 200 ng/mL of recombinant extracellular GPBP-1 or with buffer (control). After 3 hours cells were lysed and total RNA extracted and assessed the mRNA expression. The functional analysis of  data provide evidence that high levels of circulating GPBP-1 correlate with a lupus-prone cellular response.

DESIGN
A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates, grown for 18 hours and treated with 200 ng/mL of recombinant extracellular GPBP-1 or buffer (TBS). After three hours of incubation, cells were lysed, total RNA extracted and mRNA expression analysed following Agilent's recommendations.
