TITLE
Expression data from cultured human ovarian carcinoma cell lines with and without Cisplatin treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chemo-resistance to platinum such as cisplatin is critical in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Recent evidences have linked epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) with the drug resistance as a contributing mechanism. The current study explored the connection between cellular responses to cisplatin with EMT in ovarian cancer.

DESIGN
46 ovarian carcinoma cell lines expression data with and without Cisplatin treatment.
