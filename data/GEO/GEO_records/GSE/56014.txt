TITLE
Layers infected by Salmonella Enteritidis

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression profiling in spleen in chicken inoculated with S. enteritidis and control was conducted to screen differentially expressed genes and identify the key gene, signalling pathways and important biological processes that related to the infection of S. enteritidis

DESIGN
The 20-week old white leghorn layers were infected by Salmonella Enteritidis. Control group was mock infected by PBS. The spleen samples were collected at 7 and 14dpi for expression profile screening using Agilent 44K chicken microarray. Four biological replicates were used in each group at each timepoints. The balanced design was used for microarray experiment.

PLATFORM
GPL13790 Agilent-026441 Gallus gallus (Chicken) Oligo Microarray v2 (Feature Number version)
