TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for acute-type adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently mapped 605 chromosomal breakpoints in 61 ATL cases by spectral karyotyping and identified chromosome 14q11 as one of the most common chromosomal breakpoint regions. To map the precise location of chromosomal breakpoints at 14q11, we performed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based comparative genomic hybridization on leukemia cells from acute-type ATL patients.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix 50K SNP arrays was performed for leukemic cell samples from10 acute-type ATL patients.
