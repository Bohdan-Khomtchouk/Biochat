TITLE
Genome wide analysis of Saccharomyces nascent RNA

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces

SUMMARY
To address co-transcriptional pre-mRNA processing events, Saccharomyces nascent RNA was isolated by chromatin fractionation and analyzed on a genome-wide high density tiling microarray. Co-transcriptional splicing efficiencies were derived by determination of intronic relative to exonic sequence concentrations.

DESIGN
Nascent RNA, mRNA and genomic DNA were isolated from wild-type Saccharomyces cells and analyzed on a genome-wide high-density tiling microarry (Saccharomyces Tiling 1.0R Array, Affymetrix). At least 3 independent biological replicates were analyzed (nascent RNA (nRNA): 3 replicates, mRNA: 3 replicates, genomic DNA (gDNA): 4 replicates).
