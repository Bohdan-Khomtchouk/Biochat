TITLE
Gene expression of extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma I

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of extranodal nasal-type NK/T cell lymphoma and other EBV-associated lymphoid proliferation disease patients was analyzed to elucidate association between JAK-STAT pathway and canonical or non-canonical PRC2/EZH2 target pathways using Illumina HumanRef-8 v3 chips.

DESIGN
6 samples in total in this data set. 3 from NKTL cell line, 3 from NKTL patient.  The non-normalized data were used for analysis. No normalization was performed.

PLATFORM
