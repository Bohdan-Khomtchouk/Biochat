TITLE
miR-638 promotes melanoma metastasis and protects melanoma cells from apoptosis and autophagy (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiling identified miR-638 as one of the most significantly overexpressed miRNAs in metastatic lesions compared with primary melanomas. miR-638 enhanced the tumourigenic properties of melanoma cells in vitro and lung colonization in vivo. mRNA expression profiling of miR-638 and antagomir-transduced cells identified new candidate genes as miR-638 targets, the majority of which is involved in p53-mediated apoptosis regulation. miR-638 depletion stimulated expression of p53 and its downstream target genes and induced apoptosis and autophagy in melanoma cells. miR-638 promoter analysis revealed transcription factor associated protein 2-Î± (TFAP2A) as a direct negative regulator of miR-638. Further analyses provided strong evidence for a double negative regulatory feedback loop between miR-638 and TFAP2A. Taken together, miR-638 may support melanoma progression by suppressing p53-mediated apoptosis pathways and by targeting the transcriptional repressor TFAP2A.

DESIGN
Whole genome cDNA microarray (Illumina Human HT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip Kit, San Diego, CA 92122 USA) analyses were performed in duplicates using RNA extracted from SK-Mel-147 cells transfected with a non-targeting control, miR-638 or antagomiR-638.
