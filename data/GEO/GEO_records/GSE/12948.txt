TITLE
Oncogenesis of T-ALL and non-malignant consequences of overexpressing NOTCH1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have determined the consequences of ICN1 overexpression from retroviral vectors introduced into bone marrow cells. Even though the tumors consist of phenotypically heterogeneous cells, no evidence for tumor stem cells was found.

DESIGN
Expression analysis, array-based comparative genomic hybridization and spectral karyotyping.
