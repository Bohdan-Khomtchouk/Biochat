TITLE
Gene expression after transfection of IGF-II specific siRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from HuH-7 cells after transfection of IGF-II specific siRNAs. Gene expression profiling was performed using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Arrays. The raw data were analysed using mixed model ANOVA. Keywords: transfection with siRNA

DESIGN
Cells transfected with two independent siRNAs (ds1 and ds2) as well as untransfected cells were examined. For each condition biological duplicates were used for gene expression profiling
