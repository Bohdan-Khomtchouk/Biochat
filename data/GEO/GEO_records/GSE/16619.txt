TITLE
Identification of novel gene amplification events in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify novel gene amplification events that may contribute to breast cancer  progression, we examined copy number variation in 161 primary breast cancer samples using the Affymetrix 250K_Nsp and 250K_Sty microarrays or the Affymetrix SNP5.0 microarray.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from primary breast cancer samples. Copy number variations were determined from probeset signal intensities.
