TITLE
Affinity purification of ribosomes and associated RNAs from stress-treated cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this study, we systematically identified ribosome associated RNAs. To identify ribosome associated RNAs, C-terminal ZZ-tagged Rpl16a, expressed under control of its native promoter, was affinity purified from whole cell extracts of cultures grown to mid-log phase. Extracts were incubated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) coupled microbeads, washed, and ribosomes were eluted by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease treatment. To analyze how changes in steady-state mRNA levels (= transcriptome) are related to changes of respective messages in the translatome, total RNA and ribosome associated RNA from stress-treated and untreated cells were analyzed with yeast cDNA microarrays. To achieve this, fluorescently labeled (Cy5) cDNA was prepared from total RNA isolated from yeast cell extracts and from affinity-purified ribosomes, and each sample was mixed with differentially labeled (Cy3) cDNA prepared from a common reference RNA pool, and competitively hybridized on yeast cDNA microarrays. We performed five independent experiments with untreated cells grown in minimal medium (t=0 reference) and three or more independent biological replicates of treated cells. Altogether, we sampled the cell's response to five different " stress treatments " that were applied for relatively short periods of time (10 or 20 minutes) to avoid secondary effects triggered by transcriptional adaption. A stimulus or stress experiment design type is where that tests response of an organism(s) to stress/stimulus. e.g. osmotic stress, behavioral treatment Time: Duration of the treatment Growth Condition: Type of treatment
