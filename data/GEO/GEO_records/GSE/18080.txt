TITLE
ChIP-chip of MoCRZ1

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe oryzae

SUMMARY
CRZ1 (Calcineurin Responsive Zinc finger 1) is a conserved transcription factor that relays Ca2+/calcineurin signals within the cell. To catalog genome wide locations that MoCRZ1 binds to, we have conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray (ChIP-chip) in the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. Fungal mycelia were treated with 200mM CaCl2 to activate translocation of MoCRZ1 to the nucleus, thereby binding to the promoter regions of downstream genes, and CaCl2 together with 10ug/ml FK506 to block these phenomena. Using ChIP-chip, we were able to identify over 100 direct targets of MoCRZ1 which include well known downstream genes as well as previously unknown genes.

DESIGN
Fungal mycelia expressing MoCRZ1::GFP under its native promoter were treated with 200mM CaCl2. MoCRZ1 bound DNA fragments which were immunoprecipitated with antiGFP-antibody were compared with 30% input DNA. Mycelia treated with 200mM CaCl2 and 10ug/ml FK506 were processed as the same way and used as negative control treatment.
