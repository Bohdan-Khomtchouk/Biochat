TITLE
Gene expression patterns of EBV negative BJAB B-lymphoma lines stably and conditionally expressing EBNA-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EBNA-1 is expressed in all EBV-associated malignancies and may play a role in transcription regulation through its DNA binding ability. This is our attempt to examine the effect of EBNA-1 on the expression of cellular genes. We have compared the transcription profiles of conditional and stable EBNA-1 transfected sublines of the EBV negative B-cell lymphoma BJAB where EBNA-1 was expressed for few days, few months or years. The non-specific effects were accounted by comparing the gene expression profiles of untransfected cells or cells transfected with the empty vector or cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline.

DESIGN
Stable and inducible EBNA-1 expressing cells compared with EBNA-1 lacking cells.  Biological replicates: 3 transfected replicates for each condition
