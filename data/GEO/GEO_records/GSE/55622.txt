TITLE
Cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ are intrinsic components of the b-catenin destruction complex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the role of YAP/TAZ as b-catenin inhibitors, we compared the expression profiles of Rex1GFPd2 ES cells transfected with siControl#1, siControl#2, siYAP/TAZ#1, siYAP/TAZ#2 and cultured in 2i medium or PD-only medium

DESIGN
We collected RNA from  Rex1GFPd2 embryonic stem (ES) cells transfected with siControl#1, siControl#2, siYAP/TAZ#1, siYAP/TAZ#2. Cells were maintained in 2i medium (2i=PD0325901+CHIR99021) or switched to PD (PD0325901)-only medium after 24 hours from siRNA transfection. Cells were harvested 72 hours post-siRNA transfection. Samples were then processed for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
