TITLE
The influence of resveratrol on rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes based on a gene chip transcription analysis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of our study is to increase understanding of the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic potency of resveratrol by identifying genes which underlie involved pathological pathways and biological process. Therefore, we performed a gene Chip Transcription Analysis with subsequent Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) analysis to evaluate which transcripted genes are significantly influenced by resveratrol.

DESIGN
To determine the transcriptional profile of resveratrol, three biological replicates were processed on Affymetrix Gene Chip Human 1.0 ST.
