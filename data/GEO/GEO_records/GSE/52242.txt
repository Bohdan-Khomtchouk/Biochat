TITLE
Deletion of conserved protein phosphatases reverses defects associated with mitochondrial DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated by signaling pathways sensitive to extracellular conditions and to the internal environment of the cell. We found that deletion of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) or of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) diminishes the nuclear transcriptional response associated with mtDNA damage.

DESIGN
Six samples were analyzed to determine message RNA levels.
