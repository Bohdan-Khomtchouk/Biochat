TITLE
Identification and characterization of miRNAs in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) responsive to the pathogenic fungus Verticillium longisporum infection using Brassica AA (B. rapa) and CC (B. oleracea) as reference genomes

ORGANISM
Brassica napus

SUMMARY
we deep-sequenced two small RNA libraries made from V. longisporum infected/non-infected roots and employed Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea genomes as reference for miRNA prediction and characterization as well. We identified 893 B. napus miRNAs representing 360 conserved and 533 novel miRNAs, and mapped 429 and 464 miRNAs to AA and CC genomes, respectively. Among them, 62 miRNAs were responsive to the V. longisporum infection.

DESIGN
two small RNA libraries constructed from V. longsiporum infected and non-infected roots after 6 days were sequenced by  Illuminaâ€™s Solexa sequencing technology (BGI, China)

PLATFORM
GPL15579 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Brassica napus)
