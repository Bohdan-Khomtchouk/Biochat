TITLE
RIP-seq of polyribosomal SLBP RNP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
UV cross-linking and immunoprecipiatation with high throughput sequencing of cytoplasmic SLBP RNP

DESIGN
Polyclonal Î±-SLBP antibody was used to immunoprecipitate SLBP RNP from polyribosomal fractions of HeLa S3  lysates. Mock immunoprecipitation were also performed and serve as a negative control.
