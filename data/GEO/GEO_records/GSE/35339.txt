TITLE
ATRX-mediated chromatin association of histone variant macroH2A1 regulates alpha globin gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The histone variant macroH2A generally associates with transcriptionally inert chromatin, however the factors that regulate its chromatin incorporation remain elusive. Here, we identify the SWI/SNF helicase, ATRX, as a novel macroH2A interacting protein. Unlike its role in assisting H3.3 chromatin deposition, ATRX acts as a negative regulator of macroH2A’s chromatin association. In human erythroleukemic cells deficient for ATRX, ChIP-sequencing studies reveal that macroH2A accumulates at the HBA gene cluster on the subtelomere of chromosome 16, coinciding with the loss of α globin expression. Collectively, our results implicate deregulation of macroH2A’s distribution as a contributing factor to the α thalassemia phenotype of ATRX syndrome.

DESIGN
Mononucleosomes from K562 cells bearing integrated lentiviral shRNA constructs targeting either luciferase (shluc) or ATRX (sh92) were isolated and ChIP'd with mH2A1 antibody. DNA from shluc Input and the two mH2A1 ChIPs were isolated and sequenced on Illumina's Hiseq.
