TITLE
Identification of microRNAs specific for high producer CHO cell lines

ORGANISM
Cricetulus griseus

SUMMARY
Mature microRNA levels were analyzed in 4 producing CHO cell lines expressing 2 structurally different recombinant proteins at low and high level as well as in 1 non-producing CHO cell line. The goal was to identify microRNAs that are involved in heterologous protein formation and secretion.

DESIGN
5 recombinant CHO cell lines. 3 biological replicates each. All samples were hybridized against a common reference (pool of all total RNA samples).

PLATFORM
GPL18028 TUGRAZ miRNA array TUGRAZ-HSA_MMU_RNO-MRC23
