TITLE
medium vs cell miRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the inside and exported miRNA in cell culture system.

DESIGN
We characterized the miRNA spectra of cell lines when deprived of serum. The absence of miRNAs present in bovine serum is a distinct advantage of using serum depletion to study extracellular miRNA as it removes potential source of interference.
