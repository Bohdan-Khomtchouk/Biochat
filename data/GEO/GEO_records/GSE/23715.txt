TITLE
Interior Spruce_Bark_PissodesStrobi _Herbivory

ORGANISM
Picea engelmannii x Picea glauca

SUMMARY
We performed a transcriptome analysis of interior spruce (Picea glauca x engelmannii) bark response to weevil (Pissodes strobi) feeding using 21.8K spruce microarray (that contains 21.8 thousand unique transcripts). This microarray study revealed a large rearrangement of the interior spruce bark transcriptome in response to weevil feeding involving differential expression of close to 20% of the studied transcriptome.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from the bark of interior spruce exposed to weevil feeding and from the bark of untreated trees at three time points (6 hours, 2 days and 2 weeks). Four independent biological replicates were included for treatment and control at each time point. Four hybridizations were performed for treatment and control comparison within each time point (6 hours, 2 days, 2 weeks) and one hybridization was performed for each comparison between time points for both treatment and control (total 18 hybridizations/slides).
