TITLE
Gene expression of mouse embryonic gonad

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the function of NANOS2 to regulate the transcriptome in embryonic male germ cells, we performed expression microarray analysis of the embyornic gonads of the Nanos2+/-, Nanos2-/- male and wild type female from E12.5 to E15.5.  The Nanos2+/- and Nanos2-/-  female gonads at E15.5 were analyzed as a negative control.

DESIGN
Biological duplicates were examined at each stage, genotype, and sex for each experiment.
