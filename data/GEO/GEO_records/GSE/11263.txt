TITLE
Array-based comparative genomic hybridisation analysis at 1Mb resolution of 44 pilocytic astrocytomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs), WHO Grade I, are one of the most frequently occurring childhood brain tumors. We have used microarray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) at 1Mb resolution to study copy number changes in a series of PAs (n=44). Keywords: Comparative Genomic Hybridization, aCGH

DESIGN
Single hybridization per case. 44 pilocytic astrocytomas WHO grade I were analyzed. Target (tumor) labelled with Cy5 and reference with Cy3. Mixture of 20 normal male or female genomic DNA was used in sex-mismatched hybridization.
