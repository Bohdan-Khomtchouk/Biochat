TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of adipose tissues of A. actinomycetemcomitans- and C. pneumoniae-infected apoE-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The 14-week experiment included three groups: 1) the Acute Cpn group, with one C. pneumoniae inoculation at the age of 9 wks; 2) the Chronic Cpn group, with three C. pneumoniae inoculations at the age of 9, 11, and 13 wks; and 3) the control group, with three SPG inoculations at the age of 9, 11, and 13 wks. The mice were sacrificed at the age of 14 wks. The 24-week experiment included four groups: 1) the recurrent A. actinomycetemcomitans infection group, with ten  A. actinomycetemcomitans inoculations once a week from the age of 14 to 23 wks; 2) the chronic C. pneumoniae infection group, with three C. pneumoniae inoculations at the age of 9, 11, and 13 wks; 3) the combined chronic C. pneumoniae and recurrent A. actinomycetemcomitans infection group, with three C. pneumoniae inoculations at the age of 9, 11, and 13 wks, and ten A. actinomycetemcomitans inoculations once a week from the age of 14 to 23 wks; and 4) the control group, with three SPG inoculations at the age of 9, 11, and 13 wks, and ten 0.9% NaCl inoculations once a week from the age of 14 to 23 wks. The mice were sacrificed at the age of 24 wks.Epididymal and inguinal AT gene expression was analyzed using an Illumina Mouse WG-6 v2.0 platform.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from inguinal and epididymal adipose tissues, samples from infected animals were compared to vehicle-inoculated controls.

PLATFORM
GPL6887 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip
