TITLE
Expression and differential expression analysis in colorectal carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression and differential expression analysis of custom probes for genomic regions that have been found to be differentially expressed (i) throughout cell cycle progression, (ii) in response to the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic p53 pathway, and (iii) the anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative STAT-3 pathway.  In addition, the Agilent custom array (244K) interrogates probes for genomic regions predicted to contain a conserved secondary structure identified by RNAz (Washietl et al. " Fast and reliable prediction of noncoding RNAs. " Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 102:2454-9, 2005.) or Evofold (Pedersen et al. " Identification and classification of conserved RNA secondary structures in the human genome. " PLoS Comput Biol. 2:e33, 2006.), as well as known non-coding RNAs from public databases, and the Agilent mRNA probe sets 014850. Colorectal carcinoma cells with defunct TP53 compared to colorectal carcinoma cells with induced TP53.

DESIGN
We analyzed three arrays each for colorectal carcinoma cells with defunct TP53 and with induced TP53 expression
