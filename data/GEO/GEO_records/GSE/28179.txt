TITLE
Midgut - CGH Differential Replication

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_3278 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of David MacAlpine. For full list of modENCODE projects, see Project Goal: We will precisely identify sequence elements that direct DNA replication by using chromatin immunoprecipitation of known replication initiation complexes.  These experiments will be conducted in multiple cell types and developmental tissues. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and
