TITLE
Microarray analysis to examine glycan-related gene expression in primary human cells infected with HIV-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The main objective of my laboratory is to identify the molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 entry and infection of the CNS, focusing on PG-species as the primary attachment receptors, and their interactions with certain HIV-1 proteins.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis to examine glycan-related gene expression in primary human cells infected with HIV-1 to confirm that distinct cell-associated PGs play differential role(s) in viral capture and transfer via BMVECs and astrocytes To examine glycan-related gene expression in primary human cells (CNS-based cells such as BMVECS, astrocytes and microglia, as well as primary human control peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as CD4+ T-cells and macrophages)  infected with HIV-1 at different time-points (6 hours post-infection, 24-hours post-infection and 7-days post-infection) as compared to uninfected cells (all of the above cells, uninfected, in triplicates, with matching time-points).
