TITLE
Gene expression profiles differentiating gastrointestinal stromal tumours according to KIT mutations and expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) represent a heterogeneous group of tumours of mesenchymal origin characterized by gain-of-function mutations in KIT or PDGFRA of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family. Although mutations in either receptor are thought to drive an early oncogenic event through similar pathways, two previous studies reported the mutation-specific gene expression profiles. However, their further conclusions were rather discordant. To clarify the molecular characteristics of differentially expressed genes according to GIST receptor mutations, we combined microarray-based analysis with detailed functional annotations.

DESIGN
29 samples: 15 with KIT mutation detected, 11 with PDGFRA mutation detected, 3 with no mutation detected
