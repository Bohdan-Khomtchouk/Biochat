TITLE
Genomewide analysis of EGF-induced alternative splicing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed EGF treatment and hnRNP A1 knockdown in HeLa cells and analyzed alternative splicing patterns by high-throughput RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
The mRNA profiles of control/EGF-treated/hnRNP A1-knockdown HeLa cells were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2000.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
