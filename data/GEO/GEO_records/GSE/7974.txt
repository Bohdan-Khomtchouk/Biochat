comparison ws vs crb (cul3a)-Study of the function of SCF complexes in Arabidopsis.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
af01_cul3a2_cul3b - comparison ws vs crb (cul3a) - Cullin proteins belong to a multigene family that includes at least three members in budding yeast, six in human, five in C. elegans and five in Arabidopsis thaliana. All cullins analyzed so far directly interact with RBX1/HRT1/ROC1, a RING finger protein, thereby forming the core module of different ubiquitin ligase complexes, which specifically recruit substrate proteins for ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. CULLIN1, the only cullin protein studied so far in plants, has been shown to be essential for plant development and to play a role in multiple signalling cascades. Here, we report on the first molecular and genetic characterisation of a plant Cullin 3. In contrast to fungi and animals, the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains two related CULLIN 3 genes, called CUL3A and CUL3B. We found that CUL3A is ubiquitously expressed in plants and that the CUL3A protein is also able to interact with RBX1 and certain Arabidopsis BTB-domain proteins. In order to determine the role of CUL3A in plant development, we used a reverse genetic approach and identified T-DNA insertion mutants. cul3a null mutants flower slightly latter than the control plants and their hypocotyls exhibit a reduced sensitivity to far red light. The viability of the cul3a mutant plants suggests functional redundancy between both CUL3 genes in plants.  - Comparaison of mutant AtCul3a (T-DNA mutant of Versailles collection) and WS.
