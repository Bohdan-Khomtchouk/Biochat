TITLE
OsJAR1−related JA-inducible genes in osjar1 tos17 mutant rice leaves.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Jasmonates is inductively produced as a major plant hormone responsible for defense reactions in plants against both biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogen infection and mechanical wounding. Jasmonoyl isoleucine is known to be a bioactive compound of jasmonate and plays a pivotal role for plant defenses. We identified OsJAR1−related JA-inducible genes in osjar1 tos17 mutant (osjar1-2) rice leaves 0 - 2 h after JA treatment using 44k microarray.

DESIGN
Expression profiling in the wild-type rice leaves treated with jasmonic acid for 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h was compared with that in the osjar1 mutant  leaves treated with jasmonic acid for 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h using two-color method with three biological replicates.
