TITLE
Comparison of microRNA profiles between Normoxia and Hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used miRNA array to study differential expression of miRNA under hypoxia exposure in cancer cells. Cells cultured under normoxia were used as controls.

DESIGN
Hypoxia induced differential expression in miRNAs were meassured by treating epithelial ovarian cancer cell line A2780 at 1% O2 for 6hr, 48hr and 6days. Cells not treated with hypoxia (21% O2) were used as control.
