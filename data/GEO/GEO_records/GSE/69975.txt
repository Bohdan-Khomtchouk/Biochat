TITLE
Comparison of osteocyte-enriched bone from DMP1 cre Mbtps1 knockout mice with littermate controls.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose of arrays were to determine what the effect of deletion of Mbtps1 gene was on gene expression of osteocytes in bone in vivo.  DMP1 cre driver was used to delete the Mbtps1 gene in osteocytes and osteoblasts in bone.  We then isolated osteocyte enriched bone particles from 40 week old male mice to determine the effect of this deletion on gene expression.  We have previously shown that Mbtps1 is needed for transcription of Phex, DMP1, and MEPE genes in osteoblasts in culture.  Arrays showed these genes were reduced as expected in osteocytes in vivo.  Controls represent osteocyte enriched bone from 40 week old littermates.  Also, as expected, Mbtps1 expression was reduced in these knockout mice

DESIGN
4 control mice and 3 knock out mice were used in the analysis
