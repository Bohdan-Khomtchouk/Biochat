TITLE
RNA-Sequencing of Stat3 silenced oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examine the role of Stat3 in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and determine that direct binding of Stat3 to the Etv6 promoter, and subsequent upregulation, in part, promotes differentiation.

DESIGN
Examination of gene expression in Stat3 silenced OLP in the presence or absence of CNTF
