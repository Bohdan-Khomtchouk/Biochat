TITLE
Cells with Surface Expression of CD133highCD71low are Enriched for Colony-Forming Progenitor Cells in the Adult Murine Pancreas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Previously, we identified tripotent colony-forming progenitor cells in the adult murine pancreas that were capable of self-renewal and differentiation into duct, acinar and endocrine cells in vitro. However, the incidence of these progenitor cells was low (~1% among pancreatic cells in adult 2-4 month-old mice). The goal of the current study was to find cell-surface markers that can distinguish and enrich pancreatic colony-forming progenitor cells. It was found that pancreatic cells could be divided into CD133+CD71- , CD133highCD71low and CD133lowCD71low and CD133-CD71- cells. CD133highCD71low cells, but not other cell populations, were the most enriched for colony-forming progenitors. Interestingly, both CD133+CD71- and CD133highCD71low cells expressed ductal markers as shown by gene expression RT-PCR analysis. To further characterize CD133+CD71- (designated as R1 cells) and CD133highCD71low (designated as R2 cells) ductal cell populations, genome-wide gene expression analysis using RNA-seq was performed. The genes that were differentially expressed by R1 and R2 cells are deposited here. Subsequent pathway analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed that R2 and R1 cells have propensity for cell migration and immune response, respectively. These gene expression analyses suggested ductal cells of the adult pancreas are heterogeneous in nature.

DESIGN
Two populations of cells are sorted from the pancreas of adult 2-4 month old C57Bl/6 mice and their RNA profiles are determined. These cell populations are CD133(high)CD71(low) cells (3 samples) and CD133(positive)CD71(negative) (2 samples).
