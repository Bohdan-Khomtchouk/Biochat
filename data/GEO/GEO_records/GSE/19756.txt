TITLE
Gene Expression Profiling Data of African Malaria Vector Anopheles gambiae Aging

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Senescence is a biological phenomenon experienced by all living eukaryote organisms. Genome-wide gene expression associated with aging has been explored in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, but this has not been well understood in African malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. Gene expression profiling using DNA microarray allows for simultaneous study of changes in mRNA levels for thousands of genes. This study examined genome-wide gene expression during aging process in An. gambiae. The influence of blood feeding on gene expression was also examined.  The data can be used to further our understanding of mosquito senescence and identify biomarkers for mosquito age grading.
