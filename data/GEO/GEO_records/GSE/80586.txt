TITLE
Tumor microenvironment derived exosomes pleiotropically modulate cancer cell metabolism

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of tumor microenvironment in most solid cancers. Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, and much of the published literature has focused on neoplastic cell-autonomous processes for these adaptations. We demonstrate that exosomes secreted by patient-derived CAFs can strikingly reprogram the metabolic machinery following their uptake by cancer cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from purified exosomes from patient derived CAFs
