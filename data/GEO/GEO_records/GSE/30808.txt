TITLE
ChIP-chip from 48h hemin induced K562 cells with GATA-1, EKLF, and NF-E2 antibodies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor GATA-1, EKLF and NF-E2 promotes erythroid differentition by regulating their target genes, however, the intricate interplays between these key TFs and microRNA genes are largely unknown. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of GATA-1, EKLF and NF-E2 together with microRNA genomic promoter profiling by ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated that GATA-1, EKLF and NF-E2 collaborately regulate a series of microRNA genes.

DESIGN
Comparison of microRNA promoter arrays of GATA-1 VS EKLF VS NF-E2 in K562 cells suffering with hemin induced erythroid differentiation

PLATFORM
GPL13949 NimbleGen_HG18 RefSeq Promoter array [080929_HG18_GC_CGH]
