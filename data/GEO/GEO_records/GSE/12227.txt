TITLE
Neonatal and embyronic CNS of mice with maternal or paternal duplication of proximal chromosomes 7 and 15 (430A)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was performed on CNS tissue from neonatal mice carrying the T9H translocation and maternal or paternal duplication of proximal Chromosomes 7 and 15.  Our analysis revealed the presence of two novel paternally expressed intergenic transcripts at the PWS/AS locus.  The transcripts were termed Pec2 and Pec3 for paternally expressed in the CNS.Our analysis also revealed imprinting of Magel2, Mkrn3, Ndn,Ube3a and Usp29, as well as Pec2 and Pec3 in embryonic brain, 15.5 dpc, and provided a survery of biallelically expressed genes on proximal Chromosomes 7 and 15 in embryonic and neonatal CNS. Keywords: genetic modification, developmental comparison
