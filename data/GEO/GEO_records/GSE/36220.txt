TITLE
Transcriptome study of hepatocytes isolated from transgenic mice expressing HCV core.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein plays  a major role in HCV mediated liver pathologies. We have previously reported that HCV core variants isolated from tumoral (T) and non-tumoral (NT) livers were capable to alleviate Smad transcriptional activity and to shift TGF-Î² responses from tumor suppressor effects to tumor promotion. To comprehensively appreciate the consequences of core-mediated deregulation of Smad signaling on TGF-b target gene expression, Affimetrix microarrays were performed. Microarray analyses demonstrate that HCV core expression in hepatocytes modulates TGF-b target gene expression. Furthermore, most of the genes modulated in core expressing hepatocytes after TGF-b treatment were already regulated in these non treated cells suggesting that HCV core is capable to activate latent TGF-b.

DESIGN
Transcriptome analysis was performed on primary hepatocytes from transgenic mice expressing  either Core T  or core NT or their control littermates treated  or not with TGF-b.
