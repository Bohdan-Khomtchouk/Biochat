TITLE
Expression data from Treg cells from Lkb1 or Tgfbr2 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of Treg cells from Foxp3Cre/+Lkb1f/f mice versus Foxp3Cre/+ mice, and Foxp3Cre Tgfbr2 f/f mice versus Foxp3Cre mice.

DESIGN
CD4+YFP+ Treg cells were sorted from spleen and lymph nodes of mice for RNA extraction with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was reverse transcribed, amplified, labeled, and hybridized to Mouse Genome 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix).

PLATFORM
GPL16570 [MoGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
