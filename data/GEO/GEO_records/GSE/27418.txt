TITLE
miRNA profiling from T-ALL cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The NOTCH1 signaling pathway is a critical determinant of cell fate decisions and drives oncogenesis through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. To elucidate tumorigenic pathways that cooperate with activated Notch1 in leukemogenesis,we performed miRNA expression profiling of normal CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, non-malignant ICN1 over-expressing CD4+CD8+ cells and ICN1-induced tumor CD4+CD8+ cells.

DESIGN
Three groups of the murine T cells: Control CD4+CD8+ normal thymocytes vs.non-malignant ICN1-expressing CD4+CD8+ cells vs. ICN1-tumor CD4+CD8+ cells .
