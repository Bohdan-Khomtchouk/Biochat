TITLE
Transcriptomic response of murine liver to severe injury and hemorrhagic shock: CodeLink portion of dual platform

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A dual platform microarray analysis was used to characterize the temporal transcriptomic response in the mouse liver following trauma and hemmorhagic shock

DESIGN
Mice were divided into five groups, anesthetized and surgically treated to simulate a time course and trauma severity model: non-manipulated animals (C), minor trauma (MT), 1.5 hour of hemorrhagic shock and severe trauma (HS/T), 1.5 hour HS/T followed by 1 hour resuscitation (HS/T+1.0R), 1.5 hour HS/T followed by 4.5 hours resuscitation (HS/T+4.5R)

PLATFORM
GPL11579 Alternative Mouse Whole Genome Bioarray (CodeLink)
