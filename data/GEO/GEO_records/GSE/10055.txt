TITLE
Transcriptional Analysis of 1M Regions in Medicago truncatula Using Tiling Microarrays

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
We report here a transcriptonal analysis in six different organ types of a approximately 1 Mb region in legume plants barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) which is sytenic with soybean (Glycine max). We used oligonucleotide tiling microarrays to detecte transcription of over 80% of the predicted genes in both species. We detected differential gene expression in the six examined organ types. Keywords: RNA

DESIGN
Both the barrel medic and soybean tiling arrays were produced on the Maskless Array Synthesizer platform. Briefly, tiling-paths consisting of 36-mer oligonucleotides offset by five nucleotides were designed to represent both DNA strands of the selected barrel medic and soybean genome sequence. Probes were synthesized at a feature-density of 390,000 probes per array in a “chess board” design. Microarray production and storage were carried out. Total RNA and mRNA were sequentially isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, respectively. mRNA from different organ types was reverse transcribed using a mixture of oligo(dT)18 and random nonamer primers, during which amino-allyl-modified dUTP (aa-dUTP) was incoporated. The aa-dUTP decorated cDNA was fluorescent labeled by conjugating the monofunctional Cy3 dye (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) to the amino-allyl functional groups in the cDNA. Two μg dye-labeled targets were used for hybridization.
