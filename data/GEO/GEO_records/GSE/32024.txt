TITLE
Expression data from 293T cell treated with ROCK inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray to determine the genes whose expression was changed at three or six hours after Y27632 treatment.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment; 293T control vs 293T treated with Y27632 for three hours, 293T control vs 293T treated with Y27632 for six hours.
