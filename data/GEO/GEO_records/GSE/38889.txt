TITLE
A novel 3-D organotypic culture model by co-culturing alpha-SMA positive CAF and cholangiocarcinoma cells in a collagen matrix

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The increased α-smooth muscle-actin positive cancer-associated fibroblastic cells (CAF) in the desmoplastic stroma may relate to a more aggressive cancer and worse survival outcomes for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients We developed a novel 3-D organotypic culture model by co-culturing α-SMA positive CAF and cholangiocarcinoma cells in a collagen matrix.

DESIGN
Cholangiocarcinoma cell lines were established by isolating α-SMA positive cancer-associated fibroblastic cells (CAF) (BDEsp-TDFE4) and cholangiocarcinoma cells (BDEsp-TDEH10) from tumors arising from bile duct inoculation of spontaneously-transformed low grade malignant rat BDE1 cholangiocytes (BDEsp cells). These tumor-derived cells lines were then grown in a rat tail type I collagen gel matrix, alone or in co-culture, and their gene expression profile were compared.
