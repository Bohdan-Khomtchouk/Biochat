TITLE
Evaluation of performance of Arabidopsis Pathoarray 464_001: comparison with ATH1

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To evaluate technical reproducibility of Arabidopsis Pathoarray 464_001 (GPL3638), two slides were hybridized with labeled amplified RNA prepared from identical RNA. The RNA was prepared from Pseudomonas syringae ES4326- and 5mM MgSO4- injected samples (Psm 24h set C and mock 24h set C. See also GSE4429, GSM99793 and GSM99794). Keywords: Evaluation of a custom microarray performance
