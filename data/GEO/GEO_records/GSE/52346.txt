TITLE
miRNAs trigger widespread epigenetically-activated siRNAs from transposons inÂ Arabidopsis (bisulfite-seq)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Utilizing whole-genome BIS-seq to analyze transposon methylation in DNA methylation mutants, and RNAi mutants, compared to wildtype.

DESIGN
DNA extracted from plant inflorescence tissue, bisulphite-treated and libraries sequenced Illumina HiSEq, mapped by BiSMark.

PLATFORM
GPL9062 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Arabidopsis thaliana)
