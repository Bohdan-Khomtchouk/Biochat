TITLE
Posterior Second Heart Field (pSHF) transcriptomes of wild-type and Shh mutant mouse embryos

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand Sonic hedgehog homolog (Shh)-mediated molecular networks in the posterior second heart field (pSHF), we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with Shh-dependent expressional changes.  We microdissected the pSHF from E9.5 embryos and compared the Shh mutant samples with than of wild-type using Agilent 4x44k Mouse Whole Genome Arrays (n = 4 WT pools and 4 Shh - /- pools).

DESIGN
Microdissected pSHF from E9.5 mouse embryos was molecularly verified by real-time PCR.  Shh mutant embryos were compared with wild-type embryos. Four independnet pools of RNAs from each biological group were measured on 1-color Agilent Mouse Whole Genome Arrays (n = 3 WT pools and 4 Shh -/- pools).

PLATFORM
