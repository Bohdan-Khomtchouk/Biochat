TITLE
Aspergillus niger : Control (fructose) vs. steam-exploded sugarcane induction (SEB)

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. niger comparing mutant strains with the disrupted xylanolytic transcriptional activator gene, XlnR, the arabinolytic transcriptional activator gene, AraR, and the double mutant (ΔXlnR, ΔaraR and ΔaraRΔXlnR, repsectively) treated with steam-exploded sugarcane bagasse (SEB) for 12 and 24 h. The main objective was to identify genes related to cellulases and hemicellulases in mutant strains grown on SEB, with indirect comparisons with the WT strain grown on SEB [the (WT/SEB) data deposited in GSE24798]. The experiment was further validated by real-time PCR and enzymatic assay.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment : A. niger mutant strains on SEB for 12 and 24 h at 30 oC in batch culture. Firstly, the strains were pre-grown in minimal medium with fructose as carbon source (control), and then transferred to SEB as carbon source.
