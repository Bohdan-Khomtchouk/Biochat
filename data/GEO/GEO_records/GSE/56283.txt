TITLE
Effect of SAOUHSC_02810 deletion in S. aureus NCTC8325

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus NCTC 8325

SUMMARY
To analyze function of SAOUHSC_02810, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes transcription changed in mutant strain. SAOUHSC_02810 were replaced by ermB gene.

DESIGN
Cells were grown to OD600=2.0, and the RNA level of wild type NCTC8325 and SAOUHSC_02810 mutant were compared.

PLATFORM
