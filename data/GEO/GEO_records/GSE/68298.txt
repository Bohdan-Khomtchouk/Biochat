TITLE
Expression data from aging study on mouse spermatogonial stem/progenitor cell population

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In mouse, spermatogonial stem/progenitor cells are the progenitor cell which develop to mature sperms through a series of mitotic and meiotic divisions and differentiation. Gfra1 is an established surface marker for mouse spermatogonial stem/progenitor cells. In this study, we used a transcriptomic approach to investigate the effect of aging on Gfra1-positive and -negative populations of mouse male germ cells.

DESIGN
Spermatogonial stem/progenitor cells were isolated from testes of mice at ages 6-day, 21-day, 60-day, and 8-months by magnetic assisted cell sorting (MACS) technique using Gfra1 marker. Transcriptomes among different ages and Gfra1 status were compared.
