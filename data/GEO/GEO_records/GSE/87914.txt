TITLE
A genome-wide map of polyadenylation sites in primary human breast tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used a modified PAS-Seq protocol to map sites of polyadenylation genome-wide in primary breast tissue. Here, we present a map of breast poly(A)-sites derived from six ER+ tumors, six ER- tumors, and adjacent normal tissue from each of the 12 tumor donors.

DESIGN
Modified PAS-seq in 12 pairs of matched patient tumor/normal tissue samples (6 ER-, 6 ER+).

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
