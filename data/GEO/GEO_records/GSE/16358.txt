TITLE
Scavenger receptor B2 is a cellular receptor for enterovirus 71

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) belongs to human enterovirus species A of the genus Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae. We established transformant cells by transfection of mouse cells with genomic DNA from human cells and then detected two EV71-susceptible cell lines.  Using microarray with the two cell lines we found that scavenger receptor B2 is a cellular receptor for EV71.
