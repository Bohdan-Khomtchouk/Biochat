TITLE
Medullary Carcinoma of the colon

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study examined the expression profile of medullary carcioma of the colon compared to adjacent histologically normal colonic mucosa.

DESIGN
Medullary carcinomas of the colon were selected from Rhode Island Hosptial and The Miriam Hospital to identify new molecular markers of this disease. Medullary carcinoma was defined by applying strict morphologic criteria and demonstration of mismatch repair protein deficiency (MMRd) by IHC.
