TITLE
Epigenome analysis of smoking in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of smokers and non-smokers in PBMC samples. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.1  was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across  485,577 CpGs in PBMC samples. Samples included 50 smokers and 61 non-smokers.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the 111 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.1

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
