TITLE
Mechanisms of variable ventilation in experimental lung injury

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In the present study we seek to identify changes in lung gene expression under mechanical ventilation in uninjured as well as acutely and chronically injured lungs. A standard volume-controlled lung-protective ventilatory protocol is compared to a concept of mechanical ventilation using variable tidal volumes.

DESIGN
Comparison of mRNA profiles in whole-lung samples after mechanical ventilation with constant or variable tidal volumes

PLATFORM
GPL14844 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Rattus norvegicus)
