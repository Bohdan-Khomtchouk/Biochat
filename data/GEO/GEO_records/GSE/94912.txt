TITLE
Small RNA libraries from pooled synthetic miRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A total of 286 synthetic miRNAs that are commonly observed in circulation were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).

DESIGN
We randomly assigned synthetic miRNAs to each of three plates (Plate 1, Plate 2, and Plate 3) respectively. Six combinations of different concentrations from these three synthetic miRNAs plates were subjected to small RNA sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
