TITLE
Ultrasonic surgical aspirate is a reliable source for adult neural progenitor cells (aNPCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Adult neural progenitor cells (aNPCs) are a potential source for cell based therapy for neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injuries. We show that the ultrasonic aspirate samples that are typically considered as a waste after surgery are a great source for aHNPCs.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from the core tumor tissues (Fr-Co) was compared to that from the ultrasonic aspirates (Fr-UA). Total RNA isolated from the tumorspheres generated from core tumor tissues (Sp-Co) was compared to the total RNA isolated from tumorspheres generated from ultrasonic aspirates (Sp-UA).
