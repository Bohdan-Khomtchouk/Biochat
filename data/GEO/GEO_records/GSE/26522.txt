TITLE
Transcription profiling of One month old Gossypium herbaceum plant leaf during drought and watered condition

ORGANISM
Gossypium barbadense

SUMMARY
Comparative genomics has emerged as a promising means of unravelling the molecular networks underlying complex traits such as drought tolerance.We used Affymetrix microarray to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying in drought and watered condition and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.leaf tissue were used for the expression analysis during watered and drought condition  with three biological replicates for each case.
