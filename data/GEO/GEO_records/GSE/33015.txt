TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of PHABULOSA targets in Arabidopsis root meristem

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report the discovery of a root growth program in Arabidopsis that is independent of a functional quiescent center (QC). In this regulatory program, PHABULOSA (PHB), posttranscriptionally regulated by SHR and SCR, plays a central role. In phb shr and phb scr mutants, root meristem/growth activity recovers significantly. Interestingly, this recovery does not accompany the resurgence of QC cells. PHB regulates apical root growth in stele cells of the root meristem, located proximal to the QC. Our genome-wide investigation suggests that PHB exerts its influence on root growth by regulating auxin-cytokinin homeostasis. Apical root growth was restored when cytokinin levels were genetically reduced in the shr mutant. Conversely, when miRNA-resistant PHB was expressed in the root stele cells, apical root growth and meristem functions were significantly inhibited without blocking the QC identity. Taken together, our investigation reveals two mechanisms through which SHR regulates root growth and stem cell activities: one is to specify and maintain the QC and the other is to regulate the proximal meristem activity through PHB and cytokinin.  In this regulation, QC seems to be more involved in maintaining the “growth signal” and thus ensure the indeterminate root growth.

DESIGN
Total 7 samples (2 replicates of shr-2 mutant (high PHABULOSA expression) vs. 2 replicates of shr-2 phb-6 (low/absent PHABULOSA expression). 3 replicates of Wild type used as reference sample.

PLATFORM
