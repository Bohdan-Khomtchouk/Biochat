TITLE
Comparison of gene expression in M. tuberculosis TrxB2-DUC mutant treated or not with atc and DTT

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
M. tuberculosis thioredoxin reductase (TrxB2) is essential for bacterial survival in vitro and in vivo. To gain insight into the pathways dependent on TrxB2, we compared the mRNA profiles of TrxB2-DUC mutant in the presence and absence of atc and DTT.

DESIGN
We grew bacteria in 7H9 medium to an OD of 0.5~0.6. We then added atc to a final concentration of 800 ng/ml and DTT to a final concentration of 2 mM. Samples were collected 24 hr after treatment.
