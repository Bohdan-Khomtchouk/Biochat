TITLE
JunB is essential for IL-23-dependent pathogenicity of Th17 cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand molecular mechanisms by which JunB regulates Th17 differentiation, we performed ChIP-seq analyses of JunB-deficient and control Th17 cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq analysis of JunB,IRF4,BATF in in vitro generated TH17(Î²) and TH17(23) cells.

PLATFORM
