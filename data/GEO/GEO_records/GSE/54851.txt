TITLE
Dynamic mRNA gene expression following a rapamycin treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Dynamic mRNA gene expression from the wildtype YSBN6 during a rapamycin treatment (rapamycin-induced downshift). Rapamycin was added to yeast cells growing exponentially on glutamine as sole nitrogen source.

DESIGN
A sample was taken at steady-state 10 minutes before , and then 3, 7, 10, 14, 24, 56 and 120 minutes after rapamycin treatment. Biological triplicate gene expression was measured for samples -10, 7 and 24 minutes after shift, for a total of 14 chips. Changes were generally evaluated relative to the steady-state point (-10 minutes). Biological variability can be assessed from the replicates time points. Other dynamic omics data are associated with this dataset. Consult the publication for more details.
