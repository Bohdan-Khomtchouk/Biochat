TITLE
Murine uterus expression profile during Peri-implantation: Pre-implantation vs. Post-implantation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Anaylsis differentially expressed genes of mouse peri-implanted uteri comparing pre-implantation uteri (Day2, Day3 and Day4) with post-implantation uteri (Day6, Day7 and Day8) by microassay. This study has built a meaningful basis for future investigation in elucidating the molecular nature of maternal-fetal interactions during pregnancy establishment and maintenance.

DESIGN
Pre-implantation uteri VS. Post-implantation uteri. Three biological replicates of each experiments: pre-implantation uteri (Day2, Day3 and Day4): 234, 234①, 234②; 3 mixture of post-implantation uteri (Day6, Day7 and Day8): 678, 678①, 678②. Two hybridizations were performed by using a reverse fluorescence strategy (Cy3, Cy5) for each sample.
