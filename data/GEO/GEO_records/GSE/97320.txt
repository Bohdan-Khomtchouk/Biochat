TITLE
Differential gene expression profiles in peripheral blood in Northeast Chinese Han people with acute myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The genes had different expression between healthy people and acute myocardial infarction.We aimed to identify the differentially expressed genes involved in acute myocardial infarction in Northeast Chinese Han people. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression to identify the differentially gene between the patients with acute myocardial infarction and healthy people in Northeast Chinese Han people

DESIGN
Three patients with acute myocardial infarction and three healthy people in Northeast Chinese Han people were recruited,total RNA of each samples were extracted from peripheral blood to hybridize with Affymetrix microarrays.
