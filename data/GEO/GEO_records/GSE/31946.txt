TITLE
Factors affecting the yield of microRNAs from laser microdissectates of formalin-fixed tissue sections

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sixth generation Exiqon® locked nucleic acid miRCURY™ LNA microarrays were used to profile in duplicate the expression of microRNAs in 250 or 400 ng of RNA isolated from a laser microdissectate of a formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human non-small cell lung cancer tumor.
