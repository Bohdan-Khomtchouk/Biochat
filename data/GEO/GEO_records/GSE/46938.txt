TITLE
A temperature-responsive network links cell shape and virulence traits in a primary fungal pathogen -- RNAi mutants (1)

ORGANISM
Histoplasma capsulatum

SUMMARY
The ability to grow at host temperature is a critical trait for most pathogenic microbes of humans. Thermally dimorphic fungal pathogens, including Histoplasma capsulatum, are a class of soil fungi that undergo a dramatic change in cell shape and virulence gene expression in response to host temperature. Here we elucidate a complex temperature-responsive network in H. capsulatum, which switches from an environmental filamentous form to a pathogenic yeast form. We dissect the circuit driven by three regulators that control yeast-phase growth, and demonstrate that these factors, including two deeply conserved Velvet family proteins of unknown function, associate with DNA. We identify and characterize a fourth regulator of this pathway, and define cis-acting motifs that recruit these transcription factors to a tightly interwoven network of temperature-responsive target genes. Our results provide the first comprehensive analysis of the complex transcriptional network that links temperature to morphology and virulence in thermally dimorphic fungi. This submission gives the expression profiling results.

DESIGN
cDNA from each ryp mutants and wild-type controls was labeled with Cy5 and competitively hybridized against the Cy3-labeled pooled reference sample using  H. capsulatum whole-genome 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray. For the experiments with ryp T-DNA mutants, there were 4 to 6 replicates for each strain and condition, and for the experiments with ryp knockdown strains, there were 3 to 12 replicates for each strain and condition.  The T-DNA and knockdown experiments are being submitted as separate series, with samples further divided based on G217B platform version.
