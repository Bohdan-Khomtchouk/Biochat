TITLE
Contribution of STAT3, IRF1 and PGAM5 to androgen response in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To decipher the contribution of STAT3, IRF1 and PGAM5 to androgen-responsive gene expression, effect of siRNA-mediated silencing of STAT3, IRF1 and PGAM5 on expression of androgen-dependent genes was studied.

DESIGN
Human LNCaP prostate cancer cells were transfected with individual siRNA SmartPools targeting STAT3, IRF1 or PGAM5 or a non-targeting siRNA SmartPool.  Forty-two hours after transfection, cells were treated with synthetic androgen R1881 (5nM) or vehicle.  Three biological replicates were generated per treatment group.  Forty-eight hours later, total RNA was isolated and processed for Illumina oligoarray analysis.
