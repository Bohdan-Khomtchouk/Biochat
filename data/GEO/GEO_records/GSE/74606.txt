TITLE
Heterogeneity in early lymphoid compartments [qPCR]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to understand the developmental trajectories of early lymphocyte development it is crucial to prospectively isolate stage and lineage specific cells. It has become clear that early lymphoid progenitor compartments in the bone marrow are molecularly and functionally heterogeneous which warrants further investigation to refine the marker combinations used to isolate these progenitors. An initial antibody screen revealed extensive surface marker heterogeneity amongst early lymphoid progenitors. This heterogeneity was resolved using single cell gene expression assays and single cell in vitro differentiation assays, identifying marker combinations that isolate functionally distinct populations. In addition, using reporter transgenic mice we were able to identify a set of surface markers that can be used alone or in combination with classical targets to identify specific stages of B-cell development. B-cell stages based on transgene expression which were used for screening purposes were verified by RNASeq. The data provides a greater resolution of the complexity of the lymphoid progenitor compartment within the bone marrow than has been understood to date and provides novel tools for the further identification of cell populations in B-lineage development.

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling of mouse common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). Four 96-well plates with pre-amplified single CLP bone marrow cell cDNA (with 10 and 20 cell controls) were loaded on to a 96.96 Dynamic Array Chip for Gene Expression. Samples Ids follow where SS < X > denotes well ID, and P < X > denoted the plate. Controls include well where no RT is performed (noRT) and 10 and 20 cell controls.

PLATFORM
GPL21099 Fluidigm mouse gene panel for CLP analysis
