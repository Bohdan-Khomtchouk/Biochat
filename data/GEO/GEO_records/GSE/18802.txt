TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles in diploid and transformed tetraploid MEF cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We propose that abnormal DNA content in tetraploid cells can alter the gene expression profile, contributing to the cellular transformation. To test this hypothesis, we employ mRNA microarray to compare the gene expression profile in transformed tetraploid cells with that in the parent diploid cells. Keywords: gene expression profile determination

DESIGN
Total RNA were extracted from diploid or tetraploid cells (n = 3 for each cell lines. mRNA microarray hybridization was conducted. Data were collected and analyzed.
