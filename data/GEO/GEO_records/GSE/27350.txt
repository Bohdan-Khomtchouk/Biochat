TITLE
Expression of enzymes involved in gag synthesis and degradation in cartilage aging and arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glycoarrays are used to identify differences in the expression of enzymes involved in gag synthesis and degradation in cartilage aging and arthritis. This experiment includes 3 samples from donors with and without growth factor stimulation. Samples are from human biopsy/necropsy origin.

DESIGN
Human knee chondrocytes were grown in monolayer culture from 3 donors unstimulated or stimulated with TGFÃŸ1 (10ng/ml) for 6 hours.
