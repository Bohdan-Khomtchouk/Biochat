TITLE
1 week & 4 week styrene inhalation exposure at 2 concentrations (40ppm & 120ppm) in three strains of C57BL/6 mice (lung): wild-type (WT), CYP2F2 knockout (KO), and CYP2F1 humanized (TG) mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This data set is #1 of three generated as part of a coordinated series of experiments to examine potential modes of action of Styrene inhalation on lung and liver in male C57Bl/6 mice.  Styrene causes increased lung tumors in mice, but not in rats.  Mouse lung tumors were found mostly at the conclusion of a life-time (104 weeks for males) exposure study and most were benign.  Styrene is largely negative in genotoxicity assays.  Styrene metabolism by CYP2F2 produced a different metabolite pattern in mouse lung than in liver or in rats or humans.  The purpose of this study was to use genomic analyses to further investigate potential modes of action (MoA) of styrene in mice, using a total of three genomic data sets.  Dataset #1 exposed C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), CYP2F2 knockout (-/-; KO) and CYP2F21 humanized (2F2-KO + 2F1,2A13,2B6-transgenic, TG) male mice to 0, 40 or 120 ppm styrene at 6 hr/day 5 days/wk for 1 or 4 wk.  Lungs were analyzed by whole genome microarrays for each strain at each dose.  The second part of the study examined a broader dose response and short term exposure.  Male wild type C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to 6 inhalation concentrations of styrene: 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 120 ppm for a single 6 hour exposure. This was intended to gain dose-response data at low-observed-adverse-effect-levels (LOAELs) of styrene (â‰¥ 20 ppm) and at no-observed-adverse-effect-levels (NOAELs) of styrene ( < 20 ppm). Dataset #2 examined lung gene expression, while dataset #3 examined liver gene expression data from the same animals.

DESIGN
A total of 90 male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to two inhalation doses of styrene (40ppm and 120ppm) for 1 week and 4 weeks.  For each treatment a total of 5 biological replicates were used, from 3 strains of mice; wild type (WT), CYP2F2(-/-) knock-out (KO) and  CYP2F2(-/-),2F1,SA13,2B6 transgenic (TG), with strain specific controls included (0ppm).
