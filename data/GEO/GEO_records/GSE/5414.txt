TITLE
Gene Expression data of Arctic Ground Squirrel during the multiple stages of hibernation

ORGANISM
Urocitellus parryii

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression in a wide range of tissues including brown adipose tissue (BAT), liver, heart, hypothalamus, and skeletal muscle in hibernating arctic ground squirrels during multiple stages in torpor-arousal cycles compared to non-hibernating (post-reproductive) animals with illumina beadarray technology. Keywords: Multiple stage comparison
