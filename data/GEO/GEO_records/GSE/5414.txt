TITLE
Gene Expression data of Arctic Ground Squirrel during the multiple stages of hibernation

ORGANISM
Urocitellus parryii

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression in a wide range of tissues including brown adipose tissue (BAT), liver, heart, hypothalamus, and skeletal muscle in hibernating arctic ground squirrels during multiple stages in torpor-arousal cycles compared to non-hibernating (post-reproductive) animals with illumina beadarray technology. Keywords: Multiple stage comparison

DESIGN
Arctic Ground Squirrels were sampled at four stages of hibernation: early arousal denoted as EA (1-2 hrs after Tb cross 30¡C, n=4), late arousal denoted as LA (7-8 hrs after Tb cross 30¡C, n=4), early torpor denoted as ET (10-20% of torpid episode, n=4) and late torpor denoted as LT (80-90% of torpid episode, n=5), where Tb is the body temperature and the length of torpid episode is estimated from the previous torpor bout. Post-reproductive animals denoted as PR (n=7) were used as non-hibernating control. Five tissue types: brown adipose tissue (BAT), liver, heart, hypothalamus, and skeletal muscle were hybridized on two customized 700-gene beadarray platforms: 1A and 2A on 96-sample Illumina ArrayMatrix. The data of a pilot study involving brown adipose tissue (BAT), liver, and skeletal muscle on 16-sample Illumina BeadChip denoted as 16chip are also included in this series.
