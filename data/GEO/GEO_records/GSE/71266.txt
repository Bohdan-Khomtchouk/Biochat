TITLE
Comparison of expression profiles for Agrobacterium tumefaciens wild-type strain C58 grown with or without manganese

ORGANISM
Agrobacterium tumefaciens

SUMMARY
The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens attaches to and forms biofilms on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. The transition between free-living, planktonic A. tumefaciens and multicellular biofilms is regulated by several well-defined environmental and nutritional inputs, including pH, oxygen tension, and phosphate concentration. In many bacterial species limiting iron levels inhibit attachment and biofilm formation. In several systems intracellular levels of the redox-active manganous (Mn2+) and ferrous (Fe2+) ions are interrelated and have tight corresponding regulation with respect to one another. We show that limiting manganese concentrations elicit similar growth and biofilm phenotypes to those seen under iron-limiting conditions. Microarray analysis comparing gene expression in manganese-replete versus manganese-limiting conditions identified a small number of differentially regulated transcripts. These results indicate that the redox-active manganous and ferrous ions are required for wild-type levels of growth and biofilm formation, and that the manganese-dependent response is primarily post-transcriptional and complementary to, but not redundant with, the iron-dependent response.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates, independent RNA preparations, two dye swaps.
