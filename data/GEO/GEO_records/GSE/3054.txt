TITLE
Establishing and Characterizing a Cell Culture Model for M Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
M cells are special cells in the epithelium of the small intestinal bowel and play an important role during the initiation of a primary, fast immune response. On a Costar-Transwell filter cells of a colon adeno carcinoma cell line (Caco-2) are growing until differentiation. Then on the other side of the Caco cell layer lymphocytes from human venous blood are added. Pores in the filter membrane allow contact between lymphocytes and Caco cells. Therefore some cells of the Caco cell layer are differentiating to " M cell like " cells, showing the morpholgy and function of natural M cells. Keywords: cell type comparison, induction response
