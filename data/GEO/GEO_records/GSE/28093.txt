TITLE
Expression profile of OPC senescence

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify factors involved in OPC senescence, we compared gene expressions between OPC-CG4, OPC-FCS and OPC-Rev.

DESIGN
We established OPC senescence model system, in which OPC become senescent in the presence of high concentration of FCS. This phenotypes were kept even when the medium was switched to their optimal serum-free medium.
