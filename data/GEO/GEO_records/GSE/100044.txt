TITLE
Identification of symmetric methylation of histone H4 arginine 3 on KSHV genome (H4R3me2s ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Human gammaherpesvirus 8

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify the symmetric methylation sites on KSHV genome during latency and lytic reactivation

DESIGN
KSHV infected, TRExBCBL1-RTA cells were induced with doxycycline for 12h to trigger the lytic reactivation, cells were crosslinked and subjected for chromatin isolation and sonication. ChIP assay was performed using anti-H4R3sym antibody, Control IgG antibody, or Histone H4 antibody.
