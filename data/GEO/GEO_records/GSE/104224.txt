TITLE
Two distinct myeloid subsets at the term human fetal-maternal interface

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The subsets of immune cells within the human placenta are incompletely described. We used microarray to determine the transcriptional differences between two myeloid subsets in the term human placenta.

DESIGN
Human myeloid cells from the normal human term placenta were sorted to high purity for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. This series contains re-analyzed samples from GSE78896: GSM2080659 - GSM2080662.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
