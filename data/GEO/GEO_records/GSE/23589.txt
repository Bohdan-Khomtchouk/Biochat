TITLE
Genes regulated by SOX2 overexpression in gastric cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify candidate downstream target genes of SOX2 in gastric cancer cells, we transiently expressed exogenous SOX2 in a gastric cancer cell line NUGC3 and analyzed significant changes of gene expression.

DESIGN
NUGC3 cells were infected with the optimum 20 MOI (infectious units/cell) of SOX2- or control GFP-expressing adenoviral vectors. At 72 h after infection, the cells were harvested for cDNA microarray analysis.
