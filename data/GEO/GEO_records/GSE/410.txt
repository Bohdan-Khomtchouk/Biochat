TITLE
IMR-90 cells: Tissue Culture Polystyrene Time Course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IMR-90 Human Fibroblasts were seeded onto TCPS dishes.  mRNA was isolated at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 96 hours. This time course was used as a control for gene expression studies on collagen/chondroitin sulfate tissue engineering scaffold materials using the same cell line. Keywords = tissue culture plates Keywords: time-course
