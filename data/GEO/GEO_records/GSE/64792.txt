TITLE
A Long Noncoding RNA Acts as a Tumor Suppressor in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Many long noncoding transcripts are involved in cancer progression. Here, we utilized high-throughput microarray to compare the transcriptome alterations between the KYSE30 cells overexpressing an empty vector and Epist, thus identified 95 and 99 down-regulated and up-regulated genes, respectively. Expression levels of several previously reported genes implicated in cancer development and progression were altered, such as DDIT3, GATA6, UPP1, FAT3. These genes are involved in tumorigenesis through diverse mechanisms. The present study reveals that Epist functions as a tumor suppressor in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

DESIGN
KYSE30 cells overexpressing an empty vector were compared to KYSE30 cells overexpressing Epist. Three biological replicates of each condition were analysed on Agilent microarray.
