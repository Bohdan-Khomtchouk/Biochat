TITLE
Global gene expression of various tissues with different treatments of deciduous dioecious tree, Eucommia ulmoides

ORGANISM
Eucommia ulmoides

SUMMARY
To obtain the global gene expression of Eucommia ulmoides, microarray analyses based on EST was conducted. We used 5 kinds of samples (inner stem, outer stem, immature fruit, flower, and leaf) with hormon (IAA, NPA, ABA), light (dark, bright field) & temperature (27, 37, 42Â°C) treatmens. In total, 102 independent samples were analysed.

DESIGN
Gene expression of various plant tissues including inner and outer stems, female and male reproductive organs and leaves with hormon, heat, light treatments.
