TITLE
affy_med_2011_14-Transcriptomic analysis of roots of WT (A17) Medicago truncatula plants and of a hypermycorrhizal mutant (B9) grown on limiting (P/10) or non-limiting phosphate (P2).

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
affy_med_2011_14 - affy_med_2011_14 - -In natural ecosystems most terrestrial plants form arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), mutualistic symbioses with soil fungi belonging to the order Glomeromycota. This symbiosis takes place when phosphate is limiting and enables the plant to acquire nutrients (in particular phosphate) in exchange of carbon provided to the fungus A hypermycorrhizal mutant B9 was identified (Morandi et al. Mycorrhiza (2009) 19: 435) which displayed higher root colonization by Glomus intraradices. This phenotype could be linked to a defect in phosphate sensing or transport. We have undertaken the analysis of the root transcriptome of both WT and mutant plants grown on limiting or non-limiting phosphate to determine which processes are affected in the hypermycorrhizal mutant.-- Roots were harvested from 4 week-old WT and B9 mutant plants grown in a culture chamber with limiting (P/10, 130 µM phosphate) or non limiting (P2, 2.6 mM phosphate) phosphate under long days (16 hrs day at 22°C with 380 µE.m-2.s-1 light and 8hrs night at 19°C). RNAs were then extracted for transcriptomic analysis. We will compare WT (or mutant) root transcriptome on P/10 versus WT (or mutant) root transcriptome on P2 as well as mutant versus WT transcriptome on either P/10 or P2.
