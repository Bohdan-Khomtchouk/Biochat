TITLE
Gene expression profiling in murine monocyte-dendritic cell progenitors (MDPs), common monocyte progenitors (cMoPs) and 32Dcl.3 cells transduced with C/EBPalpha and/or IRF8

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To understand the mechanism by which IRF8 inhibits neutrophil differentiation

DESIGN
Murine bone marrow MDPs and cMoPs were isolated by cell sorting from wild-type or Irf8 deficient mice.  32Dcl.3 cells were transduced with retroviruses carrying murine C/EBPalpha cDNA and/or murine Irf8 cDNA. Two independent experiments were performed.
