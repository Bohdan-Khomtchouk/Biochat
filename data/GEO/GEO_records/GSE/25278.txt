TITLE
Gp130-dependent release of acute phase proteins is linked to the activation of innate immune signaling pathways

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gp130 dependent gene expression was analyzed in a previously established hepatocyte-specific gp130-knockout mouse model. Whole transcriptome analysis for isolated hepatocytes was performed to measure tissue specific responses after proinflammatory stimulus with IL-6 across different time points. We observed differences in the hepatocyte-specific transcriptional gp130 dependent response for genes associated with different aspects of the innate immune system. Our findings suggest a complex network of tightly-linked genes involved in the early activation of different parts of the innate immune response including acute phase proteins, complement and coagulation cascade.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from a total number of 61 samples of isolated hepatocytes of hepatocyte-specific gp130-knockout and gp130flox mice, which were subjected to Il-6 treatment for 0, 1, 3, 6 or 12 hours, respectively.
