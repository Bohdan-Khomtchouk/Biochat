TITLE
Expression Profiling of Arabidopsis Long Intergenic Nongcoding RNA in Inflorescences, Leaves, and Roots

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNA) transcribed from intergenic regions of eukaryotic genomes play important roles in key biological processes; yet, plant lincRNAs remain poorly characterized. Here we profiled lincRNA expression in inflorescences, leaves and roots using ATH lincRNA v1 array. we found 92% lincRNAs could be detected in at least 2 ATH lincRNA v1 arrays and majority of the lincRNAs were expressed at levels higher than those of pri-miRNAs but lower than those of mRNAs.Using a cut-off of 2-fold change, we identified 149 lincRNAs preferentially expressed in inflorescences, 232 in leaves and 164 in roots.

DESIGN
Nine arrays were hybridized with RNAs from inflorescences, leaves and roots with 3 biological replicates.
