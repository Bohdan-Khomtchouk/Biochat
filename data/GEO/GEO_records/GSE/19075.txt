TITLE
Global gene expression profile of colon from wild-type and AE2-knockout mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to identify changes in gene expression levels between wild-type and AE2-knockout colon.

DESIGN
7 wild-type and 7 AE2-null colon RNA samples were compared to identify genes that are differentially expressed in the colon of AE2 knockout mice. Total RNA was collected from both male and female wild-type and AE2-null colons (including both proximal and distal colon) when the mice were 18 days old.  All pairs were gender- and aged-matched, and all mice were on a mixed 129 Black Swiss background. To facilitate statistical analysis and reduce any affects of Cy3 and Cy5 labeling, comparisons of two wild-type and two AE2-null samples were repeated using a dye flip.
