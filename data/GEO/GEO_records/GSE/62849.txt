TITLE
Gene expression profiling of 1205Lu human melanoma cells after reversible shifting between monolayer and stem cell-like growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA samples were prepared from a 1205Lu original cell monolayer (OM), melanoma stem cell-like bodies (MB), and a new cell monolayer derived from stem cell-like bodies (NM).

DESIGN
Experiment included 3 samples: a reference sample (OM) and two experimental samples (MB,NM).
