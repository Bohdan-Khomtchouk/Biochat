TITLE
Comparison of transcriptome profile between wild-type and dst mutant plants

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Drought and salinity are two main abiotic-stresses negatively affecting crop growth and productivity worldwide with largely decreasing crop yields. The understanding of plant responses to stresses in physiology, genetics, and molecular biology will be greatly helpful to improve the tolerance of crops to abiotic-stresses through genetic engineering.To identify the genetic loci that control drought and salt tolerance in rice, we performed a large-scale screen for the mutants with altered drought and salt tolerance. A drought and salt tolerance (dst) mutant line was isolated.In this series, we compare the transcriptome of wild-type plant Zhonghua11 and dst mutants under the normal growth conditions. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
6 samples (3 biological replicates for each line) were used in this experiment.
