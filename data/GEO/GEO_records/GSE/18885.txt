TITLE
Expression data from human Wegener’s granulomatosis patients and normal controls in PBMCs and in PMNs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) is a systemic inflammatory disease that can lead to substantial morbidity.  This study seeks to further understanding of the biology underlying WG, and to discover markers of disease activity useful in prognosis and treatment guidance.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was performed on total RNA from PBMC and from granulocyte (PMN) fractions from 41 WG patients and 23 healthy controls, using Illumina HumanRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChips. For each of the 64 subjects, there is expression data for the PBMC and for the PMN fractions, so, for example, the RNA for SAMPLE 1 PBMC and for SAMPLE 1 PMN comes from the same individual.  Note there is no PMN expression data for SAMPLE 35 since that PMN RNA sample failed quality control. Details of the design, and the gene signatures found are given in the paper (PMID 20155833) associated with this GEO Series.
