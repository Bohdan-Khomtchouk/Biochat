TITLE
Topologically-associating domains and their long-range contacts are established during early G1 coincident with the establishment of the replication timing program

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study uncovers a temporal hierarchy of chromatin re-organization during G1 that is linked to the developmental and temporal control of replication timing, revealing a novel link between development and genome organization.

DESIGN
Analysis of time-course 4C-seq for several baits to study dynamic changes in chromatin organization during early G1

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
