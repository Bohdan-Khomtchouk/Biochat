TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of gene expression and transcription factors binding reveals new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation during Drosophila spermatogenesis [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To investigate the mechanisms of gene regulation during Drosophila spermatogenesis, we studied the effects of comr and can mutations on the chromatin of the cells in Drosophila testes by H3K27me3 ChIP-Seq.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq of H3K27me3 histone modification in comr- and can-mutant testes of Drosophila melanogaster. We processed two biological replicates of every sample and corresponding input specimen.

PLATFORM
GPL16479 Illumina MiSeq (Drosophila melanogaster)
