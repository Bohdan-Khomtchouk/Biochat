TITLE
Whole-transcriptome expression data from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) silenced for KChIP2

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Loss of KChIP2 during cardiac stress has been suggested to have a transcriptional impact on cardiac ion channels  contributing to maladaptive electrical remodeling. Therefore, we tested the consequence of KChIP2 loss, in the absence of cardiac stress, by treating cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with shRNA for KChIP2 and subsequently performed whole-transcriptome microarray analysis to identify gene changes.

DESIGN
NRVMs were isolated from the hearts of neonatal (day 1-2) Sprague Dawley rats. They were subsequently plated and cultured for 24-36 hrs then treated with either a control or KChIP2 shRNA inserted into a adenoviral construct. Cells were left in culture for an additional 48 hrs following shRNA delivery, after which they were collected for total RNA.
