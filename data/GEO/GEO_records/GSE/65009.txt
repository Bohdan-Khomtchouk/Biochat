TITLE
YM155 treated KYSE410

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the gene expression profiles of KYSE410 cell line to identify distinct up and down-regulated genes during treatment with cisplatin.

DESIGN
KYSE410 cell line were treated with 20 nM YM155 for 6 hrs and selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to gene expression profiles of KYSE 410 cell line treated with cisplatin.
