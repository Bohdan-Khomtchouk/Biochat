TITLE
Genomic and physiological responses to strong selective pressure during late organogenesis: how natural Fundulus heteroclitus populations cope with persistent environmental pollution Superfund Site

ORGANISM
Fundulus heteroclitus

SUMMARY
This study explores the synergistic effects of two model PAHs, an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist (β-naphthoflavone) and a cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) inhibitor (α-naphthoflavone), on gene expression in stage 31 embryos from two different population.  One population (Elizabeth River population) is relatively resistant to the pollutants in its environment.

DESIGN
A loop design (Figure 5) was used for the microarray hybridizations where each sample is hybridized to 2 arrays using both Cy3 and Cy5 labeled fluorophores (Kerr and Churchill, 2001).  The loop consisted of Cy3 and Cy5 labeled embryo aRNAs from 4 biological samples and six different treatments (T1-T6: control, 1 μg/L BNF, 50 μg/L ANF, 100 μg/L ANF, 1 μg/L BNF + 50 μg/L ANF, 1 μg/L BNF + 100 μg/L ANF).  In total, 48 biological samples were hybridized to 24 microarrays.  Each array had different combinations of biological samples, so that the most direct comparisons (i.e., 50 µg/L ANF resistant embryo and 50 µg/L sensitive embryo) are hybridized to the same array.  The loop formed was T1S→ T1R → T2S→ T2R →T3S→ T3R→ T4S→ T4R→ T5S→ T5R → T6S→T6R→ T1S→ T2S → T3S → T4S → T5S → T6S → T1S → T1R → T2R → T3R → T4R → T5R → T6R, where each arrow represents a separate hybridization (array) with the biological sample at the base of the arrow labeled with Cy3 and the biological pool at the head of the arrow labeled with Cy5.  T1-6 is treatment, and S and R represent sensitive and resistant embryos.
