TITLE
Identification of changes in gene expression in seedlings of the ashh2/sdg8 Arabidopsis mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Mutation of the ASHH2 gene has pleiotropic developmental effects. The aim of the study was to identify changes in gene expression in seedlings of the ashh2-1/sdg8-1 mutant (SALK_065480, insertion in the gene At1g77300, SDG8/EFS/ASHH2) and look for  correlation wth changes in  methylation marks on histone tails. Wild type Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Colombia) seedlings were used as reference. For low-expresssed tissue-specific genes there was a correlation between reduced H3K36me3 levels and reduction in expression. Although some highly expressed genes with low tissue-specificity show reduced H3K36me3 levels in the mutant, expression levels were, however, not affeccted.

DESIGN
Six biological replicates with 12 plants each both of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (ecotype Colombia-0) and ashh2-1/sgd8-1 mutant (SALK_065480, insertion in the gene At1g77300, SDG8/EFS/ASHH2) were sown out on soil and grown under the following conditions; 22oC day and 18oC night, 16 hr day length with 30 min adjustment of light to on and off, and 85 Î¼mol/m2/sek in light intensity. The inflorescences of each biological replikate were harvested in bulk from 30-36 days old plants at same time of the day (between 12:45 and 13:45) and at the same developmental stage in bulk.
