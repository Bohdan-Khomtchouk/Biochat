TITLE
SOX10 Single Transcription Factor Based Fast and Efficient Generation of Oligodendrocytes from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the use of a single transcription factor, SOX10, for the generation of oligodendrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells. We further used RNA sequencing to compare the oligodendrocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells to different primary cells. It was revealed that oligodendrocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells are representative of intermediate oligodendrocytes during embryonic development.

DESIGN
Examination of different primary cells and oligodendrocytes derived from different human pluripotent stem cell lines

PLATFORM
