TITLE
Whole-genome gene expression profiling of dorsal root ganglion neurons after nerve damage

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We generated whole-genome gene expression profiles of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons following nerve damage. DRG neurons extend one peripheral axon into the spinal nerve and one central axon into the dorsal root. The peripheral axon regenerates vigorously, while in contrast the central axon has little regenerative capacity. For this study, two groups of animals were subjected either to sciatic nerve (SN) or dorsal root (DR) crush, and at 12, 24, 72 hours and 7 days after the crush, lumbar DRGs L4, L5 and L6 were dissected and total RNA was extracted.

DESIGN
For each time point after lesion, three biological replicate RNA samples  were hybridized together with the common reference sample consisting of labeld RNA pooled from three unlesioned animals.
