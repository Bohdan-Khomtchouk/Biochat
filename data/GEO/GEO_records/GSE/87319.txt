TITLE
MeDIP-Chip from deliveries of control fetuses or fetuses with NTDs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Neural-tube defects (NTDs) are common birth defects of complex etiology. Although many studies have confirmed a genetic component, the exact mechanism between DNA methylation and NTDs remains unclear.In this study,the alteration of methylation from placental tissues of normal infants or with NTDs.Results demonstrated that DNA methylation changed in specific gene location.

DESIGN
Comparison the DNA methylation site of placenta tissues between control fetuses with NTD's fetuses
