TITLE
Genome-wide maps of RNA Polymerase II and p65 localization in HUVECs stimulated with TNF alpha

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TNF alpha is one of the inflammatory mediator and induce genes mainly by  transcriptional factor, p65,  in endothelial cells. This time, we performed a time course study to detect the change of localization of p65 and Pol II.

DESIGN
To identify p65 and Pol II binding sites, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) of HUVECs treated with or without TNF alpha for 30 mins.  Cells were starved before stimulation longer than 16 hours.  HUVECs were used within the first 6 passages.  For crosslinking, 10 mM of EGS in 50% glacial acetic acid was used for 45 min, followed by 20 min of 1% paraformaldehyde treatmet was used.
