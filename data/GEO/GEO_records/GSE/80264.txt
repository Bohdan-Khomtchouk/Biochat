TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of H9 hESC derived cerebral organoids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was utilized to characterize the transcriptome of human embryonic stem cells-derived 3D cerebral organoids. Briefly, H9 hESCs were differentiated into cerebral organoids using previously established methods (Lancaster, 2013). Coding and noncoding genes were analyzed in 1 month and 2 month old cerebral organoid samples.

DESIGN
Examination of transcriptome of hESC and cerebral organoids 1 month and 2 months old with 2 experimental replicates per group.
