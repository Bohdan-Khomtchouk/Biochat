TITLE
Gene expression data from immunological non-responders and responders to antiretroviral therapy in HIV infected patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Among the ART treated patients, 15-20% show discordant response to therapy with lack of increase in CD4+ T cell count despite of undectable viral load, termed as immunological non responders or immunological failures. The mechanisms are not well established In the current study, we have used microarray based differential gene expression profile analysis among these cohorts to elucidate the mechanisms of immunologic non responsiveness to ART

DESIGN
A total 21 samples were analyzed in current study. HIV-1 subtype C infected patients showing immunological non responsiveness (Seven biological replicates), subjects responding to therapy (Five biological replicates), therapy naive (Five biological replicates) along with healthy controls (Four biological replicates) were recruited in this study. RNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects used for hybridization on Affymetric array
