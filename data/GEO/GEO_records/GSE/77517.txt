TITLE
Genome-wide evaluation of change in lncRNA expression in non-functioning pituitary adenoma using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in the formation of many different types of tumors. However, expression profiles and potential functions of lncRNAs in non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) have not been systematically evaluated. We evaluated the expression profiles and potential functions of lncRNAs in non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs).

DESIGN
10 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens (5 non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) and 5 normal pituitaries(NPs)) were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The NFPAs team was designed as the Tumor group (T), while the NPs team was designed as Normal group (N).
