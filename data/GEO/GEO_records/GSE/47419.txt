TITLE
Transcriptome profiles of mouse mammary stem cells and progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MaSC, Luminal progenitor enriched subpopulations were isolated from virgin and pregnant mice based on using both surface marker or internal reporter transgene (GFP) expression. (Tiede BJ et al., 2009, PLoS ONE 4(11): e8035. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008035), and the transcirptome profiles were determined and compared.

DESIGN
Two MaSC differential methods: CD24/CD29 & GFP reporter; two physiolgical condition: virgin vs pregnant; the combination of ((P4, GFPhi)  vs (P5, P6, GFPlo)) x (vg vs pg)

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
