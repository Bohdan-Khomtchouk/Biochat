TITLE
RNA Sequencing for reprogrammed beta cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alpha-cell-derived INS+ cells (yellow cells) were isolated 1 month after AAV-PM (adeno-associated virus carrying pdx1 and mafA under the CMV promoter) infusion from ALX-treated GCG-Cre; R26RTomato; MIP-GFP mice, based on expression of tomato red (alpha-cell lineage) and GFP by flow cytometry. Sorted normal GFP+ beta cells and normal TOM+ alpha cells from GCG-Cre; R26RTomato; MIP-GFP mice without any treatment were used as controls.

DESIGN
Examination of gene profile in reprogrammed mouse beta cells from alpha cells, compared to primary mouse beta cells and alpha cells

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
