ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Expression profile of mutant cells compared to wild-type cells: Expression profile of Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome  in ∆pht1, ∆ago1, ∆clr4, rik1, ∆pht1rik1, ∆pht1∆ago1 and ∆pht1∆clr4 cells. Expression profile of Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome  in ∆rrp6, ∆cid14, ∆swi6, ∆swr1, ∆set1, ∆pht1∆swi6 and ∆pht1∆set1 cells. Expression profile of Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome  in ∆alp13, ∆cph1, ∆set2, clr6-1 and ∆cph1∆pht1 cells. Occupancy profiling: Occupancy profiling of RNA polymerase II, histone variant H2A.Z and ClrC subunit Rik1 in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe Occupancy profiling of histone variant H2A.Z  in ∆msc1 cells.

DESIGN
Agilent 60mer oligonucleotide custom array containing probes spanning large portion of chromosome 2 at 50bp resolution was used to profile expression levels in mutant cells and to compare them to levels in wild-type cells. Agilent 60mer array was used to analyze DNA recovered by immunoprecipitation of  RNA polymerase II, H2A.Z or Rik1 from asynchronous culture of fission yeast. Agilent 60mer array was used to analyze DNA recovered by immunoprecipitation of  histone H2A.Z  from asynchronous culture of fission yeast.
