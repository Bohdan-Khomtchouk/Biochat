TITLE
The Scc2NIPBL/Scc4MAU2 complex acts in sister chromatid cohesion and transcriptional regulation by maintaining nucleosome-free regions [microarray]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Scc2/Scc4 complex binds to broad nucleosome-free regions in the promoters of highly expressed genes. The cohesin loader is recruited to these sites by the RSC chromatin remodeling complex

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from wt, scc2-4 and sth1-3 cells at 25°C and 37°C. dscDNA was obtained using the IVT system (Invitrogen) and hybridized to Affymetrix Yeast Genome 2.0 Arrays to analyze the expression profile of wt, scc2-4 and sth1-3 cells.
