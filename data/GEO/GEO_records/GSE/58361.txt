TITLE
Genome-wide co-occupancy of Hoxa9 and C/EBPα in Hoxa9/Meis1 transformed HSCs [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of the genome-wide binding sites of Hoxa9 and C/EBPα in a murine myeloblastic cell line transformed by Hoxa9/Meis1. Over 50% of Hoxa9 binding sites are co-bound by C/EBPα, providing mechanistic insight into the requirement of C/EBPα for Hoxa9-mediated leukemogenesis. Additionally, genome-wide occupancy of H3K4 monomethylation and H3K27 trimethylation provide additional information on the functionality of Hoxa9/C/EBPα cobound loci.

DESIGN
Examination of two transcription factor binding sites and two histone modifications in a transformed cell line.
