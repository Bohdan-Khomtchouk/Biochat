TITLE
Host Regulatory Network Response in Calu-3 cell Infection with A/CA/04/2009 Influenza virus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential Expression was determined in Calu-3 cells between mock infected and infection with A/CA/04/2009 Influenza virus at nime time points post infection.

DESIGN
Calu-3 cells were infected with A/CA/04/2009 Influenza virus at MOI of 3, samples were collected 0,3,7,12,18, 24, 30, 36 and 48 hpi. Expression profiles and DE genes were determined for all time points.  There are 3 mock and infected replicates for each time point.
