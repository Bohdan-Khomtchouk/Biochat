TITLE
The Genetic Basis of Rapidly Evolving Male Genital Morphology in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila mauritiana

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of total RNA extracted from the genital discs of males for each of the following strains : Drosophila sechellia, Drosophila mauritiana, hybrid introgression line 3Q1(A) and hybrid introgression line Q1(A)

DESIGN
Analysis of poly(A)+ RNA for three independent biological replicates of sequencing libraries for each of the following strains: D. sechellia w, D. mauritiana P-insertion Q1, hybrid introgression line 3Q1(A), and hybrid introgression line Q1(A).  Male genital discs were obtained as described above, and total RNA was extracted using RNAqueousÂ®-Micro Kit (Ambion).  Poly(A)+ transcripts were isolated subsequently using MicroPoly(A)Puristâ¢ Kit (Ambion).  To facilitate normalization of reads across our samples, at this stage of library construction we spiked-in small amounts of exogenous RNA from ArrayControlâ¢ Kit (Ambion) into each sample of poly(A)+ RNA. Paired-end sequencing was carried out by loading the samples onto four lanes (three samples per lane) of a flow cell and run on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx sequencer using 72 cycles per end of each paired-end read.  Biological replicates of each genotype were loaded onto separate lanes.
