TITLE
The Genetic Basis of Rapidly Evolving Male Genital Morphology in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila mauritiana ; Drosophila sechellia ; Drosophila sechellia x Drosophila mauritiana

SUMMARY
Deep sequencing of total RNA extracted from the genital discs of males for each of the following strains : Drosophila sechellia, Drosophila mauritiana, hybrid introgression line 3Q1(A) and hybrid introgression line Q1(A)

DESIGN
Analysis of poly(A)+ RNA for three independent biological replicates of sequencing libraries for each of the following strains: D. sechellia w, D. mauritiana P-insertion Q1, hybrid introgression line 3Q1(A), and hybrid introgression line Q1(A).  Male genital discs were obtained as described above, and total RNA was extracted using RNAqueousÂ®-Micro Kit (Ambion).  Poly(A)+ transcripts were isolated subsequently using MicroPoly(A)Puristâ¢ Kit (Ambion).  To facilitate normalization of reads across our samples, at this stage of library construction we spiked-in small amounts of exogenous RNA from ArrayControlâ¢ Kit (Ambion) into each sample of poly(A)+ RNA. Paired-end sequencing was carried out by loading the samples onto four lanes (three samples per lane) of a flow cell and run on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx sequencer using 72 cycles per end of each paired-end read.  Biological replicates of each genotype were loaded onto separate lanes.
