TITLE
An early inflammatory gene profile in visceral adipose tissue in children

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to characterize expression profiles of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue in children. Adipose tissue samples were collected from children having elective surgery (n=71, [54 boys], 6.0 +- 4.3 years). Affymetrix microarrays (n=20) were performed to characterize the functional profile and identify genes of interest in adipose tissue. Visceral adipose tissue had an overrepresentation of Gene Ontology themes related to immune and inflammatory responses and subcutaneous adipose tissue had an overrepresentation of themes related to adipocyte growth and development. Likewise, qPCR performed in the whole cohort showed a 30-fold increase in haptoglobin (P < 0.005), 7-fold increase in IL-10 (P < 0.001), 8-fold decrease in VEGF (P < 0.01) and a 28-fold decrease in TBOX15 (P < 0.001) in visceral compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue.The inflammatory pattern in visceral adipose tissue may represent an early stage of the adverse effects of this depot, and combined with chronic obesity, may contribute to increased metabolic and cardiovascular risk.

DESIGN
20 human samples from pre-pubertal boys and girls were assessed for differences in expression between subcutaneous (n=15) and visceral fat (n=5), with 1 microarray per subject
