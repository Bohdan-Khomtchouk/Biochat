TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profile in RAG2+ B lineage cells from the small intestinal lamina propria and RAG2+ B lineage cells from the bone marrow

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used a RAG2-GFP reporter mouse to show that RAG+ B lineage cells can be found in the small intestinal lamina proria in normally-housed mice at weaning age. We used microarry expression analysis to compare the RAG2+ population in the gut to the RAG2+ B lineage population in the bone marrow. Microarray was used to compare RAG2+ lamina propria B cells to RAG2+ bone marrow B cells.

DESIGN
For each experiment, RAG2-GFP+ cells from 8-12 post-natal day 17-25 RAG2-GFP reporter mice were sorted from small intestinal lamina propria lymphocyte preparations and bone marrow. RNA extracted from trizol was used for the analysis. 3 independent replicates were performed.
