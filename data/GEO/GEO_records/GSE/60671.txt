TITLE
Expression data from HeLa cells with and without human recombinant TIMP-4 treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TIMP-4 overexpression increases tumor burden in mice, promotes progenitor cell phenotype and sensitizes cells to apoptosis, by relying on NFkB signaling

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the molecules and signal transduction pathways modulated by hrTIMP-4

PLATFORM
