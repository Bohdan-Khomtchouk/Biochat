TITLE
Gene expression analysis in the lungs of Fra-2 Transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The aim of this experiment is to identify novel gene candidates being regulated in Fra-2 overexpressing mice. Fra-2 over-expressing mice (Fra-2 TG) develop vascular remodeling and pulmonary fibrosis. Fra-2, as a trascription factor, is responsible for downstream target genes expression. Comparison of the mRNA expressed from WT  and Fra-2 TG  animals will help to identify Fra-2 target genes. The microarray analysis will be performed in mRNA isolated from  lung homogenate. The lungs of the mice were extensively perfused. The right part was snap-froen and transfered to (-80Â°C). The total RNA was isolated and quantified.

DESIGN
Comparison of transgenes vs. wild-types. Hybridization of samples from 4 wild-type and 4 transgene animals = 8 single-color hybridizations

PLATFORM
