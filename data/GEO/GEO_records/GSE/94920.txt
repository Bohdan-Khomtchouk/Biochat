Dual angiopoietin-2 and VEGFA inhibition elicits anti-tumor immunity that is enhanced by PD1 checkpoint blockade

SUMMARY
Pathological angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer and therapeutic target. Vascular-endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) and angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) sustain tumor angiogenesis and limit anti-tumor immunity. Here we show that combined ANGPT2 and VEGFA blockade by a bi-specific antibody (A2V) provided synergistic anti-tumoral benefits in transgenic and transplant tumor models, including metastatic breast cancer, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and melanoma. Mechanistically, A2V promoted tumor vascular regression, necrosis, and antigen presentation by intra-tumoral phagocytes. A2V also “normalized” the remaining blood vessels and facilitated the extravasation and perivascular accumulation of activated, interferon-γ (IFNγ)-expressing CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). While the anti-tumoral activity of A2V was partly CTL-dependent, CTLs concurrently upregulated the immune checkpoint ligand PDL1 in the vascular endothelial cells. IFNγ neutralization blunted this adaptive response, and PD1 blockade improved tumor control by A2V in different cancer models. These findings position CTLs as key effectors of anti-angiogenic therapy and support the rationale for co-targeting angiogenesis and immune checkpoints in cancer therapy.

DESIGN
Orthotopic MMTV-PyMT mammary tumors were generated as follows. Late stage, primary MMTV-PyMT tumor-derived cells were obtained from 14- to 15-week old female MMTV-PyMT mice, following tumor digestion with collagenase IV (0.2 mg/ml, Worthington), dispase (2 mg/ml, Lifetechnologies), and DNaseI (0.1 mg/ml, Lifetechnologies) treatment in IMDM medium for 30 min at 37°C. The cell suspensions were filtered using a cell strainer (70 μm) and washed in PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 2% FBS. Tumor-derived cells were then cultured in 15-cm petri dishes for 48 h in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine (Amimed) and a combination of 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco). Non-adherent/dead cells and debris were then washed away, and 2x106 tumor-derived cells (in PBS) were orthotopically injected in the fourth mammary fat pad of 8-10–week-old female FVB/n mice. When tumors reached a size of 300 mm3, mice were injected i.p with the following moAbs: mouse IgG1 (clone MOPC-21, 500 μg) + rat IgG2a (clone 2A3, 100 μg), designated as “IgG”; or anti-VEGFA/ANGPT2 (A2V, 500 μg) + rat IgG2a (clone 2A3, 100 μg), designated “A2V”.  Five days later, mice were euthanized and tumors harvested and prepared for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cells were stained with CD45, CD8, CD4, CD31, CD11b, F480 and 7-AAD. After live-dead and single-cell discrimination, cell populations were discriminated according to the following markers:   Endothelial cells (ECs): CD45–CD31+;  TAMs: CD45+CD11b+F480+.    CD8+ T cells: CD45+CD11b–CD8+;   CD4+ T cells: CD45+CD11b–CD4+;   Cell sorting was performed using FACS Aria II apparatus (BD). Each cell population (n=4) was isolated from an independent tumor. Typically, 2x104 to 2x105 cells were obtained for each cell population.
