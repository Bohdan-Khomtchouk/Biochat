TITLE
Global analysis of dauer gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
These are the 94 microarray experiments that are published in the paper: John Wang and Stuart K. Kim. Global analysis of dauer gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans, Development 2003 130: 1621-1634. There are 94 individual microarray experiments divided into 3 broad experiments. The first experiment is a time course of dauer exit; each time course is labeled as " Dauer MTC# " . The second experiment is a time course of L1 development after starvation arrest; each time couse is labeled " L1 MTC# " . The final experiment is a comparison of pure dauers (0 hours) versus 12 hours after dauer exit and are labeled " Dauer Adjust " . Every time course was repeated 4 times (#N)however for the dauer 4 and 7 hour time points there are only 3 replicates. For instance, all the time points labeled as " Dauer MTC#1 " are from the same starting pool of dauer worms that were aliquoted into 10 fractions and analyzed at the time indicated. Every sample is compared to a common reference RNA that is used throughout all the hybridizations. In some cases there is a " -2 " after the hour designation; this means the first hybridization failed for some technical reason and thus the second hybridization (same RNA) is reported. Groups of assays that are related as part of a time series. Keywords: time_series_design
