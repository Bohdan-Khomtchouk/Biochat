TITLE
Systemic inflammation modulates Fc receptor expression on microglia in chronic neurodegeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the inflammatory response in neurodegenerative disease during an episode of systemic inflammation using the ME7 prion model. Comparison of ME7-infected mice with mice innoculated with Normal brain homogenate (NBH). 18 weeks post-innoculation mice were administered 500ug/kg LPS or an equivalent volume of saline as a control.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the hippocampus, amplified and reverse transcribed to cDNA using WT ovation kit and hybridised to mouse 430_2.0 Affymetrix Arrays. There were three biological replicates (individual  mice) per group.
