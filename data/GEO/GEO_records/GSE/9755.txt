TITLE
Tannin resistance strategies of Escherichia coli in anaerobic conditions

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli K-12

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli, grown anaerobically, with or without Acacia mearnsii (Black wattle) extract were compared to identify tannin-resistance strategies. The cell envelope stress protein, spy, and the multidrug transporter-encoding mdtABCD, both under the control of the BaeSR two-component regulatory system, were significantly up-regulated in the presence of tannins. BaeSR mutants were more tannin-sensitive than their wild-type counterparts. Keywords: tannin resistance
