TITLE
Alveoli septation inhibition and protection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
It has been shown that dexamethasone (Dex) impairs the normal lung septation that occurs in the early postnatal period. Treatment with retinoic acid (ATRA) abrogates the effects of Dex. To understand the molecular basis for the Dex indiced inhibition of the formation of the alveoli and the ability of ATRA to prevent the inhibition of septation, gene expression was analyzed in 4-day old mice treated with diluent (control), Dex-treated and ATRA+Dex-treated.
