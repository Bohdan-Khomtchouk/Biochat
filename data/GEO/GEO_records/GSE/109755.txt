TITLE
A novel hippocampal long-range VIP-GABAergic projection to subiculum contributes to fear memory formation through region-specific connectivity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced seven long-range projection vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons from the mouse CA1 oriens/alveus area using patch-seq technique to determine their molecular identity.

DESIGN
Cells were recorded using patch-clamp technique, filled with biocytin for morphological identification and aspirated for next-generation sequencing. Only cells with confirmed axonal projections from the CA1 to subiculum were included.

PLATFORM
