TITLE
Probing the regulatory effects of specific mutations in three major binding domains of the pleiotropic regulator CcpA of Bacillus subtilis

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Study the effect of single amino acid point mutations in CcpA at the transcriptome level. Cells were grown in LB with or without 1% glucose and harvested at an OD600 of 0.3 (early exponential phase).

DESIGN
Bacillus subtilis strain ccpA::spec carrying pHT304 (empty plasmid), pWH_ccpA_M17R, pWH_ccpA_T62H, or pWH_ccpA_R304W were grown in LB with or without 1% glucose. The control in the microarray study was the strain Bacillus subtilis ccpA::spec carrying pWH_ccpA-wt. All Bacillus subtilis cultures were harvested in the early exponential growth phase at an OD600 of 0.3 from 100 ml culture. Two independent cultures of each strain per growth condition (+/- glucose) and a technical replicate (dye-swap) were used. Please note that '[A}' and '{B}' channels (in the raw data *slide.txt files) correspond to Cy3 (Ch1) and Cy5 (Ch2) in each sample record.
