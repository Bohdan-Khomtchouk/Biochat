TITLE
Genome-wide Analysis of Class IIa Histone Deacetylase Regulation of Hepatic Gluconeogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of Class II Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis at the gene expression level. We show that in liver, Class IIa HDACs (HDAC4, 5, and 7) are all phosphorylated and excluded from the nucleus by AMPK family kinases. In response to the fasting hormone glucagon, Class IIa HDACs rapidly translocate to the nucleus where they directly bind to the promoters of gluconeogenic enzymes such as G6Pase. In turn, HDAC4/5 mediate the acute transcriptional induction of these genes via deacetylation and activation of Foxo family transcription factors. Loss of Class IIa HDACs in the murine liver results in inhibition of FOXO target genes and lowers blood glucose, resulting in increased glycogen storage.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from primary hepatocytes infected with shGFP or shHDAC4 & 5 subjected to 2 or 4 hours treatment with DMSO or forskolin.
