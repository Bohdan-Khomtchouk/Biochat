TITLE
Transcription factor transcriptome during somatic embryogenesis (SE) in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To identify transcription factor (TF) genes exhibiting preferential expression during SE, expression profiles of 1,880 TFs were compared in two genotypes with largely different capacities for SE induction in IZE culture on auxin medium, namely the highly embryonic Col-0 accession and the tanmei mutant unable to form somatic embryos. Our study revealed 729 TFs whose expression changes during the 10-day incubation period of SE; 141 TFs displayed distinct differences in expression patterns in embryogenic versus non-embryogenic cultures. This study provides comprehensive data focused on the expression of TF genes during SE and provides guidelines for further research on functional genomics of SE.

DESIGN
The experiment was designed to monitor the expression of 1,880 TF genes at three distinctive stages of IZE-derived embryogenic culture, which refer to: (i) freshly isolated explants competent to undergo embryogenic transition (0 d), (ii) explant tissue subjected to SE induction (5 d), and (iii) the advanced phase of embryogenesis related to somatic embryo formation (10 d).
