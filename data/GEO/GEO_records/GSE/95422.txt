TITLE
Potential biomarker genes for acute and gradual temperature stress in maraena whitefish Coregonus lavaretus

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
Stress represents a major factor negatively affecting fish welfare in aquaculture. The objective of the present study was to identify and evaluate informative indicators for the welfare of maraena whitefish (Coregonus maraena) exposed to inconvenient temperatures. The present study compares the physiological impact of either acute or gradual temperature rise from 18 °C to 24 °C on maraena whitefish in aquaculture. We analysed microarray-based transcriptome profiles in liver, spleen and kidney and identified a common set of diagnostic biomarkers each indicating thermal stress induced by acute or gradual temperature rise in the selected tissues. We identified common and unique tissue- and stress mode-specific pathways reflecting metabolic, cell signalling and immunologic crossroads to cope with thermal stress.
