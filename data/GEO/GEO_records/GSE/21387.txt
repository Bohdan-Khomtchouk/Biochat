TITLE
Array CGH between GK and Wistar Rats for Detecting Copy Number Variations

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The Goto-Kakizak (GK) rat, a nonobese animal model of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), were developed by repeated inbreeding of glucose-intolerent individuals selected from Wistar rats. During their development, GK rats suffer from reduced beta-cell mass and insulin resistance spontaneously (T2D phenotype), which are supposed to be caused by loci holding different genotypes between GK and Wistar rats. This array CGH experiment can detect loci which show different copy numbers (genotype) between GK and Wistar rats. These loci serve as a valuable repository for mining candidates contributing to the pathogenesis of T2D.

DESIGN
The genomic DNA taken from 3 male GK rats as 3 test samples while pooled genomic DNA from 8 male Wistar rats as the common referrence. For each of the hybridization, a dye-swap was designed as well.
