TITLE
Gene expression profile associated with p53R2 in human cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Deregulation of the expression of p53R2, a p53-inducible homologue of the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, has been found in various human cancer tissues; however, the roles p53R2 plays in cancer progression and malignancy remain controversial. In present design, we aimed to identify changes in gene expression profiles associated with p53R2 in cancer cells. We compared gene expression file of control KB cells with that of p53R2-attenuated KB cells by its specific siRNA by using cDNA microarray technology. We used microarrays to display the global gene expression profile change, after knockdown of p53R2 expression in human oropharyngeal carcinoma KB cells, to find the gene set regulated by p53R2.

DESIGN
To compare changes in gene expression profile in human oropharyngea carcinoma KB cells, KB cells were transfected with control siRNA or p53R2 siRNA, 48h later, total RNA and protein were subjected to Q-PCR and Western blot to confirm a significantly decreased p53R2 mRNA and protein, and then these total RNA samples were for microarray analysis. The cDNA microarray data was analyzed to explore gene sets/pathways, which were significantly impacted by knockdown of p53R2.
