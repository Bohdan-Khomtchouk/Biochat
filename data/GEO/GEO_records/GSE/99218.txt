TITLE
Mouse lens gene expression profile based on cDNA microarray analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine the relative gene expression profile in the lens tissue, total RNA extracted from the neonatal (P7) and adult (P60) mouse lenses were subjected to cDNA microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array. The expressed genes were annotated and organized them from their relative high to low expression. The genetic background of mouse strain used was C57/BL6.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from the pooled mouse lenses and their respective quality and quantity was evaluated with standards techniques. About 500 ng of total RNA at a concentration of approximately 50 ng/ml was used for the hybridization
