TITLE
Global Regulation of Alternative RNA Splicing by the SR-Rich Protein RBM39

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RBM39 is extensively involved in alternative splicing of RNA and helps regulate transcript levels. RBM39 may modulate alternative splicing similarly to U2AF65 by either directly binding to RNA or recruiting other splicing factors, such as U2AF65.

DESIGN
RNA extracted from wild-type and RBM39-deficient human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells was subjected to RNA-Seq, and alternative splicing events in the two cell types were analyzed and compared.
