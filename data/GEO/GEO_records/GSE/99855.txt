TITLE
Study of gene expression of peripheral blood T cells in 25 healthy male donors of different age from 25 to 97 years

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study we analyse a gene expression dataset, obtained by microarray hybridization, consisting of T lymphocytes from 25 healthy male volunteers with ages ranging over whole adult lifespan (25 to 97 years). Large groups of genes exhibiting non-monotonic expression patterns over time were observed, highlighting similarities in gene expression profiles of young and ‘‘successfully aged’’ individuals.

DESIGN
Twenty-five male subjects were selected for study participation, equally divided into five age-classes: A (25–35 years old), B (40–50 years old), C (55–65 years old), D (70–80 years old) and E ( > 90 years old).
