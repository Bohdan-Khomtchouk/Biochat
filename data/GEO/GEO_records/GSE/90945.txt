TITLE
Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the wild type and the Nsd1 deletion mutant of Fusarium fujikuroi under 3 different culture conditions

ORGANISM
Fusarium fujikuroi

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide transcriptome analyses of the Fusarium fujikuroi wild type compared to the âˆ†nsd1 mutant Nsd1 is a GATA type transcription factor which has a major impact on growth, conidiation and secondary metabolism in F. fujikuroi

DESIGN
The 2 strains were grown, each with 2 biological replicates, under 3 different conditions: synthetic medium with 1) 6 mM glutamine; 2) 60 mM glutamine; and 3) 6 mM NaNO3

PLATFORM
GPL16547 NimbleGen Fusarium fujikuroi annotation version 1 gene expression array [110407_UG_Ffujikuroi_expr]
