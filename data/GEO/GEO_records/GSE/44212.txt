TITLE
Gene expression in Bacillus subtilis treated with human PGRP, gentamicin, and CCCP

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Human Peptidoglycan Recognition Proteins (PGRPs) kill bacteria, likely by over-activating stress responses in bacteria. To gain insight into the mechanism of PGRP killing of Bacillus subtilis and bacterial defense against PGRP killing, gene expression in B. subtilis treated with a control protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA), human recombinant PGRP (PGLYRP4), gentamicin (aminoglycoside antibiotic), and CCCP (membrane potential decoupler) were compared. Each treatment induced unique and somewhat overlapping pattern of gene expression. PGRP highly increased expression of genes for oxidative and disulfide stress, detoxification and efflux of Cu, As, and Zn, several transporters, repair of damaged proteins and DNA, energy generation, histidine and cysteine synthesis, envelope lysis and remodeling, and other stress responses. PGRP also caused marked decrease in the expression of genes for phosphate uptake and utilization, Fe uptake, and motility. Gene expression microarray in B. subtilis exposed to a human bactericidal innate immunity protein, PGRP, showed induction of oxidative stress response and defense genes, with different expression pattern than B. subtilis exposed to an aminoglycoside antibiotic and a membrane potential decoupler.

DESIGN
B. subtilis was treated with PGRP (human recombinant PGLYRP4), gentamicin, or CCCP (carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone). RNA was obtained from each culture and assayed for gene expression using custom whole genome Affymetrix 900513 GeneChip B. subtilis Genome Array. Each experiment was repeated 3 times.
