TITLE
Gene expression changes in Drosophila head induced by pentylenetetrazole and levetiracetam combination treatment

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have recently developed a Drosophila behavioral- and transcriptomic- based (systems) model of chronic pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced locomotor plasticity. Pharmacological validation using antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) sodium valproate and levetiracetam (LEV) at behavioral level showed a weaker prophylactic and stronger symptomatic effect of sodium valproate and the opposite, i.e., stronger prophylactic and weaker symptomatic, effect in the model. Microarray gene expression profiling of fly head after sodium valproate and LEV treatment of flies further supported the above therapeutic effect of the two AEDs in the PTZ fly model. Given the strong prophylactic effect of LEV in our model, we hypothesized that time series of transcriptomic alterations caused by PTZ at 12 hrs, 2nd day and 7th day (an earlier GEO submission) may be neutralized by LEV. The present submission relates to microarray expression profiles at 12 hrs, 2nd day and 7th day of a drug regime in which flies were treated with both PTZ and LEV for four days followed by three days of treatment with PTZ alone. Results are consistent with our above hypothesis. Keywords: Drug combination response
