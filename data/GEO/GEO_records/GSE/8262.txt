TITLE
Gene Expression Profile in Developing Mouse Brain Following Chronic Hypoxia Treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we determined the effect of chronic consistent hypoxia (CCH) and chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) on global gene expression in cortical and hippocampal region of developing mouse brain using long-oligo beadschip arrays. Keywords: Gene expression profile
