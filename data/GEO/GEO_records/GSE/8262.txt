TITLE
Gene Expression Profile in Developing Mouse Brain Following Chronic Hypoxia Treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we determined the effect of chronic consistent hypoxia (CCH) and chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) on global gene expression in cortical and hippocampal region of developing mouse brain using long-oligo beadschip arrays. Keywords: Gene expression profile

DESIGN
Control-Cortex: Cortical samples from 16 days old mice were analysed on whole-genome expression chips to reveal expression profile at this developmental stage.  Used as control for Chronic Hypoxia Treated cortical samples. CCH-Cortex: Cortical samples from 2-week CCH treated mice were analysed on whole-genome expression chips to reveal the changes in gene expression profile following 2-week CCH treatment. CIH-Cortex: Cortical samples from 2-week CCH treated mice were analysed on whole-genome expression chips to reveal the changes in gene expression profile following 2-week CIH treatment. Control-Hippocampus: Hippocampal samples from 16 days old mice were analysed on whole-genome expression chips to reveal expression profile at this developmental stage.  Used as control for Chronic Hypoxia Treated hippocampal samples. CCH-Hippocampus: Hippocampal samples from 2-week CCH treated mice were analysed on whole-genome expression chips to reveal the changes in gene expression following 2-week CCH treatment. CIH-Hippocampus: Hippocampal samples from 2-week CCH treated mice were analysed on whole-genome expression chips to reveal the changes in gene expression following 2-week CIH treatment.
