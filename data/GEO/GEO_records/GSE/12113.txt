TITLE
Antitumor Activity and Molecular Effects of the Novel Hsp 90 Inhibitor, IPI-504, in Pancreatic Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumors from pancreatic cancer specimens obtained at surgery were used for efficacy testing and biologic analysis.  These tumors were s.c. explanted in xenograft models for subsequent treatment experiments. This study aimed to assess the antitumor activity of the Hsp90 inhibitor, IPI-504, in pancreatic cancer and to determine the biological effects of the agent. Keywords: Pharmacogenetics

DESIGN
Five tumor samples were profiled in treated and untreated with IPI504.  Untreated samples were profiled in duplicate.  The overall design is to identify differentially expressed genes in IPI504 treated versus untreated.
