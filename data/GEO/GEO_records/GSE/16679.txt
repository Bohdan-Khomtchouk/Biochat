TITLE
Plag1 overexpression cooperates with Evi1 overexpression and Gata1s mutation in leading to M7 leukemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to develop a Plag1 signature and determine how its overexpression contributes to  leukemogenesis. To study this, we transduced an immortalized (but not transformed) cell line (derived from Gata1s mutant fetal liver progenitor through insertional mutagenesis) by Plag1-expressing retrovirus. This turned a non-transformed cell line to a leukemogenic cell line. To study whether Plag1 overexpression led to deregulation of signaling pathways that may contribute to leukemic transformation, we generated microarray gene expression profiles of this cell line transduced with either Plag1 or the empty vector.

DESIGN
We generated gene expression profiles by microarray from stable cell lines transduced with either the empty vector or the Plag1-expressing vector.
