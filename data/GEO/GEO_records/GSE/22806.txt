TITLE
Expression data from Anopheles gambiae females blood fed twice within a gonotrophic cycle

ORGANISM
Plasmodium falciparum

SUMMARY
Anopheline mosquitoes frequently take multiple blood meals in a single gonotrophic cycle. In this study we determined patterns of gene expression in Anopheles gambiae females blood fed twice within the first gonotrophic cycle.
