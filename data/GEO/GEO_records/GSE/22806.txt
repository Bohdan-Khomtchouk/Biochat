TITLE
Expression data from Anopheles gambiae females blood fed twice within a gonotrophic cycle

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Anopheline mosquitoes frequently take multiple blood meals in a single gonotrophic cycle. In this study we determined patterns of gene expression in Anopheles gambiae females blood fed twice within the first gonotrophic cycle.

DESIGN
1 condition, 3 replicates per condition, Affymetrix internal controls
