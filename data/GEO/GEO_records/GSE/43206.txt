TITLE
Expression data of the parental and the induced radio-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray analysis to investigate differential gene expression on the induced radio-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines compared to the parental cell lines.

DESIGN
Induced radio-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines were established in our lab to verify their cellular and genetic characteristics. They were exposed to Cesium-137 gamma-radiation up to a total 80 Gy.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
