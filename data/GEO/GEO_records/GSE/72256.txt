TITLE
Pig-specific skin transcriptional responses after intradermal administration of flagellin

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
The study aimed at defining the skin innate responses after intradermal injection of flagellin. For this purpose, pigs were immunized by intradermal route with flagellin and H1N1 antigen. Skin was then sampled for microarray analyses.

DESIGN
Pigs were immunized with the TLR5 agonist flagellin and the H1N1 antigen by intradermal route. Punch biopsies of skin were sampled post-injection. Total RNA was extracted and microarray experiments were performed as single-color hybridizations on Agilent 4x44K pig  (Sus Scrofa) whole genome catalog arrays (Agilent-014868) according supplier's recommendations.

PLATFORM
