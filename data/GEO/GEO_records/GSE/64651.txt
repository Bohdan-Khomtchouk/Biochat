TITLE
Small RNAs in stress-related rice cultivars

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In this study, we sequenced small RNA content from three different rice cultivars employing Illumina technology. More than 15 million reads were generated using Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform. After pre-processing, distinct small RNA sequences were identified for each rice cultivars.

DESIGN
We collected seedlings of different rice cultivars and total RNA isolated was subjected to Illumina sequencing. The sequenced data was further filtered using NGS QC Toolkit to obtain high-quality reads. The filtered reads were pre-processed using modified perl script provided in the miRTools software. After quality control, the identical reads were collapsed into a unique read and read count for each sequence was recorded. All the filtered unique reads from each sample were mapped on the rice genome to find their location.
