TITLE
Expression data from uterus of SD rat during pre-implantation period.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Contraceptive action of Ormeloxifene(Orm), a non-steroidal anti-implantation agent, is well established, however, the molecular targets and pathways regulated by Orm are still not known . The present study was aimed at identifying the genes and pathways modulated by the Orm treatment in rats during uterine receptivity We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying molecular targets and pathways identified under the influence of Ormeloxifene .

DESIGN
SD rat uterus of day 5 pregnancy were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. In one group rats were fed with Ormeloxifene (contraceptive dose) on day 1 of pregnancy and rats of second group were given vehicle alone,i.e. Orm treated (T) and control (C).
