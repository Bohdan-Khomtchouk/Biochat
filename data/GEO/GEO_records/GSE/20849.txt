TITLE
Steady State Thermal Acclimation in the Eurythermal Goby fish, Gillichthys mirabilis

ORGANISM
Gillichthys mirabilis

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify transcriptional resonses to thermal acclimation in a highly eurythermal fish. Specifically, what are the  genes necessary to maintain homostasis at different temperatures and do these genes underlie any known acclimatory responses? Gillichthys mirabilis (goby fish) were acclimated to 3 temperatures (9C, 19C and 28C) for one month.  Gill tissue from 7-9 individuals were dissected and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed into cDNA, labeled with cy5 and hybridized against a common reference (cy3) on 2-color cDNA microarray developed for this species. Significant genes were determined by expression differences between groups (one-way ANOVA, FDR < 0.05) .
