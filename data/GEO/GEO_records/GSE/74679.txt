TITLE
Analysis of transcriptome changes in Kmt2d deletion in cardiac mesoderm, anterior heart field precursors and cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
KMT2D is required in the cardiac mesoderm, anterior heart field precursors and cardiomyocytes. Kmt2d deletion in cardiac mesoderm (Mesp1Cre) is embryonic lethal at E10.5 and mutants have hypoplastic hearts; Kmt2d deletion in anterior heart field precursors (Mef2cAHF::Cre) deletion is embryonic lethal at E13.5 and mutants have defects in septation of outflow tract and interventricular septum (IVS); Kmt2d deletion in cardiomyocytes (Tnnt2::Cre) deletion is embryonic lethal at E14.5 and mutants have defects in IVS septation and compact myocardium. The goal of this study is to compare changes in gene expression in these Kmt2d conditional deletion mutants and understand common or distinct pathways dysregulated in absence of KMT2D.

DESIGN
Whole genome gene expression analysis was performed on RNA isolated from control and mutant embryonic hearts (or right ventricles and outflow tract for anterior heart field deletion samples). Libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq Paired-End Cluster Kit v3, and sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 2500 system for pair-ended 100 base pairs (PE 100 bp).
