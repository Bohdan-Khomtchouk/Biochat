TITLE
Gene expression profiles of granulin- and control-treated normal human mammary fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To examine the effects of recombinant granulin on human mammary stromal fibroblasts, we cultured normal human mammary fibroblasts in the presence of recombinant human granulin (1ug/ml) or PBS every 24h for 6 days.

DESIGN
We cultured normal human mammary fibroblasts in the presence human granulin (1ug/ml) or PBS control every 24h for 6 days.  The analysis showen are for 3 control (control) and 3 granulin-treated (PGRN) fibrobast cultures.
