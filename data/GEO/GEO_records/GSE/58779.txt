TITLE
Characterization of small RNAs and their targets in soybean (Glycine max)

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Small RNAs, including microRNAs and their targets, as well as phased secondary siRNAs, were characterized in the soybean genome by deep sequencing of small RNA libraries from a wide range of tissues. The mRNA targets of many of these small RNAs were also validated from many of the same tissues using PARE (Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends) libraries.

DESIGN
Small RNA profiling was done by Illumina TruSeq sample preparation followed by high-throughput sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute.Â PARE analysis used library construction approaches described in the journal Methods (PubMed ID: 23810899).
