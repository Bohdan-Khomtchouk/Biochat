TITLE
Osteoprotection through the deletion of the transcription factor Rorβ in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To identify gene expression changes (using RNAsequencing) in MC3T3-E1 cells where Rorβ has been deleted using CRISPR/Cas9 (and a control cell line) Method: MC3T3-Control and MC3T3-Rorβ-CRISPR(KO) cells were osteoblast differentiated for 2 days, and RNA was harvested (n=3 for each cell line) Results: We identified genes and pathways (using IPA) that were significantly altered in the Rorβ-CRISPR(KO) cell line, compared with the Control cell line Conclusions: Many pathways were changed, namely the Wnt pathway which is important to the biology of Rorβ and to osteoblast differentiation in general

DESIGN
Control and Rorβ-CRISPR(KO) cells (n=3) were osteoblast differentiated for 2 days and RNA was harvested and submitted for high-throughput RNA sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
