TITLE
Centromere misdivision promotes centromeric sequence changes, de novo centromere formation, and centromere expansion

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Centromeres typically contain repeat sequences, but centromere function does not necessarily depend on these sequences. In aneuploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) and wheat distant hybridization offspring, we found functional centromeres with dramatic changes to centromeric retrotransposon of wheat (CRW) sequences. CRW sequences were greatly reduced in the ditelosomic lines 1BS, 5DS, 5DL, and a wheat-Thinopyrum elongatum addition line. CRWs were completely lost in the ditelosomic line 4DS, but a 994 kb ectopic genomic DNA sequence was involved in de novo centromere formation on the 4DS chromosome. In addition, two ectopic sequences were incorporated in a de novo centromere in a wheat-Th. intermedium addition line. Centromeric sequences were also expanded to the chromosome arm in wide hybridizations. Stable alien chromosomes with two and three regions containing centromeric sequences were found in wheat-Th. elongatum hybrid derivatives, but only one is functional. In wheat-rye (Secale cereale) hybrids, rye centromere specific sequences spread to the chromosome arm and may cause centromere expansion. Thus, distant wheat hybridizations cause frequent and significant changes to the centromere via centromere misdivision, which may affect retention or loss of alien chromosomes in hybrids.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was carried out with anti-CENH3 antibody using material 4DS and control (Chinese Spring, CS as short).
