TITLE
Transcription profile of primordium gut organs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are a novel stem cell population induced from mouse and human adult somatic cells through reprogramming by transduction of defined transcription factors. Recently, researchers success in generation various cells from iPSCs. Lung progenitor cells are able to differentiate to all of the cells exist in adult lung, attract attention for regenerative medicine. It is known to present between embryonic day 9.5 from 13.5 in mice. We can realized at regenerative medicine in lung using lung progenitor cell surface markers defined by compering each endoderm primordia of organ formation. We investigated the differences in gene expression of each endoderm organ.

DESIGN
Mouse gut organs morphogenesis begin at E9.5-E11.5. The primordium lung, esophagus, stomach, and intestine at E11.5 were dissected and analysed transcription profile.
