TITLE
Expression data of siFAM210B and control A549 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our previous study screened a novel cancer progression suppressor gene, FAM210B, which encodes an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, by the suppression of mortality by antisense rescue technique (SMART). We demonstrated that FAM210B loss was significantly associated with cancer metastasis and decreased survival in a clinical setting. We used microarrays to find diffrenet gene expression between siFAM210B and control A549 cells

DESIGN
A549 cells were transfected with siRNA for 72h  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays, and Realtime PCR were used to verified the effect of siRNA knockdown. We used  mixed siRNA, tirplicated per sample and designed the control to increase the resolution of expression profiles.
