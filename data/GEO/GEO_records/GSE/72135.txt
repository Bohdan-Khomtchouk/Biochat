SUMMARY
Calcium oxalate stones account for over 80% of urinary stones, while the molecular mechanism of its formation is still not completely elucidated. The incidence of hyperoxaluria in calcium oxalate stone formation ranks only second to hypercalciuria. It plays an important role in the pathophysiological process of stone formation. We analyzed miRNA expression profiles between experimental hyperoxaluric rats and normal rats in order to find out the target genes and signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of hyperoxaluria.
