TITLE
Expression data from hyperoxaluric rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Calcium oxalate stones account for over 80% of urinary stones, while the molecular mechanism of its formation is still not completely elucidated. The incidence of hyperoxaluria in calcium oxalate stone formation ranks only second to hypercalciuria. It plays an important role in the pathophysiological process of stone formation. We analyzed miRNA expression profiles between experimental hyperoxaluric rats and normal rats in order to find out the target genes and signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of hyperoxaluria.

DESIGN
We feed ethylene glycol (EG) and ammonium chloride (AC) to male experimental hyperoxaluric rats (T group) and age-matched male rats selected as control group (C group). The oxalate concentration in 24-hour urine of each experimental rat was measured and the three highest were selected for microarray test. MicroRNA microarray was applied to evaluate the expression difference between the two groups and screen miRNA that were above 2- or below 0.5-fold change.
