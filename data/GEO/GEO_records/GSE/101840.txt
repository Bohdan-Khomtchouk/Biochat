TITLE
DNAm profiling of healthy cord whole blood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNAm profiles of control cord whole blood was obtained for 6 samples using the Illumina 450K platform.

DESIGN
Cord blood was initially collected from neonates delivered by elective cesarean section in the absence of labor at the Children’s & Women’s Health Centre of BC (Vancouver, Canada). Cells from these samples were separated by FACS and used for characterizing the effect of nucleated red blood cells on genomic assays (PMCID: PMC4567832, GEO: GSE68456). These are healthy cord whole blood samples that have been used as controls/references for independent projects, as well as methods for identifying maternal contamination of cord blood.
