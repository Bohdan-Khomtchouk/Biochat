TITLE
Gene expression profiling of rudhira null embryo and yolk sac at 9.5 dpc

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Rudhira is essential for mouse developmental angiogenesis and tissue morphogenesis. Embryos lacking endothelial rudhira die at mid-gestation with vascular patterning defects. Rudhira mutant yolk sac endothelial cells show slow and random migration. So to identify key signaling pathways perturbed in the absence of rudhira, we undertook whole transcriptome based analysis of gene expression in rudhira null yolk sac and embryo. Transcriptome analysis shows that key mediators of angiogenesis, cell adhesion, migration and extracellular matrix degradation as well as several components of the TGFÎ² pathway are perturbed in rudhira null mutant yolk sacs at 9.5 dpc.

DESIGN
We used two embryo samples ( 2E- wild type; 5E- rudhira mutant). Repetition was done on each sample. We used 4 yolk sac samples (3Y,4Y- wild type; 7Y,8Y-rudhira mutant) for the analysis. Repetition was done on each sample.
