TITLE
YAP/TAZ control peripheral myelination by regulating Schwann cell proliferation and the expression of laminin receptors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myelination is essential for nervous system function. Schwann cells interact with neurons and with the basal lamina to sort and myelinate axons, using known receptors and signaling pathways. In contrast, the transcriptional control of axonal sorting and the role of mechano-transduction in myelination are largely unknown. Yap and Taz are effectors of the Hippo pathway that integrate chemical and mechanical signals in cells. Here, we describe a previously unknown role for the Hippo pathway in myelination. Using conditional mutagenesis in mice we show that Taz is required in Schwann cells for radial sorting and myelination. Yap is redundant with Taz as ablation of both Yap and Taz abolishes radial sorting. Yap/Taz regulate Schwann cell proliferation and transcription of basal lamina receptors, both necessary for proper radial sorting of axons, and subsequent myelination. These data link transcriptional effectors of the Hippo pathway and of mechanotransduction  to myelin formation in Schwann cells.
