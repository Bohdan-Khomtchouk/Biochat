TITLE
Expression data from the inducible expression of EWS-FLI1 (EF) in embryoid bodies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oncogenic transformation in Ewing sarcoma tumors is driven by the fusion oncogene EWS-FLI1. The inducible expression of EWS-FLI1 (EF) in embryoid bodies, or collections of differentiating stem cells, generates cells with properties of Ewing sarcoma tumors, including characteristics of transformation.  These cell lines exhibit anchorage-independent growth, a lack of contact inhibition and a strong Ewing sarcoma gene expression signature. These cells also demonstrate a requirement for the persistent expression of EWS-FLI1 for cell survival and growth.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the effects of doxycycline-inducible expression of EWS-FLI1 on the gene expression signature of cells derived from differentiating stem cells, or embryoid bodies. Triplicate biological replicates were collected and analyzed.
