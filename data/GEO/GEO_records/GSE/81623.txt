TITLE
EZH2 and BCL6 cooperate to assemble CBX8-BCOR Polycomb complex to repress bivalent promoters, mediate germinal center formation and promote lymphomagenesis [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The EZH2 histone methyltransferase mediates the humoral immune response and drives lymphomagenesis through de novo formation of bivalent chromatin domains at critical germinal center (GC) B cell promoters. Herein we show that the actions EZH2 in driving GC formation and lymphoma precursor lesions are dependent on the presence of the BCL6 transcriptional repressor, both of which are in turn dependent on the presence of non-canonical PRC1-BCOR complex. BCL6-BCOR complexes assemble preferentially at bivalent promoters in an H3K27me3-dependent manner. We observe specific induction of the CBX8 chromodomain protein in GC B cells. CBX8 binds to H3K27me3 at bivalent promoters and is required for stable association of BCOR complex and its histone modifications. CBX8 loss of function in B cells phenocopies loss of EZH2 and H3K27me3. Moreover, oncogenic BCL6 and EZH2 cooperate to accelerate diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) development and combinatorial targeting of these repressors results in enhanced anti-lymphoma activity in vitro, in vivo and in primary human DLBCLs.
