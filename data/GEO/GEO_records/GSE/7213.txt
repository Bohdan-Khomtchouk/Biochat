TITLE
Comparative analysis of cellular mRNA incorporation into MLV and HIV1 virus-like particles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesize that cellular mRNAs are incorporated nonselectively into retrovirus particles Keywords: comparative expression profiling

DESIGN
This study utilizes microarray analysis to test these hypotheses. Transfected cells were grown, RNA was isolated and used for global gene expression profiling (Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 array). Statistically significant gene expression was determined as a minimum 6 counts of 9 pairwise comparisons, minimum 1.5-fold change, and p < 0.05. Further, Absolute | FC - FC SEM | > = 1.5.
