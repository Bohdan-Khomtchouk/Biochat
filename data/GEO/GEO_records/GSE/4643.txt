TITLE
Comparison of upland li mutant with normal fibers

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
The G. hirsutum mutant li1 is caused by a dominant mutation which has pleiotropic effects on plant development. To get information for molecular effects by li1 mutation on cotton fiber development, we examined expression patterns of over 5000 genes by cDNA array from 6 to 18 DPA in a 3-day interval between li1 mutant and normal fibers. Keywords: Mutant and normal fiber comparison
