TITLE
Selective Degradation of Splicing Factor CAPER-alpha by Anticancer Sulfonamides

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Target protein degradation is an emerging field in drug discovery and development. In particular, the substrate receptor proteins of the cullin ubiquitin ligase system play a key role in selective protein degradation, which is an essential component of the anti-myeloma activity of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) represented by lenalidomide. Here, we demonstrate that a series of anticancer sulfonamides NSC 719239 (E7820), indisulam, and NSC 339004 (chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide, CQS) induce proteasomal degradation of the U2AF-related splicing factor CAPER-alpha via DCAF15-DDB1-CUL4 CRL4-DCAF15 mediated ubiquitination in human  cancer cell lines. Both CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout of DCAF15 and a single amino acid substitution of CAPER-alpha conferred resistance against sulfonamide-induced CAPER-alpha degradation and cell-growth inhibition. Thus, the these sulfonamides represent selective chemical probes for disrupting CAPER-alpha function and designate DCAFs as promising drug targets for promoting selective protein degradation in cancer therapy.

DESIGN
Comparison of the siRNA-based genetic perturbation of CAPER/RBM39 (non-target siRNA vs. siRBM39, 20 nM, 48 hours, n = 3) and the E7820-based chemical perturbation of the protein (DMSO vs. E7820, 1 microM, 24 h, n = 3).
