TITLE
mRNA-Seq of brain tissue from honeybee (Apis mellifera) drones (male), workers (female) and queens (female).

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera carnica

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of brain tissue of was performed by RNA-SEQ in workers, queens and males. The sex and caste specific expressed and spliced genes were examined comparing drone, worker and queen honeybees.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA profiles in heads of male, worker and queen honeybees pupae were compared.
