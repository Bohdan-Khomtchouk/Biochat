TITLE
The tumor heterogeneity of high grade serous ovarian cancer identified by stem cloning technique (Illumina SNP array)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Little is known about a relationship between intratumor heterogeneity and drug resistant ability in high grade serous ovarian cancer. Using stem cell cloning technique on high grade ovarian cancer, we have cloned ovarian cancer colonies at high efficiency. The heterogeneity of ovarian cancer is recapitulated in cloned cancer colony library, and Taxol treatment (100 nM 3 hrs) has been conducted on cancer library and obtained drug resistant cancer clones in vitro. Using cloned original cancer colonies and drug resistant cancer colonies, we have studied the effect of intratumor heterogeneity on acquisition of drug resistance.

DESIGN
We have used surgery samples of high grade serous ovarian cancer and cultured cancer cell colony on 3T3 feeder layer. We used Illumina OmniExpress SNP array to genotype samples from normal fimbria (fimbria clones), cancer clones (N clones), passaging cancer clones (NP clones) and drug resistant cancer clones (TR clones). Fimbria, N and NP clones were cloned from original pooled culture of normal fimbria and ovarian cancer cells. TR clones were cloned from Taxol-treated (four times) ovarian cancer cells. All clones are from two patients and those from patient 2 are called CP30-N clones.
