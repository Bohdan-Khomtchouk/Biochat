TITLE
The evolution of β-thalassemia major from minor is associated with paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 11p15

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
β-thalassemia major can be caused by homozygous mutations of the HBB gene, most of the cases are inherited from parents who both have β-thalassemia minor. Herein, we show that a mosaic paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 11p14.3-15.5 is associated with β-thalassemia major in a patient with β-thalassemia minor-that evolved to β-thalassemia major. From this case, we suggest that analysis of HBB gene for non-hematopoietic tissues should be performed in late-onset β-thalassemia major patients. Keywords: genomic

DESIGN
This study is to evaluate the cause of delay-onset β-thalassemia major in our patient. Patients peripheral blood, hair follicle, and oral mucosa, and her parents pripheral blood samples were analyzed.
