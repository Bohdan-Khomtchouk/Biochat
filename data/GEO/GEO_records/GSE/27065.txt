TITLE
Differential gene expression from microarray analysis distinguishes woven and lamellar bone formation in the rat ulna following mechanical loading

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The objective of our study was to use a microarray to distinguish the molecular responses between woven and lamellar bone formation induced through mechanical loading.    The micorarray identified numerous genes and pathways that were differentially regulated for woven, but not lamellar bone formation.

DESIGN
Rat forelimb loading was completed in a single bout to induce the formation of woven bone (WBF loading) or lamellar bone (LBF loading).  A set of normal (non-loaded) rats were used as controls.  Microarrays were performed at three timepoints after loading: 1 hr, 1 day and 3 days.
