TITLE
AKHR F1 heterozygous progeny of obese parents and controls, 10-11 days old adults

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transgenerational effects of parental metabolic state have been shown, but the mechanism is still unclear. Here we present transcriptome sequencing data from AKHR heterozygous F1 progeny, either from obese maternal or paternal parents, compared to genetically matched heterozygous controls or to wild-type controls

DESIGN
3 AKHR heterozygous samples descended from obese maternal parents, 3 AKHR heterozygous samples descended from obese paternal parents, 3 AKHR heterozygous samples descended from non-obese parents, and 3 wild-type controls, independent biological replicates and independent experimental replicates (1 set of samples from each experimental replicate)

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
