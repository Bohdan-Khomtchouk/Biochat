TITLE
Feasibility and Interpretation of the Genome-wide Infinium Methylation Data Derived from Ligated Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded Paired Tumor and Normal Tissue.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples are a highly desirable resource for epigenetic studies, but there is no suitable platform to assay genome-wide methylation in these widely available resources. Recently, Thirwell et al. (2010) have reported a modified ligation-based DNA repair protocol to prepare FFPE DNA for the Infinium methylation assay. In this study, we have tested the accuracy of methylation data obtained with this modification by comparing paired fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE colon tissue from colorectal cancer patients. We report locus-specific correlation and concordance of tumor-specific differentially-methylated loci (DML), both of which were not previously assessed.

DESIGN
We used Illumina’s Infinium Methylation 27 K chip for 12 pairs of FF and 12 pairs of FFPE tissue from tumor and surrounding healthy tissue from the resected colon of the same individual after repairing the FFPE DNA using Thirwell’s modified protocol.

PLATFORM
GPL8490 Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (HumanMethylation27_270596_v.1.2)
