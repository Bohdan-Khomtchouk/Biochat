TITLE
Nucleosome mapping in 20 kb upstream regions of microRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We mapped the nucleosome locations in upstream regions of all known microRNAs in 3 cell lines using the method described in Nature Biotechnology 2007 Feb;25(2):244-8. Keywords: Nucleosome Mapping Study

DESIGN
20 kb upstream regions of microRNAs were tiled at 10 bp spacing using mostly 50-mer probes.  Duplicate experiments were performed in MCF7, MALME, and UACC62 cell lines.
