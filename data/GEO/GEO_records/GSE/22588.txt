TITLE
Regulatory Divergence in Drosophila revealed by mRNA-seq (trans-splicing)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila sechellia ; Drosophila melanogaster x Drosophila sechellia

SUMMARY
Deep Sequencing of mRNA from Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila Sechellia, and their F1 hybrid. These data were generated in a study to analyze the extent and specificity of trans-splicing in Drosophila. mRNA-seq libraies were prepared from poly(A)+ RNA prepared from whole F1 hybrids of D. melanogaster and D. sechellia (female 0-3d post eclosion). Separate control libraries were prepared from D. melanogaster and D. sechellia total RNA (mixed before library preparation). The results of this study identified 80 novel trans-splicing events between homologous alleles of the same gene. Keywords: RNA-Seq Keywords: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing

DESIGN
There were 2 total samples in this study.  Paired-end mRNA-seq was used to survey trans-splicing in F1 hybrids of D. melanogaster and D. sechellia.  A mixed " control " library was used to assess the frequency of false-positive trans-splicing signal resulting from errors in reference genomes, high-throughput sequencing, and RT-PCR amplification based strand-switching.
