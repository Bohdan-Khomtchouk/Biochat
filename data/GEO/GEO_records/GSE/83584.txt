TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of self-renewing hESCs and multipotent mesoderm progenitor cells as a function of substrate stiffness

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-sequencing on human embryonic stem cell samples grown on soft (400Pa) and stiff (60kPa) hydrogels under self-renewal and differentiation conditions

DESIGN
Whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing in the conditions described

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
