TITLE
p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signals the Immunoresolving Actions of Resolvin D1 in Inflamed Human Visceral Adipose Tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activation of the innate immune system leading to a persistent state of low-grade of tissue inflammation greatly influences the risk of developing metabolic complications associated with obesity. In this study, we characterized the inflammatory state in adipose tissue from obese patients and explored the potential of the specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) resolvin D1 (RvD1) to actively terminate inflammation and promote its resolution. By means of high-troughput transcritomic analysis we identified a  cytokine-related molecular signature in obese omental adipose tissue, characterized by a remarkable overexpression of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1Î² and IL-10 associated with a concomitant increase in macrophage infiltration, which gradually increased in a body mass index-dependent manner.

DESIGN
RNA profiling was conducted in 4 patients with morbid obesity and 4 control subjects using the Affymetrix Human Genome U219 expression array plate containing more than 36,000 transcripts and variants (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA).
