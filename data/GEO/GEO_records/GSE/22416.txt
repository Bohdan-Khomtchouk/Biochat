TITLE
Expression data from ileum of inducible intestine-specific GATA6 knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
GATA6 is a transcription factor involved in the differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells into differentiated absorptive epithelial cells. GATA6 is expressed in all segments of the small intestine.  We examined the impact of deleting GATA6 from intestinal epithelial cells of the adult ileum

DESIGN
6-8 week old Villin-CreERT2 mice or Villin-CreERT2 mice crossed to GATA6 flox/flox mice were treated with a single injection of tamoxifen. (100 mg/ml) for 5 consecutive days.  28 days later the ileum was dissected and RNA prepared from the whole ileal segment using the RNAeasy method with DNAse treatment.  Three individual mice were examined in each of the control and GATA6 KO groups.
