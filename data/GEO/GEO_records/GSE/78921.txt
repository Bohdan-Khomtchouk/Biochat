TITLE
Whole transcriptome profiles of different brain regions from a Chlorocebus sabaeus model of Parkinson's disease with and without human parthenogenetic stem cell derived neural stem cell transplantation.

ORGANISM
Chlorocebus sabaeus

SUMMARY
RNAseq was performed on caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra samples from animals treated with MPTP to induce a Parkinson's-like condition, and then transplanted with hpNSCs or control buffer. The goal of the study was to determine if there were any difference in gene expression caused by the transplanted cells.

DESIGN
Animals were treated with MPTP to induce a Parkinson's-like condition, and received either hpNSC transplantation or injections of buffer. Biopsies of the caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra from each animal were analyzed by RNAseq.
