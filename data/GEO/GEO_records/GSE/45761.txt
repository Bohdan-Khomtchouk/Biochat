TITLE
miRNA Expression in Early Porcine Pregnancy

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
This study examined the expression of pig-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) at gestation day 20 (gd20) of pregnancy in Yorkshire sows. Tissue differences in miRNA expression, and miRNA differences between healthy and arresting embryo attachment sites (i.e., healthy endometrium vs. arresting endometrium; healthy trophoblast vs. arresting trophoblast), were of prime interest. For more information, please refer to the primary research paper.

DESIGN
Paired endometrium and trophoblast samples were collected at gestation day 20 from two conceptus attachement sites (1 healthy, 1 arresting) per sow (n=3). Endometrial samples were collected from four non-pregnant sows at mid-estrus.
