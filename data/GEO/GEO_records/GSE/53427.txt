TITLE
Kat2a regulates hippocampal memory formation [small RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced small RNAs from 12 samples extracted from mouse CA1 tissue to generate the first CA1-specific murine miRNome under normal and Kat2a-loss-of-function conditions.

DESIGN
Samples were divded in 4 groups: A: Control (n=6), C: Kat2a cKO na√Øve (n=6)
