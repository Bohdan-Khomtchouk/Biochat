TITLE
NR2E3 gene networks are associated with AHR signaling pathways

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify NR2E3-specific gene expression pattern in liver cancer cell line, small hairpin RNA for NR2E3 was transfected in HepG2 human liver cancer cells.

DESIGN
Two groups of samples are included: 1. sh control (shCT_1, shCT_2); 2. shNR2E3 (shNR2E3 KO_1 , shNR2E3 KO_2). Gene expression profiles of NR2E3 depleted cells were compared to that of shRNA controls. Experiments were performed in HepG2 cells.
