TITLE
Adaptation During Ovarian Cancer Metastasis Reveals a Predictive Gene Signature

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We characterized the genetic copy number and expression differences between matched ovarian primary tumors and omental metastases. Differentially expressed genes revealed that metastases proliferate more and are less apoptotic. Differentially expressed genes revealed a predictive expression signature when applied to other gene expression datasets.

DESIGN
18 samples from 9 matched pairs of primary ovarian tumors and metastases from the omentum were collected.
