TITLE
Charaterization of the initial molecular events of adipose tissue development and growth during overfeeding in humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The adaptive mechanisms in response to excess energy supply are still poorly known in humans. Our aims were to define metabolic responses and changes in gene expression in adipose tissue of healthy volunteers during fat overfeeding.

DESIGN
Healthy lean and overweight subjects were submitted to a high fat diet during 56 days. Adipose tissue biopsies were taken at Day 0, Day 14 and Day 56.
