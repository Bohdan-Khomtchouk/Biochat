TITLE
Genome-wide DNA damage response following ionizing radiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139 (gH2AX) is an early key event of the DNA damage response (DDR) following DNA double strand breaks (DSB) induction. Although gH2AX distribution has been extensively used as a damage marker, genome-wide investigation of the subsequent DNA repair has been poorly addressed. Here we present ChIP-Seq-based distributions of Histone H3, H2AX and gH2AX under physiological conditions in HeLa cells. Additionally the same histones were studied after a single exposure to 10 Gy X-ray at 0.5, 3 and 24 hours post irradiation

DESIGN
In HeLa cells ChIP-seq data for histone H3, H2AX and gammaH2AX were analysed in unirradiated cells as well as after 0.5, 3 and 24 h. Input samples were included and one technical (Sequencing)  and one biological (irradiation, library prep and sequencing) replicate was done.
