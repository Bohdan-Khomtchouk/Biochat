TITLE
The Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Human Embryonic Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study provides a framework describing how magnetic exposure is transduced from the most-plausible molecular-level ‘biosensor’ (lipid membranes) to cell-level responses that include differentiation toward neural lineages. In addition, SMF provided a stimulus that uncovered new relationships – that exist even in the absence of magnetic fields – between gangliosides, the time dependent regulation of IL-6 signaling by these glycolipids, and the fate of embryonic cells.

DESIGN
Subconfluent (70%-80%) undifferentiated LVECs (passage 11) were resuspended at 500k cells in 10 ml culture medium (day 0) and cultured in the presence or absence of static magnetic field. Four conditions were investigated: A) Control (without exposure); B) One day exposure (Exposed on day 6 without recovery); C) Continuous exposure (day 2 to day 5) followed by one day recovery; D) Continuous exposure (day 2 to day 6) without recovery. Cells are harvested on day 7. mRNA was isolated from the cells and microarray analysis was done using the Affymetric Human Genome U133 2.0 Plus Chip.
