TITLE
Keratinocyte and fibroblast gene expression in skin and keloid scar tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Keloids are scars that extend beyond original wounds and are resistant to treatment.  In order to improve understanding of the molecular basis of keloid scarring, we have assessed the genomic profiles of keloid fibroblasts and keratinocytes.

DESIGN
Skin and scar tissues were obtained for isolation of primary keratinocytes and fibroblasts.  Keloid scars were excised from patients undergoing scar excision surgery, normal skin samples were isolated from patients undergoing elective plastic surgery.  Primary culters were prepared for keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and were harvested for analysis up to passage three.  Nine keloid scars, for adjacent non-lesional keloid skin samples, and three normal skin samples were obtained and cultured.  RNA was isolated using RNeasy, and quality verified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.  Labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST microarray chips was performed by the Vanderbilt Genome Sciences Resource at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
