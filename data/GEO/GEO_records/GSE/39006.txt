TITLE
Transcriptional response of adipose tissue depots to a high energy feeding regimen in Japanese Black and Holstein steers

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Three Japanese Black (JB) and 3 Holstein (HS) steers were fed a high energy diet and were slaughtered with 26 months of age. Intramuscular (IMF) and subcutaneous fat (SCF) was sampled to reveal differences in the expression profiles between the breeds and adipose depots.

DESIGN
