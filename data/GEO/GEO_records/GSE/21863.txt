TITLE
Transcriptome of the Nxnl2-/- mouse retina

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A nxnl2 knockout mouse model was created and the transcriptome used to demonstrate that the retina is compromised by the absence of nxnl2. For the mouse lacking Nxnl2, the gene encoding RdCVF2, the progressive decline of the visual performance of the cones in parallel with their degeneration arises due to loss of trophic support from RdCVF2 Keywords: genetic modification, transcription-profile, retina

DESIGN
In total 6 samples were analyzed, they represent the genotypes wt/wt and ko/ko that were tested in triplicate each.
