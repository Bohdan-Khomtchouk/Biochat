TITLE
Gene expression data from liver of rat fed a high-fat diet without/with mulberry leaves

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To investigate effects of intake of mulberry leaves on hyperlipidemia, we performed gene expression profiling on rat liver by microarray analysis. Microarray analysis revealed that mulberry leaves up-regulated the genes involved in alpha-, beta-, and omega-oxidation of fatty acids, mainly relating to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway, and down-regulated the gene expression involved in lipogenesis. Furthermore, the genes relating to response to oxidative stress were up-regulated in rats administrated mulberry leaves.

DESIGN
Rats were fed a high-fat diet without/with orally administration of mulberry leaves (0 or 500 mg/kg/day) for 7 weeks. Livers were taken for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
