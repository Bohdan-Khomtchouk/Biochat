TITLE
Histone H2B R102A

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Total RNA from three replicate cultures of wild-type and mutant strains was isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays. Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by histone H2B R102A mutant.
