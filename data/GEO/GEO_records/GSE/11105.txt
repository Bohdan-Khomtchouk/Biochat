TITLE
Expression data from tibialis anterior muscle

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated transgenic mice expressing constitutively SOCS-3 specifically in skeletal muscle. SOCS proteins are implicated in the negative regulation of various pathways including insulin signaling pathway. Our transgenic mice are predisposed to obesity and systemic insulin resistance compared to control mice. We used microarrays to detail the variations of gene expression in muscle from transgenic mice versus controls. Keywords: transgenic, tibialis anterior, SOCS-3

DESIGN
Tibialis anterior is a mixed muscle easy to extract. Our previous investigations showed that this muscle expressed high level of the SOCS-3 transgene.
