TITLE
HI-LNC RNA knockdown in EndoC-betaH1 cell using lentiviral ami-aRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have previously identified hundreds of human islet lncRNAs. Here we functionally characterise 12 such lncRNAs in EndoC-betaH1 cells through loss of function studies. Our results suggest that a number of them display transcriptional phenotypes.

DESIGN
We have used lentiviral based ami-RNAs to knockdown 12 human islet expressed lncRNAs (HI-LNCs) in the beta cell line EndoC-betaH1. EndoC-betaH1cells were transduced with virus for 80 hrs prior to RNA-harvest followed by hybridisation to HTA-2.0 affymetrix microarrays. Each experiment was done in replicates and 5 non targetinf (NT) controls were used.
