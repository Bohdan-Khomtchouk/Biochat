TITLE
Genes altered by L-asparaginase treatment in REH cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes affected by L-asparaginase, we treated with L-asparaginase 1U/ml. After 2 days, RNA was extracted, and then expression analysis was performed using agilent microarray.

DESIGN
Expression microarray with L-asparaginase or non-treated REH cells were performed in duplicate.
