TITLE
Microarray data from aerial tissue of submergence tolerant M202(Sub1) and intolerant M202

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
An ERF transcription factor, Submergence-1A (Sub1A), dramatically enhances the tolerance to prolonged submergence in rice. For instance, rice accessions which lack Sub1A (e.g. M202) die within 7-10 d of complete submergence. By contrast, genotypes which posses Sub1A (e.g. M202(Sub1)) can endure submergence stress for 14 d. In this study, the two near isogenic lines with and without Sub1A were subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix Gene Chip technology. This analysis provided beneficial information to elucidate general response to submergence stress and to estimate Sub1A-dependent defense response to the stress at mRNA accumulation level.

DESIGN
Aerial tissue of 14-d-old plants which were submerged for 24 h were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Non-submerged plants were used as control. Two independent biological replicates were analyzed for each treatment/genotype.
