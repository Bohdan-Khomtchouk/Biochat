TITLE
Control HepG2 vs miR-24 HepG2 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-24 targets were identified in this study using mRNA microarrays. Combined with Bioinformatics, our results show that miR-24 regulates cell cycle and DNA repair.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from C or miR-24 over-expressing HepG2 cells after 48 hr of transfection and microarray analysis was performed
