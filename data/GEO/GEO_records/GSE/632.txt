TITLE
Control and Congestive Heart Failure

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Congestive heart failure was done by artificial myocardial infarction. After extracting total RNA from control and infarcted ventricles with Triazol, messenger RNA was isolated with Qiagen mRNA isolation kit. About 1.5ug poly A+ RNA was taken for probe preparation. Probe was labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 and 657. Labeled probes were hybridized with Qiagen rat unigene oligo library. After 2 low and 1 high stringency washes Prolong Antifade was added to the slides to prevent bleaching effect. The data ratio was normalized using a location and intensity dependent Lowess formula. Keywords: other

PLATFORM
GPL333 Qiagen Rat Oligonucleotide Array
