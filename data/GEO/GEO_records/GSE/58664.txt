TITLE
RNA sequencing of cultured mouse wild-type E10.25 forelimbs in control or cyclopmaine containing media [SOLiD]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We wanted to identify differentially expressed genes in wild-type forelimbs and forelimbs briefly exposed to Shh signaling.  E10.25 forelimbs were cultured in control media and media containing cyclopmaine (inhibits the Hedgehog pathway)

DESIGN
Generated two wild-type (control) and two cyclopmaine biological replicates for RNA-seq UT-Genome and Analysis Facility

PLATFORM
GPL9318 AB SOLiD System 3.0 (Mus musculus)
