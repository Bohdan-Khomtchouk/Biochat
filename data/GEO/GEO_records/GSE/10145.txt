TITLE
Azacytidine time course on MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF7 cells at 80% confluency were treated with 5 micromolar azacytidine with gene expression profiling determined at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 hours of exposure to compound. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Approximately 5,000,000 million cells were plated into 10 cm plates from a common pool. Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum until 80% confluency was attained. Cells were then exposed to 5 micromolar azacytidine prepared as a 10 millimolar stock in DMSO. Each time point was represented by three biological replicates. Total RNA was extracted from the cells using the trizol method and RNA samples were validated for integrity throughout the isolation and extraction procedure. All gene expression profiles showed similar distributions with similar raw median intensities.
