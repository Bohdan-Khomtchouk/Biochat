TITLE
In situ synthesis of peptide microarrays - shadow mask design [1]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A computer program was used to create random amino acid sequences based on and restricted by physical shadow masks which will be used for lithography-based synthesis of peptides.  The output from this algorithm was used to create peptides that were synthesized by Sigma Aldrich, and printed onto glass slides.  The arrays contained 384 peptides printed in duplicate for each of 4 different mask designs.  52 different monoclonal antibodies were incubated on these microarrays and analyzed for their propensity to bind the peptides created from each mask set.  The diversity of binding served as a proxy for the 'randomness' of these peptides, and provided information about how many masks are needed to truly generate random sequence peptides.

DESIGN
two replicates of each peptide was printed on 1 Mask peptide microarray. A minimum of Two microarrays were tested for each sample. Image was qualified using in-house metrics for quality assurance.

PLATFORM
GPL17490 MASK design peptide microarray
