SUMMARY
Global tranascriptional profiling of Bacillus subtilis cells comparing fur mutant to mutants of the iron-sparing response: fur fsrA double mutant, fur fbpAB triple mutant, fur fbpC double mutant, and  fur fbpABC quadruple mutant Abstract of associated manuscript: The Bacillus subtilis ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein is the major sensor of cellular iron status. When iron is limiting for growth, derepression of the Fur regulon increases the cellular capacity for iron uptake and mobilizes an iron-sparing response mediated, in large part, by a small non-coding RNA named FsrA. FsrA functions together with three small, basic proteins (FbpABC) to repress many " low-priority " iron-containing enzymes. We have used transcriptome analyses to define the scope of the iron-sparing response and to define subsets of genes dependent on either FbpAB or FbpC for their repression. Enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, including both aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, are major targets of FsrA-mediated repression and, as a consequence, flux through this pathway is significantly decreased under iron limitation. FsrA also mediates a physiologically significant repression of iron-sulfur containing enzymes required for ammonium assimilation (the GltAB glutamate synthase) and catabolism of lactic acid (LutABC). Repression of the lutABC operon requires both FsrA and FbpB which supports a model in which the Fbp proteins function to enable repression of subsets of the FsrA regulon.
