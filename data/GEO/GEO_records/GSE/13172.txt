TITLE
Mismatch oligonucleotides in human

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tiled regions surrounding 5 human genes as 36mers, HBG2, TIMP3, SYN3, FLNA, FBX07. The first three of these genes, we tiled with various mismatch oligos in addition to 'perfect match' oligos. Keywords: Mismatch hybridization experiment

DESIGN
Tiled perfect match and various designs of mismatch oligonucleotide for several human genes. Goal was to observe the influence of various MM types on hybridization behavior in human, and compare it to yeast (see related slide).
