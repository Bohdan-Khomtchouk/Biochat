TITLE
TGF-beta/Smad3-dependent gene expression analysis in naive CD4 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Investigation of transcript level modulation in unstimulated and TGF-beta treated (with or without superimposed T-cell receptor and CD28 stimulation) naive CD4 T cells from wild type or Smad3-deficient littermate mice. Smad3 is a critical signaling molecule and transcription factor downstream of TGF-beta and mediates several of the TGF-beta dependent tolerogenic effects in T cells. This study was undertaken to unveil the transcriptionnal program controled by the TGF-b/Smad3 axis.

DESIGN
Microarray study using RNA recovered after 6 hours of culture in either serum free media, serum-free media + TGF-beta (2.5ng/ml) or serum-free media + TGF-beta and anti-CD3e and anti-CD28 stimulation (3 conditions). Naive CD4 T cells (TCRb+, CD4+, CD62L+ and CD44-) were sorted from either wild type or Smad3 deficient littermates and submitted to the 3 culture conditions. Three biological replicates were obtained (each from at least 2 different mice). Thus a total of 18 Nimblegen 365K chip were used.
