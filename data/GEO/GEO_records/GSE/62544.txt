TITLE
Profiling of three leiomyosarcoma molecular subtypes with RNA-sequencing

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a malignant neoplasm with smooth muscle differentiation, and there are three molecular subtypes of LMS which have been defined previously by our lab. To further validate these subtypes and identify potential therapeutic targets in each subtype, we profiled the LMS cases from each subtype with RNA-Seq technology.

DESIGN
8 LMS cases from subtype I, 6 cases from subtype II, 3 cases from subtype III and 7 cases of normal tissues, were selected for RNA-Seq. Then the expression levels and potential mutations were analyzed on these cases.

PLATFORM
