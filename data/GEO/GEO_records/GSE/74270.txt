TITLE
RNA sequencing of Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Specimens for Gene Expression Quantification and Data Mining

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared the RNAseq data consistency between Ribo-Zero and RNase H kits

DESIGN
RNA libraries were prepared using both Ribo-Zero and RNase H kits on breast cancer FFPE specimens. We sequenced these libraries and compared their data consistencies.
