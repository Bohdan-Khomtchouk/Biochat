TITLE
Potential mechanisms of endocrine disruptors as revealed by uterine gene profile

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Females were ovariectomized and injected with sesame oil, estradiol in sesame oil, BPA in sesame oil or HPTE in sesame oil. Uterine tissue was collected after 2 or 24 hours. RNA was analyzed by microarray compare ealry and late responses to a potent and a weak estrogen agaonist.

DESIGN
3 uteri per group were analyzed individually on one-color Agilent arrays (note: estradiol treatment at 24 hr only has 2 replicates).
