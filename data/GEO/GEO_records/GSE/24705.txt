TITLE
mRNA expression data from iPSCs, ntESCs and iPSC-nt-ESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We generated three kinds of genetically identical mouse reprogrammed cells: induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells (ntESCs) and iPSC-nt-ESCs that are established after successively reprogramming of iPSCs by nuclear transfer (NT). NtESCs show better developmental potential than iPSCs, whereas iPSC-nt-ESCs display worse developmental potential than iPSCs. We used microarrays to distinguish the gene expression differences among three pluriptoent stem cells and identified that imprinted genes had a similar expression pattern in iPSCs and iPSC-nt-ESCs.

DESIGN
We sought to obtain genetic identical pluripotent stem cell lines in order to minimize genetic variations among different reprogrammed cells. To that end, we established a genetically homogenous secondary reprogramming system, in which mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying doxycycline (dox)-inducible lentiviruses expressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc were isolated and used as donors for different reprogramming experiments. We generated iPSCs after plating MEFs in the presence of dox in ES culture conditions, and then derived ntESCs after transplantation of the nucleus from the same MEFs into enucleated oocyte. Furthermore, we successively reprogrammed iPSCs by means of NT and established a set of nt-iPSC lines.  Pluripotent stem cells generated from different reprogramming strategies were for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
