TITLE
Ectopic cerebellar cell migration causes maldevelopment of Purkinje cells and abnormal motor behaviour in Cxcr4 null mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis revealed the most significantly affected pathways in the Cxcr4 deficient developing cerebellum are involved in extra cellular matrix receptor interactions and focal adhesion

DESIGN
We isolated the cerebellum  WT (n=8) and CXCR4 KO(n=7) P1 mice, and run illumina mice gene expression array to compare the gene expression pattern between this two groups.
