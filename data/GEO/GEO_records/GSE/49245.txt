TITLE
NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO) is essential for KSHV-encoded viral FLICE inhibitory protein (vFLIP) K13- induced gene expression and its N-terminal 251 resdidues are sufficent for this process

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report here that  KSHV viral infection targets the NF-kB pathway which is crucial for cell survival. KSHV protein vFLIP K13 is known to directly interact with cellular protein NEMO of the NF-kB pathway. We used gene expression array to suggets that  the interaction of K13 with NEMO is important to activate NF-kB pathway.

DESIGN
We employed gene array analysis followed by bioinformatics analyses  as well as biological pathways  to determine  the effect of K13  interaction with Nemo in Jurkat cell line system. Total RNA was isolated  isolated using standard RNAeasy kit protocol (Qiagen). Their gene expression profiles were obtained using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array.
