TITLE
Absolute expression level of Saccharomyces castellii genes

ORGANISM
Naumovozyma castellii

SUMMARY
Total RNA versus genomic DNA hybridization on custom arrays designed for all Saccharomyces castellii genes

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected in mid-log phase from Saccharomyces castellii cells grown in rich medium (abbreviated CM, in house recipe).   RNA was then converted to cDNA, Cy3-labeled and hybridized competitively against Cy5 labeled genomic DNA from Saccharomyces castellii.
