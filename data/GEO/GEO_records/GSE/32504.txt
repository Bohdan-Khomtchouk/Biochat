ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed genome-wide mRNA profiling of 149 human surgical liver samples from Caucasian donors with detailed medical documentation. The overall purpose of the study was to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in human liver.

DESIGN
149 liver samples of Caucasian origin were included in the study on the analysis of RNA expression (Illumina Human_WG6_V2) and genotype (HumanHap_300_V1)
