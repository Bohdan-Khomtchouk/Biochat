TITLE
H2AZ Orchestrates Neural Progenitor Cell Proliferation and Differentiation via Setd2-mediated H3K36me3 Modification [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the genomic characterization of H2AZ binding at E13 brain. ChIP experiment was performed with antibody against H2AZ. we generated genome-wide characterization of H2AZ occupancy and find that H2AZ was prone to bind the promoter and the intergenic regions. The genomic localization of H2AZ might reveal its essential role during early neurogenesis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis, revealingÂ that these genes occupied by H2AZ play roles in the cellular metabolic process, DNA replication, cell cycle, and neuron development and so on. Detailed investigation of the binding profiles show that direct binding of NkX2-4 by H2AZ. This study provides a framework for the epigenetic regulation of H2AZ in embryonic neurogenesis.
