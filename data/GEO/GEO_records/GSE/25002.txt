TITLE
Expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing Candida albicans Nik1p comparing osmotic stress and fludioxonil treatment

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Fungal group III histidine kinases are the molecular targets of some classes of fungicides. In contrast to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fungal pathogen Candida albicans possesses a group III histidine kinase, CaNik1p, also called Cos1p. To investigate the function of CaNIK1, the gene was expressed in S. cerevisiae. The transformants became susceptible to antifungal compounds to which the wild-type strain is resistant. The susceptibility was related to the activation of the MAP kinase Hog1p of the osmotic stress response pathway. Gene expression analysis revealed a strong overlap of the responses to osmotic stress and to fludioxonil at early time points. While the response to fludioxonil persisted, the response to osmotic stress was diminished with time.

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae expressing Candida albicans Nik1p were treated with 10 Âµg/ml fludioxonil. As a comparison, another culture of S. cerevisiae expressing Candida albicans Nik1p was treated with 1 M sorbitol to induce osmotic stress response. One culture remained untreated as a control. From all cultures, samples  were taken after a duration of 15, 30 and 60 min.
