TITLE
Transcriptional comparison between whole kidneys from E14.5 Wnt4 mutants and wildtype mice (MG_U74Av2 platform). (GUDMAP Series ID: 7)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our laboratory's interest is in understanding the molecular principles that underlie the regional organization of the mammalian metanephric kidney. Our goal is to generate a detailed spatial map of the cellular expression of selected regulatory genes during mammalian kidney development.  The goal of this study is to identify a population of genes that are enriched in the renal vesicle (RV) and its derivatives using Wnt4 mutants. Keywords: mutant comparison

DESIGN
Wnt4 is required for renal vesicle (RV) induction.  Therefore, RV and the derivatives (s-shaped body and eventually the mature nephron) are missing in Wnt4 mutants.  At E14.5, these structures are present in wildtype kidneys.  Transcriptional profile comparison between E14.5 wildtype and Wnt4 mutants therefore identify genes expressed in the RV and derivatives. Minimally pooled kidney samples were used as single biological replicates.  Total RNA was isolated from these pools and subjected to a single round of amplification for use on Affymetrix arrays.
