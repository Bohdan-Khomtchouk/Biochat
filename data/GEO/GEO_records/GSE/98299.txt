TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of metastatic Sonic Hedgehog subgroup medulloblastomas

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report findings that illuminate a dynamic metastasis pathway in the common pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma.

DESIGN
We examined the transcriptomes of medulloblastoma driven by ATOH1 in collaboration with aberrant Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling, as well as those of medulloblastoma from Ptch1+/- animals.
