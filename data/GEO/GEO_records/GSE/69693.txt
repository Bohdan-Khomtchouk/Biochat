TITLE
Time-course of genes expression of the dorsal and lateral lineage in the SVZ-RMS-OB post-natal neurogenic system

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
SVZ neural stem cells of P1 CD1 mouse pups where dorsally or laterally in vivo electroporated with a GFP vector. At variable time after electroporation, fluorescent cells were FACS sorted. Total RNA was exctracted, amplified and submitted to micro-array analysis.

DESIGN
6 time-points were chosen for analysis: 8 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, 7 days and 14 days. For each time-point 2 to 4 replicates were performed.
