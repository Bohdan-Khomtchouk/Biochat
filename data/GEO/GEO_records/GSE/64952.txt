TITLE
Transcriptional Analysis of Deinococcus radiodurans for Novel sRNAs expression that are Differentially Expressed under Ionizing Radiation

ORGANISM
Deinococcus radiodurans R1

SUMMARY
In this study, we identified potential sRNA candidates inÂ D. radiodurans by a whole transcriptome deep sequencing analysis, and confirm the expression of 31 sRNAs in D. radiodurans with Northern blotting analysis and RT-PCR. A total of 8 confirmed sRNAs showed differential expression during recovery after acute ionizing radiation (15 kGy).

DESIGN
Two samples (sham and 15kGy irradiated) were sequenced.

PLATFORM
