TITLE
MYCL and EP400 are required for Max and MCPyV mediated gene activation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine if MYCL or EP400 knockdown would affect Max target genes in Merkel cell carcinoma cell line MKL-1, we performed RNA-seq analyses of MKL-1 cells inducibly expressing shMYCL and two different EP400 shRNA -2, -3  and compared to ChIP-seq data using BETA analyses.

DESIGN
MYCL or EP400 was inducibly reduced with shRNA in MKL-1 cells to analyze gene regulation.
