TITLE
Transcription data for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates TBCF10839 and TBCF121838 grown to early and late exponential growth phase

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to monitor the gene expression of genomically related but phenotypically divergent strains TBCF10839 and TBCF121838

DESIGN
Cultures were grown in LB medium 37Â°C. In mid-exp. phase (OD600 1.5) cell aliquots were harvested for subsequent RNA extraction. Culturing was continued until late exponential phase (OD600 3.0) when another aliquot was harvested for RNA extraction.

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
