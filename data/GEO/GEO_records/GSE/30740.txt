TITLE
Distribution of Drosophila insulator proteins after ecdysone treatment in Kc cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Here we examine changes in the distribution of Drosophila insulator proteins during the ecdysone response.  We performed ChIP-seq analysis in Kc cells at 0, 3, and 48 hours of ecdysone treatment with antibodies against CP190, Su(Hw), dCTCF, and BEAF-32B.

DESIGN
Examination of 4 different insulator proteins at 3 time points of ecdysone treatment.

PLATFORM
