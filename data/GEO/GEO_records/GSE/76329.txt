TITLE
Nonkeratinizing Carcinoma Tissues: Tumor vs. Adjacent non-tumor tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the common malignant tumors, accounting for first place in head and neck malignant tumors. Nonkeratinizing carcinoma (NKC) is the major histologic type of NPC. We performed Transcriptional profiling of NKC comparing tumor with adjacent non-tumor tissues using. Goal was to identify and investigate dryregulated lncRNAs and mRNA in NKC at genome-wide scale.

DESIGN
Two-paired experiment, Tumor vs. Adjacent Non-tumor Tissues. Biological replicates: 7 paired samples.
