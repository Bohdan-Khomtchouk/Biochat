TITLE
Genome-wide comparison of gene expression level between leukemia stem cells in different tissues

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in different tissues. The hypothesis is that the distinct niche in different tissues affects the gene expression of LSCs.

DESIGN
Total RNA from LSCs in different tissues including bone marrow (BM), spleen (SPL), peripheral blood (BL), gonadal adipose tissue (AT) as well as normal counterparts for LSCs from normal BM (NBM) was isolated and subjected to RNA-seq. LSCs were derived from a blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (bcCML) murine model induced by co-expression of human leukemic oncogenes BCR-ABL and NUP98-HOXA9. Triplicates were generated for LSCs from each tissues.

PLATFORM
