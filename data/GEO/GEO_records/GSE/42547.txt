TITLE
Annexin A2 Modulates Radiation-Sensitive Transcriptional Programming and Cell Fate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Whole genome expression profiling in the presence and absence of annexin A2 [shRNA] identified fundamentally altered transcriptional programming that changes the radioresponsive transcriptome. Bioinformatics predicted that silencing AnxA2 may enhance cell death responses to stress in association with reduced activation of pro-survival signals such as nuclear factor kappa B. This prediction was validated by demonstrating a significant increase in sensitivity toward tumor necrosis factor alpha induced cell death in annexin A2 silenced cells, relative to vector controls, associated with reduced nuclear translocation of RelA (p65) following tumor necrosis factor alpha treatment.

DESIGN
Murine progenitor cells, JB6 cell line, were stably transformed with Annexin A2 shRNA or vector only control and then treated with ionizing radiation at two doses, 10cGy and 100cGy.  Samples were collected at 2hr, 6hr and 24hr for RNA isolation.  Two untreated time points were collected also: 2hr and 24hr.
