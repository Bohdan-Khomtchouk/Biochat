TITLE
Expression data in wt or mutant Drosophila melanogaster embryos

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Terminal differentiation of epidermal cells in Drosophila embryos requires the activity of a transcription factor. Svb is necessary and sufficient to induce this process. pri is a regulator of Svb activity, converting it from a repressor into an activator. To characterize the downstream Svb and pri effectors in cell morphogenesis, we performed microarrays in wt, svb -/- (no gene) and pri -/- (svb repressor) mutant conditions.

DESIGN
Embryos were selected at a precise 13-15h (after egg laying) stage of development, and manually genotyped for each condition: wt (W samples), svb -/- (R samples) and pri -/- (P samples). 5 independent replicates of 200 embryos are used for each condition. RNA were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
