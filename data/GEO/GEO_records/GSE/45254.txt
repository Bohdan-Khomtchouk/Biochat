TITLE
mRNA profiling of GGT-HIF2aM3 (gamma-HIF2alphaM3) kidney cortex

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The complete transcriptomes of kidney cortex from 3 γ-HIF2αM3 18 month old TG+ male mice and 3 age matched wild type (WT) C57BL/6 male mice were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 Sequencer.

DESIGN
Examination of complete transcriptome of kidney cortex between γ-HIF2αM3 TG+ male mice and wild type C57BL/6 male mice

PLATFORM
