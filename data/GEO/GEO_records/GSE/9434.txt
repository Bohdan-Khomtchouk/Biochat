TITLE
Gene expression level during L-threonine production

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
The comparative transcriptome profiling of L-threonine producing strain (TH07 strain harboring pBRThrABC) and control W3110 (lacI-deleted) strain harboring pKK223-3 has been analyzed using oligo nucleotide microarray. Keywords: comparative transcriptome analysis (between L-threonine producing strain and the control strain)

DESIGN
Samples for transcriptome profiling were taken at the OD600 of 5.13 (TH07 harboring pBRThrABC) and 5.21 (control strain), replicate = 2
