TITLE
Gene expression data from striatal regions of MPTP-intoxicated mouse brain by acupuncture

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Acupuncture at acupoints GB34 and LR3 has been reported to inhibit nigrostriatal degeneration in parkinsonism models, yet the genes related to this preventive effect of acupuncture on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system remain elusive. We investigated gene expression profile changes in the striatal region of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism models after acupuncture at the acupoints GB34 and LR3

DESIGN
C57BL/6 mice were divided into four experimental groups; ① C: Control, ② M: MPTP-treatment only, ③ MA: MPTP- and acupuncture-treatment at acupoints GB34 and LR3, ④ MNA: MPTP- and acupuncture-treatment at non-acupoints. Total RNA was isolated from two brains' striatal regions of each experimental group (4 experimental group × 2 samples of each experimental group = total 8 samples).
