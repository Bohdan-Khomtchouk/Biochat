TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of inter- and intra-patient variation in human iPSC cardiomyocytes: Platform for precision medicine to predict drug toxicity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In the present study we created and analyzed cardiomyocytes from two separate iPSC clones from the fibroblasts of five different female individuals and two male individuals, using footprint-free Sendai virus

DESIGN
RNA-seq of iPSC cardiomyocytes, Ampli-seq of heart left ventricle and iPSC cardiomyocytes (with and without drug treatment) and Exome-seq of patient fibroblasts.
