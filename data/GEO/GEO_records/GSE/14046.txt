TITLE
Differential Expression genes between Moniezia expansa and Moniezia benedini

ORGANISM
Moniezia expansa

SUMMARY
We used complementary DNA microarray to analyze the gene expression profiles different between Moniezia expansa and Moniezia benedini. A total of 4056 sequences including full length and partial complementary DNAs representing novel, known, and control genes were analyzed. We utilized cDNA array for detection of gene expression profiles of different proglottids of M.expansa and M.benedini. The present study provides some interesting data that only expressed in M.expansa
