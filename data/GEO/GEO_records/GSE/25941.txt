TITLE
Effects of age on the skeletal muscle transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global microarray (HG U133 Plus 2.0) was used to investigate the basal level skeletal muscle transcriptome profile of young and old adults.  One vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was obtained in the basal state from 36 different subjects.

DESIGN
A total of 36 subjects were included in this investigation.  The young (n=15, 25±1y) participants included 7 males and 8 females.  The old (n=21, 78±1y) participants included 10 males and 11 females.  All subjects were healthy and had never been involved in any formal exercise.  Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis in the basal state.  The RNA integrity of all 36 samples was very good with an average RIN number of 8.2.  All samples were analyzed on a separate microarray chip, and samples were not pooled between subjects.
