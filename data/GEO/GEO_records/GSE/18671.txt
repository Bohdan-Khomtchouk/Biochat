TITLE
miRNA expression data from human high and low risk prostate carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA expression of 6 high risk and 8 low risk prostate carcinoma were compared to the expression of 6 benign prostatic hyperplasia. Keywords: expression profile

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of miRNA expression underlying tumorigenesis and tumor progression and identified dysregulated genes during this process
