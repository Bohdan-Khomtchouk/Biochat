TITLE
ChIP-chip data of HA-Yra1 and Rrm3-Flag in wild-type and cells overexpressing YRA1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription is a major obstacle for replication fork progression and a cause of genome instability. Yra1 is an essential nuclear factor of the evolutionarily conserved family of hnRNP-like export factors that when overexpressed impairs mRNA export and cell growth. Through this ChIP-chip analysis it is shown that Yra1 binds to active chromatin and is enriched at telomeres when it is overexpressed, in agreement with a possible role of this mRNP factor in the maintenance of telomere integrity. Our data indicate that YRA1 overexpression correlates with replication impairment as inferred by the increase of Rrm3, a helicase involved in the replication fork progression, at transcribed genes and telomeres.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip studies were perfomed with antibodies against HA-tagged Yra1 protein in wild-type cells and cells overexpressing YRA1 of the yeast S. Cerevisiae, as well as Flag-tagged Rrm3 protein in both wild-type and cells overexpressing YRA1.
