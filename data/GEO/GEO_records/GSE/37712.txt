TITLE
Expression data from mouse embryonic stem cells upon TRIM71 KD and parental ctrl cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identify mammalian TRIM71 as repressor of mRNAs that inhibits translation and affects mRNA stability. In this data set we compare the expression profile of mouse ES upon Trim71 KD versus that of the parental cells.

DESIGN
Experiment was performed in triplicate.
