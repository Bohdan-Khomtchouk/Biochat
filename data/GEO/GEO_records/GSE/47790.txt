TITLE
Regulation of exon definition and apoptosis by the Ewing's Sarcoma Protein

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Ewing's Sarcoma Protein EWS belongs to the TET family (FUS/TLS, EWS, TAF15) of RNA and DNA binding proteins, implicated in DNA transcription, pre-mRNA splicing and maintenance of genome integrity. To identify in vivo RNA targets of EWS we performed a combinatorial approach of CLIP-Seq In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from three biological replicates of HeLa cells transfected with either scrambled or siEWS oligonucleotides. These data allowed us to identify 805 genes affected at the expression level by EWS knockdown, of which 395 upregulated and 410 downregulated. Moreover, HJAY identified 206 differentially regulated alternative splicing events in 114 genes.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were labeled and hybridized onto Affymetrix HJAY
