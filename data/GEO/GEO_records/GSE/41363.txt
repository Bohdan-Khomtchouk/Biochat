TITLE
Role of the Cytoskeleton in muscle transcriptional response to altered use

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Desmin is a cytoskeletal protein in muscle involved in integrating cellular space and transmitting forces.  In this study we sought to determine the combinatory effects of desmin deletion, aging and eccentric exercise on skeletal muscle at the transcriptional level across many pathways of muscle physiology.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from the TA muscle of mice of two genotypes (wildtype (WT) and desmin knockout (KO)) and two ages (7-9 weeks (Adult) and 12-14 months (Aged)). TA muscles were subjected to a bout of 50 eccentric contractions 12 hours prior to RNA isolation.  Numbers per group are as follows: WT_Adult (5), WT_Aged (5), KO_Adult (5), KO_Aged (4).
