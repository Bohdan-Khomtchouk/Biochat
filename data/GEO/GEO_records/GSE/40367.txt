TITLE
Gene expression analysis of liver and colon cancer primary tumors and metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Enriched tumor epithelium from 61 primary and metastasis tumor specimens was obtained by laser capture microdissection (LCM) as previously described (Boersma et al., 2007).  In brief, frozen 8-Î¼m serial sections from OCT-preserved frozen tissues were prepared and mounted on plain, uncharged microscope slides.  One Hematoxylin/eosin-stained section of each specimen was reviewed by a pathologist to confirm diagnosis and presence of tumor.  The pathologist indicated which representative sections of the tumors should be microdissected.  LCM was performed with the Pixcell II LCM system (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA).  Total RNA was isolated using the PicoPure protocol (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA).  The mRNA was amplified with two linear amplification steps by in vitro transcription using the MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) followed by the labeling step using the BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit T3 from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY).  Labeled cRNA was hybridized onto Affymetix GeneChip HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.
