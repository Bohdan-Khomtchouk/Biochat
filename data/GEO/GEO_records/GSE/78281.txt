TITLE
Transcriptome alterations induced by steroid receptors agonists in primary neurons and astrocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We utilized whole-genome microarrays (Illumina Mouse WG-6) to measure changes in mRNA abundance levels induced by steroid hormones in primary neurons and astrocytes. To stimulate gene expression we treated neuronal and astroglial cultures with glucocorticoid receptor agonist (dexamethasone), mineralocorticoid (aldosterone), progesterone (progesterone), androgen (5α-dihydrotestosterone) and estrogen 2 (β-estradiol). Keywords: Hormonal response

DESIGN
Microarray experiment was designed to determine the effects of steroid receptor agonists. The ex vivo experiments were conducted using mouse striatal neurons and astrocytes from primary cultures. To stimulate gene expression we treated neuronal and astroglial cells with dexamethasone (100 nM), aldosterone (200 nM), progesterone (200 nM), 5α-dihydrotestosterone (200 nM) and β-Estradiol (200 nM) for 4 h. Control cells were treated with vehicle. Four independent biological replicates of the microarray were prepared for each experimental group.
