TITLE
Ovarian Transcript Expression in Newborn Mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of normal newborn ovarian transcript levels, for use in comparison to array based studies of differential expression in mouse knockout models. Keywords: Genetic Modification

DESIGN
Newborn ovaries were pooled separately from wild type  animals and total RNA isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, CA). Newborn ovaries were collected within 12 hours of delivery. Animal experimentation was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine. Three independently pooled RNA samples from wild type used to generate biotinylated cRNA. Biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 2.0 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Since three independent experiments were performed from three independent pools of wild type RNA, signal intensities for particular genes were averaged between the three chips.
