TITLE
Patients with Activated B-cell-like Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (ABC DLBCL) in high and low infectious disease areas have different inflammatory gene signatures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DLBCL accounts for approximately 40% of newly diagnosed lymphomas worldwide. Several etiological mechanisms have been proposed. Among these are viral infections and chronic inflammation which may be associated with the initiation and progression of lymphoma.

DESIGN
Paraffin-embedded specimens from Egyptian and Swedish DLBCL patients were studied using gene expression. RNA from patients were pooled together and arrays were performed in triplicates.

PLATFORM
