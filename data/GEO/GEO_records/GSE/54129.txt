TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of gastric cancer by oligonucleotide microarrays

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastric cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide, and the molecular mechanisms involved in gastric carcinogenesis are still not fully understood. To gain molecular understanding of carcinogenesis, progression, and diversity of gastric cancer, 111 human gastric cancer tissues and 21 noncancerous gastric tissues were analyzed by high-density oligonucleotide microarray in this study. These results provide not only a new molecular basis for understanding biological properties of  gastric cancer, but also useful resources for future development of therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers for gastric cancer.

DESIGN
Tumor samples from 111 patients with gastric cancer underwent subtotal gastrectomy. Biopsy Normal gastric mucosa got from 21 volunteer who underwent gastroscopy for health examination.
