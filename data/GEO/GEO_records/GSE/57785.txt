TITLE
Whole genome transcriptional analysis of monocytes/macrophages purified from bone marrow of xeno-transplanted mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The development and progression of CLL are dependent upon a complex microenvironmental network of cellular and molecular signals. As an example the in vitro survival of CLL cells is supported by nurse-like cells, which have been identified as a CLL-specific tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) population. However little is known regarding the role of TAMs in CLL development and progression. In the CLL xenograft model based on the engraftment of MEC1 human CLL cell line into Rag2-/-γc-/-, we analyzed the whole-genome transcriptome of TAMs isolated from the bone marrow. We found an enrichment of genes involved in inflammation and interaction between TAMs and leukemic cells.

DESIGN
Rag2-/-γc-/- were injected intravenously with MEC1 cells and sacrificed at early stage of leukemia with age-matched wt Rag2-/-γc-/- mice (n=3/group). RNA was isolated from bone marrow murine monocytes/macrophages purified by magnetic separation and processed for illumina whole-genome gene expression direct-hybridization assay.
