TITLE
Impact of Tcf1 and Lef1 deficiency on follicular helper T (Tfh) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptome between control and Tcf1/Lef1-deficient germinal center Tfh (GC-Tfh) cells

DESIGN
Control mice or those are deficient for Tcf1 and Lef1 transcription factors were infected with vaccinia virus. On day 8 after infection, the splenocytes were isolated and surface stained to identify CD44-high, CD62L-low, GFP+, CD4+ T cells. From these cells, PD-1+, CXCR5+ GC-Tfh cells were sorted for RNAseq analysis
