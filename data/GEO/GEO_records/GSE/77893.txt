TITLE
RNA-SEQ analysis of postnatal Ret-positive (EGFP-labeled) nociceptive (NaV1.8 population) dorsal root ganglia L345 or L6S1 neurons.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this set is to build expression data using FACS isolated Ret-positive cells (postnatal) harvested from a RetFloxedEGFP reporter mouse crossed with NaV1.8Cre mice to enrich for Ret nociceptor population. To enrich for bladder projecting neurons L6S1 DRGs were FACS isolated. L3,4, 5 lumbar levels were also FACS isolated to aid in differential expression of Ret-nociceptor population from L6S1 and L345 spinal DRG levels. The series further includes these populations from males and females to uncover sex based differences.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from 3 month FACS isolated dorsal root ganglia dissected from RetFloxedEGFP (RET9 allele is floxed followed by conditional expression of EGFP: abbreviated 9CG) C57BL/6J mice (knocked-in Ret locus-heterozyotes, EGFP is expressed only after Cre-mediated excision from NaV1.8 cells: in DRGS, only small unmyelinated Ret expressing cells) and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform.
