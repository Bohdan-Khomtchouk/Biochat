TITLE
A Novel Statistical Algorithm for Gene Expression Analysis Differentiates PXR-Dependent and Independent Mechanisms of Toxicity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of the present study is to examine the potential role of the pregnane x receptor (PXR) in mice treated with an small molecule inhibitor for beta-secretase (CMP013)

DESIGN
Two groups of mice, C57Bl/6 (PXR+/+) and PXR-knockout C57Bl/6NTac (PXR-/-), were administered either CMP013 or vehicle. There were five animals per treatment group for each strain. After 96 h, all animals were euthanized, and liver samples were collected for RNA. extraction.
