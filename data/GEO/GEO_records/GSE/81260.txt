TITLE
Comprehensive analysis of microRNA signature of mouse pancreatic acini identifies over-expression of miR-21-3p in acute pancreatitis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the current study, we characterized the global miRNA expression profile in mouse pancreatic acinar cells during acute pancreatitis using next-generation RNA-Sequencing. We identified 330 known and 6 novel miRNAs being expressed in mouse pancreatic acinar cells. At basal state, miR-148a-3p, miR-375-3p, miR-217-5p, miR-216a-5p were among the most abundantly expressed whereas miR-24-5p and miR-421-3p were least abundant. Treatment of acinar cells with supra-maximal caerulein or bile acid induced numerous changes in miRNA expression levels. In particular, we observed significant upregulation of miR-21-3p in these experiments, which was further, confirmed using mouse models of acute pancreatitis. In summary, this is the first comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression in healthy mouse pancreatic acinar cells and how this expression signature changes in acute pancreatitis.
