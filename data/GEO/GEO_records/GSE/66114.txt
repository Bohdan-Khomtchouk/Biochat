TITLE
TGFβ1 treatment of A2058 melanoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
4 replicates were prepared from A2058 melanoma cells [transfected with 10ng of empty vector (pcDNA3.1+)] and treated with 5ng/ml TGFβ1 or vehicle control for 24hrs

DESIGN
This is the control arm of a larger experiment where cells transfected with a particular expression plasmid were treated with TGFβ1 or control vehicle. The transfection with the expresion plasmid was unsucessful so this empty vector data has been used alone to simply examine the effect of TGFβ1 treatment on A2058 cells.
