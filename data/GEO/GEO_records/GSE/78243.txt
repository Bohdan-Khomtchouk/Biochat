TITLE
Oxidized mitochondrial nucleoids released by neutrophils drive  type I Interferon production in human lupus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Autoantibodies against nucleic acids and excessive type I Interferon (IFN) are hallmarks  of human Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). We previously reported that SLE  neutrophils, exposed to TLR7-agonist autoantibodies, release interferogenic DNA, which  we now demonstrate to be of mitochondrial origin. We further show that healthy human  neutrophils do not complete mitophagy upon induction of mitochondrial damage. Rather,  they extrude mitochondrial components, including DNA (mtDNA), devoid of oxidized  residues. When MtDNA undergoes oxidation, it is directly routed to lysosomes for  degradation. This rerouting requires dissociation from the transcription factor TFAM, a  dual high mobility group (HMG) protein involved in maintenance and compaction of the  mitochondrial genome into nucleoids. Exposure of SLE neutrophils, or healthy IFNprimed  neutrophils, to anti-RNP autoantibodies blocks TFAM phosphorylation, a  necessary step for nucleoid dissociation. Consequently, oxidized nucleoids accumulate  within mitochondria and are eventually extruded as potent interferogenic complexes. In  support of the in vivo relevance of this phenomenon, mitochondrial retention of oxidized  nucleoids is a feature of SLE blood neutrophils, and autoantibodies against oxidized  mtDNA are present in a fraction of patients. This pathway represents a novel therapeutic  target in human SLE.

DESIGN
4 samples, no replicates, 2 controls. 2 samples are Neutrophils cultured with and without CCCP (control). 2 samples are Monocytes cultured with and without CCCP (control).
