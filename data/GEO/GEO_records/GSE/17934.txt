TITLE
Analysis of gene expression in the mouse embryo pharyngeal arch

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was conducted to examine normal gene expression in the pharyngeal arch during mouse embryonic development

DESIGN
Wild type embryonic tissue containing the pharyngeal arches was collected from five independent samples (n=5) at stage E10.5 by dissection. Total RNA was isolated for analysis by Affymetrix mouse genome 430A GeneChip.
