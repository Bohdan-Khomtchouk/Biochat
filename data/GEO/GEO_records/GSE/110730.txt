TITLE
Expression analysis of Escherichia coli CC72 before and after osmotic stress

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
Expression level of whole genome genes in Escherichia coli CC72 at early-exponential phase, and 10 min, 20 min and 45 min after osmotic stress. Venus was fused to the 3' end of rpoC in E. coli MG1655 to localize RNA polymerase as reported previously (C. Cagliero and D. J. Jin, 2013).

DESIGN
8 chips were used to measure total RNA extracted from E. coli CC72 grown in LB medium at eary-exponential phase, and 10 min, 20 min and 45 min after 5 M NaCl stress. Each condition has two biological replicates.  And each chip measures the expression level of 4252 genes from E. coli MG 1655 eight 60 mers probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with two technical replicates.
