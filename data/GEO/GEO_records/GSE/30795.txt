TITLE
Multiple tissue RNA sequencing of two Arabidopsis thaliana MAGIC founder accessions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We sequenced messenger RNA isolated from seeding, root, and floral bud tissue for 2 MAGIC founder accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. The resulting data was used for validation of gene models, and provides a resource to assess tissue-specific expression.

DESIGN
Examination of RNA expression across tissues (seedling, root, floral bud) for 2 accessions (Col-0, Can-0).

PLATFORM
GPL11221 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Arabidopsis thaliana)
