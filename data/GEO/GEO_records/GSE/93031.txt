TITLE
Defects in dosage compensation impact global gene regulation in the mouse trophoblast

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is critical for the development of the extraembryonic tissue as well as the embryonic tissue. Here we carried out transcriptomic analysis of the trophoblast isolated from two different Xist mutant embyros at E7.5 in comparison with wild-type.

DESIGN
Allele-specific RNA-seq analysis of the trophoblast isolated from E7.5 embryos. Embryos were obtained from JF1 females crossed with B6 males carrying respective Xist mutations as well as B6 wild-type males.
