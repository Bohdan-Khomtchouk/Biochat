TITLE
Expression data from mouse skin cell lines in various stages of tumorigenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse skin cell lines in various stages of tumorigenesis were assayed for transcriptome-wide expression levels. We assessed gene expression levels in mouse skin cell lines representing immortalized keratinocytes, premalignant lesions, malignant squamous cell carcinomas, and malignant squamous cell carcinomas with spindle morphology. These tumors were overwhelmingly driven by Hras mutations. The cells themselves were derived from multiple mouse strains.

DESIGN
We grew cells in serum supplemented media. RNA was harvested from log-phase cells by Qiagen kit and hybridized to Affymetrix M430 2.0 arrays.

PLATFORM
GPL1261 [Mouse430_2] Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array
