TITLE
Exon Level Expression Profiling of Epididymal Adipose Tissue: During Chronic Glucocorticoid Treatment While Consuming an N-6 Rich High Fat Diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of total RNA from C57BL/6 epididymal adipose tissue samples Exogenously administered glucocorticoids (GC) are used for the treatment of numerous pathologies, however their chronic usage is associated with alterations in lipid metabolism and adipose tissue function. The combination of chronic GC usage with consumption of a high fat diet poses an even greater risk for the development of adverse metabolic outcomes. We evaluated the effect of chronic GC usage in combination with a 45% high fat diet rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on visceral adipose tissue gene expression in C57BL/6 male mice.

DESIGN
We analyzed epididymal adipose tissue from 8 male C57BL/6 mice using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array. Array data was processed by Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console (AGCG) Software and Affymetrix Expression Console Software. No techinical replicates were performed.
