TITLE
Understanding adult human progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Overarching aim is to achieve a greater understanding of the control of progenitor cells within the adult human retina within the normal and diseased retinal microenvironment. Specifically we will assess via our experimental designs: (i) the control of CD133+ retinal cell populations that display mitotic potential and differentiation and Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization using adult human CD133+ & CD133- retinal cells

DESIGN
Adult human retina was processed to produce a cell suspension, CD133+ cells were magnetically isolated to produce cell populations of CD133+ and CD133- cells. 3 retinal samples were analysed for each cell population.
