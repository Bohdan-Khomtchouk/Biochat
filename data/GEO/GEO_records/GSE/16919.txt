TITLE
Expression data from hESCs differentiated in the presence or absence of nicotinamide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human ESCs are pluripotent cells that have the capacity of self renewal for a prolonged period in vitro, and can differentiate into derivatives of all three primary germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. Human ESCs are responsive to a wide range of factors in vitro that can direct their differentiation into specific cell types. We analyzed the effect of nicotinamide (NIC) on differentiation of hESCs in vitro. CEL file for GSM424319 is unavailable.

DESIGN
hESCs were cultured as free-floating clusters in the presence of 10% FCS for 4 weeks in the presence or absence of nicotinamide.
