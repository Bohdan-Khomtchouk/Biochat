TITLE
Idiopathic oligozoospermic patients vs. Normozoospermic fertile controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Characterization of Y-chromosome CNVs in the AZF regions that may be involved with oligozoospermia through Array-CGH.

DESIGN
Eighteen patients with at least two spermograms showing sperm density lower than 15 million/ml,  normal hormone levels, no chromosomal abnormalities detected by karyotyping method or microdeletions of the Y-chromosome detected by multiplex PCR technique. Four patients had moderate oligozoospermia (5-15million/ml), seven had severe oligozoospermia (1-5million/ml) and seven had extreme oligozoospermia ( < 1million/ml  ). The control group included six proven fertile men (with at least two children, the youngest being at most two years old) with normal karyotype, and no chromosome Y-microdeletions.
