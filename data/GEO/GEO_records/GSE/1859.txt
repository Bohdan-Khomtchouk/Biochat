TITLE
DNase II-deficient fetal liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The liver of DNase II-deficient embryos contains numerous macrophages carrying undigested DNA, and the embryos die in feto. Here, we examined the gene expression in the wild-type (GSM32833) and DNase II-/- (GSM32834) fetal liver, and found that a set of interferon (IFN)-inducible genes is strongly activated in the DNase II-/- fetal liver. When the DNase II-/- mice were crossed to IFN type I receptor (IFN-IR)-null mice, the mice deficient in both DNase II and IFN-IR genes were born apparently normally, indicating that the type I IFN and its inducible genes had the lethal effect on the mouse development. To examine which genes induced by IFN is responsible to kill the embryos, the gene expression of the fetal liver of DNase II-/- IRF-IR-/- embryos (GSM32835) was also examined. Keywords: other
