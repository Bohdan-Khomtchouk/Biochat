TITLE
mRNA profiling of mouse embryonic cells with activin or SB431542 treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analysed the mRNA expression profiles of control and VprBP knockdown mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with or without Activin treatment or TGF-Î²/Activin inhibitor SB431542 challenge for 4 days during differentiation

DESIGN
Comparation of mRNA expression profile between control and VprBP knockdown mESCs upon Activin/SB431542 treatment furing 4 days differentiation

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
