TITLE
A Predictive Response Signature to Infliximab Treatment in Ulcerative Colitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infliximab, an anti-TNFa monoclonal antibody, is an effective treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC) inducing over 60% of patients to respond to treatment. Consequently, about 40% of patients do not respond. This study analyzed mucosal gene expression from patients enrolled in ACT1 to provide a predictive response signature for infliximab treatment. Keywords: predictive response signature

DESIGN
Twenty-two patients underwent colonoscopy with biopsy before infliximab treatment. Response to infliximab was defined as endoscopic and histologic healing at week 8 (P2, 5, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 24, 27, 36, and 45 as responders; P3, 12, 13, 19, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, and 47 as non-responders). Messenger RNA was isolated from pre-infliximab biopsies, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix HGU133Plus_2.0 Array. The predictive response signature was verified by an independent data set.
