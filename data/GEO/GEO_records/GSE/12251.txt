TITLE
A Predictive Response Signature to Infliximab Treatment in Ulcerative Colitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Infliximab, an anti-TNFa monoclonal antibody, is an effective treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC) inducing over 60% of patients to respond to treatment. Consequently, about 40% of patients do not respond. This study analyzed mucosal gene expression from patients enrolled in ACT1 to provide a predictive response signature for infliximab treatment. Keywords: predictive response signature
