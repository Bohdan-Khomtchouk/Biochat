TITLE
DREAM in pain mechanisms in the trigeminal ganglia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression of DREAM in dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord is related to endogenous control mechanisms of acute and chronic pain. In primary sensory trigeminal neurons high levels of endogenous DREAM protein are preferentially localized in the nucleus, suggesting a major transcriptional role. Here, we show that DREAM participates in the control of trigeminal pain perception through the regulation of prodynorphin and BDNF. Furthermore, genome-wide analysis of trigeminal neurons in daDREAM transgenic mice revealed that cathepsin L (CTSL) and the monoglyceride lipase (MGLL) are new DREAM downstream targets and have a role in the regulation of trigeminal nociception.

DESIGN
Four biological replicates were independently hybridized to Affymetrix chips (GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array) for each sample type.
