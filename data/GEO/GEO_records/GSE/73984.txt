TITLE
SOX9 Regulates Multiple Genes in Chondrocytes, Including Genes Encoding ECM Proteins, ECM Modification Enzymes, Receptors, and Transporters

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated mRNA that is regulated by SOX9 in mouse chondrocytes

DESIGN
The primary culture of rib chondrocytes from floxed Sox9 mice is infected with Adeno-CMV-Cre or Adeno-CMV-Null. The expression levels of mRNA  was compared between SOX9 depleted and not-depleted chondrocytes by RNA-Seq.

PLATFORM
GPL9250 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Mus musculus)
