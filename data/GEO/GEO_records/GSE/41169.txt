TITLE
Blood DNA methylation profiles in a Dutch population

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of whole blood in schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects of different ages. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 480,000 CpGs. Dataset included 62 schizophrenia patients and 33 healthy subjects from Dutch descent.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 96 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip. Publication: Steve Horvath, Yafeng Zhang, Peter Langfelder, Ren√© S. Kahn, Marco P.M. Boks, Kristel van Eijk, Leonard H. van den Berg, Roel A. Ophoff. Aging effects on DNA methylation modules in human brain and blood tissue. Genome Biology. Special Edition. The raw data (non-normalized Unmethylated and Methylated signal intensities) are not available.
