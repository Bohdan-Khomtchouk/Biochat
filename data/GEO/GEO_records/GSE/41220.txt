TITLE
Gene expression data from cultured cortical neurons.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix DNA arrays to investigate the extent to which nuclear HDAC4 accumulation affects neuronal gene expression. Cultured neurons were infected with lentiviruses expressing either wildtype HDAC4 or the constitutuvely nuclear 3SA mutant under the control of neuronal Synapsin promoter.

DESIGN
Neurons were infected at 5 days after plating (5DIV) and analyzed at 14 DIV.
