TITLE
Transcriptomic response of 6 Propionibacterium freudenreichii strains during cold storage

ORGANISM
Propionibacterium freudenreichii

SUMMARY
Propionibacterium freudenreichii is used as a ripening culture in Swiss cheese manufacture. It produces flavor compounds over the whole ripening period. During cheese ripening, P. freudenreichii is exposed to a temperature downshift, especially when cheeses are transferred from warm temperature (about 24째C) to cold temperature (about 4째C). The cold adaptation of the type strain was studied previously. The aim of this study was to investigate the adaptation of 6 other P. freudenreichii strains at cold temperature by means of a global gene expression profile. The temporal transcriptomic response of 6 P. freudenreichii strains was analyzed at 2 times of growth, during growth at 30째C then after 3 days 4째C, in the constant presence of lactate as the main carbon source.
