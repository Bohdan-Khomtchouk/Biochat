TITLE
Dynamic RNA-protein interactions underlie the zebrafish maternal-to-zygotic transition

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We adapted the iCLIP method to zebrafish embryos to investigate activities of Hnrnpa1 during the maternal-to-zygotic transition

DESIGN
3 and 4 biological replicates from zebrafish embryos before (preZGA) and during (ZGA) zygotic genome activation, respectively, after UV crosslinking. Negative control samples include 3 IgG replicates of UV crosslinked samples for both developmental stages examined
