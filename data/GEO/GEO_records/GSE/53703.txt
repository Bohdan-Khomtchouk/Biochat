TITLE
Identification of a novel E-box binding PI polyamide inhibiting MYC-driven cell-proliferation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of K562 and P493 cells treated with Myc-5 and Mismatch PI polyamides as well as with DMSO as a control

DESIGN
Gene expression in human K562 and P493 cells was measured at 72 hours after treatment with DMSO, MYC-5 and its mismatch PI polyamides.  Four or two replicates  for each sample were hybridized on 8x60K Agilent GE array.

PLATFORM
GPL13607 Agilent-028004 SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
