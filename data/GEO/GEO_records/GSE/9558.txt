TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Peyers patches after infection of C57BL/6 mice with Yersinia enterocolitica

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Orogastral infection of mice with Yersinia enterocolitical leads to HIF-1 alpha activation.To elucidate whether this HIF-1 alpha activation also results in a HIF-1 dependent gene programming, the transcriptomes from Peyers Patches of uninfected and Yersinia enterocolitica infected mice were analyzed by means of of microarray analyses using Affymetrix GeneChip probe arrays (MG-U74Av2). In total, 288 genes were differentially regulated three day after infection in PP compared with the expression of uninfected control mice. Of these 288 genes, 217 were found to be differentially upregulated and from these, 14 genes ( 6.5% of all upregulated genes) are well described to be regulated via HIF-1. These data indicate that orogatral infection with Y. enterocolitica results in HIF-1 dependent gene programmning Keywords: Time course
