TITLE
VeraCode GoldenGate Methylation Assay microarray data for purified human leukocytes, reconstruction mixtures and human whole blood samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to utilize DNA methylation to quantify human leukocyte subsets in human blood. This file contains data from an Illumina custom VeraCode GGMA microarray for human leukocyte subtypes (purified from whole blood samples via magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and purity confirmed by flourescence activated cell sorting (FACS)) as well as for complex mixtures of DNA from those samples, and for human whole blood samples.

DESIGN
Bisulfite converted DNA from the  samples were hybridized to an Illumina Custom VeraCode GGMA microarray.
