TITLE
NINDS Rat Epilepsy Diet

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The ketogenic diet (KD) is an anticonvulsant treatment that has been used to manage medically-intractable epilepsies.  The KD requires 10-12 days to become maximally effective, suggesting that changes in gene expression are involved in its anticonvulsant action.  Using the Affymetrix rat arrays (RAE230A), 6 control samples and 5 KD samples were run. Keywords: other
