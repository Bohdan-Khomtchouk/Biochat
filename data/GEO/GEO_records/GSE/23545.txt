TITLE
Whole-genome gene expression profiles of non-tumorous human lung tissues: GRNG set

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled genome-wide gene expression in non-tumorous human lung tissues. The overall goal of this project is to improve our molecular understanding of various lung diseases including lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

DESIGN
Lung specimens were obtained from patients with a variety of lung diseases. After resection, tissue samples of the lobes or lungs not relevant for the diagnostic work-up were frozen and stored at -80C. RNAs were extracted and then hybridized to a single custom-made whole-genome human Affymetrix array.
