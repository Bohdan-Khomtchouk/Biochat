TITLE
Whole-genome gene expression profiles of non-tumorous human lung tissues: GRNG set

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled genome-wide gene expression in non-tumorous human lung tissues. The overall goal of this project is to improve our molecular understanding of various lung diseases including lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
