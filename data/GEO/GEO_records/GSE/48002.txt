TITLE
Protein Domain Mimetics as In Vivo Modulators of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Signaling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profiling of hydrogen-bond surrogate that targets hypoxia-inducible transcription factior complex and results in inhibition of hypoxia-inducible genes with relatively minimal perturbation of non-targeted signaling pathways.

DESIGN
Hypoxic HeLa cells were treated with transcriptional inhibitors HBS 1, HBS 2 or vehicle and their expression profiles were compared to normoxic HeLa cells.
