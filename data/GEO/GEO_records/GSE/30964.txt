TITLE
Genome-wide mRNA expression profiles of FACS-purified rat beta cells freshly isolated from control and 24h-fasted rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The study was designed to capture the in vivo adaptations of nutrient-sensing pancreatic beta cells to fed or fasted (24h) state. Short periods of fasting are thought to mediate the beta cellsâ€™ competence for insulin synthesis and secretion. We examined whether it influenced their typical mRNA expression. After 24h of fasting, a 1.5 fold change was detected in 1.5% of all assayed transcripts (p < 0.05), with 95% of altered genes (430 of 452) being down-regulated (Fig.6A). Suppression was more marked for a panel of genes with beta cell-specific expression, of which 12% were 1.5-fold suppressed. Suppressed beta cell marker genes were statistically enriched in gene clusters of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ER to Golgi transport, protein folding and secretory vesicle-mediated transport, i.e. the pathways of protein synthesis and transport.

DESIGN
For both experimental conditions, 3 biological replicates were studied, each representing an independent isolation from n= 5, 10w-old male Wistar rats. Beta cells were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after the end of the isolation procedure, i.e. within 3 hours after animal killing.
