TITLE
Global effects of spt10 mutations on gene expression in budding yeast.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Using yeast strains based on the protease-deficient strain BJ5459 (= wild type), the effects of the spt10-null and spt10-C388S mutations on global gene expression were assessed and compared.  BJ5459 (wild type) and BJ-SPT10(C388S)-HA cells were grown in synthetic complete medium to A600 = 0.6. RNA was prepared using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).  Biotinylated cRNA was prepared from three independently prepared sample pairs and hybridised to Affymetrix S98 arrays and detected using fluorescently labelled streptavidin.  The wild type and the spt10-C388S average signals each represent the average of the signals from three arrays. The P-value is an indicator of the statistical significance of the difference between the average signals for wild type and the C388S mutant. The lower the value, the greater the significance. The gene descriptor is provided by Affymetrix. Keywords: mutant yeast strain comparison

DESIGN
Three RNA samples from wild type, spt10-null and spt10-C388S cells were prepared independently on three occasions. These nine RNA samples were used to make cRNA and hybridised separately to Affymetrix S98 arrays at the same time.
