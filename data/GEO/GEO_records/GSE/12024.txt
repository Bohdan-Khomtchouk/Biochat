TITLE
Effect of Sirolimus treatment on lupus nephritis in NZB/W F1 female mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NZB/WF1 female mice spontaneously develop autoimmune lupus nephritis. Expression profiling of kidney tissue from (a) 12 week NZB/W F1 female mice defined as asymptomatic for lupus nephritis, (b) 36 and 42 week NZB/W F1 female mice defined as diseased/symptomatic for lupus nephritis and (c) 36 and 42 week NZB/W F1 female mice that are diseased/symptomatic for lupus nephritis and treated with Sirolimus was carried out. The goal of the study was to identify genes associated with lupus nephritis and modulated by Sirolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR. In addition,  lupus nephritis genes resistant to Sirolimus therapy were also identfied

DESIGN
This series of samples comprises of kidney tissue from (a) 12 week old NZB/W F1 female mice defined as asymptomatic for lupus nephritis (N=4), (b) 36 (N=3) and 42 week (N=3) old NZB/W F1 female mice defined as diseased/symptomatic for lupus nephritis and (c) 36 (N=3)and 42 (N=3) week old NZB/W F1 female mice that are asymptomatic for lupus nephritis on treatment with Sirolimus
