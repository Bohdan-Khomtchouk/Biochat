TITLE
Sleep Deprivation and Recovery Sleep for 7 Regions of Mouse Brain.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effects of sleep deprivation, recovery sleep, and three time-of-day controls on seven brain regions laser microdissected from mouse brain. The regions include the locus coeruleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, hypocretin area, tuberomammillary nucleus, orbital cortex, posteromedial cortical amygdala, and entorhinal cortex.

DESIGN
In this study, 7 brain regions were collected by laser microdissection from brain tissue of mice from 5 different treatment groups and used for microarray experiments. Four biological replicates were generated for each regionxcondition. Conditions are: SD, sleep deprivation for 6 hours from ZT0 - 6; SDC, time-of-day control for SD at ZT6; RS, recovery sleep for 4 hours following SD; RSC, time-of-day control for RS at ZT10; W, spontaneous waking at ZT18.
