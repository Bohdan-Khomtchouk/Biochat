TITLE
Uncover small RNAs in citrus somatic embryogenesis

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
To uncover the involvement of miRNAs and siRNAs in somatic embryogenesis of the perennial woody crop citrus, we carried out high-throughput (Illumina) sequencing (HTS) of sRNAs and RNA degradome tags in non-embryogenic and embryogenic tissue of Valencia sweet orange. A total of 191 stem-loop structures were identified, emanating 50 known and 45 novel miRNAs, 130 miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and 94 other siRNAs. Combining with the result of degradome sequencing, a total of 235 phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs), and 195 cleaved target genes were identified for miRNAs/siRNAs.

DESIGN
Small RNA and degradome libraries of nonembryogenic callus (NEC), embryogenic callus (EC) and embryogenic callus exposed to  somatic embryo induction for 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks (E1-4) of Valencia sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) were sequenced by Illumina platform, one biological replicates
