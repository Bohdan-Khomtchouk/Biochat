TITLE
IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7 coordinately regulate the type I IFN response in myeloid dendritic cells downstream of MAVS signaling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myeloid dendritic cells from WT, Irf3-/-xIrf7-/-, Irf3-/-xIrf5-/-xIrf7-/-, Mavs-/- (IPS1-/-)and Ifnar-/- mice were infected with West Nile virus to assess the contributions of specific signaling and transcription factors in initiating the antiviral response

DESIGN
RPMI + rmGM-CSF purified bone marrow derived myeloid DC (mDC), mock and WNV infected with insect derived virus and RNA isolated at 24 hours post infection . Each genotype has matched mock and infected samples. n=6 for WT mock, WT infected, IFNAR mock, IFNAR infected, IRF3x7 infected; n=5 IRF3x7 infected; n=3 IRF3x5x7 mock, IRF3x5x7 infected, MAVS mock, MAVS infected. RNA was prepared using the Illumina bead station assay and hybridized to Illumina RefSeq-8 V2 BeadChips. Note: MAVS=IPS1
