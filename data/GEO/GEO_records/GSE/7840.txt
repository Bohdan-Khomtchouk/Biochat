TITLE
Oligonucleotide microarrays for the detection and identification of viable beer spoilage bacteria

ORGANISM
Pectinatus frisingensis ; Lactobacillus brevis ; Lactobacillus casei ; Lactobacillus coryniformis ; Megasphaera cerevisiae ; Pediococcus damnosus ; Pectinatus cerevisiiphilus ; Lactobacillus perolens ; Pediococcus inopinatus

SUMMARY
A prototype oligonucleotide microarray was designed to detect and identify viable bacterial species with the potential to grow of common beer spoilage microorganisms from the genera Lactobacillus, Megasphaera, Pediococcus and Pectinatus. Probes targeted the intergenic spacer regions (ISR) between 16S and 23S rRNA, which were amplified in a combination of reverse transcriptase (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to hybridization. This method allows the detection and discrimination of single bacterial species in a complex sample. Furthermore, microarrays using oligonucleotide probes targeting the ISR allow the distinction between viable bacteria with the potential to grow and non-growing bacteria. The results demonstrate the feasibility of oligonucleotide microarrays as a contamination control in food industry for the detection and identification of spoilage microorganisms within mixed population. Keywords: microarray, oligonucleotide, species-specific, detection, beer spoilage bacteria

DESIGN
Each oligonucleotide species-specific probe was spotted in 70 replicate spots on the microarray. Nine single beer spoilage bacteria species were detected with the developed prototype oligonucleotide microarray and also three mixes of two different beer spoilage bacteria species.
