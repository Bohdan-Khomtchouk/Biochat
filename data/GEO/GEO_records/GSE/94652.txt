TITLE
Affymetrix OncoScan data for IDH and TP53 mutant gliomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IDH and TP53 mutant gliomas are high recurrent tumor, and thus we aimed to detect malignant and recurent factors in this genetic type of gliomas

DESIGN
OncoScan arrays were performed for two set, i.e., primary and recurrent tumors, of IDH and TP53 mutant gliomas.
