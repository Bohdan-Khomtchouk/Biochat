TITLE
Genome-wide analysis gene expression in SUM-149 cells expressing AREG shRNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Results of knocking-down AREG expression in SUM-149 cells by lenitviral infection of shRNA vectors and measuring gene expression provides information as to what genes are regulated by AERG in inflammatory breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
SUM-149 cells were infected with a single AREG shRNA virus (sh4) or three AREG shRNA viruses (shPld) and the non-silencing vector (shNS). Total RNA was collected and genome-wide analysis of expression was performed on RNA from each cell line.
