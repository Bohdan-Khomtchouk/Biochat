TITLE
GDF11 is a myokine that inhibits muscle differentiation and induces atrophy during regeneration

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Age-related frailty may in part be due to a decreased competency in skeletal muscle regeneration. The role of the closely related TGFbeta amily molecules myostatin and GDF11 in regeneration is unclear. The commercially available antibody which in a prior report was used to demonstrate an age-related decrease in GDF11 was found to detect both GDF11 and myostatin, and with this reagent it appears that the combination of GDF11 and myostatin increases with age in serum. Mechanistically, GDF11 and myostatin induce SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, and both inhibit myoblast differentiation and regulate identical downstream signaling. GDF11 injected into adult mice in a model of regeneration induces an increase in smaller fibers and a decrease in satellite cell expansion. There are no signs of benefit from GDF11 to regeneration. Thus, GDF11 appears to be an age-associated myokine that inhibits muscle differentiation, and is thus a target for blockade to treat frailty

DESIGN
hSKMCs, treated with 3 doses of either GDF11 or Myostatin (10, 30, or 300ng/mL). Samples were collected at 0, 10hrs and 24hrs. 4 replicates
