TITLE
Expression data from mock treated/oxidized HF after 24h incubation with/without monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cells are constantly exposed to stress. Most of those stresses do not necessarily cause cell death or visible damage. The present study explores the way the immune system responds to such sub lethal stressed cells.

DESIGN
HF cells were exposed to sublethal oxidative stress or mock treated with PBS and after removal of the stressor, HF were incubated with/wthout monocytes for 24h and gene expression was evaluated.
