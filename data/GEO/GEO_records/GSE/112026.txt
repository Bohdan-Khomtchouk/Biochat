TITLE
A Novel Functional Splice Variant of AKT3 Defined by Analysis of Alternative Splice Expression in HPV-Positive Oropharyngeal Cancers (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The incidence of HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has increased more than 200% in the past 20 years. Recent genetic sequencing efforts have elucidated relevant genes in head and neck cancer, but HPV-related tumors have consistently shown few DNA mutations. In this study, we sought to analyze alternative splicing events (ASE) that could alter gene function independent of mutations. To identify ASE unique to HPV-related tumors, RNA sequencing was performed on 46 HPV-positive OPSCC and 25 normal tissue samples. A novel algorithm using outlier statistics on RNA-sequencing junction expression identified 109 splicing events, which were confirmed in a validation set from The Cancer Genome Atlas.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing data for 47 HPV+ HNSCC tumors, 25 normal UPPP, 2 HPV+ HNSCC patient derived xenografts, and 2 HPV+ HNSCC cell lines (SCC-090, SCC-047) ---------------------------------------------- Submitter declares that the raw data will be submitted to dbGaP ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap ) because of patient privacy concerns.

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
