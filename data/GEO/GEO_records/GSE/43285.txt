TITLE
Gene expression profiles after infection of rainbow trout with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)

ORGANISM
Oncorhynchus mykiss

SUMMARY
We describe here transcripts induced after intraperitoneal injection of rainbow trout with 2 different viruses, both belonging to strain 23.75 of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV): a deleted Nv gene (dNV) virus and a wild type (wt) virus. Two days after infection, differentially expressed transcript levels from selected immune-related trout genes were studied in internal organs (spleen and head kidney).

DESIGN
Fishes were divided in two groups (3 fishes per group). The first group was intraperitoneally injected with 100000 pfu per trout of dNV VHSV, while the second group was injected with 100000 pfu/trout of wt VHSV. All fishes were sacrificed two days post infection.
