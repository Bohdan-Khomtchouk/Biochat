TITLE
C/EBPa Regulates Protease/anti-protease Balance and Mediates Bronchiolar Cell Recovery After Injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the present study, we hypothesized that C/EBPa (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha) plays a role in cell regeneration in response to bronchiolar epithelial cell injury. C/EBPa mediated ciliated cell regeneration after naphthalene bronchiolar epithelial cell injury in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that C/EBPa regulates protease/anti-protease balance after lung injury, and intratracheal treatment with anti-protease (BPTI) restored ciliated cell regeneration after naphthalene injury in CebpaD/D mice.

DESIGN
Cebpa d/d VS. Control mice 0hr, 3hr and 72hr after naphthalene injury. Three replicates each.
