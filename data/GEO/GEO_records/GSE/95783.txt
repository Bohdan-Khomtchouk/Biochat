TITLE
Expression data from the uterus of ovariectomized young adult rats treated for three days with E2, 3-MC, E2+3-MC

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Examination of crosstalk between Aryl hydrocarbonreceptor (AHR) and Estrogen receptor (ER) in the rat uterus on the level of mRNA transcriptome The study was designed to see the overall gene-expression change in the uterus induced by E2, the AHR ligand 3-MC alone and in combination with E2.

DESIGN
Ovariectomized young adult rats were treated with vehicle control (DMSO), 4µg/kg/d 17β-Estradiol (E2), 15 mg/kg/d 3-Methylcholanthrene (3-MC) and E2 + 3-MC for three consecutive days. Uteri were obtained 24 h after the last treatment. Biological samples from three rats were analyzed for each treatment group.
