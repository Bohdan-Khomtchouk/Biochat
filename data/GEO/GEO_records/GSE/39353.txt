TITLE
Expression profiling of human prostate non-tumorigenic RWPE-1 cells after overexpressing ERG and ETV1, and ERG and ETV1 silencing on prostate cancer cells LNCaP and  VCaP, respectively

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosomal rearrangements involving ETS factors, ERG and ETV1, occur frequently in prostate cancer. We here examine human prostate non-tumorigenic RWPE-1 cells with ERG- or ETV1-expressing stable RWPE-1 cell.

DESIGN
RWPE-1 stable cell clones overexpressing ERG and ETV1 were grown under normal conditions.  Total RNA was extracted from three biological replicates. This was used to hybridize to Affymetrix expression arrays using the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform.

PLATFORM
