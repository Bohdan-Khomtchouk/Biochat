TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of primary monocytes from HIV+ patients with differential responses to therapy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study aimed at investigating the monocytic transcriptome distinction between patients with sustained virus suppression (BDL) and patients with virological failure during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This study provides the first transcriptomic distinctions in monocytes between viremic patients and BDLs on HAART. Our results reflected the outcome balanced between subversion of monocyte transcriptome by HIV and compensatory effect adapted by host cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from primary monocytes from five HIV+ patients on HAART who sustainably controlled HIV below detection level (BDL), five HIV+ patients on HAART who consecutively experienced viremia and four healthy HIV sero-negative controls were compared against each other.
