TITLE
Utility of circulating serum miRNAs as biomarkers of early cartilage degeneration in animal models of post-traumatic osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to identify potential serum microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers of cartilage degeneration comparing preclinical mouse models of post-traumatic osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis.

DESIGN
Cartilage degeneration was induced in one knee of 10-12 week old male C57BL6 mice by surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) or intra-articular injection of methylated-bovine-serum-albumin (AIA), with sham-operated or saline-injected control animals (n=6/treatment/time). Total serum RNA and knee joints were isolated at 1, 4 and 16 weeks post-induction. Cartilage degeneration was scored histologically. Serum miRNA expression profiling was performed using Agilent microarrays and validated by quantitative PCR.
