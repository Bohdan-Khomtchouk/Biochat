TITLE
Profiling transcriptomic response of Enchytraeus albidus to Cu and Ni: Comparison with Cd and Zn

ORGANISM
Enchytraeus albidus

SUMMARY
Metals, including copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) are among the most common contaminants in soils in Europe. Although their effects are relatively well known regarding survival and reproduction of soil invertebrates, their modes of action in these organisms are still poorly studied. Enchytraeus albidus has been used in soil ecotoxicology for many years, and more recently has a gene library and an oligonucleotide microarray for this species which allowed gene expression studies. This has potentiated the means to study further in depth the mechanisms of response to stressors. The main aim of this study is to understand the mechanisms of response of E. albidus to Cu and Ni. For that we have 1) assessed and compared the transcriptomic profile of E. albidus in response to Cu and Ni and 2) compared the Cu, Ni, Cd and Zn transcriptomic profiles. For the microarray hybridizations, E. albidus were exposed to the reproduction effect concentrations EC50 and EC90 of Cu and Ni during 4 days. Results indicate that Cu and Ni have to some extent, similar mechanisms of toxicity and that have already been identified in other species, indicating cross-species conserved mechanisms. Based on hierarchical clustering, it was possible to observe a clear separation of Cd treatments from all other metals. This separation strongly correlates with the available information regarding the toxicokinetics of the tested metals, in which Ni shows properties similar to essential metals.

DESIGN
Gene expression in E.albidus was measured  4 days after exposure to Copper, Nickel, Cadmium and Zinc at 2 concentrations of effect on reprocduction (EC50 and EC90). Three biological replicates per exposure condition and 6 biological replicates of control conditions were used.
