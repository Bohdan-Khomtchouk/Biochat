TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of flatfish (Solea senegalensis) spermatogenesis: early versus late spermatogenesis

ORGANISM
Solea senegalensis

SUMMARY
The Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) is a marine flatfish of high economic value and a target species for aquaculture. Here, we used a transcriptomic approach to investigate changes in genes expressed in the Senegalese sole testis throughout spermatogenesis in wild-caught fish adapted to captivity. We identified approximately 400 genes that are differentially expressed during the progression of spermatogenesis and that participate in processes such as activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, sperm maturation and motility, cell adhesion or cytoskeletal remodeling. The results from this study contribute to our understanding of the molecular changes ocurring during spermatogenesis in the Senegalese sole.

DESIGN
This study represents spermatogenesis in Solea senegalensis: early versus late spermatogenesis. Total RNA from testes at different stages in spermatogenesis (early, mid, late and functional maturation) from F0 wild Senegalese sole (3-4 animals at each stage) was extracted using the RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNAse following the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of total RNA was performed using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. RNA samples from each stage were pooled and amplified, labelled and hybridized to a custom-made oligonucleotide microarray containing 5,087 Senegalese sole Unigene sequences. In brief, pooled testicular RNAs from each stage were amplified and the resulting cRNAs labelled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, mixed in equal amounts and hybridized to the microarray for 17 h at 60 ºC. Each hybridization was performed at least in duplicate.
