TITLE
Expression profiles of human macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The project was designed to identify genes with an altered expression in macrophages from subjects with atherosclerosis compared to macrophages from control subjects. Keywords: Case-control

DESIGN
We used monocyte-derived macrophages from peripheral blood cultured in the absence or presence of oxidized LDL, baseline macrophages or foam cells. The macrophages were obtained from 15 subjects with subclinical atherosclerosis and a family history of CHD. Macrophages from 15 age and sexmatched subjects with no atherosclerosis and no family history of CHD were used as control.
