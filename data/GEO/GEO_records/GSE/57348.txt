TITLE
Melanomas enhance metastasis and resist BRAF-therapy through regulation of the scaffold protein FHL2 after loss of differentiation markers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To test whether or not the stable restoration of PMEL and FHL2 knockdown affects the oncogenic ability of into amelanotic melanoma cells. Global gene expression analysis performed to identify what different mechanisms and/or factors might be involved in cell motility and cell aggressiveness.

DESIGN
A375M2 were stable transduced with lentivirus containing an empty vector expressing eGFP, full length PMEL or shRNA specific sequence against FHL2. Cells were FACS selected and grown in selective medium for 15 days before testing. Total RNA was extracted from cells after being seeded at equal numbers and reached 80% confluence. Samples were obtained from three separate experiments and send together for processing.
