TITLE
Transcriptional regulation of ROS controls the transition from proliferation to differentiation in the root

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We isolated the meristematic and elongation zones of Col-0, upb1-1 mutant and 35S::UPB1-3YFP/upb1-1 plants by micro-dissection and extracted RNA from each section independently. To identify genes that might mediate UPB1 function we conducted a series of microarray experiments. The spatial distribution of the UPB1 protein suggested that it might exert a different effect on gene expression in the meristematic and elongation zones. Therefore, we isolated the meristematic and elongation zones by micro-dissection and extracted RNA from each section independently.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from approximately 60 meristem- and elongation zones of Col-0, upb1-1 and 35S::UPB1-3YFP #2 6 day old plants. Two biological replicates were performed for each experiment.
