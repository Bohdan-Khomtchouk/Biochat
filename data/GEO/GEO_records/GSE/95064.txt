TITLE
Mouse ES Cells: Control vs Hottip_VP160 and Hoxa13

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse embryonic stem cells comparing control (dCas9 transfected) ES cells with ES cells transfected with a Hottip promoter gRNAs and Hoxa13 promoter gRNAs along with dCAs9-VP160.  Goal was to determine the effects of activation of Hottip lncRNA and Hoxa13 on expression of Hox genes

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Control ES (3 biological replicates) vs. ES cells tranfected with dCas9-VP160 for Hottip (4 biological replicates) and Hoxa13 (3 biological replicates).

PLATFORM
GPL13912 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Feature Number version)
