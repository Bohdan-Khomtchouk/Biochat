TITLE
crl; Transcriptome comparison of the crl mutant and CDT1-RNAi line

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au13-04_cdtbis; cdt1_bis crl mutants and CDT1-RNAi lines have very similar macroscopic phenotypes as well as identical defects in plastid division and biogenesis. Our goal wwas to determine how much of these similarities originated from similar alterations of gene expression. Plantlets of crl mutant and CDT1-RNAi lines were grown in vitro on MS1/2 medium for 14 days. CDT1-RNAi lines were compared to the corresponding wild-type (Ws), whereas crl mutants were compared to their wild-type siblings and are in the Col0 ecotype.

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - normal vs rnai mutant comparaison, normal vs transgenic comparaison
