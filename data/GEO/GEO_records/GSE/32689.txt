TITLE
Comparison of the human oocyte to its sister polar body

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clinicians need additional metrics for predicting quality of human oocytes for IVF procedures. Human polar bodies reflect the oocyte transcript profile. Quantitation of polar body mRNAs could allow for both oocyte ranking and embryo preferences in IVF applications. The transcriptome of a polar body has never been reported, in any organism.

DESIGN
Eight total samples. There are 2 biological replicates of the following four conditions: pooled oocytes and their sister polar bodies and a single oocyte and its sister polar body.
