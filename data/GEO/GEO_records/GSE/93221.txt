TITLE
Microarray analysis on fat bodies of fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) larvae fed with either a semi-purified diet only or a semi-purified diet supplemented with palm fruit juice (PFJ)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PFJ (4 ml for a final concentration of 19,000 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per kg diet or 0.86 mg GAE per kcal diet) was supplemented to larvae of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) given a semi-purified diet to observe for possible effects on energy metabolism and lifespan. Fat bodies extracted from these larvae were used five days since the egg stage for gene expression studies. Results from the microarray data analysis carried out show that fruit fly larva fat bodies given PFJ had up-regulated heat shock protein genes, while cell cycle and growth genes were down-regulated.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from fat bodies of fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) larvae given PFJ in a semi-purified diet (five days since the egg stage) were compared to controls (two replicates in the treatment group versus two replicates in the control group, with each replicate containing total RNA from ten larva fat bodies).
