TITLE
Transcriptome changes in mouse livers upon Bmal1 or Nr1d1 knock out and interactome of lnc-Crot by 4C-seq

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To explore the circadian regulations of Bmal1, we examined the transcriptome changes in mouse livers upon Bmal1 knock out at two circadian time points, CT0 and CT12. To explore the circadian regulations of Nr1d1, we examined the transcriptome changes in mouse livers upon Nr1d1 knock out at two circadian time points, CT0 and CT12. To explore interactome of lnc-Crot, 4C-seq was performed with lnc-Crot as bait region at CT6 and CT18.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of WT and KO at CT0 and CT12. 4C-seq at CT6 and CT18.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
