TITLE
Low-cost, low-input RNA-seq protocols perform nearly as well as high-input protocols

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila virilis

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA according to several library prep protocols with known mixtures of two species of Drosophila in order to establish linear response in each protocol.

DESIGN
For each library prep protocol, mixtures with 0%, 5%, 10%, and 20% D. virilis total RNA was prepared, then libraries prepared according to instructions.

PLATFORM
GPL19602 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila virilis)
