TITLE
MDP- and Pam3CSK4-induced genes in na√Øve and tolerant macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Most of the genes were self-tolerized by Pam3CSK4 and MDP but there was no or minimal cross-tolerization. The transcriptome induced via Nod2 stimulation is greatly expanded in TLR2-tolerant macrophages. Keywords: self and cross tolerance by MDP or Pam3CSK4

DESIGN
Genes induced by Pam3CSK4 or MDP were selected based on a three-fold increase over expression levels in unstimulated  macrophages.  Tolerized genes are defined as genes downregulated more than 2-fold in tolerant macrophages stimulated with  Pam3CSK4 or MDP.
