TITLE
MDP- and Pam3CSK4-induced genes in na√Øve and tolerant macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Most of the genes were self-tolerized by Pam3CSK4 and MDP but there was no or minimal cross-tolerization. The transcriptome induced via Nod2 stimulation is greatly expanded in TLR2-tolerant macrophages. Keywords: self and cross tolerance by MDP or Pam3CSK4
