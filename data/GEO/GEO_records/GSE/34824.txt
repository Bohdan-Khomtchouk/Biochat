TITLE
Frequent driver mutations in histone H3.3 and chromatin remodeling genes in paediatric glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole exome sequencing identified frequent driver mutations in a series of paediatric glioblastomas We used microarray-based profiling to investigate differences in gene expression according to mutational status of driver genes

DESIGN
RNA from 27 primary tumor samples was subject to QC by Agilent BioAnalyser analysis and then hybridised to an Affymetrix U133 Plus2 gene expression array

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
