TITLE
Role of ILK in cardiac regeneration

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two different mouse models of cardiac-specific ILK expression (ILKS343D and ILKR211A) were used to investigate the role of ILK in cardiac regeneration

DESIGN
4 groups with 3 mice (biological replicates) in each group with the total of 12 heart samples were used in this microarray experiment
