TITLE
Expression data from dark-grown BR double mutant bzr1-1D;bri1-116, single mutant bri1-116, and wildtype

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Molecular genetic analyses support a central role of BZR1 in Brassinosteroid (BR) regulation of plant development. The dominant bzr1-1D mutation, which stabilizes the BZR1 protein, completely suppresses the de-etiolated phenotype of the null bri1-116 mutant grown in the dark. Using microarray analysis, we identified genes differentially expressed in bri1-116 compared to wild type and genes differentially expressed in the bzr1-1D;bri1-116 double mutant compared to the bri1-116 single mutant.  Consistent with the phenotypic suppression of bri1-116 by bzr1-1D, about 80% of the genes affected in bri1-116 were affected oppositely  by bzr1-1D

DESIGN
BZR1 regulated genes were generated from comparing genes differentially expressed by bzr1-1D;bri1-116 and bri1-116.  Genes affected by BRI1 were generated from comparing differentially expressed genes of bri1-116 and Col control. ANOVA was used to find genes whose expression was different between bzr1-1D;bri1-116 and bri1-116 or between bri1-116 and Col samples [see Supplementary file below].
