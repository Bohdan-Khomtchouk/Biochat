TITLE
Rotating wall vessel (RWV) grown A549s compared to monolayer grown A549s

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A549 epithelial cells grown under two different conditions were compared.  A549s grown in rotating wall vessel cultures disp[lay a more in-vivo like phenotype. The data here describe the transcriptional differences between the two culture methods

DESIGN
1 colour; Cy3 labelled, 5 biological replicates for each culture condition, A549s grown in RWVs (RWV) compared to A549 grown in monolayers (mono)

PLATFORM
GPL4133 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Feature Number version)
