TITLE
Analysis of the honey bee brain transcriptome from nurses and forager bees

ORGANISM
Apis mellifera

SUMMARY
New insights into the transcriptional regulation of behavioral plasticity in honey bees gained by analyzing brain genes expression with the CAGEscan technique that involves identification of specific transcription factors, cis regulatory motifs and alternate transcriptional start sites

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different types of Honey Bee Apis Mellifera samples (Nurse and Foragers)
