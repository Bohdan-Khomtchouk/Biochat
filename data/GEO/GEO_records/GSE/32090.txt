TITLE
Expression data from BNL CL.2 liver cells when cultured with iron, RAW 264.7 macrophages or both

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We found that co-culturing BNL CL.2 liver cells with RAW 264.7 macrophages increased IRP binding in the first. To further investigate this modulation we investigated the gene expression profile in BNL CL.2 cells cultured alone, with iron, with RAW 264.7 macrophages or in the presence of both iron and macrophages. This novel reconstituted liver cell-macrophage communication pathway with the present gene expression data provides a platform for addressing how macrophages participate in the iron homeostasis of liver cells and, ultimately, in systemic iron homeostasis.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to determine the gene expression modulation in BNL CL.2 cells in response to 24h culture with 100 micromolar ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), co-culture with RAW 264.7 macrophages or both
