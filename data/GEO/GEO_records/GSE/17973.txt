TITLE
Murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes vs. adipocyte-derived microvesicles (ADMs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA profiles of adipocyte-derived microvesicles (ADMs) and their donor 3T3-L1 adipoyctes (Day 11) were compared.  ADMs included RNA without typical 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA.

DESIGN
ADMs  vs. donor 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Biological replicates: 2 ADMs replicates, 2 donor cells.
