TITLE
Retinoids induce rapid dynamic changes in the non-coding RNAs and epigenetic profiles of murine Hox clusters (ChIP-chip)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Physiologically relevant concentrations of retinoic acid are added to Mouse ES cells and a time course (0-72 hours) is examined with tiling array ChIP-chip and RNA-seq to characterize the early dynamics of expression of coding and non-coding RNAs and epigenetics in and around the Hox clusters.

DESIGN
Expression, epigenetics, and RARs are examined at various timepoints (0-24hrs) after retinoic acid induced neuronal differentiation
