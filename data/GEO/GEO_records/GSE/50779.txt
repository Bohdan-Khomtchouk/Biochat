TITLE
Expression data from DCs stimulated with  LPS vs DCs stimulated with PTX

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DCs treated with PTX (PTX-DC) is able to induce EAE like PTX as adjuvant whereas neither LPS nor DCs treated with LPS (LPS-DC) fails to induce EAE. We want to identify genes that are responsible for EAE induction in DCs and genes that are able to toloerize EAE in DCs through the microarray.

DESIGN
Bone marrow derived dendritic cells are either unstimulated or stimulated with LPS and PTX for 24h respectively. Cells are harveseted for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
