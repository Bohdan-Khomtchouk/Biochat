TITLE
Synechocystis PCC6803 time course responses to 50 ÂµM cadmium

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
The transcriptome approach was used to characterize the kinetics (9 time points) of the global change in Synechocystis gene expression in response to continuous exposure to Cd (CdSO4, 50 _M). For each time point, total RNA were isolated from stressed and unstressed cells, reverse-transcribed, differentially labelled (dye swapped), hybridized together (stressed versus unstressed samples) and analyzed with DNA glass microarrays (two slides per each time point), covering 2,845 of the 3,168 ORFs of Synechocystis (Custom-commercial array : IntelliGeneTM CyanoCHIP version 1.2, TAKARA). To identify differentially expressed genes, the median of the normalized ratio of Cy5/Cy3 intensity was calculated for each spot of the replicated dye-swap. The results of the analysis were carefully examined to exclude the dye effect between the 2 Cy-swapped arrays. Keywords: time course, stress responses

DESIGN
We made a kinetic (9 time points) of exposure to cadmium (CdSO4, 50 _M). For each time point, we analyzed 2 arrays (dye swap).
