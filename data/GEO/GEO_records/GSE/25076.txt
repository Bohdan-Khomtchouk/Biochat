TITLE
Hypothalamic expression differences between hypertensive BPH/2J and normotensive BPN/3J mouse strains

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of hypothalamic genes whose expression differs between high blood pressure (BPH/2J) and normal blood pressure (BPN/3J) Schlager mouse strains at age 6 weeks (young) and 26 weeks (mature) using Affymetrix GeneChip® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.

DESIGN
The whole hypothalamus was removed from young (6-week-old) and adult (26-week-old) BPH/2J hypertensive mice and age-matched normotensive BPN/2J mice (n=6/group) at peak of 24 h blood pressure. No pooling was performed. After extraction of RNA, cRNA was prepared and arrays performed using Affymetrix GeneChip® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays at the Ramaciotti Gene Function Analysis facility, University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.
