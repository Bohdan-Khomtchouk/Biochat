TITLE
Genome-wide expression microarray analysis of romidpesin treated GCC cell lines, fibroblasts and Sertoli cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Illumina expression microarray analysis of TCam-2, 2102EP, NCCIT, JAR, MPAF, ARZ and FS1 cells 8 and 16 h after 10 nanomolar romidepsin application. DMSO treated cells were used as controls. These data are part of the article 'A signaling cascade including ARID1A, GADD45B and DUSP1 induces apoptosis and affects the cell cycle of germ cell cancers after romidepsin treatment' (Nettersheim et al., 2016).

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from TCam-2, 2102EP, NCCIT, JAR, MPAF, ARZ and FS1 cells 8 and 16h after Romidepsin treatement. DMSO treated cells served as control.
