TITLE
The gene microarray of digoxin on high-fat diet (HFD) induced changes in liver tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to measure the microarray profiling of digoxin treated group versus vehicle control group in a 12 weeks HFD induced gene changes in liver tissue. The 'WT_LIVER " samples are from mice fed normal chow and not treated with digoxin, and the " HFD-WT " samples are from mice fed a high-fat diet and not treated with digoxin.

DESIGN
Liver tissue mRNA profiles of 12 weeks HFD in C57BL/6 mice were generated by Illumina mouse Ref-8 v2.0 expression BeadChips.

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
