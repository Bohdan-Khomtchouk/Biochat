SUMMARY
Normal gene expression in pancreatic lymph nodes compared to inguinal or mesenteric lymph nodes across different strains of mice (BALB/c, FVB, NOD, NOD.B10).

DESIGN
Lymph nodes were excised from 12 wk old female mice (5 mice per group), and total RNA was extracted for dual dye microarray analysis.
