TITLE
Expression data from differentiating murine embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Various substances have been reported to enhance the cardiac differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Ascorbic Acid had a cardiogenic effect in mESC CGR8 cell line. Transcriptome of AA-treated CGR8 ESCs did not reveal any significant changes in gene expression as compared to untreated cells. We performed a global gene expression analysis to better understand the mechanism of Ascorbic acid-induced cardiac differentiation.

DESIGN
Differentiating murine embryonic stem cells from CGR cell line were selected at stages of Day 0 (undifferentiated cells), Day 2, Day 3 and Day 5 of differentiation for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarray chip. Samples were collected in 3 biological replicate and were either treated with Ascorbic acid or nontreated (control group). Only those samples were processed for further analysis in which we were able to confirm that AA significantly enhanced cardiac differentiation efficiency at later stages (day 8 and 12) of differentiation by assessing the number of beating EBs in control and AA-treated groups. Cardiac efficiency was evaluated later on this study. But samples that were analyzed by microarray analysis was limited till Day 5. We did not perform whole genome study for these later days of differentiation ( day 8 or 12).
