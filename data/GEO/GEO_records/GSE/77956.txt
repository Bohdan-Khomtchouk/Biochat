TITLE
Expression data from NMuMG-mock cells and NMuMG-MAFK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MAFK is one of small Maf transcripton factor famiy molecules. We found MAFK is highly expressed in several cancer cells and related to tumorigenesis. Then, we established MAFK stable cell lines using NMuMG cells (mouse mammary glad epithelium) and used microarrays to examine gene expression alteration.

DESIGN
RNAs from NMuMG-mock cells and MAFK stably expressing cell lines (clones 4 and 10) were hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
