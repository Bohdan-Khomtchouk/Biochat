TITLE
CD95L derived si- and shRNAs kill cancer cells through an RNAi mechanism by targeting survival genes [shL1.RNAseq.lg]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We provide evidence that shRNAs and siRNAs derived from CD95 and CD95L preferentially target the 3' UTRs of survival genes culminating in a very robust mode of cell death we call DISE (Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination)

DESIGN
293T cells were infected with either pTIP-shScr or pTIP-shL1 and following puromycin selection RNA was analyzed by deep sequencing 100hrs after addition of doxycycline

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
