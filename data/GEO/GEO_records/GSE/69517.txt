TITLE
Expression in E. coli of hyper- and hypo-amyloidogenic RepA-WH1 variants

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
RepA-WH1 is a synthetic bacterial prionoid, i.e., a protein that aggregates as amyloid in bacteria leading to cell death The purpose of this approach was to outline the pathways of cytotoxicity linked to RepA-WH1 expression from the set of genes induced/repressed in an Escherichia coli strain with reduced genome (MDS42)
