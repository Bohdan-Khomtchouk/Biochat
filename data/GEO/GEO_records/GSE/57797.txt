TITLE
Expression data from the subclones of Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Medium conditioned by LLC cells stimulates thermogenic gene expression when added onto primary adipocytes. We generated single cell colonies from parental LLC cells. Media conditioned by the subclones stimulated thermogenic gene expression in primary adipocytes at varying degrees. Subclones 2, 3, 6 and 28 produce significantly larger amount of thermogenic activity than the subclones 18, 19, 23 and 24. We compared gene expression profiles of these subclones to identify secreted factors enriched in the more thermogenic clones.

DESIGN
LLC subclones were cultured under conditioned medium preparation conditiones and total RNA was extracted from biological replicates.
