TITLE
Gene Expression analysis of Oral Leukoplakia and Early Stage Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene Expression Profiling of Oral Leukoplakia (OPL) and Early Stage Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) was performed to delineate candidate gene/s clusters with potential to distinguish normal, OPL and tumor tissue from Gingivobuccal complex. All tissue samples were collected after obtaining written informed consent. The RNA profile of 15 OPL and 34 OSCC samples was compared with 1 independent controls Gingivobuccal complex tissue from healthy donors.
