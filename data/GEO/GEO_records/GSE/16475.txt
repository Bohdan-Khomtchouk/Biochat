TITLE
Expression data from side population subfraction hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The traditional view of hematopoiesis has been that all the cells of the peripheral blood are the progeny of a unitary homogeneous pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).  Recent evidence suggests that the hematopoietic system is actually maintained by a consortium of HSC subtypes with distinct functional characteristics.  We show here that myeloid-biased HSCs (My-HSCs) and lymphoid-biased (Ly-HSCs) can be purified according to their capacity for Hoechst dye efflux in combination with canonical HSC markers. We used microarray expression profiling to determine the transcriptional profiles of myeloid-biased lower-SP HSCs and lymphoid-biased upper-SP HSCs

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were analyzed for each HSC subpopulation.  Lower-SP and upper-SP HSCs were purified from three pools of mice on separate days.  HSCs were further purified with the addition of canonical HSC makers; Sca-1+ c-Kit+ Lineage-
