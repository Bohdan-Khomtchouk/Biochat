TITLE
Gene expression in the embryonic endolymphatic sac of E13.5, E14.5, E16.5 and E17.5 Slc26a4Δ/+ and Slc26a4Δ/Δ mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression was analyzed in endolymphatic sacs of two groups of mice: Slc26a4Δ/Δ and Slc26a4Δ/+ mice.  Slc26a4Δ/Δ mice fail to develop hearing and are a model for Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct and Pendred Syndrome, two forms of human deafness that are associated with mutations of SLC26A4.  Slc26a4Δ/+ mice develop normal hearing and served a controls. Gene expression was performed at embryonic day (E) 13.5, E14.5, E16.5 and E17.5, which are pathobiologically relevant time points that mark growth and enlargement of the entire inner ear including the cochlea and the vestibular aqueduct. Affymetrix microarrays were used to analyze gene expression and developmental changes in gene expression in Slc26a4Δ/Δ and Slc26a4Δ/+ mice with the goal to identify genes that are in a functional relationship with Slc26a4, the gene that codes for pendrin.

DESIGN
Endolymphatic sacs free of connective tissue and free of endolymphatic ducts were obtained by manual micro-dissection from Slc26a4Δ/+ and Slc26a4Δ/Δ mice at embryonic day (E) 13.5, E14.5, E16.5 and E17.5. Labelled fragments were analyzed following manufacturers procedures (Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip arrays).    2.0 GeneChip arrays).
