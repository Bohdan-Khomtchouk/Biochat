TITLE
Expression data in T-ALL cell lines after TOX knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
T-ALL is an aggressive malignancy of thymocyte. We identified a collaborative oncogenic driver, TOX (Thymocyte Selection Associated HMG box) that negatively modulates the non-homologous end joining by directly interacting to KU70/KU80.

DESIGN
CCRF-CEM and HPB-ALL T-ALL cell lines were transduced with shRNA against TOX (2 different shRNA) or scramble shRNA. Also untransduced T-ALL cells were used as controls.
