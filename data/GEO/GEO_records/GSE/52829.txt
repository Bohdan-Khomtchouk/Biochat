TITLE
The Transcriptomic Regulation of Berry Development is More Important at Night than During the Day

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
In order to circumvent environmental changes throughout fruit development, young and ripening berries were sampled simultaneously on continuously flowering microvines acclimated to controlled circadian light and temperature changes.     Gene expression profiles along fruit development were monitored during both day and night with whole genome microarray NimbelgenÂ® vitis 12x, yielding a total number of 9273 developmentally modulated probesets. All day-detected transcripts were modulated at night, whereas 1755 genes were night-specific. Very similar developmental patterns of gene expression were observed upon independent hierarchical clustering of day and night data, whereas functional categories of allocated transcripts varied according to time of the day. Many transcripts within pathways, known to be upregulated during ripening, in particular those linked to secondary metabolism exhibited a clearer developmental regulation at night than during the day. Functional enrichment analysis also indicated that diurnally modulated genes considerably varied during fruit development, with a shift from cellular organization and photosynthesis in green berries to secondary metabolism and stress-related genes in ripening ones. These results reveal critical changes in gene expression during night development that differ from day development which have not been observed in other transcriptomic studies on fruit development so far.

DESIGN
A total of 24 samples were analyzed representing four berry developmental stages (two during green development, two during ripening). Sample were drawn simultaneously in triplicates at day and night on the microvine dwarf (DRCF) GAI mutant.
