TITLE
Expression Data from murine control and IL6ralpha-deficient macrophages stimulated with Interleukin-6

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL-6 induces IL4ralpha expression in macrophages. This mechanism is necessary to promote macrophage polarization towards an M2-phenotype and is crucial to limit the inflammatory response both upon obesity and LPS-endotoxemia. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages from control and IL6ralpha-deficient macrophages (n=4vs4) stimulated with interleukin-6 (IL-6)

DESIGN
8 samples were analyzed to compare control and IL6ralpha-deficient macrophages for their gene expression profiles upon stimulation with IL-6
