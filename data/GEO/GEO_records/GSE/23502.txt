TITLE
Differentially expressed genes of CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differentially expressed genes of CD11b+Gr-1+ immature myeloid cells (IMCs) in the bone marrow and colonic tumor setting of histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-KO mice were examined by microarray (Affymetrix Mouse 430.2 array). Myeloid differentiation-related candidate genes were sought to be isolated and functionally studied.
