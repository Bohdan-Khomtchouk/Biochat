TITLE
Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV and HCV coinfected patients before and after 24 weeks of combined antiretroviral therapy.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aim to characterize HIV and HCV coinfected patient response to combined antiretroviral therapy through genome-wide expression profiling of patients' periperhal blood mononuclear cells before and after treatment initiation (baseline and 24 weeks).  Individuals with frank cirrhosis were excluded from the study. We used Affymetrix PrimeView arrays to quantify baseline transcriptomic characteristics and changes in the transcriptome following treatment.  Gene expression changes were analyzed based on the change in expression of each transcript per patient.

DESIGN
Mononuclear cells were purified from peripheral blood samples of 8 patients with HIV and HCV coinfection at baseline and after 24 weeks of combined antiretroviral therapy. Genes from whole blood RNA was measured via Affymetrix PrimeView microarrays.
