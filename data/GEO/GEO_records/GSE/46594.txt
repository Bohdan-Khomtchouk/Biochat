TITLE
The self-renewal of gastric cancer stem cells is regulated by a specific collaboration between the microenvironment and the genetic condition.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Because cancer stem cells already had genetic and epigenetic alterations which can affect the self-renewal, we tried to characterize genetic and epigenetic changes of the gastric cancer stem cells. To do this, we performed SNP array, MBD sequencing and RNA sequencing.

DESIGN
copy number alteration profiles of Normal tissue and gastric cancer stem cell were generated by SNP6.0 Array, in three patients(csc1,csc2,csc3).

PLATFORM
GPL6801 [GenomeWideSNP_6] Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array
