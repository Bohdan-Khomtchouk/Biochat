TITLE
Expression data from Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) exposed to WT and V30M transthyretin (TTR)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The biological effects of TTR proteins in the vasculature remain unknown. We used microarrays to detail the modulation of gene expression on HUVECs by V30M TTR when compared to cells exposed to WT TTR.

DESIGN
HUVECs (passage 7) were cultured in the presence of WT or V30M TTR at 4ÂµM for 3 hours. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain differentially expressed genes modulated by V30M TTR protein.
