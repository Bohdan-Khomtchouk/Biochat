TITLE
V. vinifera 'Cabernet sauvignon' and V. aestivalis 'Norton' innoculated with Erysiphe necator conidiospores

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
we analyzed pathogen-induced changes in the transcriptome of Vitis vinifera ‘Cabernet sauvignon’ and Vitis aestivalis ‘Norton’ by conducting a large-scale study to measure transcript abundance at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours post-treatment in conidiospore- and mock-inoculated leaves using Affymetrix GeneChip Vitis vinifera Genome Array Keywords: time course
