TITLE
Expression profile of HCT116 p53+/+ and P53-/- cells treated with Leptomycin B

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HCT116 wild type cells express p53. The isogenic HCT116 p53KO cells have the p53 gene knocked out. Cells were treated for 16 hours. Dosages for leptomycin B treatment was 2 nM and 20 nM.

DESIGN
Measuring the gene expression profile of the isogenic cell lines when the cells were treated with leptomycin B at different concentrations
