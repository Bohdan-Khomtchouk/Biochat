TITLE
RNA-Seq comparisons of gene expression profiles of epithelial and mesenchymal cells - HMLE, N8, N8-CTx

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We find that treating mesenchymal NAMEC8 cells with cholera toxin (CTx) to elevate intracellular cAMP levels and activate PKA induces a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition whereby the cells assume an epithelial state (N8-CTx). NAMEC8 cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming triggered by active PHF2, a histone demethylase, which demethylates H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 regions of epithelial genes silencing in the mesenchymal state

DESIGN
Performing RNASeq with HMLE (immortalized human mammary epithelial cells), their mesenchymal CD44hi counterparts, NAMEC8 and the CTx-reverted versions of NAMEC8 a.k.a N8-CTx

PLATFORM
