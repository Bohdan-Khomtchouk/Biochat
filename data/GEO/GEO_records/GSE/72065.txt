TITLE
Transfer RNA (tRNA) processing and RNA m5C-methylation profiles of mouse skin squamous tumours

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: High-throughput RNA sequencing has accelerated discovery of the complex regulatory roles of small RNAs, such those derived from tRNAs. Also recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing has revealed the complex RNA modification landscape and the complex role these nucleosides modifactions have in cell signalling, stem cell biology, development and cancer. The goal of this study is to establish how m5C-tRNA methylation and tRNA-derived small RNAs can affect stem cell fucntion in cancer. Methods: four replicates of  tRNAs and RNA buisulphite sequencing of wild-type (WT) and NSun2 -/- mouse skin squamous tumours were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq platform. Results: Our analyses reveal that inhibition of post-transcriptional cytosine-5 methylation locks stem cells in this distinct translational inhibition programme that results in tumour progression but that also sentizes cancer cells to genotoxic stress.
