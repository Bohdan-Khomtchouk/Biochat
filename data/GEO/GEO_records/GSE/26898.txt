TITLE
Evidence for Zoonotic Transmission of a Novel Adenovirus Associated with a Fulminant Pneumonia Outbreak in a Titi Monkey Colony

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Plecturocebus cupreus

SUMMARY
We used the Virochip microarray to detect and discover a novel adenovirus, TMAdV (titi monkey adenovirus).  We used custom-commercial microarrays from Agilent Technologies.  The microarray platform GPL11662 consists of 62,976 probes, of which 19,058 probes are 70-mer viral oligonucleotides (the union of the V3 and V4 platforms -- please see Wang, et al., PNAS, 2002; Chiu, et al., Clin Infect Dis, 2006; Chiu, et al., PNAS, 2008).

DESIGN
For this study, 4 experimental Virochip microarrays derived from tissue and swabs from affected titi monkeys were analyzed.  We also used 18 Virochip microarrays derived from sera from healthy random human blood donors as a negative background set for Z-score analysis (see Chiu, et al., Clin Infect Dis, 2006).  Raw Agilent microarray .txt files are background normalized and the 19,058 70-mer viral probes are then selected and displayed as columns in the processed data table.
