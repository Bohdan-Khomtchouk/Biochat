TITLE
Gene expression profiling of brains from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-infected cynomolgus macaques

ORGANISM
Macaca fascicularis

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression profiling of total RNA from brain samples derived from BSE-infected versus non-infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis).

DESIGN
Total RNA from brain samples derived from 7 BSE-infected (6 intracerebrally, 1 orally infected) versus 5 non-infected controls were compared using GeneChip Rhesus macaque Genome Array.
