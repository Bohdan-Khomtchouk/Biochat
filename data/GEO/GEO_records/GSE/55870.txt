TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblast (CAF) compared to Normal Fibroblast (NF) [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of differentially expressed genes in CAF associated with PDAC vs NF. Genetically engineered mice with spontaneous pancreas cancer were generated. Their genotype is Ptfa-cre/+:LSL KrasG12D/+;Tgfrb2flox/flox. Cancer associated fibroblasts were expanded in vitro from the tumors of these mice (CAF). Normal fibroblasts (NF) were also expanded from normal pancreas of mice. The experiement consists in comparing the expression profile of CAF vs. NF.

DESIGN
Expanded cultures of fibroblasts in vitro from pancreas tumor and normal pancreas tissue were lyzed in TRIzol and RNA extracted from them.
