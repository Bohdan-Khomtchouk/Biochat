TITLE
Expression data of WHV/c-myc transgenic mice at preneoplastic and neoplastic stages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The WHV/c-myc transgenic mouse is an animal model of hepatocarcinogenesis that can exquisitely mimic the cancer staging in human Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in which the c-myc oncogene is activated by adjacent woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) DNA sequences. Compared to other models of c-myc transgenic mice, WHV/c-myc mice stably develop HCC with a relatively short latent period of 8 to 12 months, with a high (near 100%) tumor incidence. The aim of this study was to discover new HCC biomarkers and analyze expression patterns of selected candidate biomarkers prior to liver tumor onset by employing WHV/c-myc transgenic mice.

DESIGN
Using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Expression Arrays, we studied hepatic gene expression profiles of WHV/c-myc transgenic mice at 5 months and 11 months, age-matched wild-type C57/BL6 mice were used as controls. At 5 months, the livers of transgenic mice exhibited mild to moderate hepatocyte dysplasia, this time point represents the preneoplastic stage. At 11 months, the tumors were visualized in WHV/c-myc transgenic mice and consisted mainly of well-differentiated, trabecular-type HCCs, and this time point was considered as neoplastic stage.
