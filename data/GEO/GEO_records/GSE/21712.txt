TITLE
Transcriptome profiling analysis of bacterial challenged Lateolabrax japonicus reveals deep insight into the immune-relevant genes in marine fish (DGE)

ORGANISM
Lateolabrax japonicus

SUMMARY
We report the application of Solexa/Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) sequencing approaches to investigate inactivated Vibrio harveyi--induced transcriptome changes in Lateolabrax japonicas, a non model vertebrate species. Totally 3.44 and 3.22 million raw tags were measured. Then, gene annotation was performed by tags mapping analysis and the 169,950 non-redundant consensus sequences from RNA-seq based transcriptome analysis were used as reference transcript database. Tag mapping indicated that Vibrio harveyi--challenged adult Lateolabrax japonicas express over 70% of all genes represented in transcript databases. Meanwhile, totally 1224 consensus sequences exhibited significant difference after the bacterial challenge, in which 1183 transcripts can be well annotated, while approximately 41 transcripts have low sequence homology to the existing known sequences in public databases, suggesting that they might be putative novel immune-relevant genes in Lateolabrax japonicus closely related to the immunity for bacterial challenge. Our present study would greatly benefit to give deep insight into the immunogenetics in fish species, and clinical application in fish diseases.

DESIGN
Examination of differentially expressed transcripts in baterial- and mock challenged fish.
