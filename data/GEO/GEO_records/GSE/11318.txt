TITLE
Molecular subtypes of DLBCL have distinct chromosomal aberrations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression profiling in 203 samples of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). By gene expression, at least three molecular subtypes of DLBCL termed as germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL, activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL, and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBL) can be distinguished. Combining gene expression profiling and aCGH, revealed copy number abnormalities that had strikingly different frequencies in the three molecular DLBCL subtypes. These data provide genetic evidence that the DLBCL subtypes are distinct diseases that utilize different oncogenic pathways. Keywords: clinical history design

DESIGN
The retrospective study included RNA and DNA extracted from 203 clinical samples.
