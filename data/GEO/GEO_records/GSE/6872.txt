TITLE
Spermatozoal RNA Profiles (U133 Plus 2.0 Array)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Normal human spermatogenesis concludes with the formation of large numbers of  morphologically well developed spermatozoa.  While transcriptionally quiescent these cells carry  an RNA payload that reflects the final spermiogenic phase of transcription. We report here the spermatozoal  transcript profiles characteristic of normally fertile individuals and infertile males suffering from a  consistent and severe teratozoospermia in which under 4% of spermatozoa are morphologically normal.  RNA was  extracted from the purified sperm cells of ejaculate and hybridized to Affymetrix U133 (v2) Microarrays. Keywords: disease state analysis
