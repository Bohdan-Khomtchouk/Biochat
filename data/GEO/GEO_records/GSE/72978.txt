TITLE
Genome-wide ParB2-DNA and RctB-DNA interaction analyses in Vibrio cholerae

ORGANISM
Vibrio cholerae

SUMMARY
Replication and segregation are the two main processes that maintain chromosomes in growing cells. In bacteria, replication and transcription have been proposed to provide motive force in chromosome segregation.  Recently, ParB2, a segregation protein, encoded by V. cholerae chromosome II (chrII) was also found to influence chrII replication. V. cholerae chrII replication is primarily controlled by its specific initiator protein, RctB. Here, we have screened for ParB2 and RctB binding sites using a genome-wide DNA binding analysis (ChIP-chip). We report the identification of a new region containing additional RctB and ParB2 binding sites, and suggest the mechanisms to coordinate replication initiation with segregation of chromosomes.
