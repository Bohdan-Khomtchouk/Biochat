TITLE
Expression data from neonatal mice cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
FGF21 belongs to the FGF superfamily and the highest expression of the FGF21 transcript was found in the liver. The initial studies identified FGF21 as an endocrine hepatokine with crucial roles in regulating lipid, glucose and energy metabolism. More recent studies have indicated a role for FGF21 in cardiovascular stress and diseases.The goal of our study is to analyze the effect of FGF21 on ischemic cardiomyocytes transcriptome using microarray.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from cultured neonatal mice cardiomyocytes after exposure to hypoxia (in 2% oxygen, 5% CO2 and 93% N2) for 12 h in the absence or presence of FGF21. Samples were processed for hybridization to the Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array (Affymetrix). We sought to find out the differentially expressed genes regulated by FGF21 in hypoxic cardiomyocytes.
