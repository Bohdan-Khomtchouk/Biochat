TITLE
PC-3 cells: siControl vs. siRNA ARHGAP21

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the prostate adenocarcinoma cell line PC-3 comparing control cells transfected with a pool of oligonucleotides control (siControl) with cells transfected a pool of oligonucleotides specific to inhibit ARHGAP21 expression (siARHGAP21). The efficiency of the transfection was checked with quantitative PCR and western blotting. Goal was to determine the effects of ARHGAP21 silencing on global PC-3 gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, siControl vs. siARHGAP21 PC-3 cells with three biological samples of PC3 cells transfected with a pool of oligonucleotides control (siControl 1, 2 and 3) and three biological samples of PC3 cells transfected with a pool of oligonucleotides specific to inhibit ARHGAP21 (siARHGAP21 1, 2 and 3). For each sample (three siControl and three siARHGAP21), two technical replicates were performed (labelled with Cy3 or Cy5).
