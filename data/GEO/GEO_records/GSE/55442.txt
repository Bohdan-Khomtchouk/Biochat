TITLE
Comparison of class-B GATA overexpression transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We have used Agilent whole genome arrays (v4) to compare the gene expression changes between 10-day-old Arabidopsis wild type seedlings and AtGNLox (AT4G26150), AtGNCox (AT5G56860), AtGATA17ox (AT3G16870), BdGATA6ox (BRADI3G08240) as well as the C-terminal mutation constructs AtGNL_LLM/AAAox and AtGNC_LLM/AAAox. Three independent biological samples were prepared for each genotype.

DESIGN
Three replicate measurements of three biological samples were prepared for each genotype (1-3 or A-C). The experiment was performed in two batches; samples with replicate numbers 1-3 and A-C were prepared and hybridzed in the same respective batch.
