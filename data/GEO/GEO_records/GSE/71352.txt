TITLE
The Jejunum Mucosa of Female Black-boned Chickens: Control vs. Heat-stressed Treatment

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of the jejunum mucosa with 1.5 fold-change reporter genes in comparing control black-boned chickens under normal temperature (NT) conditon with heat-stress treated black-boned chickens under high temperature (HT) condition. Goal was to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in co-family black-boned chickens exposure to heat stress based on global chicken gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, HT vs. NT Treatment.  Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 heat stressed replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL15357 Agilent-026441 Gallus gallus (Chicken) Oligo Microarray v2 (Probe Name version)
