TITLE
Leptosphaeria maculans gene expression during in vitro growth after silencing of DIM5 or HP1, two genes involved in chromatin remodelling

ORGANISM
Leptosphaeria maculans

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of Leptosphaeria maculans was analysed in mycelium of the wild type isolate v23.1.3 or in transformants silenced for DIM5 or HP1, two genes encoding enzymes involved in chromatin remodelling. The array probes were designed from gene models from the L. maculans whole genome annotation. The aim of this study was to characterise the effect of chromatin remodelling on gene expression during in vitro growth.

DESIGN
We performed 9 hybridizations (NimbleGen) with samples derived from mycelium of a wild type isolate, v23.1.3, of a transformant silenced for HP1 and for a transformant silenced for DIM5. Three replicates each. All samples were labeled with Cy3.
