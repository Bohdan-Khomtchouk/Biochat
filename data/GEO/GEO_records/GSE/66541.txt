TITLE
Expression data from β-globin let7 HeLa tet off cells treated with doxycycline

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarray to determine the genes whose expression was changed at six hours after doxycycline treatment

DESIGN
Cells were transfected with β-globin let7 wt constructs. Two-condition experiment; HeLa tet off cells overexpressed control vs HeLa tet off cells treated with doxycycline for six hours

PLATFORM
GPL13915 3D-Gene Human Oligo chip 25k V2.1
