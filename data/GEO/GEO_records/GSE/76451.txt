TITLE
SOX9 Drives WNT Pathway Activation in Prostate Cancer [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SOX9 is critical for prostate development and is implicated in prostate cancer, we used SOX9 ChIP-seq in combination with transcriptome profiling to identify genes and pathways it regulates in normal or neoplastic epithelium.

DESIGN
Chromatin was immunoprecipitated by SOX9 antibody in the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive prostate cancer cell line VCaP with high basal SOX9 expression and submitted for high throughput sequencing in parallel with input control.
