TITLE
Expression data from E12.5 ePet-EYFP rostral and caudal serotonin (5HT) neurons purified by flow cytometry

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The 5HT system is organized into rostral and caudal populations with discrete anatomical locations and opposite axonal trajectories in the developing hindbrain. 5HT neuron cell bodies in the rostral subdivision migrate to the midbrain and pons and extend ascending projections throughout the forebrain.  5HT cell bodies in the caudal subdivision migrate to the ventral medulla and caudal half of the pons and provide descending projections to the brainstem and spinal cord.
