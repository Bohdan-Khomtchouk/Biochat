TITLE
Allergen induced gene expression of airway epithelial cells shows a possible role for TNF-Î±

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Response to allergen was studied in bronchial epithelial cell line H292. Cells were cultured and subsequently exposed to House dust mite or vessel (saline) Microarray data was analysed using bioinformatics and biostastics. We find a strong response to allergen in epithelial cells Keywords: cellular response to allergen

DESIGN
Bronchial epithelial cell line was cultured and stimulated with house dust mite extract or diluent alone. Both conditions were performed in triplicate
