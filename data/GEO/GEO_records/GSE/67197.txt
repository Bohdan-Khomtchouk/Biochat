TITLE
Transcriptomes of Two Esca Relevant Fungi, Phaeoacremonium aleophilum and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Respond Very Differently to Co-cultured Vitis callus Culture

ORGANISM
Phaeomoniella chlamydospora

SUMMARY
In order to understand how P.al and P.ch respond to the environment set by V. vinifera we analyzed the transcriptomes of two fungi in axenic or mixed cultures with V. vinifera plant cells (callus culture). We could observe that these fungi respond with different strategies to the plant cell challange where P.ch induces de-toxification and translation machinery genes and P.al alters primary metabolism and induces heat shock related genes.

DESIGN
Two fungal strains where co-inoculated with V. vinivera callus, each experiment was repeated
