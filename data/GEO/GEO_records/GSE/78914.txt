TITLE
Expression data from human bronchial epithelial cells (treatment with IL-4)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH) is a feature of respiratory diseases characterized by mucus hypersecretion. GCH is driven by Th2 cytokines such as IL-4. To investigate the gene expression changes associated with GCH, we treated human bronchial epithelial cells with IL-4. By microarray analysis and functional studies, we found that IL-4 promotes a profound change that results in enhanced bicarbonate secretion.  This change may be required to support mucus release.

DESIGN
Human bronchial epithelial cells were differentiated as epithelial monolayers on porous membranes (Snapwell inserts).  After treatment with IL-4, gene expression changes were determined with microarrays.  In parallel, ion transport, mucus release, intracellular pH, and apical fluid composition were measured.
