TITLE
Transcriptome Analysis of Wounding-Induced Root to Shoot Communication in Arabidopsis thaliana.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Comparison of gene expression between shoots of root-wounded seedlings and shoots of control seedlings in Arabidopsis. We identified wounding-induced early (30 min) and late (360 min) root to shoot responsive genes (RtS).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, shoots of root-wounded seedlings vs. shoots of control seedlings. Biological replicates: 2 control replicates, 2 treated replicates. Technical replicate: Dyeswap

PLATFORM
GPL888 Agilent-011839 Arabidopsis 2 Oligo Microarray G4136A (Feature Number version)
