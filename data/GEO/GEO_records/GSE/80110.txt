TITLE
A. lyrata ssp. lyrata transcriptomic responses against drought stress

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata

SUMMARY
Using A. lyrata microarray platform the transcriptomic response of shoot tissues was characterized at two different time points- 8d and 11d after withdrawal of regular water application..

DESIGN
Five weeks old Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. lyrata plants were stopped watering for the treatment groups, while the control group was watered on regular intervals. Samples for early time points were harvested at 8 days after drought treatment began, while samples for late time-point was harvested after 11 days.

PLATFORM
GPL21706 Agilent-030951 A. lyrata 8X60 {Probe Name version]
