TITLE
Gene Expression Analysis in an Animal Model of Cortical Dysplasia-CONTROL GROUP

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cortical Dysplasia (CD) is the histopathological substrate in almost half of all drug-resistant epilepsy. Little is known about the gene expression profile of CD. As such information may help target therapeutics more effectively, our aim was to perform a gene expression analysis of an animal model of cortical dysplasia induced by in utero irradiation. THIS SERIES (GSE13676) INCLUDES ALL (AND ONLY) CONTROL SAMPLES (9).
