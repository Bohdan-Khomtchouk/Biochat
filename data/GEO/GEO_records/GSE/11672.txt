TITLE
Genomic location data for ectopic p73 in H1299 lung carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The integral role of p53 in tumor suppression has promted many laboratories to perform extensive analyses of signaling pathways downstream of the p53 family of sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors (p53 and its homologs p63 and p73).  Despite the ability of p73 to regulate many p53 family target genes, little is known about the specific pathways that modulate p73 during development, tumorigenesis and tumor therapy.  In this study we present a gene signature-based approach for connecting signaling pathways to transcription factors, as exemplified by p73.  We generated a p73 gene signature by integrating whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling. Keywords: Transcription factor analysis

DESIGN
H1299 lung carcinoma cells were transduced with TAp73beta or GFP expressing adenoviruses.  Microarray analysis (on the GFP and TAp73beta samples) and ChIPSeq analysis (on the TAp73beta sample) were performed to identify candidate p73 target genes.
