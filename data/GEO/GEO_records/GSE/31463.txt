TITLE
Differential expression analysis between litR (TTHB100) deletion mutant and wild-type of Thermus thermophilus HB8 under the dark condition.

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of litR (TTHB100) deletion mutant of T. thermophilus HB8 strain grown in a rich (TM) medium at 60 °C under the dark condition compared with that of wild-type.

DESIGN
Three wild-type strain of T. thermophilus HB8 were pre-cultured at 60 °C for 16 hours in 100 mL of TM medium containing 0.8% polypeptone, 0.4% yeast extract, 0.2% NaCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, and 0.4 mM MgCl2, which was adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH. The cells (1 mL) were inoculated into 100 mL of the synthetic medium and then cultivated at 60°C for 8 hours under dark condition. Then the 1.0 mM of ZnSO4 was added into the medium, and continued cultivation. Cells were collected, and then, the expression of each mRNA was analyzed.
