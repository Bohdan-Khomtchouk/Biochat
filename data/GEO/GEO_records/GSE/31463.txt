TITLE
Differential expression analysis between litR (TTHB100) deletion mutant and wild-type of Thermus thermophilus HB8 under the dark condition.

ORGANISM
Thermus thermophilus HB8

SUMMARY
We observed the expression profile of the total mRNA of litR (TTHB100) deletion mutant of T. thermophilus HB8 strain grown in a rich (TM) medium at 60 Â°C under the dark condition compared with that of wild-type.
