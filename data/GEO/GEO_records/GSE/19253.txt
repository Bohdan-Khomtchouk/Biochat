TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by NMD in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD) is a quality control mechanism that detects and degrades mRNAs that contain premature translation termination codons (PTCs), thus preventing the production of potentially harmful truncated proteins. NMD has been studied in a number of organisms including humans, yeast, Drosophila, C. elegans and recently Arabidopsis. Recently the NMD process has been shown to have a wider significance in regulating the levels of mRNA expression for a wide range of genes in yeast and Drosophila. Several genes have been found to be required for NMD in a variety of organisms, including UPF1 and UPF3. We have identified and characterised a number of alleles of UPF1 and UPF3 in Arabidopsis that are defective in NMD. By doing a transcriptomic analysis of two NMD mutants, upf1-1 and upf3-1, and wild type plants we aim to identify the subset of genes that are co-regulated by UPF1 and UPF3 and, therefore, by NMD in Arabidopsis. RNA will be extracted from 17-day-old mutant and wild type seedlings grown at 22-24 C under constant light.
