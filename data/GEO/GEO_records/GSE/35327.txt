TITLE
Array-based DNA-methylation profiling of fetal tissues obtained by routine invasive prenatal testing (chorionic and amniotic samples)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of fetal DNA-methylation levels in 47 chorionic villi (CVS) and 16 amniotic cell (AC) samples. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to determine DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,578 CpGs in fetal samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 61 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip (2 sample in duplicate pairs)
