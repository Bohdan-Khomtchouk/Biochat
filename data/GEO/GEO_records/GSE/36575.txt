TITLE
Effect of NPAP1/C15orf2 overexpression on transcriptome of HEK293 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To gain insight into the function of Nuclear pore associated protein 1 (NPAP1, formerly C15orf2), we overexpressed NPAP1 in HEK293 cells. We detected no significant difference between NPAP1-expression of induced and uninduced cells in three technical replicates, exept for an approximately 10-fold increase in the NPAP1 transcript itself. This indicates that overexpression of NPAP1 does not change mRNA expression profiles of HEK293 cells. We used microarrays to investigate global gene expression changes depending on the level of NPAP1/C15orf2

DESIGN
We compared NPAP1 overexpressing cells to untreated cells, which do not express detectable amounts of NPAP1 protein, to determine global gene expression changes.
