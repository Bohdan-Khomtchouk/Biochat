TITLE
A Gpr120 Selective Agonist Improves Insulin Resistance and Chronic Inflammation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that a high affinity, selective, small molecule Gpr120 agonist (cpdA), exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages in vitro, and in obese mice in vivo. Gpr120 agonist treatment of high fat diet (HFD)/obese mice causes improved glucose tolerance, decreased hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin sensitivity and decreased hepatic steatosis. This suggests that Gpr120 agonists could become new insulin sensitizing drugs for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and other human insulin resistant states in the future.

DESIGN
Examination of effects of DHA and compound A on primary macrophages stimulated by LPS, 3 replicates for each condition
