TITLE
Gene expression of flower buds between rdr6-15 and wild-type under drought stress condition

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand ta-siRNA-mediated regulation network in response to abiotic stress during flower development, gene expression profiles of flowering buds between rdr6-15 and wild-type under moderate drought stress and control condition were measured using microarray. 512 genes were bilaterally regulated by drought stress signal and RDR6-mediated signal.

DESIGN
rdr6-15 and wild-type plants (Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia) were grown on 30g of vermiculite soil of plastic pot for 2 weeks. Then, water depletion (drought stress treatment) was applied for 1 week. Water content of the soil was decreased to less than 20%. 10 flower buds were collected for each experiment. The experiment was repeated 3-times.
