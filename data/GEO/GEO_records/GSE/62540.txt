SUMMARY
Characterization of the selectivity of SMN splicing modifiers in SMA type I fibroblasts by RNASeq

DESIGN
In total 12 samples were analyzed, divided into four distinct groups (treated with SMN-C3 @ 500 nM; controls for SMN-C3; treated with SMN-C1 @ 100 nM; controls for SMN-C1) containing 3 replicates each.

PLATFORM
