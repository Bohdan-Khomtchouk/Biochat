TITLE
Bj Paraquat prolonged exposure vs. non-treatment

ORGANISM
Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110

SUMMARY
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of cells exposed to 0.1 mM paraquat from time of inoculation.

DESIGN
Three independent biological materials were prepared for cells exposed to 0.1 mM  paraquat during growth and non-treated cells. A total 6 arrays which includes dye swap were analyzed.

PLATFORM
