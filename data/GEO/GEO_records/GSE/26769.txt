TITLE
miRNA expression in Tregs from HSCT patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to identify the miRNA expression profile of CD4+CD25high Tregs in SCT patients with and without GvHD early and late after transplantation compared to healthy donors.

DESIGN
pool of n = 3 patients without GvHD early ( < d100) and late ( > d100) after SCT, n=3 patients with GvHD early ( < d100) and late ( > d100) after SCT and n = 3 sex- and age matched healthy donors for every timepoint
