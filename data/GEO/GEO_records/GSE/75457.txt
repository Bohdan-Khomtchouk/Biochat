TITLE
Addressing bias in small RNA library preparation for sequencing: a new protocol recovers microRNAs that evade capture by current methods

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed deep sequencing of small RNA from mouse insulinoma (MIN6) cells or mouse liver using different library prepartion methods.

DESIGN
Libraries were preapred using MIN6 or Mouse Liver total RNA using (1) Illumina v1.5 small RNA library prep kit, (2) Illumina TruSeq kit, or (3) Bioo Scientific NEXTFlexV2

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus) GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
