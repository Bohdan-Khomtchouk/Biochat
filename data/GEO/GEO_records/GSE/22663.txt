TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of signal transduction-related genes in experimental models of HER-2/neu-derived epithelial and mesenchymal tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional expression of a restricted set of cancer signal transduction-related gesen were comparatively quantified in HER2/neu transgenic mammary tumors, mesenchymal and epithelial tumor cell lineages, both estabilished from HER-2/neu transgenic tumors, and syngeneic mesenchymal stem cells.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, HER-2/neu transgenic mouse mammary tumors, previously described (Galie et al Carcinogenesis 2005 26(11):1868) mesenchymal (A17) and epithelial (BB1) cell lineages estabilished from murine HER-2/neu transgenic mammary tumors, and syngeneic mesenchymal stem cells, underwent transcriptional analysis using microarrays containing probes for 112 signal transduction-related genes and controls (GEArray Q Series Mouse Signal Transduction in Cancer Gene Array, MM-044, Superarray, Friederick, MD, USA).
