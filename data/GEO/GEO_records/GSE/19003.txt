TITLE
Seeking novel mammalian genes using transcript profiling and genotyping of a human radiation hybrid panel

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Cricetulus griseus

SUMMARY
Using a human-hamster radiation hybrid panel (G3), we have mapped loci regulating gene expression due to copy number increase.

DESIGN
Copy number from radiation hybrid clones were measured relative to the A23 hamster recipient line. Expression from 79 radiation hybrid clones were measured in duplicate and compared to expression of the A23 hamster recipient line (GA_illumina_expression1 and GA_illumina_expression2). Expression of liver, kidney and heart from human and hamster are also included (GA_illumina_expression_R).
