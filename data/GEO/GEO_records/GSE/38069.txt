TITLE
Gene expression data from teratomas formed by human iPSCs (chiPS) in SCID (Severe combined immunodeficiency) mice and humanized SCID mice (HuSCID)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human fetal liver fibroblast were reprogrammed to chiPS without exogenous DNA integration using a single episomal vector. The chiPS were then transplanted into SCID mice and HuSCID to form teratomas. We used microarrays to profile the gene expression differences between the teratomas formed by chiPS in SCID and HuSCID mice.

DESIGN
Pooled total RNA from two teratomas formed by chiPS in SCID and HuSCID mice respectively were used for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
