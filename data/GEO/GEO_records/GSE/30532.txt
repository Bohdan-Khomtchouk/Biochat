TITLE
Liver-protecting Effect of Maple Syrup

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rats fed a 20%-maple syrup diet (maple syrup group) for 11 days showed significantly lower values of the hepatic function markers than those fed a 20%-sugar mix syrup diet (control) likewise. One reasons was suggested by DNA microarray analysis which revealed that the expression of genes for enzymes of ammonia production were down-regulated in the liver of maple syrup group.

DESIGN
Rats were quarantined and conditioned by administration of the authentic AIN93G diet for 4 days. Rats had free access to the diet and drinking water during this preliminary feeding. For feeding tests, they were dichotomized (n = 7 and 8) for maple syrup and sugar mix syrup group, respectively, and then fed for 11 days on either the AIN93G diet containing 20% maple syrup or on the 20% sugar mix syrup with a similar sugar composition; the amount of maple syrup or the sugar mix syrup was arranged. Rats in both diet groups were fasted for 16 hours, prior to being anesthetically sacrificed for dissection.
