TITLE
LncRNA and mRNA expression profiles from human GES-1 cells in response to Helicobacter pylori infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Research on lncRNAs expression profiles in human interactions with Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) is rare reported. We used HTA2.0 to investigate the expression changes of lncRNAs and mRNAs in human gastric epithelial cells (GES-1 cell line) infected with or without H.pylori infection. Our study provided a preliminary exploration of lncRNAs expression profiles in H.pylori-infected cell models by microarray. A subset of aberrantly expressed lncRNAs was verified by qRT-PCR. These dysregulated lncRNAs might contribute to the pathological processes during H.pylori infection.

DESIGN
We infected GES-1 cells with H.pylori as experimental groups,and cells without H.pylori infection were regarded as control groups. After 24hr-infection, cells of each group were selected for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix HTA2.0 arrays. The aberrant expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs were explored by microarray analysis between experimental and control groups.
