TITLE
Actions and interactions of progesterone and estrogen on transcriptome profiles of the bovine endometrium

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
By comparison of the transcriptome profiles of infected and healthy udder tissue we analyse gene expression in the late stage of infection with E. coli 1303. Differentially expressed genes and transcription factors regulating coexpressed genes identified by SOTA clustering were used to identify key genes that define late stage of infection with E. coli 1303. Keywords: hormone treatment

DESIGN
12 samples, four conditions: bovine endometrium of ovariectomized cows treated w/wo steroid hormones  * three replicates

PLATFORM
