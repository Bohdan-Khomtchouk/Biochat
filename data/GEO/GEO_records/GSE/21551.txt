TITLE
Expression Data from Escherichia coli grown to mid-log growth phase.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
B-methylthiolation of the Escherichia coli Ribosomal Protein S12 Regulates Anaerobic Gene Expression. B-methylthiolation is a unique post-translational modification (PTM) that maps to a conserved Asp 88 of the bacterial ribosomal protein S12.  This modification is phylogenetically conserved in several bacteria yet has not been identified on other proteins.

DESIGN
We use microarrays to delineate the association of prokaryotic ribosomal protein PTM to the regulation of genes.
