TITLE
CPG stimulation for Gene Expression of unmutated B-CLL

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim is to identify the differential gene expression profile of unmutated B-CLL stimulated with CPG.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, CPG-stimulated B-CLL unmutated vs. Unstimulated B-CLL unmutated . Biological replicates: 9 unstimulated replicates, 9 CPG-stimulated replicates. Reference design;
