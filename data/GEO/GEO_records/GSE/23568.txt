TITLE
Expression data analyzing ID3 (Inhibitor of DNA binding 3)-affected mouse T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse CD8+ T cells affected by ID3 (Inhibitor of DNA binding 3) display patterns of gene expression suggesting enhanced persistance and survival. In this study, we identified genes differentially expressed between ID32a transduced and mock transduced, and ID32a knockout and wild type mouse CD8+ T cells. Most prominent functions of differentially expressed genes include DNA replication-associated repair, maintenance of chromosome stability and mitotic cell divison machinery. Overall, these data suggest that ID3 acts in favor of maintained survival in CD8+ mouse T cells.

DESIGN
Two independent microarray experiments were carried out using separate array batches, one comparing Id32aThy1.1 (ID32a transduced) with Thy1.1 pmel-1 (mock transduced) CD8+ T cells sorted 5 days after infection, and a second experiment comparing Id32a-/- (Id32a knockout)CD8+ T cells with Id32a+/+ (Id32a wild type) controls, both in an upaired design. Individual array samples were generated by pooling equal amounts of total RNA derived from purified T cells of four individual mice. Each experimental group consisted of four such microarrays (statistical group size n=4, pooled samples derived from 16 mice per assay group total).
