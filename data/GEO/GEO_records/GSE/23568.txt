TITLE
Expression data analyzing ID3 (Inhibitor of DNA binding 3)-affected mouse T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse CD8+ T cells affected by ID3 (Inhibitor of DNA binding 3) display patterns of gene expression suggesting enhanced persistance and survival. In this study, we identified genes differentially expressed between ID32a transduced and mock transduced, and ID32a knockout and wild type mouse CD8+ T cells. Most prominent functions of differentially expressed genes include DNA replication-associated repair, maintenance of chromosome stability and mitotic cell divison machinery. Overall, these data suggest that ID3 acts in favor of maintained survival in CD8+ mouse T cells.
