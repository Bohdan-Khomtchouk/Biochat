TITLE
MIWI2 and MILI have differential effects on piRNA biogenesis and DNA methylation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In developing male germ cells, prospermatogonia, two Piwi proteins, MILI and MIWI2, use piRNA guides to repress transposable element (TE) expression and ensure genome stability and proper gametogenesis. In addition to their roles in post-transcriptional TE repression, both proteins are required for DNA methylation of TE sequences. Here we analyzed the effect of Miwi2 deficiency on piRNA biogenesis and transposon repression. Miwi2-deficiency had only a minor impact on piRNA biogenesis; however, the piRNA profile of Miwi2-knockout mice indicated overexpression of several LINE1 TE families that led to activation of the ping-pong piRNA cycle. Furthermore, we found that MILI and MIWI2 have distinct functions in TE repression in the nucleus. MILI is responsible for DNA methylation of a larger subset of TE families than MIWI2 suggesting that the proteins have independent roles in establishing DNA methylation patterns.

DESIGN
Small RNA profiles (19-30 nt range) of embryonic (E16.5) and post-natal (P10) testis of Miwi2 mutant mice and matched heterozygote controls. mRNA profiles of embryonic testis (E16.5) of heterozygote control mice and of postnatal testis (P10) of Miwi2 and Mili mutants and heterozygote controls. CpG methylation BS-seq profile of postnatal (P10) spermatocytes of Miwi2 mutant mice and matched heterozygote controls.
