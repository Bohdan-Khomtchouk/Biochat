TITLE
The role of Calment in Drosophila longevity and oxidative stress resistance

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to gain insights into how Calment/CG3036 affects lifespan and oxidative stress resistance in Drosophila females. Here we perform a microarray analysis in isogenized Calment1/4 females and CanS controls

DESIGN
Microarrays were performed on RNA extracted from whole adult females of Calment1/4 (isogenized into a CS10 background) and CanS, with microarrays performed in triplicate for both genotypes.

PLATFORM
GPL1322 [Drosophila_2] Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 2.0 Array
