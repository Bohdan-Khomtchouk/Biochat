TITLE
Syndecan-2 and apoptosis in osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Syndecan-2 was found to act as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma and to mediate the apoptotic response to cytotoxic agents. To determine new mechanisms that control cell survival and apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells, we aim to show target genes that are involved downstream of this proteoglycan during apoptosis induction. We aim to compare the modifications induced by syndecan-2 overexpression in two different human osteosarcoma cell lines using a lentiviral vector coding the human syndecan-2.

DESIGN
Syndecan-2 lentiviral vector (SY) and control empty lentiviral vector (VV) were transducted in two different human osteosarcoma cell lines in a dye-swap experiment.
