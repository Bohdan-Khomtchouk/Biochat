TITLE
miRNA expression profiling during C2C12 myogenesis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study profiled the expression of miRNA during myogenesis of the C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line. Cells were harvest at different stages during myogenesis including proliferating, confluence, 1 day post-differentiation induction, 2 day post-differentiation induction and 4 days post-differentiation induction. Keywords: time course
