TITLE
miRNA expression profiling during C2C12 myogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study profiled the expression of miRNA during myogenesis of the C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line. Cells were harvest at different stages during myogenesis including proliferating, confluence, 1 day post-differentiation induction, 2 day post-differentiation induction and 4 days post-differentiation induction. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
This experiment was a reference design miRNA microarray where all time points were compared to a pooled proliferating C2C12 sample, made up of 4 proliferating biological replicates. Each time point had four bioloigcal replicates of which two were labelled with Cy3 and two were labelled with Cy5.

PLATFORM
GPL6055 University of Adelaide microarray facility Exiqon LNA miRNA microarray_version8.1
