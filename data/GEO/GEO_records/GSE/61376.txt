TITLE
Chronic clinical hepatic schistosomiasis japonica

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have performed a genome wide transcriptional survey of liver biopsies obtained from patients in Hunan China, who have chronic schistosomiasis with and without past viral hepatitis history, compared to patients with no liver disease history or indicators. These results present a comprehensive transcriptional profile of chronic schistosomiasis japonica patients and demonstrate similarities and differences with other hepatic diseases. These unique features of gene expression, in conjunction with previous reports of the cellular composition of granuloma formation and recovery, present an improved understanding of the molecular immunopathology and general physiological status underlying hepatic schistosomiasis.

DESIGN
The gene expression profile of the human liver was examined for chronic patients with Schistosoma japonicum infections. Microarray analysis was performed on cRNA synthesised from total RNA derived from the liver biopsy tissue from huan China. Three groups were examined based on infections status [C] were  without history or indicators of schistosomiasis or viral heapatitis controls ; [S] with a history or active for schistosomiasis but no indicators of viral heapatitis; and [S]
