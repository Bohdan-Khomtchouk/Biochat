TITLE
Expression data of the human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 treated with TGF-beta

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Smad2/3 are transcription factors that engage in TGF-beta-induced transcription. We determined and analyzed HepG2 and Hep3B-specific Smad2/3 binding sites by ChIP-chip. We used expression microarrays to compare the Smad2/3 and HNF4alpha binding sites identified by ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq, respectively, to TGF-beta-induced gene expressions.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were transfected with control or HNF4A siRNAs and treated with 3 ng/ml TGF-beta for 0, 1.5 and 24 h (6 samples in total, no replicates). Total RNA was extracted and expression microarray analysis was performed as described in the protocols.
