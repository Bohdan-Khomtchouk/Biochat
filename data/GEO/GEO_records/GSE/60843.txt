TITLE
Regulatory RNA Apela Is a Component of a Negative Feedback Loop Regulating p53-Mediated Apoptosis in Embryonic Stem Cells (II)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal is to identify regulatory RNAs that regulate the p53 signaling pathway in embryonic stem (ES) cells.

DESIGN
p53+/+ mES cells and p53-/- mES cells were untreated or treated with 0.5 uM Adriamycin for 8 hours. Total RNA was extracted and subject to RNAseq.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
