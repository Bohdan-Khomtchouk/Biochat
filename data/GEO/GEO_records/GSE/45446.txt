TITLE
Brg1 Modulates Enhancer Activation and Polycomb-mediated Repression in Mesoderm Differentiation [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the global gene expression changes in normal and Brg1-deleted mesoderm differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.

DESIGN
RNAseq analysis of poly-adenylated RNA levels for 3 conditions: Day2 of differentiation, Day4 THF (Control), and Day4 4OHT (Brg1-deleted).  2 replicates per condition.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
