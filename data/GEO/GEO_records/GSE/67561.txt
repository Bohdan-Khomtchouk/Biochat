TITLE
Gene expression profiling of T47D breast cancer cells following progestin administration in presence or absence of Telapristone

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of progesterone blockade at the gene expression level.  The hypothesis tested in the present study is that elapristone (CDB4124), an antiprogestin, will downregulate genes that are stimulated by R5020, a synthetic progestin, in the T47D breast cancer cell line.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from T47 breast cancer cells grown for 24 hours in the presence of:  1.  The sythetic progestin R5020 compared to vehicle control; 2.  The antiprogestin Telapristone (CDB4124) compared to vehicle control; and 3.  R5020 compared to R5020 Â± Telapristone.
