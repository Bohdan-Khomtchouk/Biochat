TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression of rice cultivar Gui-630 (Indica) X Taiwanjing (Japonica) and mutant lemmata (lem) panicle

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The lem mutant was discovered in a doubled haploid (DH) line derived from the F1 of Gui-630 (Indica)xTaiwanjing (Japonica) by anther culture. The lem mutant did not affect other traits but caused all other floral organs (including palea, lodicule, stamen and carpel) to homeotically transform into lemma or lemma-like structures and caused floral meristem to be indeterminate, thus resulting in the mutant floret consisting of whorls of lemma and lemma-like organs. To identify the global gene expression changes mediated by LEM, we used 57K Affymetrix rice whole genome array to investigate the differences of genome-wide transcriptome between the young panicles of mutant lem versus WT samples during flower development stage. Keywords: rice (Oryza sativa L.),wild-type and lemmata mutant

DESIGN
We generate gene expression profiles of rice cultivar Gui-630 (indica)x Taiwanjing (japonica) and mutant lemmata by using 57K Affymetrix rice whole genome array.

PLATFORM
GPL2025 [Rice] Affymetrix Rice Genome Array
