TITLE
Transient low-dose decitabine treatment of primary AML samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of primary AML samples treated with 100nM decitabine (DAC), cytarabine (AraC), or DMSO. Eight distinct AML samples were grown using an in vitro stromal co-culture system for 4 days and then treated with either DAC, Ara-C or DMSO for 3 days. DNA was prepared for genome-wide methylation analysis with the Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation BeadChip. DNA from each sample/treatment was analyzed on duplicate arrays.

DESIGN
Bisulfite-converted DNA from 24 samples was hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip in duplicate (replicates are indicated by array plate number).

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
