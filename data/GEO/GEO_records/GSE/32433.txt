TITLE
Global expression analyses of yeast cells harboring specific members of the cytosolic Hsp70-Ssa family

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast DNA microarray was used to assess and compare the global expression profile of strains harboring different family members of the major cytosolic Hsp70 family. Viability of a yeast strain deleted for all genes encoding members of the Hsp70-Ssa family (Ssa1/2/3/4) was maintained by the presence of a single Ssa family member expressed ectopically from a plasmid vector. The Hsp70-Ssa family constitutes the main source of Hsp70 molecular chaperone activity in the yeast cell. A yeast cell must actively express a member of this family to remain viable. Hsp70-Ssa are highly conserved both within yeast and amongst other species. Ssa1 and 2 are 97% identical at amino acid level and 80% identical to Ssa3 and 4. The aim of this study was to attribute specific functions to single Ssa family members by identifying specific genes or gene families whose expression was altered in the presence (or absence) of Ssa family members.

DESIGN
Eight independent RNA samples were pooled to represent a single biological sample for expression analysis. For example, the single sample analyzed for cells harboring only Ssa1 is a pooled sample of eight independent RNA extractions. Hybridization was performed for cells harboring either Ssa1, Ssa2, Ssa3 or Ssa4 as the sole cytosolic Hsp70-Ssa family member. Gene expression profiles of Ssa2/3/4 were all compared to Ssa1.
