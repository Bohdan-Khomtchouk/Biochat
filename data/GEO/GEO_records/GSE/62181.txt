TITLE
Tracking replication enzymology in vivo by genome-wide mapping of ribonucleotide incorporation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Multiple DNA polymerases are needed to replicate genetic information. Here we describe the use of ribonucleotide incorporation as a biomarker of replication enzymology in vivo. We find that ribonucleotides are incorporated into the yeast nuclear genome in replicase specific and strand-specific patterns that identify replication origins and where polymerase switching occurs. Ribonucleotide density varies across the genome as a function of the replicase, base, local sequence and proximity to nucleosomes and transcription start sites. Ribonucleotides are present in one strand at high densityat mitochondrial replication origins, implying unidirectional replication of a circular genome. The evolutionary conservation of the enzymes that incorporate and process ribonucleotides in DNA suggests that the use of ribonucleotides as biomarkers of DNA synthesis in cells will have widespread applicability.

DESIGN
Mapping genomic ribonucleotides in 14 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (seven DNA polymerase backgrounds, with or without RNH201), via HydEn-seq (end sequencing of genomic fragments generated by alkaline hydrolysis).
