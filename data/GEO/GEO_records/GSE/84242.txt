TITLE
Recognition memory-induced gene expression in the perirhinal cortex: a transcriptomics analysis.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
It is possible to identify the key genes and pathways involved in specific physiological processes using transcriptome analyses. However, these powerful new deep sequencing-based methods have rarely been applied to studies of memory function. We used the bow-tie maze to train rats by exposing them to highly familiar objects or to novel objects. Total RNA sequencing was then used to compare the transcriptome of the perirhinal cortices of naïve control rats and rats exposed to novel and familiar stimuli. Differentially expressed genes were identified between group Novel and group Familiar rats and these included genes coding for transcription factors and extracellular matrix-related proteins. Moreover, differences in alternative splicing were also detected between the two groups. To conclude, this study shows that RNA sequencing can be used as a tool to identify differences in gene expression in behaving animals undergoing the same task but encountering different exposures.

DESIGN
RNA profiles of perirhinal cortex from rats exposed to novel objects (n=5) or familiar objects (n=5) in a recognition memory task were investigated using the Ion Proton System. Controls were naïve rats that had not undergone any behavioural testing (n=4).
