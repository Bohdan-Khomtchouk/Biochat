TITLE
Gene expression profiling of wildtype vs. transgenic mice expressing the cardiac specific genetically encoded FRET biosensor Epac1-PLN

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
3’,5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an ubiquitous second messenger which regulates multiple physiological functions by acting in distinct subcellular microdomains. Although several targeted cAMP biosensors have been developed and used in cell lines or neonatal cardiomyocytes, it is unclear whether such biosensors can be successfully used in vivo, especially in the context of disease. Here, we generated the first transgenic mouse model expressing a targeted cAMP sensor (Epac1-PLN) and analyzed microdomain-specific second messenger dynamics in the vicinity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). We demonstrate the biocompatibility of this targeted sensor and its potential for real-time monitoring of compartmentalized cAMP signaling in adult cardiomyocytes isolated from healthy mouse heart and from in vivo cardiac disease model. Finally, we used gene arrays to verify that the mRNA expression levels of the main players involved in cAMP signaling such as beta-ARs, G-protein, adenylyl cyclases, PKAs, PDEs, and Epac were not significantly changed between wildtype and transgenic Epac1-PLN expressing cardiomyocytes.

DESIGN
To compare cardiac specific mRNA expression between wildtype and Epac1-PLN transgenic mice, cardiomyocyte RNA from total of 5 individual wildtype and 5 Epac1-PLN transgenic mice was isolated and submitted for the Illumina gene array analysis to the Göttingen transcriptome analysis laboratory (TAL).
