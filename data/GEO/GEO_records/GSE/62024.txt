TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the prmt5 and prmt4a;4b mutant transcriptomes

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the transcriptional profile (RNA-seq) of prmt5 and prmt4a;4b Arabidopsis mutants with their respective wild type plants grown under continous light conditions

DESIGN
WT, prmt5 and prmt4a;4b mutant plants were grown together with their respective wild type plants for two weeks under continuous white light at 22 degrees centigrades and the transcriptional profile of these plants was analyzed using RNA-seq.
