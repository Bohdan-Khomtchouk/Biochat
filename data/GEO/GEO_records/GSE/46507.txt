TITLE
Comparison of the nucleotide-resolution, genome-wide, 5'-end maps of the transcriptomes of Escherichia coli K12 strain BW25113 and Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) strain M145

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) ; Escherichia coli BW25113

SUMMARY
The differential RNA-seq data contained within this entry is complemented by global RNA-seq.

DESIGN
S. coelicolor and E. coli reference strains were grown in batch culture with shaking. The E. coli sample was extracted during mid-exponential growth, while the S. coelicolor sample was extracted at the start of pigmented antibiotic production. Each of the two samples was incubated with or without TAP (tobacco acid pyrophosphatase) before library construction. Thus, 4 libraries were analysed. TAP treatment allows the cloning and sequencing of 5' ends that were originally triphosphorylated.
