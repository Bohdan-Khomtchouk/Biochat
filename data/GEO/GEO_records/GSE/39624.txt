TITLE
Kruppel-like factor 5 is Required for Villus Formation and Terminal Differentiation of the Intestinal Epithelium

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify putative KLF5 target genes that may mediate villus morphogenesis and epithelial maturation, we performed microarray analysis on intestinal samples isolated on E14.5, prior to the initiation of villus formation. Total RNA was isolated from dissected intestine segments located ~1.5 cm anterior to the cecum from E14.5 Klf5D/D and Klf5wt/wtShhEGFP/Cre+ embryos (n=3 samples/genotype, each sample a pool of two intestines). Gene expression profiles were compared using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. Genes involved in the regulation of " epithelial cell differentiation/maturation”, “cell adhesion”, and “lipid synthesis, metabolism, and localization”. Consistent with the lack of terminally differentiated cell types in the intestines of E18.5 Klf5D/D fetuses.
