TITLE
Gene expression in the mammary gland of the tammar wallaby during the lactation cycle

ORGANISM
Notamacropus eugenii

SUMMARY
In this study we use microarray technology to identify differentially expressed genes in the tammar wallaby mammary gland during the lactation cycle. We have focused on gene expression changes in the tammar mammary gland as it shifts from one lactation phase to the next.

DESIGN
Three separate time-course microarray experiments were performed. Each experiment involved the comparison of two time-points spanning two phases of tammar lactation. The three comparisons were: pregnancy day 26 vs lactation day 2 (phase 1 vs phase 2A), lactation day 110 vs lactation day 151 (phase 2A vs phase 2B) and lactation day 151 vs lactation day 216 (phase 2B vs 3).
