TITLE
BAF250a regulates nucleosome occupancy and histone modification in priming embryonic stem cell differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
BAF complex is one major group of chromatin remodeling factors in mammals. However, how BAF regulated nucleosomes and other histone modifications is not clear. Here we delete BAF250a, a major component in esBAF to study the nucleosome and histone changes in ESCs. We find that deletion of BAF250a leads to nucleosome occupancy increase in TSS regions and non-pioneer transcription factor binding sites. BAF250a deletion also cause overall decrease of H3K27me3 modification. Collectively, these results reveals how BAF complex coordinates nucleosome, histone modification to control ESC function.

DESIGN
Sample 1-4: Nucleosome profiles in WT and BAF250a KO ESCs. Sample 5-10: profiling of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in WT and BAF250 KO ESCs.
