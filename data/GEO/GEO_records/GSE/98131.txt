TITLE
Single cell RNA-seq of basal, luminal and total epithelial cells from the mammary glands of female mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. Mammary glands were collected from female mice of various ages: pre puberty (2 weeks), pubescent (5 weeks), adult (10 weeks) and pregnant (12.5 days mid-pregnancy). Freshly sorted epithelial cells were submitted to a Fluidigm C1 System machine for single cell capture and cDNA synthesis. In some cases, cells were further sorted into basal and luminal subsets. Cells were visualized under a microscope to ensure integrity of the captured single cells prior to cDNA preparation. Libraries were sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 to achieve 100bp paired-end reads or on an Illumina NextSeq to achieve 75bp paired-end reads.
