TITLE
Retinoid X Receptor activation reverses the age-related deficiency in myelin debris phagocytosis and enhances remyelination

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The efficiency of central nervous system (CNS) remyelination declines with age. This is in part due to an age-associated decline in the phagocytic removal of myelin debris, which contains inhibitors of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation.  In this study we show that expression of genes involved in the retinoid X receptor (RXR) pathway are decreased with aging in myelin-phagocytosing cells. Loss of RXR function in young macrophages mimics aging by delaying remyelination after experimentally-induced demyelination, while RXR agonists partially restore myelin debris phagocytosis in aged macrophages. The FDA-approved RXR agonist bexarotene, when used in concentrations achievable in human subjects, caused a reversion of the gene expression profile in aging human monocytes to a more youthful profile. These results reveal the RXR pathway as a positive regulator of myelin debris clearance and a key player in the age-related decline in remyelination that may be targeted by available or newly-developed therapeutics.

DESIGN
24 Human CD14+ monocyte-sorted PBMC samples representing 4 Healthy Volunteers (HV) and 4 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients under 3 different treatment conditions.  Condition 1 = (-) Phagocystosis (-) Bexarotene.  Condition 2 = (+) Phagocystosis (-) Bexarotene.  Condition 3 = (+) Phagocystosis (+) Bexarotene.
