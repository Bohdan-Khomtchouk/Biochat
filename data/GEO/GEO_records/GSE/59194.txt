TITLE
Mouse Liver: Tumors vs Two Week Transgene Expression vs Normal

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional Profiling of mouse liver tissues comparing normal tissues, tissues with two weeks expression of transgene, and tumors arising from transgene expression after hepatocy transplantation using the comparative hepatocyte growth assay Experimental groups: Control (hPAP marker gene); Normal Liver Expressing Transgene for Two Weeks; Liver Tumors Expressing Transgene

DESIGN
Twenty-Conditon Experiment: 1 Control Group (hPAP marker transgene); 10 Groups of  Normal Liver Expressing Different Transgene for 2 weeks; 9 Groups of Tumors Arising from Different Transgene

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
