TITLE
Abcb4 liver expression profiling

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The multidrug resistance gene 2 (Mdr2 or Abcb4) encodes a P-glycoprotein (Pgp) - a phospholipid flippase - that is the murine orthologue of the MDR3 gene in humans. The MDR2 protein is principally expressed in the bile canalicular membrane of the liver. A homozygous disruption of Abcb4 causes absence of phospholipids from bile. This phospholipid deficiency results in liver injury. The Balb-Abcb4-/- mouse strain has been generated by introgressing the Abcb4 knockout from the fibrosis-resistant FVB/NJ (FVB.129P2-Abcb4tm1Bor/J) strain into the susceptible BALB/cJ background, by backcrossing FVB- Abcb4-/- mice in to fibrosis-susceptible BALB/cJ mice for 10 generations.

DESIGN
cDNA expression profiling of mRNA from liver of four single male mutant mice against a pool of RNA from four wild type controls (n=8). For each mutant animal two technical replicates were performed including a dye swap experiment.
