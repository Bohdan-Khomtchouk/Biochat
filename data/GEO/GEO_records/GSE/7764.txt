TITLE
mRNA expression profiles of resting and IL-15 activated murine NK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine NK cells were compared at rest and following 24 hours of IL-15 stimulation for their mRNA expression profiles on the Affymetrix MOE430_2 microarray platform.  Additional comparators included resting bulk splenocytes. Keywords: mRNA, mouse, NK cell, IL-15

DESIGN
Three pairs of flow sorted murine NK cells (C57Bl/6) were analzyed at rest or after 24 hours of IL-15 stimulation.  Three biological replicates of each condition (resting or IL-15) are included in this anlaysis.  In addition, bulk resting splenocytes were used (2 biological replicates with 2 chip replicates for a total of 4 replicates).
