TITLE
mRNA expression profiles of resting and IL-15 activated murine NK cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Murine NK cells were compared at rest and following 24 hours of IL-15 stimulation for their mRNA expression profiles on the Affymetrix MOE430_2 microarray platform.  Additional comparators included resting bulk splenocytes. Keywords: mRNA, mouse, NK cell, IL-15
