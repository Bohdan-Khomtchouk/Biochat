TITLE
Aortic arch profiling of Apoe knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Aortic arch profiling of Apoe-/- mice fed a high fat diet (HFD, Harlan Teklad 88137, 21% fat, 0.15% cholesterol) starting at 8 weeks of age for 8, 16, and 24 weeks.  B6 mice fed HFD for 16 weeks starting at 8 weeks of age were used as controls.

DESIGN
Apoe-/- mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD, Harlan Teklad 88137, 21% fat, 0.15% cholesterol) starting at 8 weeks of age for 8, 16, and 24 weeks.  B6 mice fed HFD for 16 weeks starting at 8 weeks of age were used as controls. At each time point, 9 mice were studied. Mice were euthanized at each time point and whole aorta (from aortic root to renal bifurcation) of each mouse was immediately collected and flash-frozen in liquid N2.   Mice were fasted overnight prior to euthanasia.  the aortic arches of three mice in the same study group were pooled, resulting in three pools per study group.
