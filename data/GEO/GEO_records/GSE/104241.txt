TITLE
Alteration of gene expression by AIMP3 depletion in mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of AIMP3 for the pluripotency and differentiation in mESCs, we performed a microarray analysis in control and AIMP3-depleted mESCs. Compared to control, 1,279 genes were significantly up or down-regulated (1.5 fold, p < 0.05) in AIMP3-depleted cells. Through analysis with DAVID bioinformatics online tolls, the p53 signaling pathway was found to be activated in AIMP3-depleted cells. Alterations of p53 signaling pathway-related genes were confirmed by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Alterations of gene expression by AIMP3 depletion were measured at 4 days after exposure to 2 Î¼M tamoxifen (4-OHT) in AIMP3f/f;cre-ERT2 mouse embryonic stem cells.
