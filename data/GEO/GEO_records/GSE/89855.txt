TITLE
Gene expression in green millet (Setaria viridis): developmentally regulated genes, transcription start sites, and stimulating introns

ORGANISM
Setaria viridis

SUMMARY
Setaria viridis (green millet) is gaining popularity as a model C4 monocot due to its small size, rapid life cycle, and compact, sequenced genome. To analyze the structure and regulation of genes throughout development, the transcriptomes of 13 tissues at different stages of development were determined by RNA sequencing, and transcription start sites were mapped. Genes were identified that are differentially expressed in different developmental stages within the leaf, as well as in the apical meristem before and after the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, and in panicles before and after anthesis. In a majority of genes, transcription initiated at the sequence YR within a narrow peak 20 – 40 nt downstream of a TATA box. Genes expressed in multiple tissues generally use the same transcription start site across all tissue types. Several introns were identified that increase gene expression. These results will increase understanding of plant development, improve the annotation of the Setaria genome, and provide tissue-specific or constitutive promoters for use in transgenic applications.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from wild-type Setaria viridis and sequenced from a total of 13 different samples at various stages during development, with three biological replicates per sample. Some replicates were sequenced more than once (a/b/…) to generate sufficient reads.
