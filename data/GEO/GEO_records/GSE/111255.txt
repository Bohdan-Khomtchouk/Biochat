TITLE
DBP1 in budding yeast

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We analyzed the effect of deleting the gene encoding putative RNA helicase DBP1 in budding yeast on translational efficiencies (TEs) genome wide in wild-type or ded1-ts (temperature-sensitive allele of DED1) strains by combining ribosome footprint profiling with RNA-seq analysis of mRNA abundance.  This study includes a total of 32 samples comprised of 16 RNA-Seq samples (mRNA) and 16 ribosome footprint profiling samples (ribo). Experiment 1 includes 8 samples, comprised of 4 RNA-Seq samples and 4 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from 2 biological replicates each of the dbp1Δ  and ded1-ts dbp1Δ mutant strains, cultured in synthetic complete (SC) medium, following shifts in growth temperature from 30°C to 37°C for 2h.  Experiment 2 examines the effect of overexpression of DBP1 in rescuing genome-wide translational defects of a ded1-cs mutant (cold-sensitive allele of DED1) and includes 12 samples, 6 RNA-Seq samples and 6 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from 2 biological replicates each of WT DED1 (dubbed DED1-CS), ded1-cs and ded1-cs overexpressing DBP1 (ded1-cs_hcDBP1) strains, cultured in SC-Leu-His medium, following shifts in growth temperature from 30°C to 15°C for 10 min. Experiment 3 examines rescue of translational defects of ded1-ts by DBP1 overexpression and includes 12 samples, 6 RNA-Seq samples and 6 ribosome footprint profiling samples, derived from 2 biological replicates each of WT DED1(DED1-TS), ded1-ts and ded1-ts overexpressing DBP1 (ded1-ts_hcDBP1) strains, cultured in SC-Leu-His medium, following shifts in growth temperature from 30°C to 37°C for 2h.
