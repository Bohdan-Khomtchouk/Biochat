TITLE
Expression profiling and functional analysis of poplar WRKY23 reveals a regulatory role in defense: WRKY23-RNAi

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
To investigate the function of poplar WRKY23, we generated PtWRKY23-overexpressing and -underexpressing (RNAi) plants. Transgenic plants were inoculated with Melampsora rust or mock-inoculated for assessment of rust-resistance and for gene expression profiling using the poplar Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® to study the consequences of PtWRKY23 overexpression and underexpression. Transcriptome analysis of PtWRKY23 overexpressors revealed a significant overlap with the Melampsora-infection response. Transcriptome analysis also indicated that PtWRKY23 affects redox homeostasis and cell wall-related metabolism. Keywords: genetic modification, stress response
