TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression in Human Normal and Breast Cancer Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression between normal breast epithelial cells and the malignant counterpart was studied using microarray technique. We utilized GeneAlbum GEM 1-6 from Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which contains which contains 65,873 cDNA clones (57,172 clones excluding controls), representing 33,515 individual genes. The normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) from 3 donors were used to search different gene expression patterns among individuals, ages and races. In addition, 8 well-established breast cancer cell lines were used as probes against a common normal HMEC from 50 years old donor Keywords: other
