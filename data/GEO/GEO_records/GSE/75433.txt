TITLE
The role of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) in human adipose derived stem cells (hADSC), isolated from human adipose tissue collected during liposuction procedures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of change in transcriptional networking and disection of the  TRalpha and TRbeta roles in hADSC, and during differentiation of hADSC towadrd different lineages.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from hADSC, and adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts differentiated from hADSC treated with triiodothytonine (T3)  for 0 and 18 h. T3 response in each cell line was analyzed.
