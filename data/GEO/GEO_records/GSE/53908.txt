TITLE
Cardiac responses to elevated seawater temperature in Atlantic salmon

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
Long-term exposure of Atlantic salmon to 19Â°C resulted in cardiac gene and protein expression changes indicating that the unfolded protein response, vascularization, remodeling of connective tissue and altered innate immune responses were part of the cardiac acclimation or response to elevated temperature

DESIGN
Heart tissue from Atlantic salmon (RNA poooled from N=3 fish per 3 replicate tanks) reared under normal (14 deg C) and elevated (19 deg C) temperatures were sampled after 21 (short-term) and 56 days (long-term acclimation), and gene expression changes between the elevated and the control temperature were assessed using microarray analysis.
