TITLE
RNA-seq to profile the H-NS transcriptome in EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

SUMMARY
In order to define the role of H-NS in regulating gene transcription and further find out the biological significance of this protein in EHEC, we conducted RNA-seq and then analyzed the transcriptome data, using EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 and Δhns. A total of 983 genes were found to be regulated by H-NS. 213 and 770 genes exhibited lower and higher transcript levels in Δhns than in WT, respectively. For instance, chemotaxis and flagellar associated genes were down-regulated in Δhns. Besides, 34 genes on virulence plasmid pO157 were down-regulated by H-NS. The outcome of RNA-seq were verified by real time quantitative PCR. As reported in Salmonella Typhimurium, Δhns showed a growth deficiency and altered fitness. We first detected that both stx1 and stx2 in EDL933 were repressed by H-NS. Although no survival difference between EDL933 and Δhns was detected when phagocytized by macrophage, we characterized the higher ability of colonization and in consequence the higher virulence of Δhns to BALB/c mice by experimental analyses than those of WT, especially when intact commensal flora of mice existed. This might indeed help us understand the core role of H-NS in depth.

DESIGN
RNA sequencing of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 and Δhns in 2 biological repeats.
