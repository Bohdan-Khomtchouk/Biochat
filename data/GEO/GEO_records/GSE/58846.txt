TITLE
Expression analysis of Lysobacter enzymogenes OH11 delta-clp mutant

ORGANISM
Lysobacter enzymogenes

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Lysobacter enzymogenes OH11 delta-clp mutant, compared to the wild-type strain.

DESIGN
A four chip study using total RNA recovered from two separate wild-type cultures of Lysobacter enzymogenes OH11 and two separate cultures of mutant delta-clp. Delta-clp represented the mutant with clp deletion in Lysobacter enzymogenes OH11. Each chip measures the expression level of 5,180 genes from Lysobacter enzymogenes OH11.
