TITLE
Expression profile of 22Rv1 cells upon DHT treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine genes regulated by Androgen Receptor in response to DHT treatment in 22Rv1, we cultured 22Rv1 cells in full serum containing media and then added DHT for 24 hrs. RNA was harvested after 24 hrs of treatment and gene expression profiling was performed by RNA-Seq

DESIGN
RNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
