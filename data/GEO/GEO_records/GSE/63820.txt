TITLE
MRTF-SRF signaling is required for seeding of HSC/Ps in bone marrow during development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Chemokine signaling is important for the seeding of different sites by hematopoietic stem cells during development. Serum Response Factor (SRF) controls multiple genes governing adhesion and migration, mainly by recruiting members of the Myocardin-Related Transcription Factor (MRTF) family of G-actin regulated cofactors. We used vav-iCre to inactivate MRTF-SRF signaling early during hematopoietic development. In both Srf- and Mrtf-deleted animals, hematopoiesis in fetal liver and spleen is intact, but does not become established in fetal bone marrow. Srf-null HSC/Ps (hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells) fail to effectively engraft in transplantation experiments, exhibiting normal proximal signaling responses to SDF-1, but reduced adhesiveness, F-actin assembly, and reduced motility. Srf-null HSC/Ps fail to polarise in response to SDF-1, and cannot migrate through restrictive membrane pores to SDF-1 or Scf in vitro. Mrtf-null HSC/Ps were also defective in chemotactic responses to SDF-1. MRTF-SRF signaling is thus critical for the response to chemokine signaling during hematopoietic development.
