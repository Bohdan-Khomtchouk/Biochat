TITLE
miR-193b Regulates Mcl-1 in Melanoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have important roles in gene regulation. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been associated with tumorigenesis. Recent studies suggest miR-193b is a tumor suppressor gene. In a previous study, we reported that miR-193b represses cell proliferation and regulates cyclin D1 (CCND1) in melanoma. Now we demonstrate that miR-193b regulates myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) in melanoma cells. miRNA microarray profiling revealed the miR-193b level in malignant melanomas was significantly downregulated compared to benign nevi, while a tissue microarray demonstrated overexpression of Mcl-1 in malignant melanoma. The Mcl-1 expressions were inversely correlated with the miR-193b levels in melanoma tissue samples, suggesting a potential regulatory role of miR-193b. Overexpression of miR-193b repressed Mcl-1 in melanoma cell lines. It is well known that Mcl-1 knockdown confers cell sensitivity to ABT-737, a small molecular inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-w. We found miR-193b, through repressing Mcl-1 expression, could also sensitize melanoma cells that were refractory to ABT-737. Furthermore, miR-193b directly regulates Mcl-1 by targeting the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of Mcl-1 mRNA. Interestingly, miR-193b may recognize sequences on the 3’UTR that do not base pair with its seed region. In conclusion, our study suggests the downregulation of miR-193b could be an early event during melanoma progression, and demonstrates miR-193b directly regulates Mcl-1 by targeting both seed and seedless sequences of the 3’ UTR.
