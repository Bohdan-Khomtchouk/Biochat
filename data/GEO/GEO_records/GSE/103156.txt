TITLE
Microarray whole transcriptome profiling of LPS (Escherichia coli O111:B4) treated BV-2 Cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A common in vitro model for evaluating anti-inflammatory agents is use of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) , a cell wall endotoxic component from gram negative bacteria which evokes a deadly cytokine storm associated with septicemia, septic shock and multi organ failure. In this study , we investigate whole transcriptome changes occurring at 24 hours of incubation with LPS (1ug/ml) in BV2 murine microglia cells. Microarrays were acquired for mRNAs and long intergenic non-coding RNA transcripts using the GeneChipâ„¢ MOGENE 2.1ST ARRAY Arrays by Affymetrix Inc.

DESIGN
BV-2 Cells treated with LPS or control

PLATFORM
GPL17400 [MoGene-2_1-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
