TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the effect of long-term freezing of PAXgene Blood RNA tubes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of long-term freezing on the stability of transcriptome profiles in PAXgene stabilized whole blood samples.  In the present study it was tested if  long-term freezing of PAXgene RNA tubes (up to one year) has an influence on the transcriptome profile of peripheral whole blood samples. Results indicated that gene expression profiles of whole blood samples stabilized with PAXgene RNA tubes remain stable for at least 1 year.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from peripheral whole blood samples collected in PAXgene RNA tubes of healthy human subjects. RNA was either isolated after 24h storage at room temperature or after freezing of PAXgene RNA tubes for up to 1 year (6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months).
