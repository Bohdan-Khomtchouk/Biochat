TITLE
Gene expression profiles of MAIT cells, MAIT-iPSCs, hiPSCs, hESCs, and reMAIT cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To show the similarity among MAIT-iPSCs, hiPSCs and hESCs and the gradual change of global gene expression of reMAIT cells along with differentiation, this experiment was designed.

DESIGN
MAIT cells, MAIT-iPSCs, hiPSCs, hESCs, MAIT cells, and reMAIT cells at the several differerent stages of differentiation were collected. Then, they were applied in this experiment.
