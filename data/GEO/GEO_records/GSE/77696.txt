TITLE
Epigenome-wide assoication analysis of HIV infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of HIV-infected and uninfected individuals for DNA samples extracted from peripheral blood. The Illumina Infinium  Human DNA methylation 450 Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 480,000 CpGs. Samples included 261 HIV-infected and 117 HIV-uninfected individuals. The goal was to identify genome-wide differentially methylated CpG sites between HIV-infected and uninfected samples. Bisulfite converted DNA from the 378 DNA samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450K Human Methylation Beadchip. The samples were extracted from whole blood. The subjects including 261 HIV-infected and 117 HIV-uninfected were recruited from the Veteran Aging Cohort Study. All subjects were inform consented and the study protocol was approved by Connecticut Veteran Affair Healthcare System IRB and Yale Human Research Protection Program at Yale University.
