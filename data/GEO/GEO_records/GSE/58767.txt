TITLE
MicroRNA expression in chicken cecum following Campylobacter jejuni infection

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
SPF leghorn chickens were infected with C. jejuni. The cecum were collected at 8h post infection for total RNA isolation. The significantly expressed microRNAs between infected and non-infected chickens were identified through Solexa sequencing technology.

DESIGN
Two libraries were made from each group, in total, four libraries were used for Solexa sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL13797 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Gallus gallus)
