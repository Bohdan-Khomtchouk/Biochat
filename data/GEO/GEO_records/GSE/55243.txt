TITLE
Genomic Microarray of Rat Alveolar Type 2 cells Following Chronic Ethanol Ingestion

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Chronic alcohol ingestion changes the alveolar landscape.  We used microarrays to characterize the change in mRNA expression following chronic alcohol ingestion in male Sprague Dawley rates (EtOH 36% of calories)

DESIGN
We used microarrays to characterize the change in mRNA expression following chronic alcohol ingestion in male Sprague Dawley rats (EtOH 36% of calories for 6 weeks).  Control animals were given an isocaloric substitution for EtOH for 6 weeks. Alveolar type 2 cells were isolated using an immuno-absorption /technique and RNA was extracted by Trizol. Four control animals and three EtOH treated animals were used for this study.
