TITLE
Chromosomal clustering of genes in trithorax (trx) mutant larvae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We have performed a systematic examination of genome-wide expression profiles using microarrays to reconstruct a global picture of the trx regulatory gene network in D. melanogaster. Using computational analysis of the microarray data, we have identified 25 clusters of genes potentially regulated by trx, most of them being located in the arm L of chromosome 3. Functional analysis revealed that most clusters are enriched in structural proteins involved in cuticle formation, which are preferently expressed in salivary glands. The same organization in clusters was observed in the transcriptomes of four independent experiments, being a distinctive feature of the regulatory networks of trx and other chromatin regulators (ASH2, NURF, Pc, ASH1). We have also identified many of these clusters in D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura and partially in A. gambiae. Keywords: loss of function analysis
