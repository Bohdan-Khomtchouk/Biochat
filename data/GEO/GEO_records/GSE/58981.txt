TITLE
Gene expression levels in Rhizosphere Originating Biocontrol Strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa M18 producing different amounts of phenazine-1-carboxylate acid (PCA)

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
To further understand the gene expression characteristics of originating biocontrol strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa M18, we have applied whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to to specify the PCA-dependent expression of M18 genome. We constructed a series of PCA-producing mutant strains (high PCA: M18MSU1; low PCA: M18MS; and no PCA: M18MSP1P2). The comparison analysis of the M18 mutants genome expressional profiles indicated that the expression of PCA in both M18MSU1 and M18MS alters the expression of a total of 545 different genes; however, the higher level of PCA in M18MSU1 altered more genes (489) as compared to M18MS (129).

DESIGN
Cells were grown to OD600=5.0 (exponential phase) in PPM medium at 28â„ƒ. Three independent experiments were performed at each time.

PLATFORM
