TITLE
Expression data from U-2 OS osteosarcoma cell lines stably expressing an S22A-progerin mutant compared with U-2 OS expressing wt-progerin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Disassembly of the nuclear envelope is an essential feature of mammalian cell division controlled by the phosphoryaltion of lamins via cyclin dependent kinases. This process is affected in cells expressing progerin, a lamin A allele found in patients with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome. Progerin can inhibit cell proliferation of both normal and tumor cells and this property is largely magnified if its phosphorylation at serine 22 is inhibited by a genetic mutation to generate S22A-progerin. Surprisingly, S22A-progerin acquires the ability to trigger cellular senescence in tumor cells with mutations in the p53 and RB tumor suppression pathways suggesting a novel pathway to control the growth of malignant tumors. We used microarrays to characterize the gene expression changes induced by the S22A-progerin in comparison with the wt-progerin in U-2 OS cell line.

DESIGN
U-2 OS cells were infected with a retroviral vector that express S22A-progerin or wt-progerin. After 4 days of infection, RNA was extracted from three independents replicas of each condition. Total RNA was send to Genome Quebec service for hybridization with Affymetrix microarrays.
