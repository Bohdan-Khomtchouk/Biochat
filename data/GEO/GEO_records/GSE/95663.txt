TITLE
Intestinal mRNA profiles of 2-month old control (APCmin) and APCmin; Setd2IEC-/- mice generated by deep sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Setd2 catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3. H3K36me3 is deposited mainly in the gene body and has recently been demonstrated to play a role in regulating transcriptional elongation and alternative splicing. We conduct deep sequencing in 2-month old control (APCmin) and APCmin; Setd2IEC-/- mice intestinal cells to understand the splicing events regulated by Setd2.

DESIGN
Intestinal mRNA profiles of 2-month old control (APCmin) and APCmin; Setd2IEC-/- mice were generated by deep sequencing. Each RNA sample was from 3 littermates RNA mixture.
