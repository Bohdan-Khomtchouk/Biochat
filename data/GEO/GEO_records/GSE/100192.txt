TITLE
Expression data from T-DM1 resistant clones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms of resistance to the antibody-drug conjugate, T-DM1, were studied on clones derived from breast cancer cell line, BT474. Microarray analyses were performed to explore potential transcriptomic differences among the distinct cell lines.

DESIGN
RNA from parental cell line, BT474, and four resistant clones, C#1, C#2, C#3 and C#6, was purified and their gene expression profiles compared using the Affimetrix Transcriptome Analysis console. Three biological replicates were analyzed for each cell lines.
