TITLE
Effect daunorubicin on the binding of the cohesin subunit Rad21 in HCT116 cells [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used ChIP-seq to measure the binding of the cohesin subunit Rad21 in response to daunorubicin treatment in HCT116 cells

DESIGN
HCT116 cells were treated for 8h with 250 nM daunorubicin or  with vehicle

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
