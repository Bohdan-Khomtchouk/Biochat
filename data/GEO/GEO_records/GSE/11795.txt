Molecular Profiling of Primitive Hematopoietic Cells Generated In Vitro from Human Embryonic Stem Cells and In Vivo during Embryogenesis

SUMMARY
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) offer an important model for investigating the human hematopoietic celldevelopment.  Here, we used long serial analysis of gene expression and quantitative real-time PCR to characterize two subsets of primitive hematopoietic cells derived in vitro from hESCs.  This revealed differences in their expression of genes associated with lymphoid and myeloid development, cellular biosynthetic processes, and cell cycle regulation.  Further comparisons with analogous data for primitive hematopoietic cells isolated from first trimester human fetal liver and newborn cord blood showed a strong similarity between the transcriptomes of the most primitive hESC- and in vivo-derived populations, with the main differences involving genes that regulate HSC development, self-renewal and homing, chromatin remodeling, AP1 transcription complex genes, and non-coding RNAs.  These data suggest that primitive hematopoietic cells are generated from hESCs in vitro by processes similar to those operative during human embryogenesis in vivo, although some differences were also detected.
