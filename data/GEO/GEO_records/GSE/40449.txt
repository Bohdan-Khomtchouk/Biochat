TITLE
Microarray analysis of toxicogenomic effect of Para-Tertiary Amyl Phenol (PTAP) on Staphylococcus aureus.

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of Staphylococcus aureus following Para-Tertiary Amyl Phenol (PTAP) treatment using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. Results from this study provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular response of Staphylococcus aureus to PTAP.

DESIGN
We conducted four independent microarray experiments (biological replicates) in the absence (control) and the presence (experimental) of Para-Tertiary Amyl Phenol (PTAP). Fold change was calculated as a ration between the signal averages of five untreated (control) and five PTAP-treated (experimental) cultures after 0, 10 and 60 min exposure time.
