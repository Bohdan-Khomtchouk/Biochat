TITLE
Gene expression analysis of primary human myeloid precursor cells treated with O6-benzylguanine (6BG)  and Temozolomide (TMZ)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For the comparison of 6BG/TMZ with control sample, the predominant annotation among the upregulated genes is ‘apoptosis’. The majority of the downregulated genes is assigned to heat shock proteins and proteins which bind unfolded proteins.

DESIGN
To look at early changes in gene expression, primary human myeloid precursor cells (40 x 10^6 per sample) derived from 3 pooled CD34+ products were treated for 18 hours with control (vehicle), 6BG, TMZ, or 6BG/TMZ and cell pellets flash frozen. Total RNA were isolated at Miltenyi Biotec (Cologne, Germany) and bioinformatics analysis of four microarray datasets was performed by their Bioinformatics Group.  The direct comparisons were: 6BG/TMZ vs Control, TMZ vs 6BG, 6BG/TMZ vs 6BG, 6BG/TMZ vs TMZ. A two-dye competitive hybridization of mRNAs derived from differently treated human cells in comparison to a reference mRNA derived from cells which underwent a different treatment was conducted. After treatment with two different drugs or a combination of both drugs, respectively, RNA was extracted from the cells and hybridized against the corresponding reference mRNA. As microarray platform, the PIQOR™ Cell Death Microarray with 494 probes was used.
