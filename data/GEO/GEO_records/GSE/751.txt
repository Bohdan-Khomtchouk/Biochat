TITLE
HEVEC dedifferentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A double screen has been carried out by comparing freshly isolated HEVEC (D0-Hevec) from human tonsils to freshly purified HUVEC (D0-Huvec), and to dedifferentiated HEVEC (D2-Hevec) grown ex vivo for two days, using three Clontech commercial nucleotide arrays (Atlas Human Cardiovascular, 1.2 I and 1.2II Arrays) Keywords = freshly isolated HEVEC expression profile Keywords = HEVEC dedifferentiation ex vivo Keywords: other
