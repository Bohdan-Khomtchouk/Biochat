TITLE
Global gene expression profile of Japanese encephalitis virus(JEV) infected cytolytic B16F10 and Non-cytolytic JEV resistant B16F10r

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B16F10, a murine melanoma cel line is cytolytic to JEV infection. We have identified a B16F10 cell line variant which is non-cytolytic to JEV infection.  This variant cell line has two types of cells, one which is persistently infected JEV and another which is resistant to JEV infection.  The JEV-resistant cells (B16F10r) were seperated from the presistently infected cells by single cell cloning.   To understand the mechanism of JEV resistance microarray analysis was caried out to Identify and characterize  genes differentially expressed during in uninfected/JEV-infected B16F10 and B16F10r cells.
