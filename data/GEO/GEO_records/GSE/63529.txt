Comparison of parental and CDKi-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines

SUMMARY
High-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) are genomically complex, heterogeneous cancers with a high mortality rate, due to acquired chemoresistance and lack of targeted therapy options. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKi) target the retinoblastoma (RB) signaling network, and have been successfully incorporated into treatment regimens for breast and other cancers. Here, we have compared mechanisms of response and resistance to three CDKi that target either CDK4/6 or CDK2 and abrogate E2F target gene expression. We identify CCNE1 gain and RB1 loss as mechanisms of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition, whereas receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and RAS signaling is associated with CDK2 inhibitor resistance. Mechanistically, we show that ETS factors are mediators of RTK/RAS signaling that cooperate with E2F in cell cycle progression. Consequently, CDK2 inhibition sensitizes cyclin E1-driven but not RAS-driven ovarian cancer cells to platinum-based chemotherapy. In summary, this study outlines a rational approach for incorporating CDKi into treatment regimens for HGSOC.

DESIGN
For parental HEY, two replicates per condition (control=10%, SNS032-treated, PD0332991-treated) were analyzed. For CDKi-resistant cells, two individual subclones derived from single cells were analyzed, except OAW28 sublines (two polyclonal populations per subline), OV90-PD/SNS-R (two polyclonal populations) and OV90-SNS-R-1 (polyclonal population, whereas OV90-SNS-R-2 is derived from a single colony).
