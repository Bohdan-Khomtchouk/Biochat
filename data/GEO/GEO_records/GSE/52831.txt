TITLE
Gene expression profile of Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma cells after knock-down of DUSP5

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By using high-density DNA microarrays, we analyzed the gene-expression profile of Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line L-428 after knock-down of DUSP5 (dual specificity phosphatase 5)

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from established Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line L-428 and hybridized with Affymetrix HG_U133A microarrays.
