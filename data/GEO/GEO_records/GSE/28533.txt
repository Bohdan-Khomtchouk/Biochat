Genome-wide Regulation of 5hmC, 5mC and Gene Expression by Tet1 Hydroxylase in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (bisulfite sequencing data)

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
DNA methylation of C5-cytosine (5mC) in the mammalian genome is a key epigenetic event that is critical for various cellular processes. However, how the genome-wide 5mC pattern is dynamically regulated remains a fundamental question in epigenetic biology. The TET family of 5mC hydroxylases, which convert 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), have provided a new potential mechanism for the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation. The extent to which individual Tet family members contribute to the genome-wide 5mC and 5hmC patterns and associated gene network remains largely unknown. Here we report genome-wide mapping of Tet1 and 5hmC in mESCs and reveal a mechanism of action by which Tet1 controls 5hmC and 5mC levels in mESCs. In combination with microarray and mRNA-seq expression profiling, we identify a comprehensive yet intricate gene network influenced by Tet1. We propose a model whereby Tet1 controls DNA methylation both by binding to CpG-rich regions to prevent unwanted DNA methyltransferase activity, and by converting the existing 5mC to 5hmC through its enzymatic activity. This Tet1-mediated antagonism of CpG methylation imparts differential maintenance of DNA methylation status at Tet1 target loci, thereby providing a new regulatory mechanism for establishing the epigenetic landscape of mESCs, which ultimately contributes to mESC differentiation and the onset of embryonic development.

DESIGN
To determine the genome-wide DNA methylation changes caused by Tet1 depletion in mouse ES cells. Tet1 protein was depleted by specific siRNA treatment. The DNA methylation levels in control and Tet1 siRNA-transfected ES cells were determined by targeted bisulfite sequencing.
