TITLE
Whole blood gene expression from subjects with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole blood (paxgene) gene expression was measured using Affymetrix microarray from 377 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis.

DESIGN
RA patient samples were collected from a phase III clinical trial of golimumab in Patients with Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Despite Methotrexate Therapy (GO-FURTHER) according to trial protocol approved by local Institutional Review Board. A subset of subjects from the entire trial population at baseline (i.e., 377 subjects before golimumab treatment) was utilized. All patients consented to genetic and transcriptomics analyses.
