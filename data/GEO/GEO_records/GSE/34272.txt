TITLE
Whole transcriptome sequencing reveals dynamic RNA changes in the aging rat brain

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Using RNA-seq, 9 cerebral cortex RNA samples were sequenced from 6 month (n=3, 6 individuals pooled), 12 month (n=3, 6 individuals pooled) and 28 month (n=3, 6 individuals pooled) rats. Allowing brain aging in the cerebral cortex to be assessed.

DESIGN
Transcriptional profiling of the ageing cerebral cortex at 6, 12 and 28 months
