TITLE
Global fibroblast activation in the left ventricle but localized fibrosis after myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Copper coated stent were implanted into the LAD coronary artery of porcine animal weighing between 20-25 kg, which leads to a severe coronary stenosis and myocardial infarct (MI). After MI, Fb are activated throughout the LV, presumably through TGF-Î²1 in response to increased wall stress and/or inflammation. Additional regional specific signaling leads to interstitial fibrosis via collagen cross-linking in MIadjacent. Local LOX activity could be stimulated by higher mechanical load imposed by tethering to the infarct or signals could diffuse from the scar.Identifying specific signaling cues to maintain the mature state of MyoFb phenotype in the scar tissue may open new perspectives in targeting the MyoFb reversibility in interstitial fibrosis without damaging existing scar tissue.

DESIGN
From each MI pig, Fb cells were isolated from these regions; MI-adjacent, MI-remote, MI-Scar. Total 4 pigs were use. So N=4(pig); n=12(per pig/3 regions/ total 4 pigs). Additionally, 3 pigs were used for SHAM.
