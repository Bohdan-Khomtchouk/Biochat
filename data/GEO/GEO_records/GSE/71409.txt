TITLE
Gene expression analysis of monocytes and monocyte derived cells (MDCs) in CLL patients with differing antibody sensitivity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA from CD14 positive monocytes isolated from CLL patient PBMCs on day 0 and from MDCs from CLL PBMCs cultured for seven days were hybridised to an RNA microarray to identify differences between the MDCs derived from sensitive or resistant CLL patients and differences in MDCs pre and post in vitro culture.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from CD14 positive monocytes from 2 sensitive and 2 resistant CLL patients and total RNA isolated from MDCs from 4 sensitive and 3 resistant CLL patients
