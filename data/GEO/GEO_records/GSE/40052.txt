TITLE
Expression data from Maize leaves post inoculation of Sporisorium reilianum.

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
Head smut of maize, which is caused by the Sporisorium reilianum f. sp. Zeae (KÃ¼hn), has been a serious disease in maize. In order to find head smut resistant candidate genes, microarrays were used to monitor the gene expression profiles between disease resistant near isogenic lines (NIL) L282 and L43, highly resistant inbred line Q319 and highly susceptible inbred line Huangzao4 after 0 to7 days post inoculation of S.reiliana by artificial inoculation method.

DESIGN
Maize leaves were selected at 0d, 1d, 2d, 4d, 7d post inoculation for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain different expression genes of different varieties at each inoculation stage in order to find head smut resistant candidate genes.
