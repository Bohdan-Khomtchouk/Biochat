TITLE
Murine polyploid trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) from day E9.5 implantation sites (experimental) vs E9.5 diploid embryos (control)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Array-based quantitative genome hybridization (aCGH) was performed to quantify gene copy number across the euchromatic portion of the genome of polyploid TGCs relative to embryonic diploid control cells.

DESIGN
DNA was prepared from diploid embryonic cells and purified polyploid TGCs, labeled, and hybridized to microarrays. Experiment was performed in two biological replicates.
