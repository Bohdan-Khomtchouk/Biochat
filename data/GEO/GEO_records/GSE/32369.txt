TITLE
Effect of iron chelators on global gene expression pattern in SW480 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of SW480 cells treated with inhibitor compounds for 6 hours. Results provide insights into the role of iron in Wnt signalling and demonstrate that iron depletion is the primary mode of actions of these compounds on Wnt pathway.

DESIGN
SW480 cells were incubated with 10 mM of compounds (OICR623), control (DMSO) and two known iron chelators (DFO and Deferasirox) for 6 hours. RNA was extracted and cDNA samples isolated from 2-4 independent experiments were hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST array.
