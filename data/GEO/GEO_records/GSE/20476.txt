TITLE
Effects of gene scilencing of USP2 on expression profiles of HL60 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
So far, we have found PMA induced USP2b isoform in myeloid leukemia cell lines such as HL60, THP-1, and U937. To explore molecular function of USP2 in the cells, we assess expression profiles of HL60-derivatives continuously expressing shRNA for USP2 and control shRNA.

DESIGN
HL60 derivatives continuously expressing shRNA for USP2 and control shRNA were treated with PMA (30nM) for 0, 1, 2, and 3 days. Total RNA was extracted from the cells and subjected to microarray experiments using Human Genome U133 GeneChips.
