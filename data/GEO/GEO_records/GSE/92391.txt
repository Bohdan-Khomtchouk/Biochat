TITLE
Global gene expression of hiPS cell derived cardiomyocytes from healthy volunteers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the relationship between inter-individual difference of drug susceptibility and global gene expression, gene expression profiles of human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) generated from healthy volunteers were compared with each other.

DESIGN
Three undifferentiated hiPSC lines of three individuals and hiPSC-CMs generated from 10 healthy volunteers were sampled at three different time points. Adult ventricular tissue was sampled from three different human cadavers. iPSC_donorA, iPSC_donorE and iPSC_donorH are represented as undifferentiated iPS cells derived from donor A, E and H.
