TITLE
Systems analysis identifies an essential role for SHARPIN in macrophage TLR2 responses (Agilent)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our systems analysis reported here demonstrates that TLR-responses in macrophages are markedly impaired by SHARPIN deficiency, and that SHARPIN controls expression of a subset of TLR2-induced, NF-kB and AP-1 dependent genes that overlaps with those affected by the hypomorphic panr2 mutation in NEMO.

DESIGN
46 total RNA samples from murine bone marrow derived macrophages were analyzed (32 by Agilent array, 14 by Affymetrix Exon array) On Agilent array, the responses of macrophages to 12hr stimulation with the TLR2 ligand PAM3CSK4 (300ng/mL) were analyzed in biological duplicates for five mutant mouse strains and respective controls: Sharpin(cpdm), Ikbkg(panr2), Atf3(KO), Il10(KO), and Nfkb1(KO).
