TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of skeletal muscle gene expression in mice with C26 tumor-induced muscle wasting and cachexia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in CD2F1 mice with cancer cachexia due to implantation of C26 colon carcinoma cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from quadriceps muscle of female CD2F1 mice with early weight loss (10%) or severe weight loss (15%) due to intrascapular subcutaneous implantation of one million C26 colon adenocarcinoma cells.
