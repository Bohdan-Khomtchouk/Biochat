TITLE
Expression data from Ts1Cje and disomic C57BL/6 adult neurospheres

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Down syndrome is the most common form of genetic mental retardation. How Trisomy 21 causes mental retardation remains unclear and its effects on adult neurogenesis have not been addressed. To gain insight into the mechanisms causing mental retardation we used microarrays to investigate gene expression differences between Ts1Cje (a mouse model of Down syndrome) and C57BL/6 littermate control neurospheres. The neurospheres were generated from neural stem cells and progenitors isolated from the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles from adult mice.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted for hybridization to arrays from 3 pairs of Ts1Cje and disomic C57BL/6 littermate control 7-day old adult neurosphere cultures.
