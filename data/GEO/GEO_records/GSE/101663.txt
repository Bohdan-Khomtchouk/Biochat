TITLE
Identification of GLYMA.13G317000 binding sites in soybean mid-maturation embryos

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
To dissect the gene regulatory networks operating during soybean embryo development, we identified the binding sites genome-wide for transcription factor GLYMA.13G317000 in mid-maturation embryos using ChIP-seq.

DESIGN
Identification of Glyma.13G317000 binding sites in soybean embryos at the mid-maturation stage.  ChIP and total chromatin controls (input) were obtained for two biological replicates.  A total of 4 samples were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform.

PLATFORM
GPL19246 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Glycine max)
