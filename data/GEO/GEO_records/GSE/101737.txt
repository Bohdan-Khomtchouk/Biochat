TITLE
p53 binding during the DNA double-strand break response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used ChIP-seq to assess where p53 binds in the human genome and how that binding changes during the DNA double-strand break response. In particular, we considered the 1-Mb-wide window centered on the MYC locus. Contrary to previous reports, we found no evidence of p53 binding at the MYC promoter. Rather, we identified three locations downstream of MYC at which p53 was bound; binding at each of these regions increased during the DNA double-strand break response.

DESIGN
Examination of p53 binding in cells with/without DNA double-strand breaks.
