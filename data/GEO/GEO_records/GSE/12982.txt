TITLE
Expression data from mouse ES cells and various differentiated cell types

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detail the role of Polycomb proteins including Ezh2 and Eed in maintaining ES cell identity and executing pluripotency. Keywords: cell type and time course

DESIGN
To assay the global effects of the loss of polycomb proteins (Ezh2 or Eed) in embryonic stem (ES) cells , we compared the expression profiles of homologuous Ezh2 or Eed knockout ES cells to wild-type ES cells in undifferentiated or differentiated condition.
