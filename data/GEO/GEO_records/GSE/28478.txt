TITLE
Hey3Met2 human ovarian cancer cells overexpressing wild type or catalytically-dead mutant RNASET2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hey3Met2 cells were stably transfected with plasmids encoding either wild-type RNASET2 or a catalytically dead form (whose cDNA has been previously mutagenized in the two CAS catalytic sites) or with the empty vector as a control. The control of ovarian tumorigenesis by RNASET2 occurs through modification of the cellular microenvironment and involvement of immunocompetent cells, thus providing evidence for specific modulations of cellular responses induced by RNASET2 that might underlay ovarian tumorigenesis. In order to get more inside on the effect of RNASET2 on the modulation of other genes, a whole genome expression has been run on Hey3Met2 cell transfected with wildtype or mutated RNASET2.

DESIGN
Hey3Met2 human ovarian cancer cells were  transfected with espression vectors encoding either wild type or catalitycally dead mutant RNASET2. Clones transfected with the empty vectors were used as negative controls. Three independent clones were used for the each type of transfected plasmid.
