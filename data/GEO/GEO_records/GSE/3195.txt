TITLE
Gene expression under normoxia/hypoxia in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with mutations in the CH1 domains of p300 and CBP

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The CH1 (TAZ) domain of the transcriptional coactivators p300 and CBP has been reported to interact with the transcription factor HIF-1alpha and this interaction is thought to be critical for HIF-1alpha target gene expression in response to hypoxia.  To determine the requirement for the CH1 domain in hypoxia-responsive gene expression, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated from e14.5 C57B/6x129/Sv F2 embryos that were either wildtype or bore deletion mutations in the CH1 protein binding domains of both alleles of p300 and one allele of CBP (tri_CH1). Subconfluent MEFs were treated with 21% oxygen (normoxia) or 0.1% oxygen (hypoxia) with 5% carbon dioxide at 37 C in a humid chamber for 6hrs. At the start of treatment, medium was removed and replaced with medium (DMEM+10% FBS+pen-strep+ l-glu) that had been preequilibrated overnight in normoxia or hypoxia as appropriate. Immediately after treatment, cells were lysed in Trizol for RNA extraction. Keywords: genetic modification, dose response

DESIGN
4 samples: two genotypes (1 control, 1 mutant); two treatments (normoxia, hypoxia).
