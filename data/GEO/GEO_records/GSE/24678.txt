TITLE
mer1D_SK1, mer2D_SK1, mer3D_SK1, spo22D_SK1, and spo70D_SK1 on expression/splicing microarrays

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
mer1D_SK1, mer2D_SK1, mer3D_SK1, spo22D_SK1, spo70D_SK1 late 9h meiotic time point. mer1D, mer2D, mer3D, spo22D diploid, and spo70D diploid was generated in the SK1 strain background (ATCC: MYA-2089) by PCR-mediated cassette-based gene replacement where the MER1, MER2, MER3, SPO22, or SPO70 ORF respectively was replaced with HIS3 from S. kluyveri then the transformants were sporulated and the homozygous deletion was verified by PCR.

DESIGN
Meiotic time point =9h; Dye swap; Reference WT_SK1 9h

PLATFORM
