TITLE
Rapid and efficient generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells using a combination of three transcription factors [brain]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We demonstrate that the induction of three transcription factors (SOX10, OLIG2, NKX6.2) in hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hiPSC-NPC) is sufficient to rapidly generate O4+ oligodendrocytes with an efficiency of 60 to 70% within 28 days.

DESIGN
Human brain biopsy from 3 different patients
