TITLE
Expression data from human tendon-derived stem cells with nestin knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have compared the gene expression profile of human tendon-derived stem cells with stable nestin knockdown.

DESIGN
TSPC with stable nestin knockdown by using two different nestin shRNA. Total RNA was extracted and fragmented biotin-tagged cRNA was hybridized to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
