TITLE
Expression data from RCAS PDGFB/Nestin tv-A glioma cells within Ptprd+/+p16-/- (n=2), Ptprd+/-p16-/- (n=2), and Ptrpd-/-p16-/- (n=3) mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PTPRD is a tumor suppressor of glioma that is frequently co-deleted with CDKN2A/p16. We show that Ptprd and p16 cooperate to promote gliomagenesis in the RCAS PDGFB / Nestin tv-A glioma mouse model. We found unique gene expression changes within tumor cells of Ptprd+/-p16-/- vs. Ptprd+/+p16-/- and Ptprd-/-p16-/- tumor cells.

DESIGN
Neonatal mice were injected with RCAS PDGFB GFP. At symptoms, or at 12 weeks post injection, GFP+DAPI- tumor cells were sorted for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The mouse strain used was a mixed background of C57/BL6 and FVB/N. Ptprd mice were from Uetani et al. 2000 and p16/Nestin-tvA mice were from Tchouganouva et al. 2007.
