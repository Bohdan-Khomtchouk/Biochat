TITLE
Differential expressions of microRNAs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Outcome prediction classifiers were successfully constructed through expression profiling of a total of 1,329 miRNAs in MKN1, gastric cancer cell line under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, MKN1 under normoxic and hypoxic conditions was used to acquire expression profiles of a total 1,329 unique miRNAs.
