SUMMARY
Schaner M., et al.; Mol Biol Cell. 2003 Nov;14(11):4376-86. Figure 1 Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of ovarian cell lines and ovarian cancers. Cell lines were not co-clustered with the tumor specimens, because these cell lines have a very prominent proliferation cluster (Perou et al., 1999; Ross et al., 2000) that significantly influences the clustering of the tumor samples if the two sample sets are not analyzed separately. Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. Keywords: Logical Set
