TITLE
Gene expression data of islets from WT and βRapKO mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates beta cell growth and mass; yet it remains unclear whether it also directs beta cell functional maturation. To understand the global molecular basis of the phenotype caused by the loss of Raptor in beta cells, we isolated pancreatic islets from 8-week-old βRapKO and WT mice. We compared gene-expression profile by Affymetrix microarray of islets, which revealed that a number of mRNAs were dys-regulated in Raptor-deficient islets.

DESIGN
To understand the global molecular basis of the phenotype caused by the loss of Raptor in beta cells, we isolated pancreatic islets from 8-week-old βRapKO and WT mice.  Then mice were sacrificed and total RNAs were isoloated from islets. Affymetrix array hybridisation and scanning were performed using Mouse Genome 430 2.0 chips.We included at least 4-5 independent biological replicates, each composed of RNA isolated from islets of 5 animals with the same genotype.
