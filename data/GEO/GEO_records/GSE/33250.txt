TITLE
Gene expression in the tail tissue of tadpoles [Rana pirica] by larvae salamander or dragon fly

ORGANISM
Rana pirica

SUMMARY
Tadpoles of the anuran species Rana pirica can undergo predator-specific morphological responses. Exposure to a predation threat by larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus results in formation of a bulgy body (bulgy morph) with a higher tail.  Whereas, dragon fly also induced higher tail tadpole.  The tadpoles revert to a normal phenotype upon removal of the larval salamander or dragon fly threat. The objective of the present study was to use Affymetrix Xenopus Genechip to profile gene expression in the tail tissue by different predation threat.

DESIGN
Tadpoles of Rana pirica treated with larvae salamander for 8days (S1, S2, S3) or dragon fly for 8days (Y1,Y2, Y3) were analyzed with triplicate. Removal experiments were also treated with predators for 4days and then removed predators from tadpoles (-S1,-S2, -S3) or (-Y1,-Y2,-Y3).  Controls were cultured for 8days without predators (C2, C3).  Tails from tadpoles after 8days of each treatment were dissected for RNA extraction and gene expression analysis using Affymetrix Xenopus Genechip arrays.
