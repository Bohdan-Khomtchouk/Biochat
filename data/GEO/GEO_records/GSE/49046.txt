TITLE
Exon Array Expression Profiling of HCT116 (p53null) cells transfected with wildtype p53 and 6 p53 mutants

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The tumor suppressor protein p53 functions to regulate diverse cellular processes including apoptosis, cell cycle, senescence and metabolism. Act as a master transcription factor, it can transcriptionally regulate the gene expression of many downstream target genes. p53 is frequently mutated in cancer by single nucleotide/amino acid substitutions at the DNA binding domain that result in a mutant form of p53 protein and usually loses its DNA binding and transcriptional regulation abilities. In this study, we performed gene expression analysis using Affymetrix Exon Array ST1.0 platform to assess the transcriptome of wildtype p53 and 6 loss-of-function p53 mutants in p53null HCT116 cells.

DESIGN
8 samples were analyzed as a group. pcDNA3.1 empty construct was served as a control experiment.
