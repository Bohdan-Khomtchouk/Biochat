TITLE
Effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on gene expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
C57BL/6 male mice were fed a standardized NCD or HFD after weaning (4 weeks of age) over a course of 12 weeks. Normal chow diet (NCD) fed animals served as Controls

DESIGN
Biotin-labeled cDNA was synthesized using GeneChip Whole Transcript Sense Labeling Assay (Affymetrix) according to vendor’s instructions. After fragmentation, cDNAs were hybridized for 17h at 45°C on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. The Arrays were washed and stained in the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 and scanned on a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix). Data intensities were log transformed and normalized with a quantile normalization method using Affymetrix Power Tools. Differentially expressed genes were identified according to statistical evidence indicated by Student's t-test and fold change statistics
