TITLE
TaqMan Peripheral blood mononuclear cell miRNA profiles of HIV-1-infected elite suppressors, viremic patients, and uninfected control donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study used TaqMan low-density arrays to identify and quantitate circulating cellular miRNAs during HIV-1 elite suppression, active HIV-1 replication, and uninfected status.

DESIGN
Blood samples were from six uninfected controls, six HIV-1 elite suppressors with undetectable viral load, and six viremic HIV-1-infected patients.
