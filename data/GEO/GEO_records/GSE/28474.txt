TITLE
Comparison between syngeneic kidney transplant and a model of allogeneic kidney transplant tolerance induced by anti-classII regimen in the rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The goal is to identify new molecules implicated in tolerance, to determine the implication of these molecules in immune responses to transplantation by gene expression comparison of 27,088 individual rat genes between tolerated kidney allotransplant and syngeneic kidney transplant.
