TITLE
Mot1 redistributes TBP from TATA-containing to TATA-less promoters

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The Swi2/Snf2-family ATPase Mot1 displaces TBP from DNA in vitro, but the global relationship between Mot1 and TBP in vivo has been unclear.  We therefore mapped the distribution of Mot1 and TBP on native chromatin at base-pair resolution.  Mot1 and TBP binding sites coincide throughout the genome, and depletion of TBP results in a global decrease in Mot1 binding.  Using midpoint-versus-length mapping to assess the spatial relationship of Mot1 and TBP on chromatin, we find evidence that Mot1 approaches TBP from the upstream direction, consistent with its in vitro mode of action.  Strikingly, inactivation of Mot1 leads to both increases and decreases in TBP-genome association.  Sites of TBP gain tend to contain robust TATA boxes, while sites of TBP loss contain poly(dA:dT) tracts that may contribute to nucleosome exclusion.  We propose that the action of Mot1 is required to clear TBP from intrinsically preferred (TATA-containing) binding sites, ensuring sufficient soluble TBP to bind intrinsically disfavored (TATA-less) sites.

DESIGN
We have analyzed the genomic distributions of yeast TBP and Mot1 using Occupied Regions of Genomes from Affinity-purified Naturally Isolated Chromatin and sequencing (ORGANIC-seq).
