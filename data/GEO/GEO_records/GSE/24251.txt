TITLE
Expression data from canine osteosarcoma primary tumors (Affymetrix Canine 2.0 array)

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Some dogs respond well to amputation and chemotherapy and are disease free longer than the median 200 days whereas others experience rapid lung metastasis. Microarrays were used to compare primary tumors of dogs with a disease free interval (DFI) > 300 days (n=7) to those with a DFI < 100 days (n=8).

DESIGN
Chemotherapy naÃ¯ve primary tumors were collected at the time of amputation and archived at the Animal Cancer Center.  Arrays were performed on a total of 15 dogs.
