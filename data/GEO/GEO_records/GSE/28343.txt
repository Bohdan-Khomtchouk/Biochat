TITLE
Genome-wide maps of KDM5A/JARID1A/RBP2 in mouse ES cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the identification of genomic regions bound by KDM5A in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and define the functional categories that these regions represent. KDM5A modifies methylated lysine residues on histone tails. We developed anti-KDM5A antibodies and set to detect genomic regions enriched with these antibodies using cells with normal Kdm5a or cells from Kdm5a knockout mice as a control. We found high enrichment with the KDM5A antibodies in normal cells when compared with the genomic background. We found striking identity in the regions enriched with these antibodies in normal cells when compared with the total genomic DNA or with KDM5A ChIP assays from Kdm5a KO cells, showing that the antibodies are specific.

DESIGN
Examination of target genes in ES cells
