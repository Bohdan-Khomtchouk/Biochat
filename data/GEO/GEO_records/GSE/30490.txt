TITLE
Genome-wide maps of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in HY(Hwayong) and chd1(chr729) rice.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
We report the application of CHIP-seq technology for high-throughput profiling of histone modifications in HY(Hwayong) and chd1(chr729). By obtaining about 12 million reads of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide H3K4me3 and H3k27me3 maps of HY(Hwayong) and chd1(chr729). We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation marked genes effectively losed in chd1 compared to HY.

DESIGN
Examination of two histone modifications in two rice species.
