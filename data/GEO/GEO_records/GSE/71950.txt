TITLE
Beyond the one-locus-one-miRNA paradigm: microRNA isoforms enable deeper insights into breast cancer heterogeneity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The product of genomic loci coding for micro RNAs (miRNAs) produce many isoforms (isomiRs). IsomiRs differing at their 5’ end have different seed regions and therefore are expected to target different genes. We used microarrays to study the effect of different isomiRs in the context of breast cancer. The product of genomic loci coding for micro RNAs (miRNAs) produce many isoforms (isomiRs).

We used microarrays to study the effect of different isomiRs in the context of breast cancer.

DESIGN
Breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured and were subject to a negative control treatment or transfected with one of the three selected isomiRs: the archetype miRNA, the miR-183-5p|2|-2| or the miR-183-5p|+2|+2| isomiR. Each treatment was done in triplicate. RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
