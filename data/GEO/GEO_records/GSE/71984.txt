TITLE
Microarray analysis of the deletion of transcription regulator SurR in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis

ORGANISM
Thermococcus kodakarensis

SUMMARY
Thermococcus kodakarensis preferentially utilizes amino acids as carbon and energy sources in the presence of elemental sulfur as a terminal electron acceptor, while it can assimilate and grow on starch or pyruvate using proton as a terminal acceptor, generating hydrogen in the absence of elemental sulfur. SurR is a transcriptional regulator controlling hydrogen and elemental sulfur metabolism. To identify the genes that are under the regulation of Tk-SurR, we investigated the transcriptional profiling of Tk-SurR deletion strain grown in the presence of elemental sulfur at 85˚C by comparing with the host strain, KU216.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, KU216 vs. DTS cells. Technical replicates: 2 DTS grown in the presence of elemental sulfur at 85˚C, independently measured. One replicate per array.
