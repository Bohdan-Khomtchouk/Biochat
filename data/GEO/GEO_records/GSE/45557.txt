TITLE
ERÎ± gene expression profile in MCF7 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This submission is a part of two separate studies: a study of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha)-mediated gene expression in response to different ligands and a study examining the roles of ERalpha and ERbeta in gene regulation in breast cancer cells.

DESIGN
Comparison of estrogen-treated versus vehicle-treated MCF7 parental cells. Each comparison was performed in biological duplicate, with dye swapping.
