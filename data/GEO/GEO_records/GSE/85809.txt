TITLE
Endogenous tRNA fragments are expressed in a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor and Paget's associated osteosarcoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profiled the differential expression of microRNAs and tRNA fragments between a case of a patient harbouring an FGF23-producing tumor and malignant osteosarcoma.

DESIGN
We profiled normal tissue versus tumor tissue in an attempt to identify differential expression of small RNAs.
