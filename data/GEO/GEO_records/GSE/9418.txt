TITLE
Comparative genomic profiling and gene expression of Escherichia coli O103:H25 Oslo 2006 outbreak strain

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
A food-borne outbreak of haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and HUS caused by E. coli O103:H25 occurred in Norway, 2006. The outbreak included 17 registered cases, of which 10 developed HUS. The aim of this study was to characterize two E. coli O103:H25 isolates from this outbreak. Only one of the isolates carry the stx2 gene (by PCR). Since they have the same typing profile by typing method MLVA, we expect the isolates to have identical gene content except from an Stx2-encoding phage. Therefore, we further investigate whether the Stx2-encoding phage has any impact on the gene expression. Keywords: mixed, gene expression, comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Triplicate samples of mRNA from a test strain O157:H7 EDL933 and two outbreak strains - one Stx positive and one stx negative were co-hybridized with genomic DNA from the same strain. Triplicate samples of the Stx positive strain grown at acidic conditions was also co-hybridized with genomic DNA from the Stx positive strain. Genomic DNA for each strain is technical replicates only.
