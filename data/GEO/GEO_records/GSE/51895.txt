TITLE
Histone deacetylase 7 role in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The generation of B cells is a complex process requiring several cellular transitions, including cell commitment and differentiation, that are tightly controlled by the action of linage-specific transcription factors. Proper transcriptional control to establish the genetic programs characteristic of each cellular stage is essential for the correct development of B lymphocytes. In fact, deregulation of these particular transcriptional programs may result in a block in B cell maturation, contributing to the development of hematological malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma. In this experiments, We study  the HDAC7 expression levels in pro-B-ALL and Burkitt lymphoma.

DESIGN
SD-1 Tet-On-Tight-HDAC7 or SD-1 cells were treated or not for 24 hours with doxycycline. We compare the effects in gene expression between the different situations (in presence or in absence of doxycycline)
