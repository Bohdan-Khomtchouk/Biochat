TITLE
Genome-wide characterization of HSF1 binding in human WT and FBXW7 KO colon cancer cells under basal conditions and upon heat shock

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FBXW7 modulates stress response by post-translational modification of HSF1 HSF1 orchestrates the heat-shock response upon exposure to heat stress and activates a transcriptional program vital for cancer cells. In this study we assayed for genome-wide localization of HSF1 enrichment in the HCT116 FBXW7 KO colon cells and their wild type counterpart in untreated cells and upon heat shock. These results revealed that accumulation of nuclear HSF1 in FBXW7 KO cells results in rewiring of the HSF1 transcriptional program.

DESIGN
Five million cells were used for the ChIP and precipitated using 5 micrograms of antibody (cell signaling, 4356) against human HSF1
