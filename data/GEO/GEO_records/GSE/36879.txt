TITLE
Profiling A375P melanoma cells following PGC1a suppression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PGC1a is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates energy metabolism. PGC1a is highly expressed in a subset of melanoma tumors and cell lines. We generated gene-expression profile of control and PGC1alpha depleted A375P melanoma cells, a melanoma cell line that expresses very high levels of PGC1a to investigate the role of this gene in melanoma.

DESIGN
Lentivirus were used to generate stable cell lines expressing two shRNAs against PGC1alpha or two shRNAs controls. Cells were selected with purmycin for 48h and RNA was harvested 48h after selection and gene-expression arrays were generated.
