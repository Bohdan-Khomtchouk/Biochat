TITLE
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 whole-genome tiling microarray design and validation

ORGANISM
Agrobacterium fabrum str. C58

SUMMARY
This research focuses on the design, manufacturing and validation of a new Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 whole-genome tiling microarray platform for novel RNA transcript discovery. A whole-genome tiling microarray allows both annotated genes as well as previously unknown RNA transcripts to be detected and quantified at once. The Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 genome is re-acquired with next-generation sequencing and then used to design the tilinlg microarray with the thermodynamic analysis program Picky. Validations are performed by subjecting Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 under various growth conditions and then using the tling microarrays to verify expected gene expression patterns.

DESIGN
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 was grown under 10 different conditions: a standard condition and 9 stressful conditions. 2 replications were measured for each condition.

PLATFORM
GPL19222 NimbleGen Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 72K x 4 array v1.0
