TITLE
An Immunosignature system for diagnosis of cancer [Cancer immunosignaturing - test 1]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset contains peptide array information from 120 patients from 5 different cancer types using classic blinded test/train method.  This array is library 1 (GPL17600).

DESIGN
A 1:500 dilution of human serum is added to a peptide array (GPL17600).  This array is a two-up design, with 10420 peptides printed on the top and bottom of a standard glass microscope slide.  Samples were run in duplicate.  The average of the duplicates are listed here.  20 train and 20 blinded test samples were run.

PLATFORM
GPL17600 10K immunosignaturing peptide microarray version 2
