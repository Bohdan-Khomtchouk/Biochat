TITLE
Targeting the treponemal microbiome of digital dermatitis infections by deep coverage pyrosequencing

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We examined 36 biopsies taken from digital dermatitis lesions of  Holstein cows. The target was the V3 -V4 variable region of 16S rRNA using Treponema specific primers. We identified 20 different taxa of Treponema using this approach.

DESIGN
Phylogenetic study of the Treponema taxa found in digital dermatitis lesions of Holstein cows.
