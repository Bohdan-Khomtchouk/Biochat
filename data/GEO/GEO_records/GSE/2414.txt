TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of EBV gene in nasal NK/T lymphoma and chronic active EBV infection

ORGANISM
Human gammaherpesvirus 4

SUMMARY
Nasal T/NK lymphoma is a unique subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that is aggressive and incurable closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)3. The clonal expansion of EB infected T- or NK cell is also seen in patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) infection, suggesting that two diseases might partly share a similar mechanism by which EBV affect host cellular genes. In order to understand the pathogenesis of EBV-associated T/NK lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) and design new therapies, we employed a novel EBV DNA microarray to compare patterns of EBV expression in SNK/T cells established from EBV-associated T/NK LPD. Keywords: parallel sample
