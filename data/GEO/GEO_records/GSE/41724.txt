TITLE
Response of Rpp4-silenced plants to soybean rust

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Experimental design:  1 genotypes: PI- (resistant USDA Plant Introduction (PI459025B) line containing SBR Rpp4 resistance gene)    2 treatments: Rub inoculation with BPMV-VIGS construct targeting the LRR region of Rpp4 candidate gene. This  BPMV construct and the plant tissue used for microarray was described in Meyer et al. (2009) Plant Physiol. 150:295-307. Control plants were inoculated with empty BPMV vector. At three weeks after BPMV inoculation, all plants were inoculated with Soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi) isolate LA04-1. LA04-1 is a single spore isolate maintained at the Foreign Disease Weed Science Research Unit.    3 replications  1 time point: 14 days after inoculation    TOTAL: 5 Affymetrix GeneChip(R) Soybean Genome Arrays    LA04-1 treatment: 500,000 spores per ml in 0.01% Tween 20   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Michelle Graham.
