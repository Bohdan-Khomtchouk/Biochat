TITLE
HCaRG-9 vs NEO-1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HEK293 cells were transfected with control plasmid (pcDNAI/Neo;Invitrogen) or with the plasmid encoding HCaRG. Stable transfectants were synchronized and grown in the presence of 10% FBS for 48 h. Total RNAs were purified with the mini RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Chips HG-U133A: - Labeling protocol: Enzo BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit. - Hybridization: According to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix). - Scanner: GeneArray 2500. - Normalization: Employing GCOS software, chips were normalized using all probe sets scaling option and target signal at 500. Chips HG-U133 Plus 2.0: - Labeling protocol: GeneChip IVT  Labeling Kit. - Hybridization: According to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix). - Scanner: GeneChip Scanner 3000. - Normalization: Employing GCOS software, chips were normalized using all probe sets scaling option and target signal at 500. Keywords: parallel sample
