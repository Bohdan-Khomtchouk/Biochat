TITLE
Gestational food-restriction but not nicotine exposure regulates gene expression in the striatum of adolescent rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to determine the effect of prenatal nicotine exposure on gene expression profiles in the striatum of adolescent rats. We found a number of immediate early genes to be differentially expressed due to food-restriction.

DESIGN
We compared control (n=8), nicotine exposed (n=7) and a group of animals matched to the food intake of nicotine exposed animals (n=10) to identify gene expression changes associated with prenatal nicotine exposure
