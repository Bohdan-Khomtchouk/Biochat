TITLE
Comparison of gene expression of memory B cells subpopulations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We investigated the ability of monoclonal B cells to restore primary and secondary antibody responses in adoptive immune-deficient hosts. Priming induced B cell activation and expansion, AID expression, antibody production and the generation of IgM+IgG- and IgM-IgG+ antigen-experienced B-cell subsets that persisted in the lymphopenic environment by cell division. Using RNA sequencing, we compared the gene expression profil of memory B cells subpopulations and activated B cells. These data showed a clear discrimination of na√Øve and activated/memory cells while indicating only minor differences between both subsets of memory cells.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of B cell subtypes (activated, memory IgM+, memory IgG+) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina
