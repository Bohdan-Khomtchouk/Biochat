TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of GMP from Icsbp (Irf-8) deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to study the consequences of the loss of Icsbp expression in hematopoiesis Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitors from bone marrow were isolated from Icsbp wild type and deficient mice by flow cytometry. Global gene expression was performed using Affymetrix gene chip technology. Keywords: Gene modification, Irf-8, knock out mice

DESIGN
GMP from Icsbp wild type and deficient mice were isolated as described by Terszowski et al. (Blood. 2005 Mar 1;105(5):1937-45). Wild type GMP were prepared from two independent biological replica using pooled bone marrow from alt least 10 independent mice. The first was analyzed using the Affymetrix MOE 430A and the second using MOE430_2. GMP from Icsbp deficient mice were prepared from three independent biological replica from at least 8 individual mice. The first two samples were analyzed using the Affymetrix MOE 430A and the third using MOE430_2.
