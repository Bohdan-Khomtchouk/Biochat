TITLE
Transcriptome-wide identification of CELF2 functional targets in T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CELF2 is a critical regulator of alternative splicing during T cell development and during stimulation-induced T cell activation. Here we utilize RNA-seq to globally profile the functional targets of CELF2 in a monoclonal Jurkat T cell line (JSL1 cells), including transcriptome-wide splicing targets and genes regulated at other levels of mRNA processing

DESIGN
We performed strand-specific RNA-seq on JSL1 cells that were unstimulated or stimulated with the phorbol ester PMA, as well as cells in both of these conditions that were depleted for CELF2 through stable lentiviral transfection of shRNAs in duplicate
