TITLE
Variation in primary CD4+ T cell response to activation across time and people

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. Variation in individuals' adaptive immune response is believed to influence susceptibility to complex diseases in humans. The genetic basis of such variation is poorly understood. We analyzed the response of human CD4+ T cells from a cohort of 348 healthy humans, representing three major ancestries, to in vitro stimulation, alone or in Th17 conditions, or with IFNb stimulation.

DESIGN
The SuperSeries includes three SubSeries. The first is a pilot microarray time-course analysis (45' to 72 hrs) of CD4+ T cells from a single pool of donors, performed to define the key timepoints of the response. The second is a microarray analysis of responses, in 5 defined conditions (unbiased stimulation at 4 and 48 hrs, Th17 conditions, IFNb supplementation) of CD4+ T cells from 15 healthy individuals. The third is a focused signature analysis (Nanostring) of responses of  236 transcripts (also in the same 5 conditions) in CD4+ T cells of 348 healthy donors.
