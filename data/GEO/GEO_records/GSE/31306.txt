TITLE
Characterization of miRNA expression profile during human monocytes differentiation in macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) triggers the differentiation of human peripheral blood monocytes into macrophages through an integrated cytokine/transcription factors circuitry. However, the role of miRNAs in the development of macrophages is just beginning to be explored. Here, we used microarray profiling to identify miRNAs involved in this molecular circuitry.

DESIGN
In this study, a sample of RNA extracted from human monocytes were compared with a sample of RNA extracted from the same monocytes after 6 days of CSF-1 treatment.
