TITLE
Wing imaginal disc spatial expression

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Wing imaginal discs were dissected to generate body wall and wing/hinge fragments.  Targets from three biological replicates of each were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Drosophila Genechip 1 arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes with localized expression patterns. Keywords = Drosophila, wing disc, spatially restricted transcripts Keywords: repeat sample
