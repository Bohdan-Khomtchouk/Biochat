TITLE
Microarray analysis of developing mouse cortex reveals regulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs throughout development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neocortical development is spatiotemporally regulated by exogenous factors, but the mechanism regulating timed specificity of neocortical mRNA translation is unknown. We find that active mRNA translation sites (polysomes) contain ribosomal protein subsets that undergo dynamic spatiotemporal rearrangements during mouse neocortical development.

DESIGN
Two samples of cortext total RNA each from four embryonic time points were collected.
