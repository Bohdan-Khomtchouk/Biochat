TITLE
Gene expression profiling of MCF7 breast cancer xenografts overexpressing podoplanin (human array)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression of the membrane glycoprotein podoplanin is upregulated in several human cancers and might be associated with their malignant progression. The exact biological function and molecular targets of cancer cell-expressed podoplanin have remained unclear, however. Here, we ectopically overexpressed podoplanin in a human breast carcinoma xenograft model to study its role in cancer progression. To identify molecular mediators of podoplanin-induced effects we compared transcriptional profiles of podoplanin-overexpressing and control tumors. Keywords: comparative transcriptional profiling
