TITLE
Effect of hyperglycemia on the transcriptional profile of primary human macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hyperglycemia is an essential factor leading to micro- and macrovascular diabetic complications. Macrophages are key innate immune regulators of inflammation that undergo 2 major directions of functional polarization: classically (M1) and alternatively (M2) activated macrophages. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of hyperglycemia on transcriptional activation of M0, M1 and M2 human macrophages.

DESIGN
Monocytes were isolated from buffy coats by magnetic cell sorting using CD14 beads and cultivated in the presence of 5mM (NG) and 25mM (HG) glucose for 6 days under stimulation with IFNg (M1), IL4 (M2) or without cytokine (M0). M0, M1 and M2 macrophages from 4 individual donors were used
