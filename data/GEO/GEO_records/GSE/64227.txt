TITLE
Re-establishment of desiccation tolerance by PEG in germinated Arabidopsis thaliana seeds

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Mature seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana are desiccation tolerant, but they lose DT while progressing to germination. Yet, there is a small developmental window during which DT can be rescued by treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG). We used microarrays to identify relevant genes in the re-establishment of desiccation tolerance by PEG.

DESIGN
Germinated Arabidopsis seeds at the stage of radicle protrusion incubated in PEG for 72h and non-treated seeds at the same developmental stage were used for for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Three biological replicates represented by pools of seeds bulk-harvested from at least two plants were used.
