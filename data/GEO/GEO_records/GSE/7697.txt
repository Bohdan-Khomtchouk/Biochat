TITLE
Granulosa cell gene expression associated with oocyte developmental competence

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of granulosa cells from rat ovarian follicles by Affymetrix rat whole genome array showed that twelve genes were up-regulated, while one gene down-regulated more than 1.5 folds in the normal developmental competence group compared with those in the poor developmental competence group. Gene ontology classification showed that the up-regulated genes included lysyl oxidase and nerve growth factor receptor associated protein 1, which are important in the regulation of protein-lysine 6-oxidase activity, and in apoptosis induction, respectively. The down-regulated genes included glycoprotein-4-beta galactosyltransferase 2, which is involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix organization and biogenesis. Keywords: Dose response

DESIGN
Immature rats were injected with eCG and 24h thereafter with anti-eCG antibody to induce follicular atresia or with pre-immune serum to stimulate follicle development. A high percentage (30-50%, normal developmental competence, NDC) of oocytes from eCG/pre-immune serum group developed to term after embryo transfer compared to those from eCG/anti-eCG (0%, poor developmental competence, PDC). Gene expression profiles of granulosa cells from the above oocyte-collected follicles were assessed by Affymetrix rat whole genome array.
