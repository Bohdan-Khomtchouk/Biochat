TITLE
Gene signaling pathways in liver of largemouth bass by a sub-chronic dietary exposure to EE2

ORGANISM
Micropterus salmoides

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to investigate pathway signatures altered in the livers of female largemouth bass (LMB) and their potential links with biological responses by dietary exposure to 0.2 mg EE2/Kg (1% of their body weight) over two months using a transcriptomics approach.

DESIGN
A high concentration of dietary 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) can activate key signaling pathways in response to oxidative damage may occur regardless of tumorigenesis and cancer. Female LMB received about 1.2g EE2/day/fish (from EE2-laced feed containing 0.2 mg EE2/Kg) for 60 days.

PLATFORM
GPL13229 LMB microarray 15K (Agilent format)
