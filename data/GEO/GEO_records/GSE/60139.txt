TITLE
Gene expressions in pancreatic cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used time-dependent spheroidal cultures of pancreatic cancer cells to investigate how spatiotemporal regulation in spheroids induces epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). We generated a round bottom spheroidal model using Î²3 integrin-negative pancreatic cancer cells in 2D conventional monolayer cultures, and compared the expression of integrin signaling-related genes that induce spheroidal geometry to determine if spheroidal geometry induces integrin switching.

DESIGN
To identify the potential genes whose expression changed in response to culture conditions, we performed microarray analysis of gene expression in human MIA PaCa-2 cells grown under monolayer and spheroid culture conditions for 6 days and 13 days.
