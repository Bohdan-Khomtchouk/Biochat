TITLE
RNA sequencing of Taf4+/+ and Taf4-/- cells in their pluripotent state as well as 3 timepoints during the formation of neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We determined the Taf4 dependent differential expression of RNAs in WT as well as KO cells in their pluripotent state, before and after treatment with retinoic acid and immediately before plating to form neuronal precursors.

DESIGN
Examination of RNA expression in 4 different cell lines (2 independent Taf4 WT and 2 independent Taf4 KO) in ES cells and at 3  timepoints during differentiation into neurons.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
