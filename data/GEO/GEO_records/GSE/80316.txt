TITLE
gene expression profiles in PC9 erlotinib resistance cells after erlotinib, HDAC inhibitor YF454A or combination treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the potential mechanisms of enhanced activity of combined inhibition of erlotinib and YF454A, we conducted a microarray analysis on gene expression profiles in PC9 erlotinib cells. We used Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 to  detail gene expression after indicated treatments and identified  the molecular mechanism during this process to facilitate further studies.

DESIGN
PC9 erlotinib resistance cells were treated with vehicle control, erlotinib (5 µM), HDAC inhibitor YF454A (0.2 µM), or the combination of erlotinib and YF454A for 12 h. Samples were obtained from three independent biological replicates.RNA from each sample was labeled and hybridized using Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0.
