SUMMARY
This series includes 278 microarrays used to detect respiratory viruses in a set of nasopharyngeal lavage specimens from children with respiratory tract infections Objective: To assess the utility of a pan-viral DNA microarray platform (Virochip) in the detection of viruses associated with pediatric respiratory tract infections. Study Design: The Virochip was compared to conventional clinical direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and PCR-based testing for the detection of respiratory viruses in 278 consecutive nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from 222 children. Results:  The Virochip was superior in performance to DFA, showing a 19% increase in the detection of 7 respiratory viruses included in standard DFA  panels, and was similar to virus-specific PCR (sensitivity 85-90%, specificity 99%, PPV 94-96%, NPV 97-98%) in the detection of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A, and rhino-/enteroviruses.  The Virochip also detected viruses not routinely tested for or missed by DFA and PCR, as well as double infections and infections in critically ill patients that DFA failed to detect. Conclusions:  Given its favorable sensitivity and specificity profile and greatly expanded spectrum of detection, microarray-based viral testing holds promise for clinical diagnosis of pediatric respiratory tract infections.
