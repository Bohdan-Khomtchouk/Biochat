TITLE
Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of primary human lung cell differentiation (Rat)

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression during differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells into AT1 cells. Timepoints taken at Day 0 (AT2 cell), Days 2, 4, and 6 in culture (differentiating) and Day 8 in culture (AT1-like cells).

DESIGN
1ug of RNA was subjected to cRNA conversion using Illumina TotalPrep RNA kit and hybridized to the HT12v4 array Analysis of gene expression during differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells into AT1 cells

PLATFORM
