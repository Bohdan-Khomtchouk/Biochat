TITLE
MYC drives resistance to PI3K/mTOR targeted inhibition (Sty SNP array)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic copy-number changes were measured using 250K StyI SNP arrays after selection of cells to enrich for resistance to BEZ235. Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted using Qiagen DNeasy from engineered human cell-lines.

DESIGN
Resulting alterations in copy numbers were calculated based on SNP intensities.
