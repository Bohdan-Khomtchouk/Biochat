TITLE
Microarray analysis of the effects of IL-2 signaling on in vitro activated WT CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Interleukin 2 (IL-2) promotes proliferation and differentiation of CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo. To define gene expression regulated by IL-2, we purified naive CD8+ T cells,  activated them for 2 days followed by treatment with recombinant IL-2 or with neutralizing antibody against IL-2 and compared gene expression between the two treatments.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA XS kit (Macherey-Nagel), amplified using a PicoSL RNA amplification kit (Nugen) and biotinylated with Encore biotin module (Nugen). Labeled RNA was hybridized to Mouse Gene 1.0ST microarrays (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instruction.
