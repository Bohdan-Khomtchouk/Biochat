TITLE
LncRNA Sequencing Analysis of Mouse spermatogonial stem cells during  retinoic acid treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Retinoic acid triggers differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells by activating the expression of differentiating genes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not code for proteins, providing a new perspective of RNA species in gene regulation. However, the function of lncRNAs in determining SSC differentiation has not been investigated. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to profile all lncRNAs in SSCs, and report the dataset of lncRNAs during SSC differentiation.

DESIGN
Spermatogonial stem cells were incubated with trans-retinoic acid(0.3mM in 0.1% EtOH,RA_T) or vehicle solution(0.1% EtOH,RA_C) for 24 hr. After treatment, SSC clumps were collected and followed the standard extraction protocol for RNA before sequencing by Illumina HiSeqTM 2000.
