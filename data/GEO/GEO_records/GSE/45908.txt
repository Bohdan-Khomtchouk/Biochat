TITLE
Gene expression profiles in growth-inhibition rice seedling implanted by the low-energy N+ beam

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Knowledge of genes expression related to the growth-inhibition biological effects induced by low-energy N+ in plant. This study investigated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to  the growth-inhibition biological effects induced by low-energy N+ in plant by RNA-seq. Ion fluences (40Kev, curren intensity=3mA) of 1×1017N+/cm2，2×1017N+/cm2，4×1017N+/cm2，6×1017N+/cm2，8×1017N+/cm2  were used in the ion-implanted experiments. Biological effects with growht-inhibition were arised from the samples implanted by the ion fluences of 6×1017N+/cm2，8×1017N+/cm2  because of the inhibition of seedling height and root length. We sequenced mRNA from these damaged rice seedlings and others. We identified 776 transcripts as reliable DEGs at the growth inhibition sample campared with the control.The pathway enrichment analysis of these 776 DEGs showed that pathway of photosynthesis - antenna proteins was down-regulated. Meanwhile transcription factor analysis showed that genes related to  AUX/IAA were also down-regulated. This study were contributed to a better understanding of molecular events responsible for adaption to the implantation of low-energy ion beam in plant.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in  rice seedlings were sampled after 96 hours-cultivated rice seeds implanted by N+ beam with different fluences
