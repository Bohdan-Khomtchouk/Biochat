TITLE
PTPRZ1 disruption-mediated gene expression changes in human glioblastoma stem cells [HG-U133_Plus_2]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal malignant brain tumor. Gene expression profiling is useful in determining the genome-wide gene expression changes based on the experimental purpose. In order to interrogate the downstream targets of PTPRZ1, we applied gene expression profiles to screen the altered genes that are responsible for the functional phenotype changes. The results will provide a cue for mechanical analysis with potential translational values.

DESIGN
PTPRZ1-knocking down glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and control GSCs were used in this study. RNA were isolated using  Primescript RT Master Mix (Takara). Profiling was established by applying Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.
