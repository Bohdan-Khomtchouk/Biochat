TITLE
Establishment and miRNA expression characterization of a canine mammary gland tumor cell line

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Canine mammary gland tumors (CMGTs) are the most common neoplasms in sexually intact female dogs. CMGTs have been suggested as a model for studying human breast cancer because of several similarities, including the relative age of onset, risk factors, incidence, histological and molecular features, biological behavior, metastatic pattern, and responses to therapy. In the present study, we established a new cell line, the SNP cell line, from a CMGT. A tumor formed in each NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mouse at the site of subcutaneous SNP cell injection, with an average size at 7 days after inoculation of 49.9 mm3. SNP cells are characterized by proliferation in a tubulopapillary pattern. Moreover, we examined miRNA expression in the cultured cells and found that the expression values of miRNA-143 and miRNA-138a showed the greatest increase and decrease, respectively, of all miRNAs observed. These miRNAs might therefore play a significant role in the malignancy of SNP cells. SNP cells might serve as a model for future genetic analysis and clinical treatments of human breast tumors.
