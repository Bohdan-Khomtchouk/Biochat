TITLE
Transcriptome Exploration in Anisodus acutangulus for Further Understanding of the Tropane Alkaloids Biosynthesis

ORGANISM
Anisodus acutangulus

SUMMARY
We analyzed the transcriptome of A. acutangulus roots by deep RNA sequencing to dig TAs biosynthetic genes. KOG (Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment analyses identified 48 unigenes referring to the tropane, piperidine and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, 145 unigenes presumably involved in distribution of arginine to TAs biosynthesis, and 86 unigenes referring to the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis. Furthermore, 82 unigenes annotated as cytochrome P450 family members seemed to be involved in secondary metabolism pathways. Previously unknown TAs biosynthetic genes in A. acutangulus, which encode littorine mutase/monooxygenase (CYP80F1) and diamine oxidase (DAO), were identified by this study.

DESIGN
A. acutangulus plants were collected from Yunnan Province of China, and the roots derived from the sterile A. acutangulus plants (2 months old) as the main tissue of TAs synthesis were collected and sequenced
