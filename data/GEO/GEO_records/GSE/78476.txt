TITLE
small RNA-seq from Karpas-422 (ENCSR905KHW)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from independent growths of cell line, Karpas-422. They are stranded SE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Total RNA < 200 nucleotides in size that was pre-treated with TAP prior to cloning.
