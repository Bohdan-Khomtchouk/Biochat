TITLE
Liver expression data from 31 mouse strains treated with vehicle or isoniazid for 3 days

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Isoniazid induced varying degrees of hepatic steatosis in an inbred strain Mouse Diversity Panel (MDP) study. RNA was isolated from all animals for analysis of gene expression changes in the liver. The objective of this study was to identify gene expression changes that drive isoniazid-induced steatosis.

DESIGN
235 total samples from 31 strains were analyzed: N=4 per treatment and strain, except isoniazid-treated LP/J (N=3), PL/J (N=3), SM/J (N=2), NON/LtJ (N=3), LG/J (N=3), MA/MyJ (N=2), RIIIS/J (N=3), SEA/GnJ (N=2), and A/J (N=2) animals where animals that died before the completion of the study were excluded from data analysis; 13 of 31 strains exhibited findings of isoniazid-induced steatosis and were coded as responders.
