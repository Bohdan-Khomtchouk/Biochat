TITLE
RIP-seq data for CCNT1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To demonstrate RIPSeeker program that is developed for RIP-seq analyses, we generated RIP-seq data corresponding to the protein CCNT1 in HEK293 cell line using standard RIP-seq protocols described in Zhao et al., (2010).

DESIGN
We performed two in-house RIP-seq experiments both for CCNT1 in human HEK293 cells.  Briefly, we generated tagged CCNT1 using a triple tag system that supports lentiviral stable expression and mammalian affinity purification (MAPLE) Mak et al (2010).  The HEK293 cells stably expressing tagged CCNT1 was purified by M2 agarose beads, followed by RNA extraction by Trizol.  The library synthesis was carried out according to the RIP-seq protocol described in Zhao et al., (2010) except that one of the two experiments was done with non-strand-specific sequencing.
