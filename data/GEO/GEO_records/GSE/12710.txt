TITLE
Differential gene expression profiles are dependent upon method of peripheral blood RNA isolation (direct, heparin)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA isolation and purification steps greatly influence the results of gene expression profiling. There are two commercially available products for whole blood RNA collection, PAXgene and Tempus blood collection tubes, and each comes with their own RNA purification method. We examined the impact of RNA isolation methods on gene expression profiles. We demonstrated that peripheral blood RNA isoaltion can critically impact differential expression results, particularly in the clinical setting where fold-change differences are typically small and there is inherent variability within biological corhorts Keywords: micorarray quality assurance

DESIGN
Comparison of 5 healthy control samples drawn directly in PAXgene or Tempus tubes vs. the same 5 healthy control samples drawn in Li Heparin tubes with no PHA stimulation.
