TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 WT, ΔpauA2 mutant, and ΔpauA2 suppressor

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

SUMMARY
PauA2 plays an essential role in spermine catabolism and that exogenous spermine exerts a bactericidal effect on the ΔpauA2 mutant of P. aeruginosa. Not only subjected to growth inhibition by spermine, the pauA2 mutant without a functional γ-glutamylpolyamine synthetase PauA2 became more sensitive to β-lactam antibiotics in human serum. To explore PauA2 as a potential target of drug development, suppressors of the pauA2 mutant were isolated from selection plates containing spermine. These suppressors share common changes in various phenotypes. Genome resequencing of a representative suppressor revealed a unique mutation at the phoU gene, and a constitutive expression of the Pho regulon as evidenced by measurements of transcriptome analysis.

DESIGN
We conducted two independent microarray experiments for each of strains. P. aeruginosa PAO1 and its derivatives was grown aerobically in LB broth along with 300 rpm shaking at 37°C.

PLATFORM
GPL84 [Pae_G1a] Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
