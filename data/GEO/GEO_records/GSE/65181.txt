TITLE
Genomic profiling of IPMN with an associated invasive carcinomas (IPMN-inv) and invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) by array-based comparative genomic hybridization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we aimed to identify gene abnormalities necessary for the transformation from carcinoma in situ (CIS) of pancreas to invasive PC. We compared the genomic profiles of paired samples from invasive region and CIS region of the identical IPMN-inv. We further determined genomic profiles of IDC.

DESIGN
10 CIS region of IPMN-inv vs control (genomic DNA was extracted from normal renal cortex obtained from 12 patients with ureteral or renal pelvic carcinoma).  10 invasive region of IPMN-inv vs control (genomic DNA was extracted from normal renal cortex obtained from 12 patients with ureteral or renal pelvic carcinoma)  19 IDCs vs control (genomic DNA was extracted from normal renal cortex obtained from 12 patients with ureteral or renal pelvic carcinoma)
