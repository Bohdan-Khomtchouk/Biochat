TITLE
Oral squamous cell carcinoma cells: microRNA-34a transfected vs. the control

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare the differential gene expression  between oral squamous cancer cells stably  overexpression of miR-34a and cells transfected with control vectors.

DESIGN
Two head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  cell lines( FADU and UM-SCC-23) transfected with control Lentivirus pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-eGFP and Lenti‐ pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-eGFP-miR‐34a respectively were analyzed. The dual channel method was used to detect the hybridization of fadu-miR-34a vs Fadu control and um-scc-23-miR-34a vs control.
