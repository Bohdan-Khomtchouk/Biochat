TITLE
SNP chip data of CML, resistant with tyrosine kinase inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate whether tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance in CML is associated with characteristic genomic alterations, we analyzed DNA samples from 45 TKI resistant CML patients with 250K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. From 20 patients, matched serial samples of pre-treatment and TKI resistance time points were available. 11 of the 45 TKI resistant patients had mutations of BCR-ABL1, including two T315I mutations. Besides known TKI resistance associated genomic lesions such as duplication of the BCR-ABL1 gene (n=8) and trisomy 8 (n=3), recurrent submicroscopic alterations including acquired uniparental disomy were detectable on chromosomes 1, 8, 9, 17, 19 and 22. On chromosome 22, newly acquired and recurrent deletions of the IGLC1 locus were detected in three patients, who had previously presented with lymphoid or myeloid blast crisis. This may support a hypothesis of TKI induced selection of subclones differentiating into immature B-cell progenitors as a mechanism of disease progression and evasion of TKI sensitivity. Keywords: SNP-chip

DESIGN
To identify oncogenic lesions in CML, we performed a genome-wide analysis of primary CML samples using high-density SNP arrays (Affymetrix GeneChip).
