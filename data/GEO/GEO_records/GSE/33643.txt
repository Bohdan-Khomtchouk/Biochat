TITLE
Comparison of gene expression alterations induced by distinct PI3K inhibitors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal is the characterization of the off-target activity of BKM120 observed in A2058 human melanoma cell line at IC90 concentration (3.606 ÂµM) but not at lower concentrations. Controls are BEZ235, GDC0941, showing no off-target activity. A secondary objective is the characterizations of drug effects on transcript expression with respect to a control treatment (DMSO) of those PI3K inhibitors.

DESIGN
3 compounds, 3 concentrations per compound treatment, DMSO control treatement, 4 biological replicates
