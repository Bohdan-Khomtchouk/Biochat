TITLE
Comparative Analysis of Cas9 Activators Across Multiple Species

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq after Cas9-gRNA transfection with different activators targeting HBG1

DESIGN
we performed PolyA Selection and RNA-Seq on cells transfected with a dCas9-based transcriptional activator (VP64, VPR, SAM or Suntag) and a gRNA targeting HBG1
