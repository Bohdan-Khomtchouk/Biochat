TITLE
Profiling of Candida glabrata during Phagocytosis by Neutrophils

ORGANISM
[Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
Our purpose is to clarify the global transcriptional profile in Candida glabrata phagocytized in human neutrophil.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates with dye-swap for each, total of 6 arrays, were performed for PMN experiments and two biological replicates with one dye-swap, total 3 arrays, were performed for carbohydrate and nitrogen depletion experiments at 30 and 60 min incubation, respectively.
