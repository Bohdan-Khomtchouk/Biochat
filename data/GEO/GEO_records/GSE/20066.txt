TITLE
miRNA profiling of late stage metastatic Her2+ breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have assayed differential miRNA expression between late stage (stage IV) metastatic Her2+ and Her2- breast cancer.

DESIGN
4 late stage metastatic Her2- samples were compared to 3 late stage metastatic Her2+ samples. There are 4 within array replicates for each sample.
