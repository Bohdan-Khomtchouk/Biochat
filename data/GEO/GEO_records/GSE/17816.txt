TITLE
Somatic Mutation Screen of Clear Cell RCC I

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Systematic somatic mutation screening of 4000 genes in human clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Information on corresponding somatic mutations in each sample can be found at These samples were run at a different facility than VARI - scmmlab.com

DESIGN
Correlating gene expression profiling with mutational status To access mutation information in these samples please query the COSMIC database with the IDs listed in GSE17895_Cancer_Genome_Project_ID.txt.gz. ( )
