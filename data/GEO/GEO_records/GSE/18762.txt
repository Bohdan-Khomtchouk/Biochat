TITLE
Hippocampus of APPV717I-CT100 Tg mice brain: Control vs. Triple hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To investigate the regulatory genes responsible for the neuropathology in AD, we performed microarray analysis with APPV717I-CT100 transgenic mice, an animal model of AD. We extracted total RNA of hippocampus in three brains of 11 month-old APPV717I-CT100 Tg mice. Total RNA was prepared from using Trizol reagent.

DESIGN
Control vs APPV717I-CT100 Tg mice.  Three hippocampus per array were used.
