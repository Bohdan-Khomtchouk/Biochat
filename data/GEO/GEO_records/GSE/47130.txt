TITLE
Vector-transduced neurons transcriptome profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
With the goal of specifically dissecting the toxicogenomic signatures of the helper-dependent (HD) human (HAd5) and canine (CAV-2) adenovirus, the VSV-G-pseudotyped SIN HIV-1 (LV) and the Adenoviral-associated vector 2/9 for human neurons (AAV2/9), we transduced a bona fide human neuronal system with HD-HAd5, HD-CAV-2, LV and AAV2/9, we analysed the transcriptional response of more than 47,000 transcripts using gene chips. Chip data showed that HD-CAV-2 and LV vectors both activated the innate arm of the immune response, including Toll-like receptors and hyaluronan circuits. LV vector induced as well an IFN response. Moreover, HD-CAV-2 and LV vectors affected DNA damage pathways - at 5 days in opposite directions - suggesting a differential response of the p53 and ATM pathways to the vector genomes. As a general response to the vectors, human neurons activated pro-survival genes and neuron morphogenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNAs extracted from transduced hmNPCs cells at 2 h and 5 days post-infection with HD-HAd, HD-CAV-2, LV and AAV2/9 vectors were hybridizated on Affymetrix microarrays and paired pair wise comparisons were performed between the mock and vector transduced hmNPCs cells. Each condition was tested in three replicates.
