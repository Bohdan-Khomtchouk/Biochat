TITLE
Influence of exposure time on gene expression of human intestinal epithelial cells exposed to Lactobacillus acidophilus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Caco-2 epithelial cell line was exposed to the probiotic bacterium L. acidophilus cells for a 1-, 4- or 8-hour exposure time or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 hour to study the impact on gene expression levels. The results indicated the effect of exposure time on gene expression levels.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from the Caco-2 epithelial cell line after the required exposure time to L. acidophilus NCFM or PBS.
