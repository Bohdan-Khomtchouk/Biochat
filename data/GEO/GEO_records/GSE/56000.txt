TITLE
Enhancer chromatin signatures predict Smad2/3 binding in Xenopus

ORGANISM
Xenopus tropicalis

SUMMARY
In this study we have examine the deposition of H3K4me1,H3K4Me3 and H3K27Ac and the Nodal transcription factor, Smad2/3, immediately following zygotic transcription and continuing through gastrulation.

DESIGN
We profiled 4 histone modifications (H3K4Me3, H3K27Me3, H3K27AC, H3K4Me1) and one transcription factor smad2/3 (+ chromatin input) using ChIP-Seq, and expression profiles (3' RNA-Seq) for Xenopus tropicalis embryos stage8, stage9 and stage10.5. Furthermore, we have profile two histone modifications (H3K4Me1 and H3K27Ac) in absance of nodal signaling in stage9 Xenopus tropicalis embryos using ChIP-seq and 3-seq
