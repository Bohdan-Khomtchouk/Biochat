TITLE
The use of Microarray Technology to screen for tumor related genes regulated in myeloid leukosis of chicken, during infection with avian leucosis virus subgroup J.

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To survey avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) integration in myeloid leukosis (ML) of chicken, we developed an ALV-J insertional identification platform based on hybrid-capture target enrichment and next-generation sequencing (NGS). In addition, we used gene expression profiling and bioinformatics to associate integration sites to transcriptional activity and to genetic features of the tumor cell genome.

DESIGN
We selected six cases of ALV-J positive and diagnosed as ML for integration sites identify from commercial broiler breeder flocks in Guangdong Province of China between November 2011 and March 2012. All tumors were diagnosed on the basis of characteristic gross and microscopic lesions. Furthermore, PCR tests on the genomic DNA of tissues and virus isolation assay only showed ALV-J-specific positive results in previously study. We randomly chose 4 independent myeloid leukosis samples from the six cases for gene expression profile analysis. And 3 ALV-negative tissue samples from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens at the same age were use as negative controls. Thus a total of 7 samples were hybridized, three representing control.
