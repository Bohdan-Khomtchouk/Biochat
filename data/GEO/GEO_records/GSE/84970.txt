TITLE
Microarray of CHD1 Knockdown in PC3 cells and CHD1 knockout in LNCaP cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to study the global gene expression and identified differentially expressed genes in CHD1 knockdown PC-3 cells and CHD1 KO LNCaP cells, aiming to identify genes and pathways that are regulated by CHD1

DESIGN
2 independent shRNAs for CHD1 and 1 control shRNA were used in PC3 cells. In addtion, CHD1 knockout cells were generated by CRISPR genome editing using sgRNAs. The samples used in the microarray analysis were in triplicates.
