TITLE
Gene expression profile of neurotoxin exposure in rat midbrain dopaminergic neurons

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
N27 cells are dopaminergic neurons derived from rat midbrain and are extensively employed as a model for neurodegeneration. N27 cells were challenged with 2 neurotoxins associated with Manganism (Manganese Chloride;Mn) and Parkinson's Disease (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion;MPP+). Mn and MPP+ result in movement dysfunction and are mitochondrial toxins particularly affecting complexes I.This study aimed to understand and differentiate the molecular mechanisms underlying Mn and MPP+ mediated dopaminergic insult by evaluating the differential gene expression pattern in the two models

DESIGN
N27 cells were treated with 150 µM and 250 µM of Mn or MPP+ respectively, for 48 h
