TITLE
ABA and ethylene signaling crosstalk

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Our current study showed that the ABA and ethylene signal transduction pathways function in parallel and have antagonistic interaction during seed germination and early seedling growth. To further address the possible mechanism by which these two hormones crosstalk, microarray analysis was performed. By microarray analysis we found that an ACC oxidase (ACO) was significantly up-regulated in the aba2 mutant, whereas the 9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE (NCED3) gene in ein2, and both the ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE1 (ABI1) and cytochrome P450, family 707, subfamily A, polypeptide 2 (CYP707A2) genes in etr1-1 were up- and down-regulated, respectively. These data further suggest that ABA and ethylene may control the hormonal biosynthesis, catabolism or signaling of each other to enhance their antagonistic effects upon seed germination and early seedling growth.
