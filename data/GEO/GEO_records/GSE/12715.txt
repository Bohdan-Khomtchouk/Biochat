TITLE
ABA and ethylene signaling crosstalk

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Our current study showed that the ABA and ethylene signal transduction pathways function in parallel and have antagonistic interaction during seed germination and early seedling growth. To further address the possible mechanism by which these two hormones crosstalk, microarray analysis was performed. By microarray analysis we found that an ACC oxidase (ACO) was significantly up-regulated in the aba2 mutant, whereas the 9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE (NCED3) gene in ein2, and both the ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE1 (ABI1) and cytochrome P450, family 707, subfamily A, polypeptide 2 (CYP707A2) genes in etr1-1 were up- and down-regulated, respectively. These data further suggest that ABA and ethylene may control the hormonal biosynthesis, catabolism or signaling of each other to enhance their antagonistic effects upon seed germination and early seedling growth.

DESIGN
Cold pre-treated seeds of wild type (Col), aba2 (or gin1-3), etr1-1, and ein2-1, were grown on 1% sucrose agar plates for 12 to 14 days. Total RNAs were extracted from which 10 μg aliquots were used for cDNA synthesis, labeling by in vitro transcription followed by fragmentation according to the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual rev5, Affymetrix. Eleven μg of each labeled samples was hybridized to an ATH1 GeneChip at 45oC for 16.5 hours. The washing and staining steps were performed using a Fluidic Station-450 and the ATH1 slides were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 7G. Subsequent data processing and analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Microarray Suit Software version 5.0. Two independent sets of microarray analyses were performed in this study. The wild type in this study was used as a control.
