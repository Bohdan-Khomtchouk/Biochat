TITLE
Every-other-day feeding extends lifespan but fails to prevent many symptoms of aging in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dietary restriction is a well-known model to induce longevity across a variety of model organisms ranging from worms, flies to mammals. However, whether lifespan extension is associated with retardation of aging phenotypes still remains unclear. Here, we address whether every-other-day feeding affects age-related gene expression in the brain.

DESIGN
RNA was extracted from whole brain tissue derived from young (3 months old) and aged (24 months old) mice which were kept on ad libitum (AL) or intermittent fasting (IF) dietary regimen, respectively.
