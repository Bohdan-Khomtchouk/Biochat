TITLE
Expression profiling of murine neuroblastoma in transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor arising from the neural crest. It can be mimicked in mice by neural crest-specific overepxression of oncogenes such as MYCN or mutated ALK.

DESIGN
Expression profiling of murine neuroblastoma driven by MYCN were compared to those driven by mutated ALK or both oncogenes. Mouse normal adrenal tissue served as a control.
