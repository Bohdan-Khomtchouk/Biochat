TITLE
Expression data from sorted monoyctes/macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tissue injury, such as incisional wound, results in an inflammatory response as well as acute to chronic mechanical and thermal pain. It is now understood that there is a strong contribution of these immune cells to the pain phenotype. We used microarray analysis of sorted CD11b+Ly6G- myeloid cells extracted from the mouse hindpaw 24h after incisional wound to identify distinct classes of upregulated genes.

DESIGN
CD11b+Ly6G- myeloid cells were sorted by expression of Ly6C (high, medium, and low) and used for microarray analysis. All sorted cells were collected on the same day to reduce variability.
