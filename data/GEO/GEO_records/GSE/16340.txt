TITLE
Rat liver.  Control vs. Chemical treated, 3 days

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The final goal of this study is to develop a short term and highly accurate prediction method of carcinogenicity based on gene expression profile of rats administrated by carcinogens. We conducted 3 days-, 14 days- and 28 days-repeated dose experiments in male F344 rats with 47 carcinogens and 26 non-carcinogens, and the gene expression profiles in liver were investigated by custom glass microarrays. Supplementary file " 73 Compounds for training " indicates 47 carcinogens and 26 non-carcinogens. Supplementary file " 15 Compounds for test " lists the other compounds which are for test.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, control vs. chemical treated rat liver. Biological replicates: 4 control, 4 treated, control samples were pooled. One replicate per array.
