TITLE
Microarray analysis of Rhodobacter sphaeroides CceR and AkgR deletion strains

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter sphaeroides

SUMMARY
To gain a better understanding of the transcription factors that regulate central carbon metabolism in Rhodobacter sphaeroides global gene expression analysis was used to determine genes under the regulatory influence of 2 transcription factors: CcmR (RSP_1663) and AkgR (RSP_0981) both predicted to be involved in the regulation of central carbon and energy metabolism.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis conducted for deletion strains of 2 transcription factors known or predicted to be involved in the regulation of central carbon metabolism in Rhodobacter sphaeroides using the R. sphaeroides Affymetrix gene chip. These deletion mutant expression profiles were compared to that of wild type cells to determine differentially expressed genes regulated by these transcription factors.
