TITLE
Bowel miRNA expression profiles of infants with gastrointestinal conditions

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed miRNA microarray expression profiling to identify miRNA differentially expressed in neonatal bowel tissues with different gastrointestinal conditions.

DESIGN
Bowel tissues were collected from infants who underwent surgery treatment for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP). Infants with other non-inflammatory, congenital intestinal conditions were employed as the Surgical-Control. Differential miRNA microarray analysis was performed.
