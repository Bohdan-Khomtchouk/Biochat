TITLE
Expression data from IBS patients before and after treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Increased numbers of mast cells and their products have been linked to symptom onset and severity in patients with chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain.  Although mast-cell inhibition ameliorates clinical manifestations and reduces mucosal inflammation, underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Keywords: Comparison of gene expression

DESIGN
Diarrhea-irritable bowel syndrome (d-IBS) patients were studied at baseline, or 6 months after natural evolution (control) or oral cromoglycate treatment. Jejunal biopsies were subjected to chip analysis (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips).
