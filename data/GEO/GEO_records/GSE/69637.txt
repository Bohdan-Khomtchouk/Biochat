TITLE
RNA-seq identifies novel lncRNAs involved in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic switching from a contractile to a synthetic state is implicated in diverse vascular pathologies, including neointimal formation. This study was designed to identify lncRNAs that may play a role in vascular pathologies. Primary smooth muscle cells cultured from surplus human saphenous vein tissue were treated with inflammatory and proliferative stimuli, IL1α and PDGF, for 72h and RNA extracted for RNA-sequencing. Using edgeR processed data we found expression of many lncRNAs was altered following treatment and could play a role in vascular disease.

DESIGN
4 groups of samples, n= 3/group each replicate using cells cultured from a different venous patient sample. Cells were quiesced in 0.2% serum for 48h followed by addition of 10ng/ml IL1α , 20ng/ml PDGF or both 10ng/ml IL1α and 20ng/ml PDGF together. Cells were collected after 72h and RNA extracted using Qiagen RNeasy kits. RNA-sequencing was carried out by Beckman Coulter Genomics on the r-RNA depleted fraction.
