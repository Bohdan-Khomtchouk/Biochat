TITLE
Plasma induced signatures reveal an extracellular milieu possessing an immunoregulatory bias in treatment na√Øve inflammatory bowel disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The complex milieu of inflammatory mediators associated with many diseases is often too dilute to directly measure in the periphery, necessitating development of more sensitive measurements suitable for mechanistic studies, earlier diagnosis, guiding selection of therapy, and monitoring interventions.  Previously, we determined that plasma of recent-onset (RO) Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients induce a proinflammatory transcriptional signature in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) relative to that of unrelated healthy controls (HC). Here, using an optimized cryopreserved PBMC-based protocol, we apply this approach to inflammatory bowel disease by examining groups of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitus (UC) patients.  The induced plasma induced signatures are compared to those of Type 1 diabetes patients (RO T1D) as well as unrelated healthy controls (uHC).

DESIGN
UPN727 cells were stimulated with CD plasma (n=22), UC plasma (n=15), Unrelated healthy control (n=10). Gene expression analysis was perfromed in order to evaluate the transcriptional signature associated with IBD.
