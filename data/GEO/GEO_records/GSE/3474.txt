HapMap Yoruban individuals vs CEPH reference

Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It is becoming clear that copy number polymorphism in the human genome is a significant form of genetic variation. We have developed a new method that uses SNP genotype data from parent-offspring trios and applied it to HapMap to conduct high-resolution detection of deletion polymorphism. Of the delections uncovered, approximately 100 have been experimentally validated using comparative genome hybridization on these tiling-resolution oligonucleotide microarrays. We identified a total of 586 distinct regions that harbor deletion polymorphisms in one or more of the parent-offspring trios.  This new method will permit future identification of deletion polymorphisms from high density SNP data derived from parent-offspring trios or other family relationships. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridisation

DESIGN
Eight array CGH assays/hybridisations of 131 suspected genomic regions with copy number polymorphisms.
