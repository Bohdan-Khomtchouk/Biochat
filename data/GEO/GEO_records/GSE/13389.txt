TITLE
hr-Transcriptomic analysis of the localized acquired resistance (LAR) phenomenon in Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
tri38-lar - hr - Analyse the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana plants developing localized acquired resistance (LAR) and a hypersensitive response (HR). The goal is to identify genes inducing LAR and/or HR. Here, we want to analyse the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana developing HR. To achieve this, we used Col0 leaf tissues developing an HR reaction after inoculation of the avirulent strain of PstDC3000 carrying the gene avrRpm1. Keywords: normal vs disease comparison

DESIGN
1 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL4346 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2.2
