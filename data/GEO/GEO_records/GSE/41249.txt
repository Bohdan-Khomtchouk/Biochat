TITLE
miRNA profile of radioresistant pancreatic cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We established radioresistant cell sublines, named as BxPC3/RR1 and BxPC3/RR2 which were derived from parental human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC3. The miRNA expression profiles of the radioresistant pancreatic cancer cells were then compared with their parental cells.

DESIGN
Three samples were analysed. miRNAs that were differentially expressed (increased or decreased in expression by â‰¥1.5-fold) between the radioresistant and parental cells were identified.
