TITLE
Transcriptional Signatures as a Disease-Specific and Predictive Inflammatory Biomarker for Type 1 Diabetes [H1N1_S5_5Pre_5D0]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The complex milieu of inflammatory mediators associated with many diseases is often too dilute to directly measure in the periphery, necessitating development of more sensitive measurements suitable for mechanistic studies, earlier diagnosis, guiding selection of therapy, and monitoring interventions.  Previously we determined that plasma of recent-onset (RO) Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients induce a proinflammatory transcriptional signature in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) relative to that of unrelated healthy controls (HC).  Here, using an optimized cryopreserved PBMC-based protocol, we compared the signature found in pre H1N1 samples to the signature associated with active H1N1 flu.

DESIGN
UPN727 cells were stimulated with plasma that was collected pre-H1N1 (healthy) or during active-H1N1 from 5 different individuals. Gene expression analysis was perfromed in order to evaluate the transcriptional signature associated with the H1N1 influenza virus.
