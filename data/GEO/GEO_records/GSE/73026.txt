TITLE
Gene expression induced by LPS, two amyloidogenic peptides, Tau 623-628 and Amylin 28-33, in peritoneal macrophages and B1a cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Amyloidogenic peptides are therapeutic in EAE, reducing systemic levels of IL6, TNF, and INFg. The fibrils are bound and endocytosed in peritoneal MFs and B1a cells. Differential gene expression was used to further understand the process.

DESIGN
Groups of three female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 10ug of Tau 623-628, Amylin 28-33, LPS, or PBS. 30-40 minutes post injection, the peritoneal cavity was lavaged, CD11b high (MFs) and CD5+CD19+ (B1a lymphocytes) were purified by flow cytometry directly into Trizol. RNA was extracted from the aqueous phase using the Qiagen RNeasy microkits. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 nano reagents kit. One color microarray, Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray,  was performed at the human immune monitoring center. All samples were processed and run at the same time.
