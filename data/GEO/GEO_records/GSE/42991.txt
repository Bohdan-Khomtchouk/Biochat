TITLE
Gene expression profiles of Tet1 knockout (T1KO), Tet2 knockout (T2KO) and Tet1/Tet2 double knockout (DKO) mouse embryonic stem cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Global gene expression profile of single and double mutant mouse ES cells were compared to wt ES cells. Two male Tet1 KO, one male Tet2 KO, two male double KO, two female double KO, two male WT and two female WT mouse ES cells were compared.

DESIGN
Global gene expression profile of single and double knockout mouse embryonic stem cells were compared to that of wild type mouse ES cells. All used ES lines were derived from C57/BL/6 mixed background mice. RNA from feeder free mutant mouse ES cells was competetively hybridized against RNA from WT ES cells. Same sex lines were compared. Two independent ES line of each genotype were used, with the exception of Tet2 KO ES cells where only one male line was used.
