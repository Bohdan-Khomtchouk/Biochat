TITLE
LOX-1-dependent transcriptional regulation after oxidized LDL (OxLDL) treatment of human aortic endothelial cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LOX-1 is the primary endothelial receptor for oxidized LDL in endothelial cells and plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis.  Expression profiling was carried out on samples from HAECT cells over-expressing either LOX-1 or GFP control and treated with or without OxLDL over a time course of  2, 6, 12 and 24 Hours.  The goal of the study was to identify genes expression changes activated by OxLDL binding to LOX-1 at several different time points.

DESIGN
This series of samples is derived from HAECT cells, and for both GFP and LOX-1 overexpressing cells includes; 0 Hr untreated (n=3), 2 Hr untreated (n=3), 2Hr OxLDL treated (n=3), 6 Hr untreated (n=3), 6 Hr OxLDL treated (n=3), 12 Hr untreated (n=3), 12 Hr OxLDL treated (n=3), 24 Hr untreated (n=3), 24 Hr OxLDL treated (n=3).  For data analysis, it was assumed that 0 Hr oxLDL treatment condition (not measured) was equivalent to the 0 Hr untreated condition.
