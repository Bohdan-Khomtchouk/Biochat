TITLE
LOX-1-dependent transcriptional regulation after oxidized LDL (OxLDL) treatment of human aortic endothelial cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LOX-1 is the primary endothelial receptor for oxidized LDL in endothelial cells and plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis.  Expression profiling was carried out on samples from HAECT cells over-expressing either LOX-1 or GFP control and treated with or without OxLDL over a time course of  2, 6, 12 and 24 Hours.  The goal of the study was to identify genes expression changes activated by OxLDL binding to LOX-1 at several different time points.
