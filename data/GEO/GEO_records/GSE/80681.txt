TITLE
Gene expression profiles in wild-type and SUMO knockdown mice after forebrain ischemia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transient brain ischemia massively activates global SUMOylation. A large fraction of SUMO targets are nuclear proteins involved in gene expression. However, gene expression profile modulated by ischemia-induced SUMOylation has not been studied. Using a SUMO knockdown (SUMO-KD) mouse model and microarray technique, we investigated how SUMOylation modulated gene expression after brain ischemia.

DESIGN
Wild-type and SUMO-KD mice were subjected to transient forebrain ischemia or sham surgery. The hippocampal CA1 subfield samples collected at 3 hours reperfusion were analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays.
