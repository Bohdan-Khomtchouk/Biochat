TITLE
RNAseq in E18.5 wild-type, Nova2-KO, and Nova1-KO mouse cortex and mid- and hind-brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from E18.5 mouse cortex (3 wild-type vs 3 Nova2-/- and 3 wild-type vs 3 Nova1-/-) and from E18.5 mouse mid- and hind-brain (3 wild-type vs 3 Nova1-/-) to compare gene expression level and alternative splicing events between wild-type and Nova mutant mice.

DESIGN
Mouse cortex or mid- and hind-brain mRNA profiles of embryonic 18.5 day wild type (WT), Nova2-/-, and Nova1-/- mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq2500.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
