TITLE
Gene expression in a wild type strain (FGSC 2489) versus an Dime-2 strain (FGSC 17937) in Neurospora crassa during nitrogen starvation

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
The protein kinase Ime2 is known to have an important role in meiosis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the Neurospora crassa IME2 homolog functions in self/nonself recognition as well as in the development of fungal sexual structures called protoperithecia. In N. crassa, protoperithecia are induced upon nitrogen starvation. We were interested in gene expression differences between an ime-2 deletion strain and a wild type strain, and due to the role of ime-2 during sexual development, carried out these arrays on media that was lacking in nitrogen.

DESIGN
There is one condition and three samples in this experiment (wild type and Dime-2 strains grown on minimal media lacking nitrogen), and dye swaps were performed
