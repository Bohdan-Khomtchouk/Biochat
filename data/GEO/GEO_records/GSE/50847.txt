TITLE
Global microarray analysis of changes of gene expression in the epidermis of Brg1(i)ep-/- mice at E16.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Changes in global gene expression in the epidermis of the Brg1(i)ep-/- mice in comparison to the wild type at E16.5 were analyzed using micro-array technology.

DESIGN
The RNA was purified from the mouse epidermal tissue after laser capture microdisection (LCM) followed by two rounds of linear amplification. The amplified RNA from two Brg1(i)ep-/- animals were pooled together and the amplified RNA from two control animals was also were pooled together.

PLATFORM
