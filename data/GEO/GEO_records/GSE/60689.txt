TITLE
Identification of LncRNA Expression Signatures for Triple-negative Breast Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify biologically and clinically novel lncRNAs potentially involved in the progression of breast cancer, we profiled the expression of lncRNAs in two stage III triple-negativebreast cancer tissues and their paired adjacent noncancerous tissues by LncRNA Array 3.0 (ArrayStar). Expression of the mostly upregulated lncRNA (BCAR4) from this signature was quantified in the breast caner tissue microarray by RNA In situ Hybridization and bioinformatic analysis of Oncomine database, confirming its correlation with breast cancer metastasis.

DESIGN
LncRNA Expression profiling analysis of the 4 samples including 2 triple-negative breast cancer tissues and their matched adjacent normal breast tissues by Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v3.0.

PLATFORM
GPL16956 Agilent-045997 Arraystar human lncRNA microarray V3 (Probe Name Version)
