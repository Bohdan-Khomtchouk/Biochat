TITLE
Impact of IRF1 on transcriptome changes in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells and STAT1-deficient human fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IRF1, and interferon-induced transcription factor, was found to have antiviral activity against a range of viruses when overexpressed. To determine which genes are associated with expression of IRF1, gene expression analysis was carried out in two different cell line expressing IRF1. The results show that more than 100 genes, many of which overlap with type I interferon-stimulated genes, are induced more than 3-fold by IRF1. A majority of the genes were induced in both cell types, while some genes were highly induced in a cell type-specific manner.

DESIGN
To investigate the impact of IRF1 overexpression on the transriptome of two target cell lines, cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing IRF1 or Firefly luciferase (Fluc) as a control. Total mRNA was harvested 48 h post-transduction and processed for Illumina BeadArray analysis.
