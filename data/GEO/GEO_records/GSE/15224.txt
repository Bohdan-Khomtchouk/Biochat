TITLE
Oligoarray comparative genomic hybridisation-mediated mapping of suppressors of an essential receptor tyrosine kinase generated in a deletion-biased mutagenesis screen

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We have used oligoarray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to identify novel suppressors generated in a UV-TMP based suppressor screen. This approach is suitable for detecting single gene mutations as well as copy number variations. Keywords: C.elegans Suppressor screen array CGH

DESIGN
[1] 2 test samples from homozygous rol-3 suppressor strains mapped to chromosome II individually hybridized to reference DNA from BC6637 (rol-3(s1040ts) conditional strain), using a high density tiling array for chromosome II. [2] 4 test samples from homozygous rol-3 suppressor strains individually hybridized to reference DNA from BC6637 (rol-3(s1040ts) conditional strain).
