TITLE
Characterization of Gene Expression in liver cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Human Agilent 60-mer, oligonucleotide microarray consists of a total of  probes covering 41,096 genes of human. Through a validation study, total RNA isolated from liver cells were used for comparison of gene expression profiles via microarray examination. A list of significantly differentially expressed genes was generated; 267 genes were  up-regulated genes, and 65 genes were  down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
The Agilent microarray platform is based upon the hybridization of a single labeled sample (derived from RNA), followed by one-channel detection. The intensity of the hybridization signal is used to determine target concentration. In order to validate the technical quality of each probe in our arrays, we carried out 6 independent hybridizations on samples   To examine the gene expression profiles between rice root and shoot development, total RNA extracted from cell lines were processed on the Agilent microarray following the standard protocol using five arrays for each tissue type. Raw expression data from 6 microarrays  were normalized and Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients were calculated for the data sets of hybridization signal intensities. Oxaliplatin-resistant MHCC97H liver cell line treated with Oxaliplatin or control.
