TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of keratinocytes laser captured from skin biopsies during the mucocutaneous HSV-2 reactivation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We aim to analyze the transcriptional profiles of keratinocytes near dermal-epidemal junction during HSV-2 reactivation in humans, including lesion, post healed (4 and 8 weeks post healing) and contra-lateral control biopsies. Since keratinocytes are the main target cells for HSV-2 infection, the goal is to define the intrinsic immunity of keratinocytes during HSV-2 reactivation in humans.

DESIGN
CD8 cells were immunofluorescently stained and keratinocytes above base membrane were laser captured from genital skin biopsies at lesion,  4 and 8 weeks post healed and contra-lateral controls; total RNA were purified from captured cells and cDNA were amplified from the total RNA using NuGEN pico kits.
