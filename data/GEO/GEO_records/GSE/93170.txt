TITLE
mRNA profile in CD4+ T cell in healthy control and Primay biliary cholangitis (PBC) [mRNA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), formally known as primary biliary cirrhosis, is an autoimmune liver disease of unknown pathogenesis. Consequently, therapeutic targets for PBC have yet to be identified. As CD4+ T cells play a pivotal role in immunological dysfunction observed in PBC, we analyzed microRNA(miRNA) and mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells to investigate PBC pathogenesis and identify novel therapeutic targets.

DESIGN
Clinically and pathologically diagnosed 6 PBC patients and 6 healthy controls, who agreed to provide samples with written informed consent, were enrolled in this study. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral CD4+ T cells from PBC patients and healthy controls. All samples fulfilled the following criteria (RNA integrity number > 8.0, A260/A280 ratio; 1.9-2.2) by Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a DU730 UV/Visible Spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). All samples profiled the expression of miRNA and mRNA by using Agilent microarray (SurePrint G3 human miRNA microarray kit 8×60K Rel.16.0 and SurePrint G3 human GE 8×60K microarray kit) according to manufacturer’s protocols. mRNA profiling was performed using Agilent gene expression array platforms with RNAs isolated from  CD4+ T cell of  PBC  and healthy control.
