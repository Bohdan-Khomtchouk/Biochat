TITLE
Expression data from retinoblastoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic losses on chromosome 16q are among the most frequent alterations found in retinoblastoma. In this study, Affymetrix GeneChip analyses along with LOH analysis of microsatellie markers was used to identify candidate tumor suppressor loci in a set of retinoblastoma. We used microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed in retinoblastoma with LOH on 16q (M19484, M22590, M22641, M22860) compared to retinoblastoma without alterations in this region (M20517, M22067, M22233, M23209, M23449, M23818, M23896, M23978) Keywords: Disease progression

DESIGN
To compare the transcriptosomes of retinoblastoma with and without LOH on 16q, total RNA was isolated from a 30 mg block of each tumor and subjected to Affymetrix microarray analysis on HG-U133A arrays.
