TITLE
MicroRNA Profiling in Ovarian Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Deregulated expression of miRNAs contributes to ovarian cancer. This study is aimed to identify which miRNAs are differentially expressed in Ovarian cancer compared to endometriosis

DESIGN
Paired ovarian cancer and endometriosis tissues from FFPE were used to isolate total RNA. miRNA expression were analyzed by miRNA microarray assay Please note that each sample represents 19 paired cases tissue samples of endometriosis and ovarian cancer pooled together and ran in quadruplicate with their group mean values, and the raw data for pooled tissue sample is provided in the 'Raw data.xls'.
