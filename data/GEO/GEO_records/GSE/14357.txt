SUMMARY
In this study, we examined transcriptional profiles from 3 different microarray platforms, across 103 peripheral blood samples with and without acute rejection, to find a critical gene-set for the diagnosis of acute renal rejection that matched biopsy diagnosis, irrespective of patient demographics, clinical confounders, concomitant infection, immunosuppression usage or sample processing methods. We hypothesized that changes in peripheral blood expression profiles correlate with biopsy-proven rejection, and that these changes could be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prediction of acute rejection. Disease State: Acute Rejection (AR#sampleid) or Stable (S#sampleid) samples
