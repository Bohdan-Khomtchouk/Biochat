ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
[original title] Gene expression response to the implantation of drug (paclitaxel)-eluting or bare metal stents in denuded human LIMA arteries. Different clinical outcomes have been observed for paclitaxel-eluting and bare metal cardiovascular stents. The aim of this project was to identify genes that might be associated with the observed clinical outcomes.

DESIGN
Human left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was divided into three segments and and two of the segments were fitted with either a paclitaxel-eluting stent or a bare metal stent. The experiment includes three groups: control, paclitaxel-eluting stent, and bare metal stent, respectively. Each group includes four biological replicates (patients 1, 2, 4 and 5).
