TITLE
Eucalyptus xylem diurnal time series

ORGANISM
Eucalyptus grandis

SUMMARY
The daily cycle of night and day affects the behaviour and physiology of almost all living things. At the molecular level, many genes show daily changes in expression levels. To determine whether changes in transcript abundance occur in wood forming tissues of Eucalyptus trees we used a cDNA microarray to examine gene expression levels at roughly four hour intervals throughout the day.
