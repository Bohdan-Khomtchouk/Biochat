TITLE
RNA sequencing analysis of triple cytokine-captured human CD4 T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
GM-CSF positve CD4 cells are found at sites of inflammation. The purpose of this study was to understand their transcriptional profile relative to known Th1 and Th17 subsets.

DESIGN
Human CD4 T cells were isolated by magnetic negative selection and activated with PMA and ionomycin. A cytokine capture assay was used to isolate CD45RA-positive, cytokine negative, IFN-gamma-single-positive, IL-17A-single-positive, GM-CSF-single positive and IL-17A-GM-CSF-double positive cells.

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
