TITLE
Gene regulation of carbon fixation, storage and utilization in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum acclimated to light/dark cycles

ORGANISM
Phaeodactylum tricornutum

SUMMARY
Regulation of carbon metabolism in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum at cell, metabolite and gene expression level in exponential fed-batch cultures is reported. Transcriptional profiles and cell chemistry sampled simultaneously at all time-points provide a comprehensive data set on carbon incorporation, fate and regulation. More than 4,500 transcripts that were differentially regulated during the light/dark cycle are identified, many of which were associated with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Genes not previously described in algae and their regulation in response to light were integrated in this analysis together with proposed roles in metabolic processes. Some very fast light responding genes in e.g. fatty acid biosynthesis were identified. Transcripts and cell chemistry data reflect the link between light energy availability and light energy consuming metabolic processes. Our data confirm spatial localization of processes in carbon metabolism to e.g. either plastids or mitochondria, or glycolysis/gluconeogenesis which are localized to the cytosol, chloroplast and to mitochondria. Localization and diel expression pattern may be of help to determine the roles of different isoenzymes, and mining of genes involved in light responses and circadian rhythms.

DESIGN
Gene regulation in Phaeodactylum tricornutum was examined in cultures acclimatized to growth cycles of 16/8 hour photoperiods (16 hour light, 8 hour dark). Two biological replicas were harvested at each of the eight time points, spaning a 27 hour period. 5 of the time points (0.5 h, 3 h, 6 h, 10.5 h and 15.5 h) were harvested in the light phase, while 3 time points were harvested during the dark phase (0.5 h, 4 h and 7.5 h darkness).
