TITLE
The miR-155/PU.1 axis acts on Pax5 to enable efficient terminal B cell differentiation [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miR-155 inhibits PU.1 expression, leading to the initiation of the initiation of plasma cell differentiation pathway. Additional PU.1 targets include a network of genes whose products are involved in adhesion, with direct links to B:T interactions.

DESIGN
Sequencing analysis of PU.1 binding in B cells using Illumina ChIP-seq sample prep kit and Illumina platform. Cells were from ex-vivo LPS and IL-4 activated (96h) splenic B cells from wild type, PU.1[155-/155-] and miR-155[-/-] mice.

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
