TITLE
Self-Self Hybridisation were used to set confidence 99% intervals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
a- Self â€“Self Hybridisation were used to set confidence 99% interval using RNA from non-tethered cell lines that is both labelled in with cy3 cy5 (theoretically identical cDNA populations) to compared technical errors associated with such experiments Keywords: comparative hybridization to access expression profiles between Cy3 and Cy5 uniformally labelled template.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, cells were split in half and labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 respectively,  4 biological replicates were used.

PLATFORM
