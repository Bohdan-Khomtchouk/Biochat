TITLE
Copy number variation analysis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the global copy number aberrations of two nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines, TW01 and HONE1. Global copy number aberrations were analyzed by using high-resolution oligoarray CGH on two NPC cell lines, TW01 and HONE1. The overviews of array CGH profiles reveal high similarity between both NPC cell lines, but the degree of copy-number alterations were more severe in TW01 than in HONE1. There were 1204 and 1513 genes with copy-number gain (CNVs with aberration score > 0.5 and number of contiguous probes ≥ 3) in TW01 and HONE1, respectively. Among them, 850 were commonly amplified in both cell lines (Gain-TH). There were 3525 genes and 926 genes with copy-number loss (CNVs with aberration score < 0.5 and number of contiguous probe ≥ 3) in TW01 and HONE1, respectively. Among them, 582 were commonly deleted in both cell lines (Loss-TH). The most prominent CNVs observed including gain on 3q26.2-q26.31, loss on 3p21.2-q12.1, 9p24.3-p21.3, and nearly the whole Y chromosome.

DESIGN
Comparison experiment, genome of NPC cells vs. normal male genome (NM). Biological replicates: TW01-1 vs. NM; TW01-2 vs. NM; HONE1-1 vs. NM; HONE1-2 vs. NM.
