TITLE
Parallel analysis of 5'-RNA ends in PSTVd-I inoculated tomato plants

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
5′ RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′ RLM-RACE) is the widely used tool for confirming the direct cleavage of target mRNA by a miRNA. Recently, 5′ RLM-RACE combined with high-throughput sequencing such as parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE) are gaining importance as these techniques allows to assess the large number of sample in a single experiment. In order to validate the cleavage of predicted a target mRNA in viroid infected tomato plants, the leaf samples collected at 21-days post inoculation were subjected for RNA extraction. A custom RNA adaptor containing MmeI restriction endonuclease was ligated to the free 5'-phosphate end of an uncapped mRNA using T4 RNA ligase, followed by reverse transcription (RT) and second strand synthesis using poly (T) primers. Obtained product was slightly amplified, cleaved with MmeI restriction endonuclease and then, a dsDNA adaptor was added to the 3’-end of the MmeI restriction endonuclease cleavage site. Resulted products were sequence in  an Illumina Mi-Seq machine. Retrieved data was then used to verify the 5’-termini of predicted target mRNA.

DESIGN
