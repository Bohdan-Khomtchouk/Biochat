TITLE
Genome-wide Profiling of Gene Expression in a New Rat Model of Cholangiocarcinoma Progression Mimicking the Human Cancer

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Validation of preclinical models of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progression that reliably recapitulate altered molecular features of the human disease would provide an important resource for suggesting and testing of novel target-based therapies against this devastating cancer. In this study, comprehensive gene expression profiling in a novel orthotopic rat model of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progression was carried out in an effort to identify potential therapeutic targets relevant to the progressive human cancer. Microarray analysis was performed on intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas formed at 10, 15, and 25 days after bile duct inoculation of neu-transformed rat cholangiocytes (BDEneu cells) into rat liver and on peritoneal metastases at the 25 day time period, compared with non-cancerous right liver lobe from the same animals.

DESIGN
Tumors were collected at 10, 15, 25 days post inoculation from biological triplicates (different rats innoculated simultaneously). Also, biological triplicates of metastatic tumors (Mets) at day 25 were analyzed. Biological triplicates of paired normal right liver lobe (RLL) from the same animals from which tumors/mets were obtained were also analyzed in this study. Thus, a total of 9 rats were used for this study.
