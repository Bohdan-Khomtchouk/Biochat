TITLE
Skin transcriptome profiles associated with skin color in chickens

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
This work was to study the transcriptome profiles in the skin of chickens with black versus white skin using high-throughput RNA deep-sequencing technology, to investigate the different expression profiles of the genes involved in skin pigmentation, then look for the main differences between black and white skin colors in Lueyang chickens.

DESIGN
16-week-old white and black female Lueyang chickens (5 birds per color) were selected for the sample collection. A piece of skin (8 mm in diameter) from the left back was collected . Total RNA was extracted from the sample using Trizol reagent . Three RNA samples from either the black or white skin samples were pooled following mRNA isolation. The sequencing of the library was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (LianChuan Sciences, Hangzhou, China). According the result of sequencing, some colored gene expressions were validated using Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
