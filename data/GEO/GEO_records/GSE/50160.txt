TITLE
Transcriptional Response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551 Rv0516c::Tn to treatment with 140 mM NaCl for 1 hr

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
To characterize the role of Rv0516c in the osmotic stress response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), we performed transcriptional profiling of CDC1551 Rv0516c::Tn following treatment with 140 mM NaCl for 1 hr relative to an untreated control.

DESIGN
CDC1551 Rv0516c::Tn  was treated with 140 mM NaCl for 1 h and compared to the same strain treated with 0 mM NaCl for 0 h.  4 biological replicates, independently grown and harvested.  One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL17618 JCVI PFGRC Mycobacterium tuberculosis 16K v5 array designed primarily based on strain H37Rv (ORF version)
