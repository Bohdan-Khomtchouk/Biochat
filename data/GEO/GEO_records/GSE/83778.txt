TITLE
Genome-wide binding profile of Dlx5 in mouse T cell lymphoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Homeobox gene Dlx5 induces T-cell lymphoma in transgenic mice. To find the target oncogene implicated in this lymphoma genesis, we immunoprecipitated Dlx5 and sequenced the bound DNA fragments.

DESIGN
ChIP using a MycTag anbibody which binds to MycTagged Dlx5 protein

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
