TITLE
Gene expression profiling in a rat model of monocrotaline-induced heart failure

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Cardiac cachexia is a common complication of heart failure in severe cases and is associated with a poor prognosis. Several skeletal muscle abnormalities have been described in patients and animals with cardiac cachexia; these include atrophy, fibrosis, altered myosin heavy chain composition, and decreased oxidative capacity. It is also well established that gene expression patterns are substantially altered in cardiac cachexia, but the reasons for such differences are not clear.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from skeletal muscle (soleus) samples of three animals with cardiac cachexia (CC) and three control animals (CT). The Affymetrix RaGene 1.0 ST Array platform was used to compare CC and CT samples and identify genes potentially associated with the cardiac cachexia process.
