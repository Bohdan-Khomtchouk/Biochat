Expression data from adult (9 month-old) and young (4 month-old) hearts from C57BL/6J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) has emerged as a key regulator of cardiac function and myocardial structure. Cardiac GRK2 is increased in heart failure and ischemia in humans, whereas genetic inhibition of GRK2 is cardioprotective in animal models of these pathologies. However, the mechanistic basis underlying these effects are not fully understood. We have used adult GRK2 hemizygous mice (GRK2+/-) as a model to assess the effects of a sustained systemic inhibition of GRK2 in heart tissue with age. We used microarrays to determine the global programme of gene expression underlying cardioprotection with age in GRK2 hemizygous mice in comparation with their wild-type littermates.

DESIGN
9 month-old and 4 month-old mice hearts were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
