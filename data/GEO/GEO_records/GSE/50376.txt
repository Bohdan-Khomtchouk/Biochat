TITLE
Zebrafish transcriptomics in 24 and 36 hpf embryos after knockdown of glucocorticoid receptor translation

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To further characterize the roles  of cortisol signaling via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in developing zebrafish, we have used morpholino oligonucleotides to knockdown GR protein translation and measured gene expression in RNA extracted from 24 and 36 hours post fertilization (hpf) embryos. The GR morpholino was characterized previously in Nesan et al., 2012, Endocrinology 181, 35-44)

DESIGN
Single-cell zebrafish embryos were microinjected with either active morpholino or mispair control. Embryos were frozen at 24 and 36 hpf and total RNA extracted for microarray analysis. Three independent replicates (different breeding events on separate days) were performed for each treatment per timepoint.
