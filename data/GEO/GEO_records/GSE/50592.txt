TITLE
Expression data from colorectal biopsy samples - adenomas or normal mucosae

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We showed that a large number of genes and exons were deregulated in colorectal adenomas in comparison with colorectal normal mucosa.

DESIGN
24 colorectal adenoma samples and a pool of 2 colorectal normal mucosae were analysed. We generated a comparison between adenomas and normal mucosa.
