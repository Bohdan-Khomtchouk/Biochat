TITLE
Drosophila midgut regional gene expression

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We found that the midgut shows striking regional differentiation along its anterior-posterior axis.  Ten distinct subregions differ in cell morphology, gene expression and aspects of Notch signaling.  RNA from isolated regions that was analyzed by RNAseq revealed spatially regulated expression of hundreds of enzymes and other genes with likely tissue functions.

DESIGN
10 midgut segments comprising from 1-3 subregions x 3 replicates from each segment = 30 samples

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
