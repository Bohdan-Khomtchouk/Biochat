TITLE
Tissue specific expression of non-coding RNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Thousands of novel non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) has been identified in recent years. Only few have been functionally characterized and it is thus unclear which and how many are functional. Here, we characterize expression of ncRNAs in twelve human tissues using a costum designed microarray. The study serve as a first analysis to gain further insight into expression behavior of a broad and comprehensive collection of ncRNAs and pinpoint a set of ncRNAs we believe are functional.

DESIGN
Expression was measured in triplicates of twelve human tissues using a custom-designed array containing 26,910 non-coding RNA features and a set of 6,856 protein-coding genes.
