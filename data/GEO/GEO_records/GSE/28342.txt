TITLE
Miz-1 is required to coordinate the pre-TCR-dependent transitional step in DN3/DN4 thymocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lineage negative, CD44 negative, CD25 positive thymocytes were isolated from wt mice or  Miz1 POZ-domain knockout mice to analyze the effect of loss of Miz1 in the DN3 population of T-cells We used the mouse Affymetrix MOE430-2 microarray to characterize global gene expression changes of DN3 thymocytes from Miz1 knockout mice.

DESIGN
We performed microarray based gene expression profiling to determine the effect of loss of Miz1 activity on the gene expression pattern of mouse DN3 thymocytes from wt and Miz1-delta-POZ mice.
