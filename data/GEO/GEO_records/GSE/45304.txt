TITLE
Transcriptional profiles of kidneys that underwent reversible UUO model using model mice for erythropoietin-deficiency anemia (ISAM)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have established a novel mouse model for postnatal erythropoietin (Epo)-deficiency anaemia, designated ISAM (inherited super anemic mouse) using a transgenic complementation rescue technique. To identify responsible signals for myofibroblastic transformation of Renal Erythropoietin-producing cells (REPs), we examined the mRNA expression profile of whole ISAM kidneys that underwent reversible UUO model.

DESIGN
Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced gene expression changes were analyzed. Three UUO-treated samples (Clip), three reversed UUO kidneys (ClipR-14), and two sham-treated and one untreated samples were compared.
