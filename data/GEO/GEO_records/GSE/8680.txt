TITLE
HEK and HeLa cells:  transfection of siRNA directed against GFP versus mock transfection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We tested the most widely used control siRNA directed against GFP for off-target effects and found by genome-wide expression profiling  that it deregulates in addition to GFP a set of endogenous target genes. The detected modulated mRNA had target sequences homologous to the siRNA as small as 9 bp in size. However, we found no restriction of sequence homology to 3'UTR of target genes. Keywords: RNAi knock down
