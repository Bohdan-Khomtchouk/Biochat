TITLE
SpDamID: Marking DNA Bound by Protein Complexes Identifies Notch-Dimer Responsive Enhancers [next-generation sequencing]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Development of an alternative method to ChIP for the identification of DNA bound by transcriptional complexes assayed using next-generation sequencing

DESIGN
Next-generation sequencing data from sites identified by different Notch complexes using SpDamID-seq and compared against FAIRE and ChIP data
