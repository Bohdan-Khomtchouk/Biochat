SUMMARY
Growth differentiating factor (GDF)15 is a TGFβ superfamily cytokine and a reported biomarker of heart failure. Myocardial expression of GDF15 is increased in heart failure. Yet, the mechanisms that control synthesis and release of GDF15 as well as the autocrine/paracrine functions of GDF15 on fibroblast function is lacking. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate signaling pathways and functions of GDF15  in cardiac fibroblasts. Cardiac fibroblasts and cardiac myocytes were isolated from adult C57/BL6 mice, maintained in primary culture and stimulated with recombinant (r)GDF15 or recombinant (r)CCN2. Short-term stimulation (30 minutes) of cardiac fibroblasts demonstrated a GDF15-induced activation of several intracellular signaling pathways including a concentration-dependent increase of phospho-Smad3(Ser423/425) (p < 0.05, n=3), phospho-AKT(Ser473) (p < 0.05, n=3) and phospho-IκBα(Ser32/36) (p < 0.05, n=3) levels. However, rGDF15 did not phosphorylate Smad3(Ser423/425) or IκBα(Ser32/36) in cardiac myocyte. Cardiac fibroblasts exposed to rGDF15 for 48 hours displayed differentiation towards myofibroblasts reflected by increased levels of the differentiation marker α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) similar to cardiac fibroblasts stimulated with TGFβ. The effect of GDF15 on α-SMA was dose-dependent ranging from 500 nM - 20 nM rGDF15 (p < 0.05, n=3). Differentiation towards a myofibroblast phenotype in the presence of GDF15 was also supported by higher matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzyme activity in the cell culture medium (6±1 fold increase, n=3, p < 0.05) and increased expression and release of MMP-3, 9 and 13. Immunoreactive GDF15 was predominantly found in cardiac myocytes. Recombinant CCN2 substantially induced GDF15 expression in cardiac myocytes, but not in cardiac fibroblasts. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that GDF15 is a paracrine factor in myocardial tissue and specifically regulated by CCN2 in cardiac myocytes. GDF15 has similar effects as TGFβ on fibroblasts by activation of intracellular signaling pathways and differentiation to a myofibroblasts phenotype.
