TITLE
SUMOylation Regulates miR-34b/c Targeted Gene Expression Program [miRNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The microRNAs known as miR-34 family suppress the expression of a suit of proteins involved in oncogenesis and pluripotency, including c-Myc.  Their expression is frequently down regulated in cancers; however the regulation of their expression is not well understood. Through genome-wide miRNA profiling and mechanistic analysis, we identified an important role of SUMOylation in miR-34b/c expression, regulating the expression of c-Myc and all other tested miR-34 targets.

DESIGN
We established HCT116 cell line that can be induced to express shRNA targeting the catalytic subunit of the SUMO E1 enzyme, SAE2 by adding doxocycline (DOX).  To rule out non-specific shRNA effects, we established two separate cell lines using two independent shRNAs Sh1 and Sh2.
