TITLE
Gene expression profiles upon Meis1 knockout in Hoxa9/Meis1-induced AML

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Meis1 is found cooperatively activated with Hoxa7/a9 in AML, and it indeed promotes leukemogenic activities of Hoxa9. It is important to identify downstream target genes of Meis1 to understand its cooperative activity with Hoxa9 in leukemogenesis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression upon Meis1 knockout.

DESIGN
Murine primary bone marrow cells of the Rosa26-Cre-ERT2 knock-in mouse were transformed by retroviral transduction of Hoxa9 and floxed Meis1. The immortalized bone marrow cells were treated with 2 Î¼M of 4-hydroxytamoxifen to delete Meis1 cDNA. Gene expression profiles were compared between the original Hoxa9/Meis1-expressing cells and Meis1 deleted (Hoxa9 only) cells.
