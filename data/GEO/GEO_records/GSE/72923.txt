TITLE
Human Stem Cells from Single Blastomeres Reveal Pathways of Embryonic or  Trophoblast Fate Specification.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mechanisms of initial cell fate decisions differ among species. To gain insights into lineage allocation in humans, we derived ten human embryonic stem cell lines from single blastomeres of four 8-cell embryos and one 12-cell embryo from a single couple (UCSFB1-10). Versus numerous conventional lines from blastocysts, they had unique gene expression and DNA methylation patterns, in part, indicative of trophoblast competence. At a transcriptional level, UCSFB lines from different embryos were often more closely related than those from the same embryo. As predicted by the transcriptomic data, immunolocalization of EOMES, BRACHYURY, GDF15 and active Î²-catenin revealed differential expression among blastomeres of 8-10-cell human embryos. The UCSFB lines formed derivatives of the three germ layers and CDX2-positive progeny, from which we derived the first human trophoblast stem cell line. Our data suggest heterogeneity among early-stage blastomeres and that the UCSFB lines have unique properties, indicative of a more immature state than conventional lines.

DESIGN
This study was designed to determine whether human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) derived from early-stage embryos had unique transcriptional and epigentic properties as compared to conventional lines that are typically derived from later-stage blastocysts.
