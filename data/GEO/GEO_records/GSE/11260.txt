TITLE
Expression profiling of HCC patients with different recurrent-free survival time

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after surgery is poor due to its high recurrence rate. Oligonucleotide microarrays were used to analyze the gene expression of HCC patients with differing recurrent-free survival times following resection to see if gene expression can predict recurrence of HCC. Keywords: Disease states analysis

DESIGN
32 HCC patients with a recurrent-free survival times that varied between 3 months to > 3 years were used for microarray analysis.RNA from a mixed pool of adjacent non-tumor tissue derived from 9 patients was used as a reference pool for all microarray hybridizations.
