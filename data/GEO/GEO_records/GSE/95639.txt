TITLE
Secretagogin is expressed by developing neocortical GABAergic neurons in humans but not mice and increases neurite arbor size and complexity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression over serial 150um sections of a single gestational week 18 human neocortical specimen. The hypothesis tested with this dataset was that a transcriptional signature of GABAergic neurons could be isolated via unsupervised gene coexpression analysis due to variation in the abundance of this cell type from section to section. This dataset is the second of its kind generated using this method (Gene Coexpression Analysis of Serial Sections, or GCASS).

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from serial sections of a single GW18 human neocortical specimen.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
