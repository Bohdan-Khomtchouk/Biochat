TITLE
Endothelial Response to Increased Shear Stress Frequency

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Porcine endothelial cells were preconditioned by a basal level shear stress of 15 ± 15 dynes/cm2 at 1 Hz for 24 hours, and an acute increase in shear stress frequency (2 Hz) was then applied. The transcriptomics studies using microarray identified  genes that were sensitive to the elevated shear frequency. keywords: adaptation, shear stress, frequency, microarray, gene expression

DESIGN
Porcine endothelial cells were preconditioned by a basal level shear stress of 15 ± 15 dynes/cm2 at 1 Hz for 24 hours, and an acute increase in shear stress magnitude (2 Hz) was then applied. Gene expression at multiple time points was measured using microarray.
