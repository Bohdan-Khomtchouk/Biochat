TITLE
Gene expression in kidney from Lewis and Dahl(S) rat

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Male Dahl salt sensitive and Lewis rats (n=3 each) were fed an 8% NaCl diet starting at 5 weeks of age for 8 weeks.  Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent from DS and LEW kidneys and was subjected to microarray analysis. Keywords: animals with different genetic background comparison

DESIGN
Male Dahl salt sensitive and Lewis rats (n=3 each) were fed an 8% NaCl diet starting at 5 weeks of age for 8 weeks.  Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent from DS and LEW kidneys and was subjected to microarray analysis. The resulting data were analyzed with GeneChip Operating Software ver1.4.  Three independent experiments comparing expressions between salt-loaded Dahl salt sensitive and salt-loaded Lewis rats were performed.
