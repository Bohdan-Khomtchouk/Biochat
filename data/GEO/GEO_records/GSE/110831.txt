TITLE
ChIP-chip from Escherichia coli CC72 cells with RNAP β’ subunit before and after osmotic stress.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
RNA polymerase (RNAP) is the key transcription machinery and its interaction with genomic DNA orchestrates gene expression in response to environmental cues. Dynamic interaction and localization between RNAP and nucleoid were observed before and after osmotic stress. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of RNAP β’ subunit together with chromatin profiling by ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated the dynamics of genome-wide RNAP-DNA interactions during osmotic stress.

DESIGN
Comparison of RNAP binding genes in Escherichia coli CC72 at early-exponential phase, and 10 min, 20 min and 45 min after osmotic stress.
