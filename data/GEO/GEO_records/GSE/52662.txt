TITLE
m6A RNA modification controls cell fate transition in mammalian embryonic stem cells (RNA methylation)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we determine the map of RNA methylation (m6A) in mouse embrionic stem cells, and Mettl3 knock out cells

DESIGN
Examination of m6A modification sites on the transcriptome of mouse Embryonic stem cells and Embryonic Mettl3 knock out cells, using a m6A specific antibody.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
