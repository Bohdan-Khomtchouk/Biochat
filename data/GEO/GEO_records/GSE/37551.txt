TITLE
Characterization of microRNAs expression during maize seed development

ORGANISM
Zea mays

SUMMARY
In this study, two small RNA libraries were sequenced, and a total reads of 9,705,761 and 9,005,563 were generated from developing seeds and growing leaves, respectively. Further analysis identified 125 known miRNAs in seeds and 127 known miRNAs in leaves. 54 novel miRNAs were identified and they were not reported in other plants.

DESIGN
Identification of known and novel miRNAs essential to maize seed development
