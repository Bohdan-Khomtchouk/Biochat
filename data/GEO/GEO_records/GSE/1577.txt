SUMMARY
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LL) and are often thought to represent a spectrum of a single disease. The malignant cells in T-ALL and T-LL are morphologically indistinguishable, and they share the expression of common cell surface antigens and  cytogenetic characteristics.  However, despite these similarities, differences in the predominant sites of disease in T-ALL and T-LL are observed. To determine if underlying biological distinctions may potentially contribute to some of these differences, we analyzed the global gene expression profiles of malignant T-cell precursors in ten T-ALL and nine T-LL using DNA arrays. Ten additional B-precursor ALL bone marrow samples,  were used in a separate analysis. Keywords: ordered
