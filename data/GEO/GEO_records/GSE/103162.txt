TITLE
Characterisation of the effects of paraformaldehyde fixation on transcript quality and composition in skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We compared the transcriptome of isolated 0.5% paraformaldehyde-fixed MuSCs to Live (freshly isolated, not fixed) MuSCs by RNA-sequencing.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis of muscle stem cells that were either live or fixed by 0.5% paraformaldehyde after the isolation procedure

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
