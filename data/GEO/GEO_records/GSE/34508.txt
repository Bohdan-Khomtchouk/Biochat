TITLE
Knockdown of slc2a10/glut10 in zebrafish embryos vs. controls

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
A zebrafish model of arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) was generated by knocking down the slc2a10/glut10 gene using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO). Control morpholino treated embryos were used as controls. The samples were collected for gene expression profiling at 48 hours post fertilization. Experimental details and analyzed data are available in Willaert et al. Human Molecular Genetics 2011; doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddr555

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, slc2a10 MO (7.5ng) treatment vs control MO (5ng) treatment. Biological replicates: 3 slc2a10 MO replicates, compared to a pooled sample of 3 control MO replicates with dye swap.

PLATFORM
