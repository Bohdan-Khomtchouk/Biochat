TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of tomato WT, M82 and pro∆GRAS mutant treated with Gibberellin

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to search for DELLA-independent GA-regulated genes in tomato. RNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to GA-treated M82 and pro∆GRAS mutant. Using a two fold increased or decreased cutoff we identified 81 GA-up regulated and 15 GA-down regulated genes, from which five genes were DELLA-independent.

DESIGN
M82 and pro∆GRAS seedlings were treated with Paclobutrazol (10mg/l) once a day for three days followed by a single GA3 application (100 µM). Three hours after the GA treatment, young leaves were collected and RNA was extracted for Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing. A total of eight samples were analyzed, each treatment had two biological replicates.
