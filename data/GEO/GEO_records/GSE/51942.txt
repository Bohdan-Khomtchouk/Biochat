TITLE
Sex chromosome parent-of-origin effects on gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
RNA was extracted from adult male and adult female Drosophila melanogaster with reversed sex-chromosome parent-of-origin (e.g. maternal-X/paternal-Y vs. paternal-X/maternal-Y)

DESIGN
Parent-of-origin effects were assayed in X/Y males, XY/Y males, and XY/X females.  Direct comparisons were made between individuals with the same karyotype (e.g. X/Y males or XY/Y males) incorporating dye-swaps.
