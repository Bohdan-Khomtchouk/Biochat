TITLE
Loss of H3K27 monomethylation leads to DNA-methylation-independent release of gene silencing

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Constitutive heterochromatin in Arabidopsis thaliana is marked by repressive chromatin modifications including DNA methylation, histone 3 dimethylation at lysine 9 (H3K9me2), and monomethylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me1). The enzymes catalyzing DNA methylation and H3K9me2 have been identified and mutations in these proteins lead to the reactivation of silenced heterochromatic elements. The enzymes responsible for heterochromatic H3K27me1, in contrast, remain unknown. Here we show that the divergent SET-domain proteins ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED PROTEIN5 (ATXR5) and ATXR6 exhibit H3K27 monomethyltransferase activity and double mutants have reduced H3K27me1 in vivo and show partial heterochromatin decondensation. atxr5 atxr6 plants also show transcriptional activation of repressed heterochromatic elements. Interestingly, H3K9me2 and DNA methylation are unaffected in the double mutant. These results indicate that ATXR5 and ATXR6 form a novel class of H3K27 methyltransferases and that H3K27me1 represents a new pathway required for transcriptional repression in Arabidopsis.
