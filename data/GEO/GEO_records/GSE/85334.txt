TITLE
Gal R regulates gene expression while arranging chromosome structure.

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
To understand the altered gene expression in galR minus cells, the cells were grown in the absence of D-galactose and tiling array analysis was performed for transcriptome profiling.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were isolated from Escherichia coli galR minus strain grown in the absence of D-galactose. The transcriptome profile of galR minus cells was figured out in relation to wild type.
