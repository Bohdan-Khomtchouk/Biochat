TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of impact of B cells from the peripheral blood of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients versus B cells from healthy donors on CD14+ PBMCs from healthy donors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD14+ cells in the PBMCs of CLL patients are converted into NLCs. CD14+ PBMCs from healthy donors when cultured with CLL cells give rise to differentiated cells called CD14CLL-cells, which are immunophenotypically similar to NLCs. CD14+ PBMCs from healthy donors when cultured with non-malignant B cells give rise to differentiated cells called CD14B-cells. Transcriptome wide analysis reveals genes involved in immune response to be significantly deregulated between CD14B-cells and CD14CLL-cells/NLCs.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from NLCs, CD14CLL-cells and CD14B-cells and hybridised to arrays (4 samples in each group)
