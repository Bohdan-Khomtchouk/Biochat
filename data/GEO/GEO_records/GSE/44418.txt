TITLE
Aberrant BAF57 Signaling Facilitates Pro-metastatic Phenotypes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
BAF57, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex conglomerate,modulates  androgen receptor activity to promote prostate cancer. However the molecular consequences of tumor associated BAF57 elevation have remianed undefined in advanced disease such as castration resistant prostate cancer and/or metastasis Global gene expression analyses were performed in models mimicking tumor-associated BAF57 expression. These analyses demonstrated that BAF57 deregulation circumvented androgen mediated signaling and elicited upregulation of Î±2 integrin and other migration and metastasis related gene signatures.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were transfected to overexpress BAF57 and validated for BAF57 transcript induction. Appropriate vector control transfected cells were also used. Vector and BAF57 transfected samples were treated with 0.1% vehicle with a 1nM DHT vector control. Gene expression analyses were performed on biological duplicates.
