TITLE
Tonsil cancer compared with normal tonsil tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; synthetic construct

SUMMARY
To investigate miRNA expression in human tonsil squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to normal tonsil tissue. Two colour LNA Exiqon array. MicroRNAs were labeled at 3'-end with a P-CU-C3-Cy3 RNA linker. A mixture of 371 synthetic DNA reference oligonucleotides containing complementary sequences to all LNA probes was randomly labeled using the ULYSIS labeling kit.

DESIGN
Two groups, tumor SCC and normal tissue samples were arrayed and then expression compared. HNxx identifiers with the same number are from the same patient, either tumor tissue (T) or adjacent normal tissue (N). Arrays were carried out in duplicate, denoted by 1 and 2.

PLATFORM
GPL21198 UTS human microRNA array (miRBase release 7.1)
