TITLE
Expresion data from yeast (wild type and gcn5 mutants) exposed to Congo Red (CR)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We analyzed the genome-wide expression profile of the wild type strain and the gcn5 mutant (component of the SAGA complex) under basal and cell wall stress (CR during 3 hours) conditions.

DESIGN
Three biological samples were analyzed for each strain (wild type and gcn5 mutant) and condition (with and without CR). A microarray experiment were carried out for each sample.
