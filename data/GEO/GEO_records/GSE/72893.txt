TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis of Regulatory T cell-conditioned dendritic cells to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning dendritic cell suppression in graft versus host disease (GvHD)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of Treg-conditioned dendritic cells (DCs) compared to LPS-matured DCs and immature DCs. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that Treg conditioning alters the gene expression profile of DCs to result in that of a semi-mature phenotype. The results provide important information on how Tregs modulate DC function.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from mature DC and Treg-conditioned DC following 24 hr 100 ng/ml LPS treatment. RNA was isolated from immature DC at the same time-point to serve as a control.
