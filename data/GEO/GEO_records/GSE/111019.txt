TITLE
Gene expression data obtained from Oryza sativa adventitious roots (2-6 cm behind the root tip) grown in nutrient solution with (30 mgL-1) and without (3 mgL-1) Si

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
Si has a wide range of effects in plant growth. One of these effects is the Si mediated formation of Casparian bands (CB), and thereby a reduced radial oxygen loss (ROL). The GeneChip provided evidence for involved genes in plant Si reaction. The given GeneChip-data revealed and influence of Si in the uptake of Fe. Additionally several genes involved in CB formation were found regulated through Si.

DESIGN
Oryza sativa ssp. Japonica cv. Selenio roots were germinated for 14d and harvested 28 days after transfer in nutrient solution. The experimental design included two different Si conditions with 30 mgL-1 SiOH4 (Plus_Si) and, as a control, 3 mgL-1 Si (Minus_Si). Four biological replicates consisting of pools of adventitious roots of roots of five plants grown in the same pot were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChips. The Affymetrix GeneChip had two technical repetitions.
