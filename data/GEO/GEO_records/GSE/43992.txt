TITLE
miRNA in human lung fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
By employing miRCURYâ„¢ LNA array, we have identified a subset (79) of the total number of miRNAs that are differentially expressed in TGF beta1-treated human lung fibroblasts MRC-5 cells, as compared to untreated control cells

DESIGN
To know the differential expression of miRNA in human lung fibroblasts after treatment of TGF beta1
