TITLE
Single cell mRNAseq of Olfactory Epithelium and Neurog1-eGFP+ progenitors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Single cell mRNAseq maps a global landscape of transcriptomes in uninjured tissue, showing clear transitions from neuronally fated progenitors to mature neurons and other mature cell types. Comparison with injured Neurog1-eGFP+ cells shows a dedifferentiation of cells towards a multipotent stem cell transcriptome.

DESIGN
Single cell transcriptomic analysis using Fluidigm C1 Autoprep of uninjured, unsorted mouse olfactory epithelium as a reference, compared to Neurog1-eGFP+ progenitors sorted from uninjured, 5 and 14 days post olfactory bulbectomy, and OMP-eGFP+ mature sensory neurons post olfactory bulbectomy

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
