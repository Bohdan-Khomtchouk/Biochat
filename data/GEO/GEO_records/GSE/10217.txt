TITLE
High resolution mapping of DNA replication origins in human genome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Because of the lack of information, regulation of DNA replication initiation in mammals is still poorly understood. In order to identify general rules, we have mapped replication origins along 1% of the human genome in HeLa cells. We found large gene-poor regions lacking origin and G+C rich regions containing clusters of closely spaced origins. Half of the 283 origins mapped are within or near CpG islands. The connection with gene expression is further reinforced by the observation that most origins overlap with DNAseI hypersensitive sites found at transcriptional regulatory elements. We show, however, that this association is independent of chromatin structure and transcriptional activity. Replication timing analyses coupled to our origin mapping demonstrate that origin dense regions and isolated origins are replicated at every moment in S phase. All together, our data suggest that a relatively strict origin-timing programme regulates DNA replication of the human genome. Keywords: Nascent strands, ENCODE project, HeLAS3 cells, SNS-Chip
