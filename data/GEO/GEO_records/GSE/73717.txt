TITLE
Gene expression profiling of mouse luminal uterine epithelium with knockout of ALK3

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) family members that regulate the post-implantation and mid-gestation stages of pregnancy. In this study we discovered that signaling via activin-like kinase 3 (ALK3/BMPR1A), a BMP type 1 receptor, is necessary for blastocyst attachment. To understand the role of ALK3 in the luminal uterine epithelium, we obtained the gene expression profiles of isolated luminal uterine epithelium from 3.5dpc control and Alk3 cKO mice.
