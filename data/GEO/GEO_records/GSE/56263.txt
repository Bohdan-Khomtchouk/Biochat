TITLE
Matrine derivative 1b(MASM) offers radioprotection and modulates acute lethal total-body irradiation-induced alterations of gene expression

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To further investigate the potential molecular basis of the protective effects of MASM on irradiation (6.5Gy)  damage, gene expression analysis was conducted on rats liver tissues using microarrays. Pre-treatment with MASM prevented differential expression of 53% (766 genes) of 1445 genes differentially expressed in response to radiation. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these genes were mainly involved in a total of 21 pathways, such as metabolic pathways, pathways in cancer, and MAPK signaling pathway.

DESIGN
The rats were randomly assigned to one of the three following treatment groups (10-12 animals per group): normal control, radiation and MASM dose (30 mg/kg body weight/day) + radiation. MASM dissolved in double distilled water were administered intragastrically to the male animals for 3 consecutive days before irradiation. Radiation induced gene expression in rat liver was measured at 24 hours after 6.5 Gy exposure.
