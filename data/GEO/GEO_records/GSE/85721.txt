TITLE
Single nuclei RNA-seq from adult mouse Hippocampus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report RNA-seq of single nuclei isolated from the adult C57BL/6 male mouse Hippocampus region. Majority of the nuclei were isolated from 12 weeks old mice (4 different animal), with an additional set of nuclei from 3 months and 2 years old animals. In addition a set of GFP labeled nuclei driven by a VGAT promoter .

DESIGN
Microdissections of dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA2/3 regions of the Hippocampus were placed into ice-cold  RNA-later for fixation and stored at 4∘c overnight, then stored in -80∘c. Nuclei were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation and kept on ice until sorting using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) into 96 well plates containing RNA lysis buffer. Single nucleus RNA was first purified then derived cDNA libraries were generated following a modified Smart-seq2 protocol. For VGAT nuclei: high titer AAV1/2 of pAAV-EF1a-DIO-EYFP-KASH-WPRE-hGH-polyA was injected into dorsal and/or ventral Hippocampus, animals were sacrificed two weeks after injections, and GFP labeled nuclei were sorted into plates and processed as described above.
