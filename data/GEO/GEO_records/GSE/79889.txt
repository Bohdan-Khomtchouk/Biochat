TITLE
QKI's function in neural stem cells (NSCs) and pre-malignant NSCs (PM-NSCs) and transcriptome of Nestin-CreERT2 PtenLoxP/LoxP p53LoxP/LoxP QKILoxP/LoxP (QPP) mouse glioblastoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study is to determine the impact of QKI deletion on transcriptomes of mouse NSC and PM-NSC and to analyze the transcriptomic profiles of Nestin-CreERT2 PtenLoxP/LoxP p53LoxP/LoxP QKILoxP/LoxP (QPP) mouse glioblastoma and to determine which subtypes these tumors belong to

DESIGN
NSCs of different genetic background (Nestin-CreERT2 QKI+/+, Nestin-CreERT2 QKILoxP/LoxP, Nestin-CreERT2 PtenLoxP/LoxP p53LoxP/LoxP and Nestin-CreERT2 PtenLoxP/LoxP p53LoxP/LoxP QKILoxP/LoxP) were isolated from postnatal day one SVZs and then treated with either EtOH or 4OHT for two days. Nestin-CreERT2 PtenLoxP/LoxP p53LoxP/LoxP QKILoxP/LoxP (QPP) mice were treated with tamoxifen at day8-10, and mouse brain tumors were collected. The total RNAs of NSCs, PM-NSCs and brain tumors were extracted by Rnasey kit and sent for sequencing with llumina HiSeq2000 Sequencer.
