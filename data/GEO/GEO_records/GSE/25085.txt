TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles by CD3+CD4+ thymocytes derived from fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were obtained from fetal liver, fetal bone marrow (BM), and adult BM. These were injected into human fetal thymic implants in SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice (4-6 separate mice per HSC donor) and allowed to mature into single positive CD4+ (SP4) thymocytes over the course of 7-8 weeks. SP4 thymocytes from injected stem cells were subsequently sort-purified from thymic implants and gene expression was performed.

DESIGN
HSC from fetal (age 18-22 gestational weeks) and adult (age: 19-43 year old) HLA-A2+ donors were obtained from different tissues. After injection into human fetal thymic implants (SCID-hu Thy/Liv HLA-A2-) the cells were allowed to mature into thymocytes and sorted on the basis of HLA-A2+ expression and CD3+CD4+ (SP4) expression. 3 separate thymic implants were analyzed for each group.
