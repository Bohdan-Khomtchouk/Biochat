TITLE
Gene expression profiling of seborrheic keratosis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Seborrheic keratosis is benign cutaneous neoplasm, the etiology of which is not well-known. To characterize differential gene expression profiles in seborrheic keratosis, we investigated the genome-wide patterns of gene expression from skin with seborrhic keratosis and uninvolved normal skin using cDNA microarrays.

DESIGN
Comparative RNA expression profiles from non-lesional and lesional skin of 4 patients with seborrheic keratosis
