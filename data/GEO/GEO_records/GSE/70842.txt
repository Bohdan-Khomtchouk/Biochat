TITLE
Expression analysis of seeds and seedlings of tomato growing on regular MS medium or MS medium supplemented with Helical multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Helical MWCNTs) in concentration 25 ug/ml

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
To investigate effects of Helical multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Helical MWCNTs) on total expression profile of tomato seeds and young sedlings we introduced Helical MWCNTs in MS agar medium in concentrationd of 25 ug/ml. Objectives for this study included the identification of genes that were up or down-regulated at the transcriptional level in tomato seeds and seedlings in response to application of Helical MWCNTs

DESIGN
Tomato seeds (1 day after placement of medium) and 11-days old seedlings growing on regular MS agar medium or MS medium supplemented with Helical MWCNTs (25 ug/ml) were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
