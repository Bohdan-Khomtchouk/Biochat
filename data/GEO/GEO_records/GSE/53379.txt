TITLE
Phenotype specific analyses of p53 reveal distinct regulatory mechanism for chronically activated p53

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microarray analysis with and without sh-p53 in IMR90 (normal human diploid fiborblasts)

DESIGN
Phenotypes were created by overexpression of RasG12V, E1A/RasG12V in IMR90 cells, in growing IMR90,  inr quiescent IMR90 cells (3 days confluence) and 24 or 48 hours Etoposide treated IMR90 cells were subjected to lentiviral knockdown of p53 or vector
