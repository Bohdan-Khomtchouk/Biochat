TITLE
Gene expression changes in MV4-11 cells upon SMARCA4 knock-down and PFI-3 treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pharmacological inhibition of the SMARCA4 bromodomain inhibited human leukemic cell proliferation, phenocopying SMARCA4 knockdown in these cells. We performed microarray analysis of global gene expression changes in MV4-11 cells after 6 days of PFI-3 treatment and after SMARCA4 knock-down. With this analysis we identified several genes whose expression was similarly up- or down-regulated upon inhibitor treatment and SMARCA4 depletion.

DESIGN
Human acute monocytic leukemia cells (MV4-11, ACC 102) were lentivirally transduced with shRNA taregting SMARCA4 (KD) or with a negative control shRNA (Scr). In a parallel experiment MV4-11 cells were treated for 6 days with 10Î¼M PFI-3, which is SMARCA4, SMARCA2 and PBRM1 bromodomain inhibitor, or DMSO as a negative control. All sample types were prepared in triplicates.
