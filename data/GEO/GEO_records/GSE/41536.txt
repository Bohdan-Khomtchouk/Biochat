TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for pulmonary adenocarcinomas with or without ALK fusion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ALK fusion positive tumor constitutes a unique entitiy in lung adenocarcionmas. We compared the allelokaryotypes of ALK fusion positive and negative tumors with SNP array to get insight into the difference of genomic background of them.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis with Affymetrix 250K SNP arrays of 35 ALK fusion positive and 95 ALK fusion negative lung adenocarcinomas was performed with annonymous references.
