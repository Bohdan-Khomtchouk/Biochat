TITLE
Characterization of mouse embryonic stem cells without any G1 cyclins

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed regular RNA-seq to understand G1 cyclins function in ES cells

DESIGN
Regular RNA-seq was performed for in wild-type ES cells and ES cells without any G1 cyclins (called Q-KO ES cells)

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
