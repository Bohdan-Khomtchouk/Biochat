TITLE
TALEN-Engineered AR Gene Rearrangements Reveal Endocrine Uncoupling of Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This experiment addressed the question of whether full length Androgen receptor and Androgen Receptor variant ARv567es have similar transciptional activities.  The transcriptomes of R1-AD1, a AR full length expressing cell line, are compared in an AR on (1nM DHT) to an AR off (ethanol vehicle) state.  R1-D567 was derived from R1-AD1 and modified with TALENs in such a way as to express only AR-V567es.  The AR on and off states were induced with a control siRNA (AR on) or a siRNA targeting exon 1 (AR off).

DESIGN
R-AD1 was cultured for 24 hours in either base RPMI media with 1nM DHT or ethanol vehichle and RNA extracted.  R1-D567 cells were electroporated with control siRNA or siRNA targeting exon 1 of AR and allowed to recover 48 hours and then cultured in base media with 1nM DHT or ethanol for 24 hrs.  Each conditon was done in triplicate.
