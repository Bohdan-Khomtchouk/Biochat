TITLE
Expression data from HUVEC with YAP siRNA knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
YAP knockdown in HUVEC elicits proliferation and cell cycle preogression defects. YAP deficient cells caused arrest in G1 and defects in S-phase entry. The microarray analysis was conducted to identify potential YAP targets that are involved in HUVEC cell cycle regulation

DESIGN
mRNA samples were collected from siRNA treated HUVECs 30 hour after transfection. Four biological replicates were used for each condition: control (RISC-free) and knockdown (siYAP#1 and siYAP#2)
