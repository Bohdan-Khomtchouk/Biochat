Chromosomal aberrations in benign and malignant salivary gland myoepitheliomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Salivary gland myoepithelial tumors are relatively uncommon tumors with an unpredictable clinical course. More knowledge about their genetic profiles is necessary to identify novel predictors of disease. In this study, we subjected 27 primary tumors (15 myoepitheliomas and 12 myoepithelial carcinomas) to genome-wide microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). We set out to delineate known chromosomal aberrations in more detail and to unravel chromosomal differences between benign myoepitheliomas and myoepithelial carcinomas. Patterns of DNA copy number aberrations were analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis. Both benign and malignant tumors revealed a limited amount of chromosomal alterations (median of 5 and 7.5 respectively). In both tumor groups, high frequency gains (≥20%) were found mainly at loci of growth factors and growth factor receptors (e.g. PDGF, FGF(R)s, and EGFR). In myoepitheliomas, high frequency losses (≥20%) were detected at regions of proto-cadherins. Cluster analysis of the array CGH data identified three clusters. Differential copy numbers on chromosome arm 8q and chromosome 17 set the clusters apart. Cluster 1 contained a mixture of the two phenotypes (n=10), cluster 2 included mostly benign tumors (n=10), and cluster 3 only contained carcinomas (n=7). Supervised analysis between malignant and benign tumors revealed a 36 Mbp-region at 8q being more frequently gained in malignant tumors (p=0.007, FDR=0.05). This is the first study investigating genomic differences between benign and malignant myoepithelial tumors of the salivary glands at a genomic level. Both unsupervised and supervised analysis of the genomic profiles revealed chromosome arm 8q to be involved in the malignant phenotype of salivary gland myoepitheliomas.
