TITLE
Gcn5 and PCAF negatively regulate interferon Î² production through HAT-independent inhibition of TBK1 [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gcn5/PCAF double knockout (dKO) leads to loss of the global H3K9ac. RNA-Seq was performed to define the changes of gene expression in response to Gcn5/PCAF deletion and H3K9ac loss

DESIGN
PCAF-/-;Gcn5f/D MEFs were infected with retroviral Cre to delete Gcn5 to generate Gcn5/PCAF dKO cells, followed by RNA-Seq analysis using spike-in RNA as controls

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
