TITLE
Transforming properties of 8p11-12 amplified genes in human breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCF10A cells was transduced with WHSC1L1 short isoform lentiviral expression vector.  Expression profiling of  MCF10A-WHSC1L1 cells, and breast cancer SUM-44 cells were performed

DESIGN
To identify genes most likely to be regulated by over expression of WHSC1L1 and relevant to human breast cancer, we determined which genes are differentially expressed in MCF10A-WHSC1L1 cells relative to parental MCF10A cells, and then determined which of those genes are also differentially expressed in SUM-44 cells compared to MCF10A cells.
