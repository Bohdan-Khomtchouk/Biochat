TITLE
Expression data from aged spermatogonial stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In vitro and in vivo aging of mouse spermatogonial stem cells alters stem cell function based on quantitative spermatogonial stem cell transplantation analyses. We used microarrays to identify differential gene expression in vitro and in vivo aged spermatogonial stem cells to identify potential causes of observed phenotypic differences in aged spermatogonial stem cell function.

DESIGN
Spermatogonial stem cells were isolated from young and serial-transplanted aged mouse donors and cultured for short and long periods.  Spermatogonial stem cells were isolated from cultures and subjected to microarray analysis to identify differential gene expression.
