TITLE
Global transcriptional response of solvent-sensitive and solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida strains exposed to toluene

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas putida KT2440 ; Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E

SUMMARY
We report the application of a high-throughput technique, RNA-seq, to study the transcriptomic response of P. putida KT2440 and DOT-T1E in the presence of toluene with the aim to study in more detail the mechanisms involved in toluene response in a toluene-sensitive and a toluene-tolerant strains.

DESIGN
P. putida KT2440 and DOT-T1E mRNA profiles in the presence of control condition (M9), M9 plus toluene in vapor phase and M9 plus a shock of butanol at exponential phase

PLATFORM
GPL17091 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Pseudomonas putida KT2440) GPL18568 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E)
