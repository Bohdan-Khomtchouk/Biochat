TITLE
Study of circular RNA in Dictyostelium discoideum

ORGANISM
Dictyostelium discoideum

SUMMARY
RNA-Seq to discover circular RNA expression in Dictyostelium discoidieum with a shallow RNaseR treated RNA-Seq library; our goal was simply to prove existence of these molecules and hence samples were multiplexed with Neurospora Crassa using the same barcode.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq on Rnase R treated RNA

PLATFORM
GPL18347 Illumina MiSeq (Dictyostelium discoideum)
