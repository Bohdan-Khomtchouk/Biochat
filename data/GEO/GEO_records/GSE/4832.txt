TITLE
cDNA (Cepko BMAP) experiments for cross-platform study

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression microarrays have made a profound impact in biomedical research. The diversity of platforms and analytical methods has made comparison of data from multiple platforms very challenging. In this study, we describe a framework for comparisons across platforms and laboratories. We have attempted to include nearly all the available commercial and “in-house” platforms. Using probe sequences matched at the exon level improved consistency of measurements across the different microarray platforms compared to annotation-based matches. Generally, consistency was good for highly expressed genes, and variable for genes with lower expression values as confirmed by QRT-PCR. Concordance of measurements was higher between laboratories on the same platform than across platforms. We demonstrate that, after stringent pre-processing, commercial arrays were more consistent than “in-house” arrays, and by most measures, one-dye platforms were more consistent than two-dye platforms. Keywords: cross platform microarrays

DESIGN
RNA samples used were aliquoted from two pools of samples: C57/B6 adult mouse retina (MR) and Swiss-Webster postnatal day one (P1) mouse cortex (MC). The mouse cortex was used as a reference sample for the dual-dye platforms.Five replicates of each sample were used to assess the degree of variation in the expression data within each platform.
