TITLE
Effect of 48 h aldosterone treatment on late-gestation fetal lung

ORGANISM
Ovis aries

SUMMARY
The late-gestation fetal lung has relatively high levels of expression of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) as well as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), suggesting that endogenous corticosteroids may act in the lung through binding at MR as well as GR. This study was designed to determine the effects of physiologically relevant increases in steroids on MR and GR in the late-gestation lung. The GR agonist, betamethasone, the MR agonist, aldosterone, or both agonists were infused intravenously for 48 hours in ovine fetuses of approximately 130 days gestation. Effects on airway pressures during stepwise inflation of the in situ lung, expression of ENaC and Na,K ATPase, and elastin and collagen content were determined at the end of the infusions. We found that aldosterone significantly reduced the initial airway pressures measured in situ during inflation. This effect did not occur with betamethasone alone or in combination with aldosterone. Conversely, betamethasone, but not aldosterone, significantly increased expression of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunit mRNAs, and collagen and elastin content in the lungs. Aldosterone altered novel gene pathways in the fetal lung, suggesting effects on lung compliance via genes which influence immune pathways and lung stiffness. The results are consistent with corticosteroid-induced fluid reabsorption at birth through GR rather than MR, but suggest that MR contributes effects facilitating lung inflation with the first breaths via nonclassical mechanisms.

DESIGN
4 sets of twin sheep fetuses at approximately 130d gestation (term is 147d) were used. One twin was infused with 0.2 mg aldosterone for 48 h, the other received vehicle.
