TITLE
ChIP-Seq of Transcriptional Components in Ly1 DLBCL and Colon carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Discovery of the genome-wide location of proteins using ChIP-Seq has allowed global mapping of the key transcription factors and chromatin regulators that control gene expression programs in various cells. Many DNA-associated processes are targeted for disease therapy. This study investigates the functions of small molecule therapeutics that target DNA-associated processes involved with CDK9 and BRD4.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA was enriched by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analyzed by Solexa sequencing. ChIP was performed using an antibody against Brd4, RNA Polymerase II, Med1, H3K27ac, and CDK8 as well as whole-cell extract (WCE) DNA controls

PLATFORM
