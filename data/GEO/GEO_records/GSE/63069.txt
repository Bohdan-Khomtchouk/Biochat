TITLE
Gene expression profiles in in vitro cardiogenesis.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed time-dependent, genome-wide analysis to explore gene expression profiles during in vitro cardiogenesis from embryonic stem cells to cardiac progenitor cells. Total RNA was extracted from undifferentiated stem cells, early mesodermal cells, cardiac mesodermal cells and cardiac progenitor cells. As a result of cluster analysis, Cited gene family was considered as candidate genes in cardiogenesis. Cited4 gene expression was specific for early cardiogenesis and Cited4 functioned as a cell cycle controling factor for early cardiac progenitor cells.

DESIGN
Embryoid body was formed as in vitro cardiogenesis. Total RNA was extracted from Rex1-positive undifferentiated stem cells at day 0, Bra-positive early mesodermal cells at day 4.5, Flk1-positive cardiac mesodermal cells at day 4.5 and Nkx2.5-positive cardiac progenitor cells at day 7.5.
