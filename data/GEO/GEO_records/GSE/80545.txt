TITLE
Gene expression of myeloma patient samples under hypoxia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We conducted whole genome gene screening against the MM patients bone marrow (sorted by CD38++) cells that were subjected by chronic hypoxia condition.

DESIGN
We compared four primary myeloma samples cultured under hypoxia with cultured under normoxia (48hr) to find new anti-apoptotic gene of myeloma.
