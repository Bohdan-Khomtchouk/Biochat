TITLE
Histone demethylase RBP2 is critical for breast cancer progression and metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the roles of RBP2 in breast cancer metastasis, MDA-MD-231 cells were transfected with siRNAs against RBP2 or luciferase control, followed with gene expression microarray analysis and gene set enrichment analysis. These analyses revealed that RBP2 knockdown significantly decreased expression of genes linked to breast cancer metastasis to lung.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 72 hours after transfection with siRNA targeting KDM5A/RBP2/JARID1A, and targeting Luceferase gene as a control.
