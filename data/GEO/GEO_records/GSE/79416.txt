TITLE
Altered expression profile of long non-coding RNA and mRNA in mice cortex around bleeding areas after subarachnoid hemorrhage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the altered expression profiles of lncRNA and mRNA in mice cortex after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Total of 617 lncRNAs transcripts and 444 mRNAs transcripts were aberrantly expressed at 24 hours after SAH.

DESIGN
SAH was induced in C57BL/6 mice. The lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in cortex of normal mice and SAH mice were examined by RNA-Seq.
