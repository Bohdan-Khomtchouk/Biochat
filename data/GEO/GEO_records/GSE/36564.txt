TITLE
HDAC1 and 2 repress lineage inappropriate expression of Flt3 and Ptprf in B cells via Pax5 and Grg4

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total RNA was isolated from pre BI (early lymphcytes) cells sorted by FACS with the following markers: B220+, CD25-, C-kit+,IgM-, CD19+. The animals used carried floxed Hdac1 & 2 either in combination with mb1-cre (refered to as DKO) or not (WT).

DESIGN
6 samples of FACS-sorted pre BI cells were analyzed, corresponding to 6 individual female animals, 8 week of age, 3 per genotype DKO and WT.

PLATFORM
