TITLE
Impact of miR-132 and miR-381 on endogenous forskolin responsive CREB targets in HEK293T cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of HEK293T cells transfected with miR-neg (negative control), miR-132 or miR-381 mimics and treated with forskolin for 0, 1 or 4hrs.

DESIGN
HEK293T cells were reverse transfected with the respective miRNA mimics.  72hrs post-transfection, cells were treated with forskolin for 0, 1 or 4hrs.  Total RNA was then extracted.  Expression profiling was carried out with Affymetrix arrays.  Experiment was performed in duplicate.  Total of 18 samples.
