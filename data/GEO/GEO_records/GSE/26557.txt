TITLE
Changes in the expression of miRs in the aorta after 3 and 10 months of a high fat diet compared with normal diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We tried to identify miRs that are differentially expresssed during atherogenesis. Aortic miRs expression profile in female apoe-/- mice after 3 and 10 months of a high fat diet were compared with female apoe-/- mice on normal diet.

DESIGN
4 Female apoe-/- mice (6-8 weeks) were fed on high fat diet for 3 months.  3 female apoe-/- mice (6-8 weeks) were fed on high fat diet for 10 months. 4 female apoe-/- mice (6-8 weeks) on normal diet served as controls. Total RNA was isolated from whole aortic tissue. RNA samples with RIN > 8 were used for array. The aortic miRs expression profile after 3 months of a high fat diet was compared with the control group. Biological replicates: 4 per group. One replicate per array.
