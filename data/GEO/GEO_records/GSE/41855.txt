TITLE
Expression data from quiescent cells and cycling cells isolated from Multicellular aggregates of lymphoma cells (MALC)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Follicular Lymphomas are blood tumors growing as spheres in patients. Before this study, there was no experimental model mimicking the 3D organization of these in vivo tumors. We develop such a model, called MALC, and observed a progressive enrichment in quiescent cells in these with time of culture; these cells were sorted, as their cycling counterparts, and their transcriptomes were compared. We used microarrays to detail the differential global gene expression profile between quiescent and cycling cells isolated from MALC.

DESIGN
14 days-old MALC were stained with pyronin Y and quiescent and cycling subpopulations sorted were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix U133+ 2.0 microarrays.
