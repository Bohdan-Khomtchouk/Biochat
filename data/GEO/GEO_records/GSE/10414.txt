TITLE
microRNA156 resistant SQUAMOSA-PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE13 (mSPL13) seedlings

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix ATH1 arrays. Comparisons among the Col-0, SPL13 and mSPL13 sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by SPL13. Keywords: Potential upregulated and downregulated genes

DESIGN
Arabidopsis 3 days seedling from three independent biological replicates of Col-0, SPL13 and mSPL13 samples, which contain three independent seed lots each, were analyzed.

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
