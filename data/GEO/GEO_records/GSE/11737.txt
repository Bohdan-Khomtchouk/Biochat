TITLE
C. elegans PRG-1 co-IP small RNAs, 5p-end-independent

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
These datasets examine the association of small RNAs with 3p hydroxyls (including endo-siRNAs, miRNAs, and 21U-RNAs) with the PRG-1 protein through co-immunoprecipitation.  Two datasets are provided; one sequences small RNAs that co-IP with PRG-1; the other sequences small RNAs from the IP input sample. These RNA samples were prepared using an approach that captures small RNAs independent of the covalent status of their 5p termini, as described in Ambros et al. (2003) Curr Biol 13:807-18. These datasets were prepared in the Craig C. Mello laboratory. Keywords: identification of PRG-1-associated small RNAs

DESIGN
