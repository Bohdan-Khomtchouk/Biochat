TITLE
Genes differentially expressed Haloferax mediterranei strains: control wild-type strain vs ΔphaA1 strain

ORGANISM
Haloferax mediterranei

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Haloferax mediterranei comparing control wild-type strain with ΔphaA1 strain, in which phaA1 gene are knockouted. ΔphaA1 strain can accumulate PHB only. Goal was to explore the PHA biosynthetic pathway and to determine their impact on primary metabolism in H. mediterranei.

DESIGN
Total RNA from the control Haloferax mediterranei and its ΔphaA1 strain were used to generate target cDNA, and then hybridized to 8*15K Haloferax mediterranei genome array genechips, representing about 3800 genes.
