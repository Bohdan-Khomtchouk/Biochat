TITLE
Droplet based single cell RNA sequencing profiles of a murine model of type-1 diabetes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Diabetic kidney disease remains the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, affecting ~30% of patients with long-standing type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and is characterized by proteinuria and gradual loss of kidney function. There is intense interest in understanding the responses of the many cell types present in the kidney to the diabetic milleu. In this study, we present single cell transcriptomes of renal cortex samples of wild-type and diabetic (C57BL/6-Ins2Akita/J) mice using Drop-Seq.

DESIGN
Renal cortex samples from wild type and diabetic Akita mice (n=2 per group) underwent dissociation and Drop-seq.

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
