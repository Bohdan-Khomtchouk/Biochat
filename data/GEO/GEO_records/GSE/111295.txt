TITLE
An exploratory study to examine the effects of maternal choline supplementation during mouse pregnancy on placental epigenetic markers (miRNA-seq data set)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study sought to explore the effects of 4X maternal choline supplementation (MCS) on mRNA and miRNA abundance in mouse placentas collected on gestational day 15.5. These data advance our understanding about the importance of choline in reproductive health and will guide future mechanistic studies designed to elucidate the mechanisms mediating choline's beneficial effects.

DESIGN
miRNA sequencing was performed on 6 placental samples (3 males and 3 females) from 1X control choline diet group and 6 placental samples (3 males and 3 females) from 4X choline diet group

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
