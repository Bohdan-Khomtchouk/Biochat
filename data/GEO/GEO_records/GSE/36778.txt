TITLE
Effect of Tgfbr2 disruption on gene expression in the aorta of Fbn1 wild-type and Fbn1C1039G mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to characterize the global changes in gene expression within the ascending aorta of mice due to conditional disruption of TGF-β signaling in smooth muscle and/or due to heterozygous fibrillin-1 mutation.

DESIGN
Myh11-CreERT2.Tgfbr2f/f (abbreviated as Cre.Tgfbr2) mice were cross-bred to Fbn1C1039G/+ (abbreviated as Fbn1C/+) mice and treated with vehicle or tamoxifen for 5 d starting at 4 wk of age to generate 4 groups of animals: 1) Cre.Tgfbr2-Veh: controls with intact TGF-β signaling and wild-type fibrillin-1 expression; 2) Cre.Tgfbr2-Tmx: conditional disruption of Tgfbr2 in smooth muscle with wild-type fibrillin-1 expression; 3) Fbn1C1039G.Cre.Tgfbr2-Veh: heterozygous expression of mutant fibrillin-1 with intact TGF-β signaling; and 4) Fbn1C1039G.Cre.Tgfbr2-Tmx: conditional disruption of Tgfbr2 in smooth muscle with heterozygous expression of mutant fibrillin-1. The animals were euthanized at 6 weeks of age and their ascending aortas (from above the coronary arteries to the first arch branch) were collected and total RNA was extracted.
