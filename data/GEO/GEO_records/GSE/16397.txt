Factorial Microarray Analysis of Zebra Mussel Adhesion Process under the Impact of Multiple Environmental Factors

ORGANISM
Dreissena polymorpha

SUMMARY
Factorial Microarray Analysis of Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) Adhesion Process under the Impact of Multiple Environmental Factors The expression profiles of the zebra mussel byssus unique genes in our cDNA microarray can be influenced by multiple factors. Three environmental factors plus adhesion status were considered as four main factors in this study.

DESIGN
Two different levels in each factor were created, therefore, a 2x2x2x2 factorial experimental design was made by sixteen treatment groups with four biological replicates in each group. There were 32 dual-channel microarray slides included in this study and the effects of main factors on gene expression profiles as well as the two-way, three-way, and four-way interactions of the main factors were analyzed. Factors: temperature, water agitation, oxygen level, and adhesion status
