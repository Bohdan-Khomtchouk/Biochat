TITLE
Transcriptional profiling analysis of Bacillus subtilis in response to high levels of iron (Fe3+)

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling analysis was used to reveral the genetic changes of B.subtilis after addition of high levels of iron. This study is to reveal the effect of high levels of iron on B.subtilis' metabolism and identify the potential resistance mechanism to high levels of iron.
