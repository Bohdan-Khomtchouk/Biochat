TITLE
Transcriptional profiling analysis of Bacillus subtilis in response to high levels of iron (Fe3+)

ORGANISM
Bacillus subtilis

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling analysis was used to reveral the genetic changes of B.subtilis after addition of high levels of iron. This study is to reveal the effect of high levels of iron on B.subtilis' metabolism and identify the potential resistance mechanism to high levels of iron.

DESIGN
1_1 is the independent biological replicate of sample 2_1, while sample 1_2 is the independent biological replicate of sample 2_2. Bacteria collected from each B.subtilis culture at 0min were mixed and used as ch2 source for each sample. The ch1 sources of sample 1_1 and 2_1 are bacteria collected from cultures without addition of Fe3+ at 20min, while the ch1 sources of sample 2_1 and 2_2 are bacteria collected from cultures with addition of 4mM Fe3+ at 20min.

PLATFORM
GPL20761 Agilent-019569 ECUST Subtilis 8*15K v1.0 (Probe Name version)
