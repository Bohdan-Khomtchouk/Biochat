TITLE
Expression profiling of T.rubrum treated with Terbinafine

ORGANISM
Trichophyton rubrum

SUMMARY
One antifungal agent, terbinafine(TRB), has specific activity against dermatophytes.A cDNA microarray was constructed from the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of different developmental stages, and transcriptional profiles of the responses to TRB were determined. Some class-specific and mechanism-independent changes in gene expression were found. Keywords: original article
