TITLE
Transcriptional profiling identifies differential expression of long non-coding RNAs in Jo-1 associated and inclusion body myositis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Myositis is characterised by muscle inflammation and weakness. Although generally thought to be driven by a systemic autoimmune response, increasing evidence suggests that intrinsic changes in the muscle might also contribute to the pathogenesis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a family of novel genes that regulate gene transcription and translation. To determine the potential role of lncRNAs, we employed next generation sequencing to examine the transcriptome in muscle biopsies obtained from two histologically distinct patient populations, inclusion body myositis (IBM) and anti-Jo-1-associated myositis (Jo-1).

DESIGN
PolyA+ RNA was sequenced in human muscle biopsies obtained from control individuals or patients with inclusion body myositis or Jo-1 myositis
