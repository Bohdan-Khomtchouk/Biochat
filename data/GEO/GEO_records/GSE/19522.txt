TITLE
Deficient of IL-18 in mice leads to the reduction of neuropeptides in the amygdala related with behavioral change

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Interleukin (IL)-18 is recognized as a multifunctional mediator in inflammation and immune responses. In addition, the production of IL-18 is stimulated by physiological and/or psychological stress implicated in several behavioral disorders. However, it still remains unclear about the role of IL-18 on the central nervous system. In this study, we analyzed gene expression of 6 brain regions; the olfactory bulb, prefrontal cortex, striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Microarray analysis indicated the regional differences of expression in IL-18-/- mice. In particular, the most profound change was observed in the amygdala, in which 1,237 genes were differentially expressed.

DESIGN
We purchased IL-18-/- mice and C57BL/6 mice from Charles River Japan . To produce F1 generation mice, three male IL-18-/- mice were mated with six female C57BL/6J mice. We mated F1 mice and created their F2 littermates. Six week-old F2 mice littermates were weaned. At 12 weeks, mice were sacrificed at 14:00 under general anesthesia with diethyl ether. After the systemic perfusion with cold phosphate-buffered saline through the heart using a syringe attached to a 21-G needle, the whole mouse brains were removed. Coronal brain sections (1 mm thick) were prepared on ice using a brain slicer . The olfactory bulb was sliced between 3.5 and 4.5 anterior to bregma. The prefrontal cortex was sliced between 2.5 and 3.5 mm anterior to bregma. The striatum was sliced between -0.5 and 0.5 mm posterior to bregma. The hypothalamus, the amygdala, and the hippocampus were sliced between 1.5 and 2.5 mm posterior to bregma. Total RNA was immediately prepared from these samples using TRIzol  and purified by RNeasy kit.
