TITLE
Deficient of IL-18 in mice leads to the reduction of neuropeptides in the amygdala related with behavioral change

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Interleukin (IL)-18 is recognized as a multifunctional mediator in inflammation and immune responses. In addition, the production of IL-18 is stimulated by physiological and/or psychological stress implicated in several behavioral disorders. However, it still remains unclear about the role of IL-18 on the central nervous system. In this study, we analyzed gene expression of 6 brain regions; the olfactory bulb, prefrontal cortex, striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Microarray analysis indicated the regional differences of expression in IL-18-/- mice. In particular, the most profound change was observed in the amygdala, in which 1,237 genes were differentially expressed.
