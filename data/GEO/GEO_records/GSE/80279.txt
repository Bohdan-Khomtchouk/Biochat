TITLE
Expression data from iPS cell derived hepatocyte-like cells sorted with antibody against cell surface protein SLC10A1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Most differentiation protocols for generation of hepatocyte-like cells from iPS cells generate cells with heterogenous expression of hepatic markers, which confounds results from liver disease models involving complex traits and subtle phenotypes We utilized proteomics to identify heptocyte-restricted cell surface proteins that mark a subpopulation of iPS cell derived hepatocytes. By performing microarray on FACS sorted cells, we demonstrate that subpopulation of hepatocyte-like cells expressing SLC10A1 are enriched for hepatic markers

DESIGN
Hepatocyte-like cells generated from iPS cells were FACS sorted using antibody against cell surface protein SLC10A1. Microarray was performed on pre-sort, SLC10A1 positive sort, and SLC10A1 negative sort cell population. Microarray on FACS sorted cells from four independent differentiations are presented.
