TITLE
The transcription repressors Bach2 and Bach1 promote B cell development by repressing the myeloid program

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mature lymphoid cells express the transcriptional repressor Bach2, which imposes regulation on humoral and cellular immunity. Here we found critical roles for Bach2 in the development of cells of the B lineage, commencing from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) stage, with Bach1 as an auxiliary. Overexpression of Bach2 in pre-pro-B cells deficient in the transcription factor EBF1 and single-cell analysis of CLPs revealed that Bach2 and Bach1 repressed the expression of genes important for myeloid cells (‘myeloid genes’). Bach2 and Bach1 bound to presumptive regulatory regions of the myeloid genes. Bach2hi CLPs showed resistance to myeloid differentiation even when cultured under myeloid conditions. Our results suggest that Bach2 functions with Bach1 and EBF1 to promote B cell development by repressing myeloid genes in CLPs.

DESIGN
WT and Bach1 and Bach2 double deficient (DD) CLPs. Multipotent progenitors (MPPs) infected with control-GFP and Bach2-GFP and cultured several condition. Follicular B cells (Fo B) stimulated with IgM. Three expreriments was performed in this paper.
