TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of the Integrator complex (BeadChip)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the genomic occupancy of INTS11, in normal condition and after stimulation of EGF. Total RNAPII was profiled in the presence or absence of INTS11, along with the Super Elongation Complex proteins AFF4 and ELL2. Additionally, we extensively examined the transcriptional response to EGF, before and after depletion of INTS11, using RNA-seq on ribosome-depleted total RNA and Global Run-on sequencing (GRO-seq).

DESIGN
EGF stimulation of Hela cells, trasnfected with a control shRNA, INTS1 shRNA or INTS11 shRNA

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
