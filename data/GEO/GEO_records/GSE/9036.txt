TITLE
Expression data of HUVEC cells after TNF-alpha treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-aplha) is a potent cytokine that orchestrates the inflammatory response by sequentially activating the expression of many genes in cultured human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs). We apply samples collected every 7.5 min to arrays and monitor the growth of several long transcripts. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Before stimulation, HUVECs were serum-starved in EBM-2 (Clonetics) containing 0.5% FBS for 18 h, and then treated with 10 ng/ml TNF (Peprotec) and samples collected every 7.5 min for 3 h.
