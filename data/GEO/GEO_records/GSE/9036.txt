TITLE
Expression data of HUVEC cells after TNF-alpha treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-aplha) is a potent cytokine that orchestrates the inflammatory response by sequentially activating the expression of many genes in cultured human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs). We apply samples collected every 7.5 min to arrays and monitor the growth of several long transcripts. Keywords: time course
