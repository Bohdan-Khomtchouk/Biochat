TITLE
Bacteroides fragilis oxidative stress

ORGANISM
Bacteroides fragilis

SUMMARY
The idea was to examine the role of OxyR in control of the oxidative stress response of B. fragilis when exposed to either atmospheric oxygen, 5% oxygen atmosphere, or hydrogen peroxide Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
The experiment was designed to compare the response of IB397 (wild type) to IB425 (oxyR) under anaerobic conditions, hydrogen peroxide stress, and atmospheric oxygen stress.  In addition, IB397 was subjected to 5% oxygen stress for comparison to full atmospheric oxygen stress.  Samples ultimately compared to Anaerobic IB397 which is considered the baseline state for these bacteria. Sample replicates are identified according to the following protocol: biological replicates are given a letter designation at the end of the title.  This letter is followed by a number if a technical replicate exists.  In the following example IB397 O2-a is a biological replicate of IB397 O2-c1 and IB397 O2-c2.  IB397 O2-c1 and IB397-c2 are technical replicates. The following replicates were used: IB397 Anaerobic - three samples; one biological replicate and one labeled extract technical replicate. IB397 Atmospheric oxygen - four samples; two biological replicates and one labeled extract technical replicate. IB397 Hydrogen peroxide - four samples; two biological replicates and one labeled extract technical replicate. IB397 5% oxygen - four samples; one biological replicate and two labeled extract technical replicates. IB425 Anaerobic - four samples; one biological replicate and one labeled extract technical replicate. IB425 Atmospheric oxygen- four samples; one biological replicate and one labeled extract technical replicate. IB425 Hydrogen peroxide - four samples; one biological replicate and one labeled extract technical replicate.
