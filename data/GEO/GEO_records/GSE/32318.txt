TITLE
2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings (Columbia ecotype)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Comparison of TopHat alignments and assessment of spurious splice junctions for 32nt and 76nt read lengths.  Total RNA from 2-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) seedlings grown on MS plates was isolated using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit from Qiagen. To remove any contaminating DNA, RNA was treated with DNAse.  Isolation of poly (A) mRNA and preparation of cDNA library were carried out using the Illumina TrueSeq RNA kit. Sequencing (72 cycle) was done on Illumina Genome Analyzer II.
