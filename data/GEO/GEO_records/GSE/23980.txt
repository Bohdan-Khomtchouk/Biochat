TITLE
Expression data from human soft tissue sarcomas with complex genomics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differentially expressed genes between 171 human soft tissue sarcomas with complex genomics

DESIGN
RNA extraction was performed on frozen samples of tumors and hybridized on U133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix microarrays, for which we had performed Comparative Genomic Hybridization profiling. This submission represents the gene expression component of the study.
