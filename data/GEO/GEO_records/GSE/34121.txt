TITLE
A genome-wide analysis reveals that the Drosophila transcription factor, Lola, promotes axon growth in part by suppressing expression of the actin nucleation factor, Spire (allele lola_ORE76)

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Drosophila embryos comparing lola mutant 10-12 hour after egg lay (AEL) embryos to age-matched control embryos. Mutants are homozygous lola nulls (allele lola_ORE76).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: lola mutant embryos vs. age-matched control embryos. 7 biological replicates, each sample independently collected and containing RNA from approximately 300 embryos. Mutant and control embryos for each replicate were collected simultaneously. Dye-swaps were performed.
