TITLE
Identification of Salmonella genes regulated by STM2239

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SL1344

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of Salmonella enterica sv Typhimurium SL1344 ΔSTM2239 mutant cultures containing either a plasmid control (pFLAG-CTC) or a plasmid carrying STM2239 (pFLAG-STM2239) in the presence of IPTG.

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from three biological replicates of ΔSTM2239 mutant cultures with either a plasmid control (pFLAG-CTC) or a plasmid carrying STM2239 (pFLAG-STM2239) that were grown in LB to OD 0.5 with 1mM IPTG to induce plasmid-driven expression.
