TITLE
Co-amplification at 8p and 11q in breast tumors and cell lines with 8p11q array Genomic Comparative Hybridization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Co-amplification at chromosomes 8p11-8p12 and 11q12-11q14 occurs often in breast tumors, suggesting possible cooperation between genes in these regions in oncogenesis.  We used high resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) to map the minimal amplified regions.  The 8p and 11q amplicons are complex and consist of at least four amplicon cores at each site.  Candidate genes mapping to these regions were identified by combining copy number and RNA and protein expression analyses. Funcational analysis for transformation was further carried out with candidate genes to determine candidate oncogenes.
