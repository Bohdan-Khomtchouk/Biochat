TITLE
Peripheral blood transcriptional analysis of a severe Ebola virus disease patient reveals dramatic transitions during critical illness and recovery

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pearson analysis of daily gene expression signatures revealed dramatic gene expression changes in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) that correlated with changes in serum and PBL viral load, coagulopathy, multiple organ dysfunction and then recovery.

DESIGN
Here, daily global host gene expression responses were measured in peripheral blood from a 34â€“year-old male health care worker exposed to EBOV in Sierra Leone and evacuated to NIH on day 7 (d7) of clinical illness through onset of critical illness and during recovery
