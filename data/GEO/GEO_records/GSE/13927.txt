TITLE
Transcriptome of mature Arabidopsis thaliana crown galls

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This study describes physiological changes, morphological adaptations and the regulation of pathogen defense responses in Arabidopsis crown galls. Crown gall development was induced on intact plants under most natural conditions with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Differential gene expression and the metabolite pattern was determined by comparing crown galls with mock-inoculated inflorescence stalk segments of the same age.
