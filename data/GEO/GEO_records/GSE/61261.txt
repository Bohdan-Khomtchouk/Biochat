TITLE
Distribution of H3K27me2, dUTX, and histone H3 in Sg4 cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PcG protein complex PRC2 is a methyltransferase specific for histone H3 lysine27, and H3K27me3 is essential for stable transcription silencing. Less well known but quantitatively much more important is the genome-wide role of PRC2 that dimethylates more than half of total H3K27. Here we have determined genomic distributions of H3K27me2, dUTX, and histone H3 in cultured Drosophila Sg4 cells by hybridization of ChIP products with tiling microarrays.
