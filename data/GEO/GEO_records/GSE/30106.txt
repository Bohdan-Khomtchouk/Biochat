TITLE
miRNA expression profile of unmutated and mutated CLL cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim is to identify the differential miRNA expression profile of  B-CLL stimulated with different type of stimulation CPG

DESIGN
One color design, 36 samples, Two-condition experiment, CPG-stimulated B-CLL unmutated  and mutated vs. Unstimulated B-CLL unmutated and mutated. Biological replicates: 18 unstimulated replicates, 18 CPG-stimulated replicates.
