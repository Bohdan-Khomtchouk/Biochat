TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of maltose utilization and regulation in aspergilla

ORGANISM
Aspergillus niger ; Aspergillus oryzae

SUMMARY
Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of the filamentous fungi Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger have opened possibilities for investigating the cellular metabolism and regulation of these fungi on a systemic level. The aim of this work was to understand how metabolism is regulated and to identify common regulatory responses between A. oryzae and A. niger. We therefore conducted batch fermentations with A. oryzae and A. niger grown on three different carbon sources (glucose, maltose, and xylose) in order to investigate their genome-wide transcription response Keywords: Two Aspergillus species and different carbon sources

DESIGN
Three conditions (glucose, maltose and xylose) with three biological replicates for A. oryzae and A. niger
