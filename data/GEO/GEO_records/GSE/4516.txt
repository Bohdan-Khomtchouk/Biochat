TITLE
Gene expression profiles in lung tissue of rats following exposure to mainstream cigarette smoke

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Expression data from rats exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) at three concentrations (sham, 300µgTPM/l and 600µgTPM/l) for 13 weeks (5d/week; 2hrs/day) after three different recovery times (2hrs, 6hrs and 20hrs after last treatment); lung tissue Keywords: recovery time course and dose dependency

DESIGN
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were nose-only-exposed for 13 weeks in total, 5d/week, 2h/day to following concentrations of mainstream cigarette smoke from the standard reference cigarette 2R4F: sham, 300µgTPM (Total particulate matter)/l or 600µgTPM/l.
