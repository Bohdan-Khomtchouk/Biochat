TITLE
Comparative early transcriptomic responses to copper and cadmium exposure in rice roots

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to do a side-by-side comparison of the transcriptomes that are regulated under Cu and Cd stress at the early stage in rice roots. The comparison of transcriptomes between Cu and Cd treatments and the application of bioinformatics procedures (e.g. regulated gene analysis) are potentially useful approaches for determining the both general and individual early responses triggered by each metal. Identify genes and pathways that would discriminate among the actions of Cu and Cd.

DESIGN
Comparison of mock control and  rice seedlings treated with 5μM Cu and 25μM Cd; Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 Cu-treated replicates, 3 Cd-treated replicates

PLATFORM
GPL8852 Agilent-015241 Rice Gene Expression 4x44K Microarray (Probe name version)
