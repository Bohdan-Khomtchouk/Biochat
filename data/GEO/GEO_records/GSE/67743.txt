TITLE
Neurons that underlie Drosophila melanogaster reproductive behaviors: detection of a large male-bias in gene expression in fruitless-expressing neurons

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Male and female reproductive behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster are vastly different, but the neurons that express sex-specifically spliced fruitless transcripts (fru P1) underlie these behaviors in both sexes. How this set of neurons can generate such different behaviors between the two sexes is an unresolved question. A particular challenge is that fru P1-expressing neurons comprise only 2-5% of the adult nervous system, and so studies of adult head tissue or whole brain may not reveal crucial differences. Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) identifies the actively translated pool of mRNAs from fru P1-expressing neurons allowing a sensitive, cell-type-specific assay. Genes with TRAP mRNAs that are detected in both sexes are four times as likely to be male biased (1,210) as female biased (331) in fru P1-expressing neurons. This suggests a potential mechanism to generate dimorphism in behavior. The male-biased genes may direct male behaviors by establishing cell fate in a similar context of gene expression observed in females. These results suggest a possible global mechanism for how distinct behaviors can arise from a shared set of neurons.

DESIGN
Libraries were prepared from five independent biological replicates, from TRAP adult heads samples from males and females, and the mRNA input from adult heads from males and females. For each experimental condition, approximately 1,000 flies that were 8 to 24 hours post-eclosion were used.
