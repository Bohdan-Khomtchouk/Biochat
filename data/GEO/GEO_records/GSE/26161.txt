TITLE
Profiling of Argonaute (AGO) 2-associated sRNAs after infection of bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transgenic Arabidopsis plants (AGO2::HA:AGO2) were treated with either mock (10 mM MgCl2) or Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) expressing avrRpt2 (R2) at a concentration of 2 x 107 cfu/ml for 14 hours. sRNAs associated with AGO1 and AGO2 were co-immunoprecipitated using antibodies against either AGO1 (AGO1-IP), or HA (hemagglutinin) (AGO2-IP). As controls, we also gel-purified the 18-28 nt fraction of the total RNAs from  an AGO2 mutant (ago2-1). The co-immunoprecipitated or gel-purified RNAs were cloned and sequenced by Illumina deep sequencing.
