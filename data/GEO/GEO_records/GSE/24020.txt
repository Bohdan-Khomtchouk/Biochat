TITLE
NF-kB suppresses genomic instability in non-Hodgkin lymphomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Oci-Ly3 and Daudi cell lines expressing p100-, p105- and luciferase-siRNA were used to identify genes that are regulated by p100 or p105 in each cell line.

DESIGN
p100- (n=3) and p105- (n=3) expressing cells were compared to Luciferase siRNA, using linear models and signficant genes were identified using FDR of 0.001. Then the results for Daudi and OCI-LY3 cell lines were compared and only genes commonly regulated in both cell lines by p100 or p105 were  selected for furhter studies.
