SUMMARY
Modification of Gene Expression of Skeletal Muscle in Response to postmenopause with or without Hormone Replacement Therapy. Even though menopause is often accompanied with first signs of age-associated changes in muscle structure and function, the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or menopause-related decline in estrogen production in the muscles of postmenopausal women is not well understood. We have used a randomized double-blinded study design together with an explorative microarray experiment to characterize possible effects of continuous, combined HRT and estrogen deprivation on the skeletal muscle of fifteen early postmenopausal women from which 10 used HRT and 5 used placebo for 12-months in a douple-blinded design. Keywords: time course analysis from HRT users and non-users
