TITLE
Expression data from Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana ; Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
In this study, we used a cross-species network approach to uncover nitrogen (N)-regulated network modules conserved across a model and a crop species. By translating gene network knowledge from the data-rich model Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia-0) to a crop, rice (Oryza sativa spp. japonica (Nipponbare)), we identified evolutionarily conserved N-regulatory modules as targets for translational studies to improve N use efficiency in transgenic plants.

DESIGN
We also study the interspecies conservation, comparing rice with Arabidopsis thaliana nitrogen transcriptomes, to help identify conserved nitrogen regulation.
