TITLE
Comparison of expression in Arabidopsis mutant tdt-1 and wild type

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The object of this study was to explore whether the loss of mRNA decapping in the Arabidopsis mutant tdt-1 resulted in global dfferences of RNA profiles, as compared to wild type. Keywords: Genetic modification affect on gene expression
