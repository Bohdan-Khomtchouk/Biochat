TITLE
Differentiation time course of trophoblast stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To characterized the changes in gene expression during the differentiation of TS cells. TS cells can be derived from two time point during embryogenesis, cell lines tested were from each of these time points. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
TS cells derived from either E3.5 or E6.5 embryos were differentiated over 6 days by withdrawal of FGF4 and feeder conditioned medium. Cell were sampled every 24 hrs and assayed by microarray.
