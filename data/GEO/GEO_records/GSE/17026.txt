TITLE
Dynamic mRNA Expression analysis of cells undergoing synchronous life-cycle differentiation in Trypanosoma brucei

ORGANISM
Trypanosoma brucei

SUMMARY
mRNA expression profiles of trypanosomes from two discrete bloodstream form stages of the parasite (slender and stumpy forms), as well as during the transition of the stumpy population to the procyclic life-cycle stage were studied. Our analysis represents the first comparison of in vivo derived pleomorphic slender cells with genetically identical stumpy forms, and a first analysis of the dynamic changes in mRNA profile that accompany the transition to procyclic forms.

DESIGN
Twenty nine RNA samples were generated (5 biological replicates of Stumpy (0h), 1h, 6h, 18h and 48h, and 4 biological replicates of slender forms.  Four arrays failed QC.

PLATFORM
GPL8834 JCVI PFGRC Trypanosoma brucei 19K v3 array designed primarily based on strain TREU927, full array version
