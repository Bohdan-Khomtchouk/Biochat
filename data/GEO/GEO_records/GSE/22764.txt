TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in EMT cells induced by overexpression of PDGF-D compared with PC3 control cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of EMTrelated gene expression levels. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that expression of mesenchymal markers was increased and expression of epithelial markers was downregulated concomitant with increased expression of stem -like cell markers in EMT cells compared with control cells. Results demostrated that overexpression of PDGF-D induced genome-wide gene expression changes which were consistent with EMT phenotype and stem cell signatures.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from stable PC3 Neo and PC3 PDGF-D cells.
