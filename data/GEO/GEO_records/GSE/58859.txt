TITLE
Chromatin-dependent regulation of the RNA polymerases II and III activity throughout the transcription cycle

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have developed a new genome-wide protocol for nascent transcription analysis at high resolution in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protocol is based in run-on labeling of nascent RNA with a biotinylated precursor. We call it BioGRO for biotin-based genomic run-on.

DESIGN
6 samples total; 4 BioGRO samples (3 mutants and 1 WT); and 2 ChIP-chip samples (Rpb3 IP and its input).

PLATFORM
GPL18871 Affymetrix/Steinmetz Saccharomyces cerevisiae custom tiling array
