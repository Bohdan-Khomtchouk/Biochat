TITLE
Differential effects of inhibition of bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling on T-cell activation and differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dorsomorphin is a small molecule inhibitor of type I bone morphogenic protein receptors (BMPRs). We have found that dorsomorphin affects a wide range of T cell function. In order to obtain the bigger picture of the effects of DM in T cell activation. transcriptomic analysis was performed using mouse primary CD25-CD4+ T cells with either DM (4 μM) or vehicle in the presence or absence of stimulation by anti-CD3 and -CD28 antibodies.

DESIGN
Mouse CD4+ T cells were prepared and cultured with or without stimulation by plate bound anti-CD3 mAb and soluble anti-CD28 mAb for 1 hour. Subsequently, 4 μM DM or DMSO was added and cells were incubated for 6 hours. Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini kits.
