TITLE
Systematic Identification of Factors Crucial for Provirus Silencing in Embryonic Stem Cells (ChIP-seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our study reports the first genome-wide atlas of functional nodes that mediate proviral silencing in ESCs.  It provides evidences for the comprehensive, interconnected and multi-layered genetic/epigenetic machineries by which ESCs maintain the repressive state of provirus and ERVs.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq analysis of Chaf1a, Trim28, Sumo2 and Zfp809 to demonstrate the mechanism of the silencing of Endogenous retroviruses
