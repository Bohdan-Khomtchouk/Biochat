TITLE
Genome-wide parent-of-origin DNA methylation analysis [Methylation450 BeadChip]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic imprinting is a form of epigenetic regulation that results in expression of either the maternally or paternally inherited allele of a subset of genes. Imprinted loci contain differentially methylated regions (DMRs) where cytosine methylation marks one of the parental alleles, providing cis-acting regulatory elements that influence the allelic expression of surrounding genes, however to date the total number of imprinted loci within the human genome is unknown. To characterize known imprinted DMRS and identify novel imprinted loci we have performed whole-genome bisulphite sequencing and high-resolution DNA methylation array analysis of healthy tissues.

DESIGN
Sequencing of bisulfite converted DNA and array based analysis of normal tissues, human embryonic stem cells, androgenetic hydatidiform moles and leukocytes from reciprocal genome-wide uniparental disomies.
