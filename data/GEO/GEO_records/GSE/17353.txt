TITLE
Expression data from hypoxia exposed normal human esophageal epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To delineate the role of hypoxia in esophageal epithelial biology, we carried out gene array experiments using a non-transformed immortalized diploid human esophageal cell line, EPC2-hTERT (Mol Cancer Res. 2003;1:729-38). Unlike cancer cell lines, EPC2-hTERT has no genetic alterations at early passages that may affect the cellular response to hypoxia.

DESIGN
EPC2-hTERT cells were exposed to moderate (1% O2) hypoxia in experiment 1 (Exp1) or severe (0.2% O2) hypoxia in experiment 2 (Exp2). Normoxia (21% O2) served as a control in both experiments.
