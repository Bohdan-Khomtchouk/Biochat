TITLE
Elevated carbon dioxide alters the interaction between Eucalyptus grandis and Pisolithus microcarpus through a complex shift in the root transcriptome

ORGANISM
Eucalyptus grandis ; Pisolithus microcarpus

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from in vitro Eucalyptus grandis roots interacting with two different Pisolithus microcarpus strains (SI-9 and SI-12) and under two different CO2 concentrations (400 and 650 ppm) . Control roots or ectomycorrhizal root tips were harvested after 1 month and used for RNA extraction. Paired-end (2X150bp) reads were generated and aligned to Eucalyptus grandis transcripts ( http://www.phytozome.net/; primarytranscripts only) using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from in vitro Eucalyptus grandis roots interacting with two different Pisolithus microcarpus strains (SI-9 and SI-12) and under two different CO2 concentrations (400 and 650 ppm) were generated by paired-end (2X110bp) Illumina HiSeq1500 sequencing. Three biological replicates were sequenced for mycorrhizal samples, five for CO2 650ppm control roots and six for CO2 400ppm control roots.
