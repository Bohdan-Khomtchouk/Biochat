TITLE
Transcriptomic profiles of CD4+ T lymphocytes from RhoA wild type (WT) and RhoA G17V mice were generated by deep sequencing in duplicate, using Illumina poly-A RNA seq.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study is to identify transcriptomic effects of RhoA G17V expression in mouse CD4+ T lymphocytes. To this end, mice conditionally expressing RhoA G17V were generated by replacing exon 3 of RhoA with a minigene containing RhoA exons 3 to 6 flanked by loxP sites followed by a neomycin selection cassette and a mutant Rhoa exon 3 encoding the G17V substitution. These mice were then crossed with the CD4CreERT2 line (Tg(Cd4-cre/ERT2)11Gnri, Jackson Laboratories), which expresses a 4-hydroxi-tamoxifen-inducible form of the Cre recombinase under the control of the mouse Cd4 promoter to generate conditional inducible CD4 specific RhoA G17V mice (Rhoaco-G17V/+ CD4CreERT2).  Mice were treated with vehicle only or Tamoxifen to induce expression of the RhoA G17V in CD4+ T cells. CD4CreERT2 mice were included as a negative control. CD4+ T cells were isolated from single cell suspensions of spleen by negative selection using the mouse naive CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit (Milteny#130-104-453) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Total RNA was extracted and standard Illumina poly-A RNA seq was performed. Naive mouse CD4+ T cells expressing RhoA G17V displayed an enrichment in a Tfh gene expression program.
