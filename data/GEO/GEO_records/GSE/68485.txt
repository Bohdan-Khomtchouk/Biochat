TITLE
Expression data from rat Achilles tendon-derived stem cells during development

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We have compared the gene expression profile of rat Achilles tendon-derived stem cells in post-natal tendon development. Rat tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) were isolated at different stages of post-natal development: TSPCs-1d, TSPCs-7d and TSPCs-56d.

DESIGN
TSPCs at different post-natal development stages (1d, 7d and 56d) were isolated, cultured and used for microarray analyses at passage 2. All TSPCs in this study were of isolated from more than one individual. Total RNA was extracted and fragmented biotin-tagged cRNA was hybridized to Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array.
