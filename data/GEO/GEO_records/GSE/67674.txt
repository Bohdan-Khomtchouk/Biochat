TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of the effects of GSK-J4 and L-ascorbic acid in female embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The effects of a histone demethylase inhibitor, GSK-J4, and L-ascorbic acid for the transcriptome in female ES cells were analyzed by RNA-sequence. Total RNA was used for high-throughput sequence with Illumina HiSeq 2500 and mapped to mm10.
