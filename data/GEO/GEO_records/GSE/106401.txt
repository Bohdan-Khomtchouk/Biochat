TITLE
Gene expression signatures for conophylline (CNP) treatment in human foreskin fibroblasts NB1RGB cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To investigate the effect of CNP on gene expression, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling using NB1RGB cells.

DESIGN
The cells were plated at 80% confluence and cultured for 16 hours, CNP at each concentration (0.025, 0.1 μM) was added and the cells were incubated for 1 hour. TGF-β was then added, and cells were cultured for 6 hours. After washing with PBS,
