TITLE
PTHR1 knock-down in osteosarcoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Expression analysis of OS tumors with shRNA knockdown of PTHR1 mouse OS 80 (a Cre:lox OS cell line from Boston) was tagged with firefly luciferase expression construct. They were then infected with either control (renilla luciferase shRNA) or an shRNA that effective knocks-down PTHR1 (PTHR1.358; para-thyroid hormone receptor). The cells were injected with matrigel onto the back flank of Balb/c nu/nu mice and left to grow for 1 month with weekly monitoring of tumour size by in vivo luciferase assay. At 4 weeks the tumours were removed and trizol stored. Whole tumour was ground up and set form micro-array.

DESIGN
6 tumors with shRNA PTHR1 knockdown ; 6 tumors with shRNA control (renilla luciferase shRNA) knockdown

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
