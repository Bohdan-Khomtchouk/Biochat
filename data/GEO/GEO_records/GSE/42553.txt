TITLE
Aspergillus nidulans: Control (Wt) vs. GPCRs mutants (ΔgprB and ΔgprD)

ORGANISM
Aspergillus nidulans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of A. nidulans comparing the mutant strains ΔgprB and ΔgprD grown on 1% glucose (w/v) in a batch cultivation medium (BCM) at 37°C for 24 and 48h. The main objective was to identifiy genes related to gprB and gprD gene function. The experiment was further validated by real-time PCR and enzymatic assay.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment : A. nidulans strains grown during 24 and 48 h at 37°C in glucose 1% (w/v).

PLATFORM
GPL15593 Agilent_029535 Univ. of Sao Paulo-FCFRP/Mol Biol Lab Aspergillus nidulans 4X44K v.1.0
