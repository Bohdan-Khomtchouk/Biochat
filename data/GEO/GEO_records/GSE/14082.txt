TITLE
Analysis of Spt16 depletion

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Transcription rate analysis in Yeast by means of GRO, mRNA amount and ChIP-on-chip during the depletion of Spt16p. Keywords: Genomic run-on GRO ChIP-chip

DESIGN
Transcription rate analysis by means of GRO and mRNA amount (RA)  of three independent replicates during the depletion of Spt16p (Control and 5 & 7 hours after the depletion). Each time point replicate has been hybridized on a different macroarray (F14-F16). ChIP-on-chip analysis of Spt16 were done during exponential grow in YPD.
