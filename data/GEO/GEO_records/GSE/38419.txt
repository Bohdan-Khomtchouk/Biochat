TITLE
miRNA profiles of Wilms tumor patients and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Blood-borne miRNA signatures have recently been reported for various tumor diseases. Here, we compared the miRNA signature in Wilms tumor patients prior to and after preoperative chemotherapy according to the SIOP protocol 2001. We did not find a significant difference between the miRNA signatures of both groups. However, both Wilms tumor patients prior to and after chemotherapy showed a miRNA signature different from that of healthy controls. The signature of Wilms tumor patients prior to chemotherapy showed an accuracy of 97.5% and of patients after chemotherapy an accuracy of 97.0%, each as compared to healthy controls. Our results provide evidence for a blood-borne Wilms tumor miRNA signature largely independent of four weeks preoperative chemotherapy treatment.

DESIGN
This project analyzes peripheral blood profiles of Wilms tumor patients and controls in order to detect specific profiles. n=19 normal controls and n=23 Wilms tumor patients were screened for the complete miRNA repertoire. Please note that each miRNA has been measured in seven replicates and the median of the replica has been computed.
