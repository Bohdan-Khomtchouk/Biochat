TITLE
affy_riz_2011_7-: Transcriptomic analysis of rice leaves challenged with virulent and avirulent Xoo strains

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
affy_riz_2011_7 - affy_riz_2011_7 - The Bacterial Leaf Blight disease of rice is due to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. As for many pathogenic bacteria, it relies on a type 3 secretion system (TTSS) that is devoted to the injection of type 3 effectors (T3Es) into the eukaryotic host cell. These proteins are meant to suppress host basal defense responses and/or mimic some host regulatory function promoting bacterial survey in the plant. During an incompatible interaction, T3Es may act as Avr proteins and stimulate Effector-Triggered-Immunity. We aim at evaluating the transcriptomic response of rice leaves challenged with avirulent strains of Xoo BAI3 and MAI1 on resistant lines IR64 and IRBB4 versus the reference susceptible rice line Nipponbare. In addition, we investigated the transcriptomic response of rice leaves upon inoculation of an XoohrcC mutant strain affected in the production of a functional TTSS.-The goal of the experiment is to characterize the rice leaf transcriptome response, upon the inoculation of susceptible and resistant rice leaves 24 hours post-infection. To that end, the experimental design includes the inoculation of susceptible Nipponbare rice leaves with Xoo strains BAI3 (race A1) and MAI1 (race A3), that will be compared to the response of resistant lines IRBB4 and IR64 rice lines. In addition, Nipponbare rice leaves will also be challenged with the BAI3hrcC mutant that is affected in the production of a functional TTSS.
