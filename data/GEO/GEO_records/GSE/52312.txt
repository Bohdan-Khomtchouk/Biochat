TITLE
Chip-chip from C-33 cells expressing FLAG-HPV1 E2 with FLAG-HPV1 E2

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HPV1 E2 binds with Brd4 to host mitotic chromosomes. To identify the targets, chromatin was prepared from mitotic C-33 cells expressing HPV1 E2, and analyzed by ChIP-chip analysis for binding to a portion of the human genome. E2 and Brd4 bind to active promoters in interphase C-33 cells (Jang et al., 2009), however, in mitosis E2 was observed instead to bind to a few extremely broad peaks on several chromosomes. These peaks ranged in size from several hundred Kb to > 1 Mb and, for the most part, overlapped coding regions.

DESIGN
Signals of anti-FLAG E2 ChIP DNA from mitotic HPV1 E2 expressing C-33 cells
