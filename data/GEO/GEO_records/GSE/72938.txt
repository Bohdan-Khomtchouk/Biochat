TITLE
Targeting metastasis stem cells through the fatty acid receptor CD36 (II)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. For most human cancers, the identity of the cells that initiate and promote metastasis is still unknown, hampering our ability to develop therapies to prevent or inhibit the spread of tumour cells to distant sites. Using an orthotopic model of human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), we have now identified a subpopulation of CD44bright cells within the primary lesion with the highest potential to develop lymph node and lung metastasis. This population is slow-cycling, expresses high levels of the receptor CD36 at the cell membrane and relies on fatty acid metabolism to thrive in lymph nodes and bronchoalveolar environments. Importantly, inhibition of CD36 by either shRNA or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies severely impairs metastatic spread of primary OSCC patient samples and established cell lines. Further underscoring its importance, CD36 overexpression in poorly disseminating tumours confers an aggressive metastatic behaviour. Analyses of public gene expression data indicate that the presence of the signature-defining CD36+ cells also strongly correlates with a poor prognosis in patients with lung SCC, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, or luminal breast cancer. By identifying metastasis-promoting cells and then targeting them with CD36 inhibition, novel anti-metastatic therapies could be developed for patients with these types of tumours.

DESIGN
3 biological replicates from Detroit-562 (Detroit #1,#2, #3) cell line and 2 biological replicates from patient derived cell line VDH-02 (hpSCC/VDH02 #2, #4) were included. From each biological replicate, 2 independent populations were sorted (CD36+ and CD36- respectively).
