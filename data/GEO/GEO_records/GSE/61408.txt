TITLE
Auxin Induced Endodermal to QC Transdifferentiation Time Series and Downsteam of JKD Analysis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
First series collects endodermal cells using the SCR::GFP promoter after treatment with auxin Second series includes comparative samples of jkd vs. wild type plants for specific tissues; QC and meristem

DESIGN
In first series, plants are grown under normal conditions, then transferred to auxin analog 2,4-D and endodermis is collected at time points 0hrs, 24hrs, 48hrs, 72hrs, 96 hrs.

PLATFORM
GPL198 [ATH1-121501] Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array
