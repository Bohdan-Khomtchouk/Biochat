TITLE
Comparative transcriptomics of Clostridium thermocellum wild type (Î”hpt) and Type I glutamine synthetase (Clo1313_2031) deletion strains using RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Ruminiclostridium thermocellum DSM 1313

SUMMARY
RNA-seq analysis revealed that genes involved in urea uptake and metabolism were significantly upregulated in the Clo1313_2031 deletion strain, suggesting that deletion of Clo1313_2031 mimics nitrogen starvation in C. thermocellum.  Additionally, genes encoding the RNF-complex were also more highly expressed and in turn may have a potential role in increasing ethanol production.

DESIGN
Samples for RNA-seq were taken from mid-exponential phase (OD ~ 0.33) batch cultures grown in MTC on 4.5 g/l cellobiose

PLATFORM
GPL20122 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Ruminiclostridium thermocellum DSM 1313)
