TITLE
ATMIN function in p53-deficient GBM

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the expression anaysis of neural stem cells lacking p53, ATMIN, or both.  p53-deficent cells form GBM, which is significanly delayed in the absence of ATMIN.

DESIGN
Expression analysis in primary neural stem cells with 4 genotypes.
