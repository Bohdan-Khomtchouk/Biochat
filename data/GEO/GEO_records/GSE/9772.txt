TITLE
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation microarray data from antiHA IP in stable LNCaP cells expressing either YFP or HOXC6-HA/YFP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor HOXC6 is upregulated in human prostate cancer. SiRNA knockdown of HOXC6 induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells while upregulation rescued LNCaP cells from siRNA-induced apoptosis. We used chromatin immunoprecipitaiton followed by microarray to identify the gene promoters that are bound by HOXC6 in LNCaP cells. Keywords: Stable expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were stabely infected with a lentivirus containing HOXC6-HA-IRES-YFP or IRES-YFP alone.  Cells were sorted for YFP expression and expanded in tissue culture.

PLATFORM
GPL6236 HG18 promoter 2 array set (1 of 2) GPL6237 HG18 promoter 2 array set (2 of 2)
