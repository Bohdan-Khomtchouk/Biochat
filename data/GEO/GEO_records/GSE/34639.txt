TITLE
Methylation data from CD4+ cells at birth and 12 months from a cohort of children who were diagnosed with IgE food allergy to either egg milk or peanut at 12 months (n=12) and healthy controls (n=12).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation data derived from total CD4+ T-cells from a cohort of paediatric food allergy. There are 12 food allergic samples (6 activated and matched control), 12 non-allergic samples (6 activated and matched control) collected at birth and resample at 12-months, total 48 samples. Mononuclear cells were either activated with anti-CD3 (0.5 ug/mL) + IL2(20U) or rested in media alone for 24 hours. CD4+ cells were purified and DNA was harvested and bisulphite converted for methylation analysis on illumina HM450K array.

DESIGN
This is a pooled design. Each sample is bisulphite converted gDNA pooled in equimolar amounts from n=2 individuals. There are 6 allergic pools and 6 non allergic pools. Each pool is sampled at two time points, birth and 12 months, and either treated or untreated at each time point.
