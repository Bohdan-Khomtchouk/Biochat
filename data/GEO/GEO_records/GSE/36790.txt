TITLE
Cetuximab resistant or sensitive head and neck cancer samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
10 cell lines (five cetuximab sensitive and five cetuximab resistant) were selected for gene copy number array analysis on the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 platform. 39 protein coding genes were amplified in cetuximab resistant cells and normal in sensitive cells, all present on genomic regions 11q22.1 or 5p13-15. Five genes were selected for quantitative PCR verification, namely, YAP1 and TRPC6 (11q22.1) and PDCD6, TPPP, and PTGER4 (5p13-15). An extended panel of totally 10 cetuximab resistant and 10 sensitive cell lines verified that YAP1 amplified cells are cetuximab resistant.   YAP1 gene amplification was highly correlated to the YAP1 mRNA expression, which was significantly higher in cetuximab resistant cells than in sensitive. YAP1 downregulation resulted in increased cetuximab sensitivity in one of two cetuximab resistant cell lines investigated and growth inhibition in another. We conclude that YAP1 is a marker for cetuximab resistance in head and neck cancer.

DESIGN
head and neck cancer cell lines with established cetuximab response were selected. 5 cetuximab resistant cell lines and 5 cetuximab sensitive cell lines were selected for gene genome wide gene copy number analysis on the Affymetrix SNP6.0 array
