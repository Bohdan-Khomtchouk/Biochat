TITLE
Stress response in yeasts

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; [Candida] glabrata

SUMMARY
Transcriptome response of the yeasts C. glabrata and S. cerevisiae treated by an antifungal agent, benomyl Keywords: time course; stress response

DESIGN
We performed microarray analyses of the transcriptome response of the yeasts Candida glabrata and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, treated by an antifungal agent, benomyl. The C. glabrata cells were submitted to 20 Î¼g/mL of benomyl for 2, 4, 10, 20, 40 and 80 minutes. The labelled cDNA from treated cells were competitively hybridized on microarrays versus cDNA from mock treated cells.
