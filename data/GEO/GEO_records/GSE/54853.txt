TITLE
RNA-seq of C.elegans and M.musculus in the presence and absence of D-Glucosamine (GlcN)

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
D-Glucosamine (2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose, C.A.S.# 3416-24-8) (GlcN) is a freely available and commonly used dietary supplement possibly promoting cartilage health in humans which also acts as an inhibitor of glycolysis. We here find that GlcN extends C. elegans lifespan by impairing glucose metabolism to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK/AAK2) leading to increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Consistent with the concept of mitohormesis, this promotes increased formation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and p38/PMK-1-mediated stress signaling culminating in increased expression of the nematodal amino acid-transporter 1 (aat-1) gene. Ameliorating mitochondrial ROS formation as well as impairment of aat-1-expression abolishes GlcN-mediated lifespan extension in a NRF2/SKN-1-dependent fashion. Notably and unlike other calorie restriction mimetics (CRM) like 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG, DOG), GlcN extends lifespan of aging C57BL/6 mice (log-rank: p=0.002; cox regression: p=0.01) similarly paralleled by an induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, increased expression of several murine amino acid transporters, as well as increased amino-acid catabolism. Taken together, GlcN mimics a ketogenic diet to extend healthspan in evolutionary distinct species. Jena Centre for Systems Biology of Ageing - JenAge (www.jenage.de)
