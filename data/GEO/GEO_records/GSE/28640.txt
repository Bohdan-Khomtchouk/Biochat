TITLE
Ares Swanson MBNL mutant study

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MBNL1 is a known splicing factor and is related to Myotonic Dystrophy (DM). This study examines the tissue specific splicing patterns of MBNL1 using a mutant and wild type mouse across three tissues (heart,brain,quadricep) related publications: Aberrant alternative splicing and extracellular matrix gene expression in mouse models of myotonic dystrophy. Du H, etal Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2010 Feb;17(2):187-93. and Muscleblind-like 1 knockout mice reveal novel splicing defects in the myotonic dystrophy brain.

DESIGN
We examined quadricep,heart and brain of a mouse MBNL1 mutant to test whether MBNL mutants creates a tissue specific splicing defect. These samples were compared to the tissues of a wild type mouse.
