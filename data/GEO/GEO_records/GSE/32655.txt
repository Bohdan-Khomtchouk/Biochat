TITLE
H3K27me3 profiles along the length of the  X chromosome in trophoblast stem (TS) cells, ChIP-chip

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This analysis includes H3K27me3 profiles along the length of the X-chromosome in male (F2) and female (K4) TS cells and in female TS cells showing local reversals of imprinted X-chromosome inactivation (K4GFP). Data also includes H3K27me3 ChIP-chip profiles in Eed-/- mutant male and female TS cells obtained from Magnuson laboratory (Kalantry S. et al., Nat Cell Biol, 2006).

DESIGN
Analysis of H3K27me3 profiles in five different cell populations. Three independent biological replicates for each wild-type female cell population and two independent biological replicates for the wild-type male cell population are provided. The ChIP-chip analysis was also carried out in Eed-/- male and female TS cells lacking H3K27me3 for comparison (one replicate). The array includes approx. 162,5 Mb of the X chromosome and approx. 14,6 Mb of chromosome 17 as a control.
