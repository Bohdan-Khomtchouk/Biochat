TITLE
Chronic ethanol exposure results in time and brain-region dependent changes in gene coexpression networks.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We examined global gene expression profiles in amygdala (AMY), nucleus accumbens (NAC), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and Liver of male C57BL/6J mice exposed to 4 cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor. Animals were sacrificed at 0, 8, and 120 hr following the last ethanol exposure.

DESIGN
Mice were exposed to 4 cycles of intermittent vapor [4 days of 16 hours vapor/ 8 hours air] with a week between each cycle. Before entry into the vapor chambers, animals were injected with pyrazole (1 mMol/kg) and either ethanol (1.6 g/kg) or saline (controls). Animals were sacrificed at 0, 8, and 120 hr following the last ethanol exposure. The liver 0 hr control group contained 7 animals. Otherwise there were 8 animals per group (treated, control) at each time point.
