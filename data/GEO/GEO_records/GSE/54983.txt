TITLE
DNA methylation data from Reduced Representation Bisulphite sequencing in the Dutch Hunger Winter Families Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report on genome-wide DNA methylation differences associated with early gestational famine exposure. We find that open chromatin regions and enhancers are especially sensitive to prenatal famine exposure.

DESIGN
We compared 24 individuals conceived during the Dutch Famine, a brief 6 month famine at the end of WWII, with a same sex sibling.
