TITLE
Expression data from KEAP1 overexpression and NRF2 siRNA knockdown of A549 NSCLC cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
KEAP1 overexpressed and NRF2 siRNA knockdown A549 NSCLC cells were used to identify downstream genes of NRF2 pathway separately and by combinatorial analysis. We used triplicate microarrays of transfected A549 cells with mKeap1-GFP for overexpression, siRNAs targeting NRF2 for knockdown and siGFP as control respectively. As a result, we identified several genes which are involved in cancer metabolic functions in these cells. We used microarrays to identify the gene downregulated in both KEAP1 overexpressed and NRF2 siRNA knockdown A549 NSCLC cells and found a subset of downregulated genes which are involved in metabolic functions.

DESIGN
We divided microarrays into three groups. One group with A549 cells that were stably transfected with mKeap1-GFP construct for overexpression, second group with knockdown of NRF2 with specific siRNA and third group contains siGFP transfected control cells. Triplicates of both KEAP1 overexpression and NRF2 siRNA knockdown groups were analyzed and compared with control microarray data.
