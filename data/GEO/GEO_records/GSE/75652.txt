TITLE
SATB2 expression increased anchorage-independent growth and cell migration in human bronchial epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2) is a protein that binds to the nuclear matrix attachment region of the cell and regulates gene expression by altering chromatin structure.  We show that ectopic expression of SATB2 in normal human bronchial epithelial cell-line BEAS2B  increased anchorage-independent growth and cell migration,RNA sequencing analyses of SATB2 regulated genes revealed the enrichment of those involved in cytoskeleton, cell adhesion and cell-movement pathways.

DESIGN
Total RNA samples from 2 vector transfected clonesand 2 SATB2 transfected were converted into cDNA libraries using a Tru-seq RNA Sample Preparation v2 Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Reads were aligned to Ensemble gene model (Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.71.gtf) using HTseq (0.6.1.p.1)
