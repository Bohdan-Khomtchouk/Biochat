TITLE
Global gene expression profiling of mouse soleus hindlimb muscle following gradual exposure to hypoxia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Young adult C57 mice were exposed to chronic hypoxia for up to 2 weeks. Control mice were maintained under normoxic conditions

DESIGN
To capture the temporal effect of reduced oxygen tension on gene regulation, we sampled and gene profiled the soleus hindlimb muscle (n=4) at 4 different time-points (day 0, 3, 7 and 14) following initiation of the gradual hypoxic insult (i.e. the O2 level was gradually lowered to 10% over the first week and kept stable during the second week).
