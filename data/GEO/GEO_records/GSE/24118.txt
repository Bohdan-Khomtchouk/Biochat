TITLE
Secreted Factors from Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm and Planktonic Cultures Differentially Impact Human Keratinocytes, in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Interactions between human keratinocytes and secreted factors from Staphylococcus aureus biofilm and planktonic cultures were investigated using microarray analysis. Relative to planktonic secreted factors, biofilm secreted factors up regulated cytokine and chemokine genes in keratinocytes.   Genes associated with DNA damage and oxidative stress were also induced in keratinocytes treated with secreted factors from S. aureus biofilm. Here we show that secreted factors from S. aureus planktonic (PCM) and biofilm (BCM) cultures differentially impact several aspects of wound healing processes.

DESIGN
Secreted factors from S. aureus biofilm and planktonic cultures with equivalent population sizes were placed in contact with human foreskin keratinocytes for 4 hours.  Keratinocytes were grown to ~90% confluency between passages 4-10.
