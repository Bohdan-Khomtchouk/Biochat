TITLE
MicroRNAome of pig adipose and muscle tissues

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Although the well-known importance of pig in agriculture, as well as a model for human biology, the miRNA catalog of pig has been largely undefined. Identification and preliminary characterization of adipose- and muscle-specific miRNAs would be a prerequisite for a thorough understanding of their roles in regulating adipose deposition and muscle growth. In the present study, we get insight into the miRNA transcriptome in eight adipose tissues, two skeletal muscles and cardiac muscle of pig using deep sequencing technology, and to elucidate their characteristic tissue-specific profiles and genomic context.

DESIGN
Eleven small RNA libraries from eight adipose tissues, two skeletal muscle tissues and cardiac muscle of pig were sequenced.

PLATFORM
GPL10945 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Sus scrofa)
