TITLE
Temporal Response to seasonal and pandemic H1N1 infection in human DCs- Donor 1

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An 8 hours timecourse was performed with human DCs infected either with A/California/7/2009 and A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (pandemic) or A/New Caledonia/20/99  and A/Texas/36/91 seosonal.

DESIGN
Human monocyte derived dendritic cells (DCs) were infected either with chicken egg grown  A/California/7/2009, A/Brevig Mission/1/1918, A/New Caledonia/20/99or A/Texas/36/91. Samples were taken and fixed in RNA stabilizing regaent at 2, 2.7, 3.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 hours. Cells exposed to chicken egg alantoic fluid served as a control. Infections with A/California/7/2009,  A/New Caledonia/20/99 or A/Texas/36/91 were carried out at a BSL2 enviroment. Infections with  A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 were carried out in a BSL3 enviroment in parralel to the BSL2 infections with cells from the same donor and cell preparation.
