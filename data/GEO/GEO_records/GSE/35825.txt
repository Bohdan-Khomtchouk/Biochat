TITLE
Type I and II Interferon-Stimulated Genes in Murine Primary Bone Marrow Macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to compare interferon-alpha (IFNa)- and interferon-gamma (IFNg)-stimulated genes under an equivalent biological input. The goal was to compare IFNa- and IFNg-stimulated genes, as well as to identify common and distinct sets of type I and II ISGs.

DESIGN
Bone marrow macrophages derived from mouse bone marrow in M-CSF for 7 days. The cells were stimulated with 62U/mL IFNa and 1U/mL of IFNg for 2.5 hrs in culture. These concentrations induced equivalent STAT1 phosphorylation in BMMs.
