TITLE
Whole genome bisulfite sequencing of sperm from a mouse heterozygous for a mutation in Setdb1 (MommeD13) and a wildtype mouse.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
DNA from mature sperm was obtained from a mouse heterozygous for a mutation in Setdb1 (MommeD13) and a wildtype control mouse. The DNA was bisulfite converted and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 to ~30x coverage. After mapping the resulting reads to the mouse genome DNA methyalation values at CpG dinucleotides were obtained as the ratio of reads with unconverted Cs relative to the sum of converted and unconverted reads. The resulting values were used to identify sites with a shift in the percentage of methylated CpGs between wildtype and mutant sperm.
