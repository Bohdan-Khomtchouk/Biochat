TITLE
Angiosarcoma gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A comparison of gene expression in OCT frozen human angiosarcoma compared with OCT frozen normal mesenchymal tissues

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from 18 AS and normal human. RNA was isolated from 3 kidney and 2 skeletal muscle OCT frozen sections and 3 samples of frozen whole blood. Twenty-five nanograms of total RNA from each sample was used for amplification, and then was fluorescently labeled using Cy3 and hybridized onto Agilent whole human genome 8x60k gene expression microarrays (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) according to Agilent standard procedures.  After hybridization for 17 h at 65 oC and 10 rpm, the arrays were washed and scanned with the Agilent G3 high-resolution scanner.  Probe features were extracted from the microarray scan data using Feature Extraction software v.10.7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). Microarray data was read and processed with R/Bioconductor (version 2.15.1/2.16) statistical software environment using the limma package (version 3.12.1).  The raw data was within array quantile normalized and probes that mapped to the same gene were combined by averaging.
