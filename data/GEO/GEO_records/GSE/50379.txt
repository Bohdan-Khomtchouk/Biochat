TITLE
Expression data from striatum of a mouse model of HuntingtonÂ´s disease (HD) (HdhQ111/Q111) crossed with mGluR5  knockout mice (mGluR5-/-) and their respective controls (HdhQ20/Q20 and mGluR5+/+).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To try to investigate the mechanism behind the adaptive phenotypes observed in a mice model model of HD crossed with mGluR5 knockout, we analyzed whether mutated huntingtin (Htt) expression in a mGluR5 null background could be altering the expression of genes that might be involved in the pattern of Htt aggregation and HD-related locomotor alterations. In this data set, we include analysis of gene expression in striatum of mice with four different genotypes: HdhQ20/Q20/mGluR5+/+; HdhQ20/Q20/mGluR5-/- ; HdhQ111/Q111/mGluR5+/+ ; HdhQ111/Q111/mGluR5-/-

DESIGN
12 samples were analyzed. We used Partek Genomics Suite v6.5 (Partek, St. Louis, MO) to determine differences in gene expression levels. Genotype effects were considered significant based of the following criteria: (i) ANOVA p-values < 0.05 and (ii) 1.5 fold increase or decrease.
