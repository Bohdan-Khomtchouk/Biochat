TITLE
Development of MLL-rearranged leukemia is dependent on a transcriptional program orchestradt by C/EBPα

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Translocations involving the MLL genes are frequently found in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor prognosis. The MLL fusion proteins act as aberrant transcription factor activating a transcriptional program that transforms the cells, potentially through collaboration with other transcription factors. To investigate this we searched gene expression profiles from patients with MLL-rearranged AML compared with normal hematopoietic progenitor cells for transcriptional regulators and found targets of C/EBPα to be up-regulated in the AML samples, suggesting that C/EBPα might collaborate with MLL fusion proteins in the initial transformation process. We could show that transformation by MLL fusion proteins is dependent on C/EBPα activity both in early progenitors as well as in GMPs. In contrast, C/EBPα was found to be indispensable in an already established leukemia. These results suggest that C/EBPα play an important role in the early transforming event of leukemogenesis. We used microarray to study the early transcriptional changes induced by MLL-ENL expression and we identified a combined C/EBPα / MLL-ENL transcriptional signature.

DESIGN
3 Cebpaflox/flox;Mx1Cre and 3 Cebpaflox/flox;Mx1Cre- mice were sacrificed 14 days after pIpC injection and bone marrow cells were harvested, enriched for cKit-expression and transduced with a pMIG retroviral vector expressing the MLL-ENL fusion protein and GFP. 72 h post first transduction, GFP-positive or negative PreGM cells were sorted.
