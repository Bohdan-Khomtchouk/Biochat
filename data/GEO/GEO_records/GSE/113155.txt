TITLE
Transcriptome analysis by microarray of human placental chorionic villi explants infected with Trypanosoma cruzi

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chagas’ disease, one of the major public health concerns in Latin America, is caused by the  haemophlagelated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). In the past few years congenital  transmission of T. cruzi has become more important, and partly responsible for the “globalization of  Chagas’ disease”. The congenital transmission, although with low rates, represents the main route of  transmission in non-endemic countries and endemic countries without vectorial transmission, and  represents one third of the new cases each year.  Diverse pathogens, including T. cruzi, are able to cross the placental barrier and infect both the  placenta and fetus. However, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen  interaction between T. cruzi and the placenta has been scarcely studied.  The use of microarray analysis to determine expression profiles constitutes a powerful tool in order to  identify genes and pathways related to the host response to infections. Here, we analyzed the  transcriptomic response of human placental chorionic villi explants (HPCVE) challenged with T. cruzi  trypomastigotes at low (105) and high (106) concentrations for 2 and 24 hours

DESIGN
Human Placental Chorionic Villi Explants (HPE) were obtained from term placentas ( > 38 weeks) with an informed consent from heatlhy women in elective cesarean delivery. In a Level II biosafety cabinet, 0,5 cm3 HPE were isolated from the center of the cotyledon, washed with sterile PBS in order to remove excess of blood and later  incubated with 105 or 106 parasites/ml (Y Strain Tripomastigotes, the infective form of the parasite) for 2 and 24 hrs.
