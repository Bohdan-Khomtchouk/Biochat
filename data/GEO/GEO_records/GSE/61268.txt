TITLE
HOTAIR or shHOTAIR lentiviral infected prostate cancer cells [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LNCaP prostate cancer cells were infected by lentivirus expressing either ctrl or HOTAIR, and the cells were cultured in hormone-deprived condition (Ethl) or in the presence of androgen (R1881). C4-2B prostate cancer cells were infected by lentivirus expressing either shCtrl or shHOTAIR, and the cells were cultured in hormone-deprived condition (Ethl) or in the presence of androgen (R1881).

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq examination of AR binding sites in LNCaP and C4-2B cells following HOTAIR de-regulation.
