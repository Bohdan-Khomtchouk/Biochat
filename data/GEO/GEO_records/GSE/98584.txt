TITLE
Gene expression profiling of continuous growth hormone infused (cGH) adult male mouse liver by RNA-seq analysis of polyA-selected liver RNA. [G88_G96]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PolyA-selected RNA isolated from livers of adult male mice treated with a continuous infusion of growth hormone for either 10 hr or 14 days was analyzed by RNA-seq

DESIGN
Liver RNA was isolated from 8 week old male mice treated with a continuous GH infusion (cGH) for either 10 hr or 14 day. For the 10 hour time point, n=9-10 individual liver RNA samples were pooled for each of 2 biological replicate libraries. For the 14 day time point, 2-3 individual RNA samples were pooled to make each of 3 biological replicate libraries. The sequencing data for the sham-treated controls is found in GEO series GSE66140, together with polyA-selected cGH infusions for 1 day, 4 day and 7 days from the same study as this study.
