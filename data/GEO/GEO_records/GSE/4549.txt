TITLE
Global exploration of interaction between HBsAg expression and Hepatocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In patient serum, HBsAg particles can outnumber HBV particles by 1000:1 or higher. To explore the interactions between HBsAg and hepatocytes, concentrating on the possible effects of persistently secreting HBsAg on the functions of host cells, we have used the S gene of a full-length HBV isolate derived from an HBsAg chronic carrier (code No. C8, GenBank accession No. AF461363), cloned into pCMV vector to transfect HepG2 cells. G418 resistant clones secreting HBsAg were selected to establish permanent cell lines, and control clones transfected only with the vector were passaged as well to serve as controls. Cells were separately collected on the fourth and the eighth day after seeding, and gene expression profiles of both cell clones were studied and compared by microarray. Totally, 340 genes were suppressed and 673 genes were induced by the expression of HBsAg on the fourth day, whereas 219 genes were down-regulated and 683 genes were up-regulated on the eighth day. Arbitrarily, changes of genes detected on both 4th and 8th day cultures were selected for further study. Many cellular functions such as immune response, xenobiotic metabolism, ubiquitin pathway, transcription regulation were affected by HBsAg expression, indicating a close association between HBsAg and host cells. Keywords: interaction, HBsAg expression, hepatocyte function

DESIGN
HBsAg particles are composed of viral envelope proteins and outnumber HBV virions by 1000:1 or even higher. This unique characteristic of HBV remains to be one of the challenges in basic and clinical aspects of viral hepatitis B. In this study, we want to explore the interactions between HBsAg and hepatocytes, concentrating on the effects of persistently secreting HBsAg on host cell functions.
