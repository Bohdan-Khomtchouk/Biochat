TITLE
Identification of genes related to local aggressiveness and metastatical potential in mesenchymal tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed 102 sample of mesenchymal tumors of different histological type and biological behaviour. The aim of the study was to identify genes related to each characteristic analysed.

DESIGN
We compared the gene expression profiles of 102 mesenchymal tumors with histological and clinical parameters. Total RNA was extracted, amplified and spotted on cDNA microarray slides. Experiments were performed in duplicate, using the dye-swap method.
