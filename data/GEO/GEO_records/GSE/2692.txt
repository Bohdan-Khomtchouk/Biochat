TITLE
Temporal bovine liver gene expression

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Liver from five Holstein cows fed to current National Research Council (2001) recommendations during the dry period and early lactation was biopsied at -65, -30, -14, 1, 14, 28, and 49 days relative to parturition.  cDNA from liver and a reference standard (made from cattle tissues not including liver or mammary) were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dye and co-hybridized to our 7,872 bovine cDNA microarray using a dye-swap design. More than 5,000 sequences present on the array were expressed in liver.  Normalized log-transformed ratios (liver/reference) were analyzed using a MIXED model in SAS.  Keywords: cow, liver, lactation, microarray, periparturient period Keywords: time-course
