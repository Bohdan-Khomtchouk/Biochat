TITLE
Expression data from E10 cells with miR-129 over-expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNAs are known to regulate gene expression by suppressing translation, but there is also a wealth of data showing that they can act as critical regulators of mRNA stability of their targets. In this experiment, we analyzed the mRNA expression profiles of E10 with high expression of miR-129 as compared to control cells to identify miR-129 targets. E10 cells infected with miR-129 over-expressing lentivirus or the control lentivirus were cultured for 48 hours. More than 80% of cells were infected. Total RNA samples were isolated using Trizol (invitrogen), and subjected to labeling, fragmentation and hybridization, according to manufacturerâ€™s protocols. Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) was used for mRNA expression profiling.

DESIGN
We compared the mRNA expression profiles between cells infected with miR-129 expressing lentivirus and the cells infected with control lentivirus
