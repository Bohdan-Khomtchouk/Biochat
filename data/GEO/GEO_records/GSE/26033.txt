TITLE
A Genome-wide Study of DNA Methylation Patterns and Gene Expression Levels in Multiple Human and Chimpanzee Tissues

ORGANISM
Pan troglodytes ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
It has long been hypothesized that changes in gene regulation have played an important role in primate evolution. However, despite the wealth of comparative gene expression data, there are still only few studies that focus on the mechanisms underlying inter-primate differences in gene regulation.  In particular, we know relatively little about the degree to which changes in epigenetic profiles might explain differences in gene expression levels between primates. To this end, we studied DNA methylation and gene expression levels in livers, hearts, and kidneys from multiple humans and chimpanzees.

DESIGN
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of heart, kidney, and liver samples from humans and chimpanzees.  The Illumina Infinium 27K Human DNA Methylation BeadChip v1.2 was used to compare DNA methylation profiles across approximately 10,575 CpG sites in human and chimpanzee tissue samples.  Samples included 6 human livers, 6 human kidneys, 6 human heart, 6 chimpanzee livers, 6 chimpanzee kidneys, and 6 chimpanzee hearts. Two techical replicates of bisulfite converted DNA from each of the 36 samples was hybridized to the Illumina HumanMethylation27 Beadchip. We limited our analysis to the  10,575 probes that were a perfect sequence match to both the human and chimpanzee genomes and which were associated with genes for which we had previously collected expression measurements across the three tissues.
