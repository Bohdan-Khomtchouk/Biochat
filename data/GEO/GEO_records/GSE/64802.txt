TITLE
piRNA-guided slicing specifies transcripts for Zucchini dependent, phased piRNA biogenesis

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
PIWI-clade Argonaute proteins repress transposable elements in animal gonads. Their sequence specificity is conferred via bound ~23-30nt long piRNAs, which are processed from single stranded precursor RNAs. How transcripts are specified as precursors and processed into stereotypical piRNA populations are central unresolved questions. Here we show that piRNA-guided RNA cleavage in Drosophila results not only in generation of a ping-pong partner piRNA but further triggers efficient 3′ directed and phased primary piRNA biogenesis. Phasing is a feature of primary piRNAs in somatic and germline cells and a consequence of consecutive endo-nucleolytic cleavage events catalyzed by Zucchini. Formation of 3′ and 5′ ends of flanking piRNAs is therefore tightly coupled. Zucchini also participates in 3′ end formation of secondary piRNAs but its function can be bypassed by additional downstream piRNA-guided cleavages and subsequent precursor trimming. Hallmarks of Zucchini-dependent phased piRNA biogenesis are also evident in mouse testes, pointing to an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of piRNA biogenesis.

DESIGN
This study aims at understanding how piRNA biogenesis is intiated in the Drosophila germline and understanding the role of the nuclease Zucchini/MitoPLD in piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila/Mouse by analysing small RNA sequencing data of various genotypes and sensor constructs.
