TITLE
Monkeypox and Vaccinia infection of cultured human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed effects of monkeypox (MPX) and vaccinia (VAC) infection on cultured human cells.  Our custom-designed arrays contain > 18,000 human genes as well as genes for each open reading frame of MPX and VAC. A reference experiement design type is where all samples are compared to a common reference. Compound Based Treatment: Chemical used for treating infected cells Infection: Virus used for infection Cell Line: Cell line used for infection Time: Time cells were harvested after infection Keywords: reference_design
