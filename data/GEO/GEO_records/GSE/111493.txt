TITLE
Expression alterations of miRNAs in SW620, HCT116, HUVEC cells exposed to 200 Î¼g/mL PEP06 for 24 h relative to control cells without drugs.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive miRNA array, we screened the abundance of 2043 microRNAs in 2 colorectal cancer cell lines SW620 and HCT116, as well as HUVEC post treatment of PEP06. Among the 2043 microRNAs, 23 were found to be aberrantly expressed with statistical significances between the control and the PEP06 treated group. In the validating study with real-time PCR and Northern blot, miR-146b-5p was revealed significantly regulated by treatment of PEP06 in vivo and in vitro. We next explored the functions of miR-146b-5p in the EMT process in colorectal cancer. Our findings gave new insights in disclosing the mechanism by which PEP06 induces colorectal cancer inhibition.

DESIGN
In this study, two samples from each group were used to acquire the miRNA expression profiling and the function of the abundant miRNAs in the CRC were analyzed by bioinformatic methods, finally, miR-146b-5p was experimentally validated to be an important target in the process of PEP06 in the treatment of CRC.
