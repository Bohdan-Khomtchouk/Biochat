TITLE
Wide-spread disruption of transcription termination in HSV-1 infection: Next-generation sequencing of translational activityd by ribosome profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were infected with wild-type simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) strain 17 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Ribosome profiling was performed at various times during infection with minor modification to the protocol described in Stern-Ginossar N et al., Science 2012

DESIGN
Ribosome profiling was performed a 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post infection. Two biological replicates were analysed.
