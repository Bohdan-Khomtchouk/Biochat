TITLE
Transcriptome analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HOIL-1-deficient patients upon TNF-α or IL-1β stimulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HOIL-1 deficient disease is a new early onset fatal autosomal recessive human disorder charaterized by chronic auto-inflammation, recurrent invasive bacterial infections and progressive muscular amylopectinosis. We studied the effect of TNF-α and IL-1β on transcriptional changes of PBMCs from HOIL-1- and MYD88-deficient patients.

DESIGN
PBMCs were obtained from HOIL-1 and MYD88-deficient patients and healthy donors and stimulated with TNF-α or IL-1β for 2 and 6 hours. RNA were extracted. Labeled cRNA were hybridized to Illumina Human HT-12 V4 Beadchips.
