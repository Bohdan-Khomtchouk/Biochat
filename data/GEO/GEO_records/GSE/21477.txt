TITLE
Gene Expression Changes in Primary Human Nasal Epithelial Cells exposed to Formaldehyde in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using various exposure conditions, we studied the induction of DNA-protein crosslinks (DPX) by formaldehyde (FA) and their removal in primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC). DPX were indirectly measured by the alkaline comet assay as the reduction of gamma ray – induced DNA migration. DPX are the most relevant primary DNA alterations induced by FA and the comet assay is a very sensitive method for the detection of FA-induced DPX. In parallel experiments, we investigated changes in gene expression by using a full genome human microarray. After a single treatment with FA (50 to 200 µM), concentration – and time-dependent changes in gene expression were seen under conditions that also induced genotoxicity. Repeated treatments with low FA concentrations (20 and 50 µM) did not lead to a significant induction of DPX but repeated treatments with 50 µM FA changed the expression of more than 100 genes. Interestingly, the expression of genes involved in the main pathway for FA detoxification and the repair of DPX were not specifically enhanced. A high degree of overlap was seen among the pattern of gene changes induced by FA in HNEC in comparison to recently published array studies for nasal epithelial cells from rats exposed to FA in vivo. Our results suggest that HNEC are a suited in vitro model for the characterization of FA-induced toxicity and the relationship between genotoxic and other cytotoxic effects.
