TITLE
Combined RNA-seq and ChIP-seq Identifies Gene Targets for Transcriptional Regulation in Vasopressin-Sensitive Collecting Duct Cells [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNAs and mapping the binding of RNA polymerase 2 in collecting duct cells treat with Vasopressin or vehicle.

DESIGN
Confluent mpkCCD cell monolayers were maintained in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to treatment with or without 0.1 nM dDAVP in serum-free medium for 24 h. followed  RNA polymerase 2 Chip seq.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
