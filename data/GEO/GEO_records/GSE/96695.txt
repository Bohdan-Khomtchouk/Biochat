TITLE
Transcriptional heterogeneity of mast cells and basophils upon activation. [mast cells]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed large-scale comparative microarrays of bone marrow -derived mast cells and basophils at rest, upon an adaptive-type action (IgE-crosslinking) or upon innate-type activation (IL-33-activation).

DESIGN
A total of 24 samples were evaluated in this microarray study. All treatment groups were analyzed in triplicates. Six different groups of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) were analyzed. WT or ST2KO BMMCs were either unstimulated, IgE-activated, or IL-33-stimulated. Similarly, six groups of bone marrow-derived basophils (BMBs) were prepared and analyzed in triplicates.
