TITLE
Notch signaling regulates neural crest differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the dataset was to study on genome-wide level the effect of Notch inhibition in gene expression on neural crest differentiation of human embryonic stem cells under chemically defined conditions.

DESIGN
Total RNA from hESCs, hESC-derived neural crest, hESC-derived neural crest+DAPT, and hESC-derived neural stem cells was collected and compared at their global gene expression level. Samples from 3 biological replicates were analysed.
