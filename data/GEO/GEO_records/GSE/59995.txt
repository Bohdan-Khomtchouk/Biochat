TITLE
Effect of DC-SCRIPT expression in MCF7 breast cancer cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths in women. Nuclear receptors (NR) and their regulators are well known for their role in breast cancer. Especially ligands for the type I NRs, Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor have growth promoting effects in breast cancer cells. The NR coregulator DC-SCRIPT (ZNF366) has been found to be a strong and independent prognostic marker in ER positive (ESR1) breast cancer patients. DC-SCRIPT modulates the function of multiple NRs and has opposing effects on type I versus type II NRs. It represses the function of the growth promoting type I NRs, whereas it enhances the mainly anti-proliferative type II NRs. In this study we aimed to gain further insight into the functional role of DC-SCRIPT in breast cancer cells.  Therefore, the effect of DC-SCRIPT expression on breast cancer cell gene expression was investigated using a novel DC-SCRIPT-inducible MCF7 breast cancer cell line model. In the presence of DC-SCRIPT, multiple cell cycle related genes were differentially expressed, including the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2B.

DESIGN
MCF7EV (empty vector control) and MCF7SC (DC-SCRIPT-inducible) breast cancer cell lines were treated with doxycyline for a total of 68h (to induce DC-SCRIPT expression in MCF7SC clones). After the first 24h, cells were serum starved for 24h to synchronize the cells. Subsequently, cells were released with 10 nM estradiol during the last 20 hours of culturing. Total RNA from two replicate experiments were obtained, and used to compare MCF7EV to MCF7SC clones.
