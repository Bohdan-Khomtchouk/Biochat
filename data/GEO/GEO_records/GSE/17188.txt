ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two MDA-MB-231 sublines, SCP2 and LM2 (4175), were applied to low oxygen (1%) for 0, 6 and 24 hours, then profiled for RNA expression.

DESIGN
Two sublines, each sublines has three conditions: 0h, 6h and 24h for hypoxia treatment. Each condition has two repeats. Total 12 samples
