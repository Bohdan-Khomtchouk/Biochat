TITLE
Pancreatic endocrine tumours: expression profiling evidences a rold for AKT-mTOR pathway

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated the global gene expression in a large panel of pancreatic endocrine tumours (PETs) aimed at identifying new potential targets for therapy and biomarkers to predict patient outcome.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue and hybridized on a custom 18.5K human oligo microarrays obtained from the Ohio State University Cancer Center.
