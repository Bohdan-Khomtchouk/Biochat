TITLE
Expression profiling of a high-fertility mouse line by microarray analysis and qPCR.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The objective of the present study was to identify genes that are involved in increasing the ovulation number in mouse line FL1 that had been selected for high fertility performance. Keywords: Comparative gene expression profiling

DESIGN
Ovaries from 30 animals of line FL1 and of the control line DUKsi were collected at the metestrous stage, combined to 6 pools each, and processed for microarray analysis.
