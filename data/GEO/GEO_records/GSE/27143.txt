TITLE
Gene expression profiles of mouse Blimp1 +/gfp and Blimp1 gfp/gfp regulatory T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Regulatory T (Treg) cells are required for peripheral tolerance. Recent evidence indicates that Treg cells can adopt specialized differentiation programs in the periphery that are controlled by transcription factors usually associated with T helper differentiation. We demonstrate that expression of the transcription factor Blimp1 defines a population of Treg cells that localize predominantly to mucosal sites and produces IL-10. Blimp1 is required for IL-10 production by these cells and for their tissue homeostasis. A list of differentially expressed genes were identified from this whole-genome expression profiling experiment.

DESIGN
Mouse Blimp1 +/gfp and Blimp1 gfp/gfp regulatory T cells were analyzed. Three replicates each.
