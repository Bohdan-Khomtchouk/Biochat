TITLE
T-bet activates poised Th1 genes through Mediator and the Super Elongation Complex [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor T-bet directs Th1 cell differentiation, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie this lineage-specific gene regulation are not completely understood. Here, we show that T-bet acts through super-enhancers in human and mouse Th1 cells to recruit Mediator and P-TEFb in the form of the super elongation complex (SEC). Th1-specific genes are poised in Th2 cells while T-bet-mediated recruitment of P-TEFb in Th1 cells activates transcriptional elongation. P-TEFb is recruited to both genes and super-enhancers, where it activates enhancer RNA transcription. P-TEFb inhibition and Mediator and SEC knockdown selectively block activation of T-bet target genes and P-TEFb inhibition abrogates Th1-associated experimental autoimmune uveitis. T-bet activity is independent of changes in NF-κB RelA and Brd4 binding, but T-bet- and NF-κB-mediated pathways converge to allow P-TEFb recruitment. These data support a model in which lineage-specifying factors allow recruitment of P-TEFb to poised genes to promote differentiation of alternative T cell fates.
