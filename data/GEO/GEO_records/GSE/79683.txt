TITLE
Expression data from thalamic dLGN nucleus in control and Sema6A knock-out mice at P0

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Misguided visual thalamic axons leads to changes in gene expression in visual thalamic neurons. We used microarrays to determine the global programme of gene expression due to altered connectivity.

DESIGN
Mouse thalamic tissue from identified dLGN nuclei was selected at postnatal stage P0 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We used two conditions: heterozygous (controls)  and homozygous knock-out of Sema6A (Sema6A-/-) mice. Each sample is composed by pooling the thalamic nuclei tissue from pups of the same condition from different litters.
