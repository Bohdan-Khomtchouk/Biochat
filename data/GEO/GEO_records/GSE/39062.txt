TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling analysis of a Hmgn1, 3 and 5 mutant mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Members of the HMGN protein family bind to nucleosomes and affect chromatin structure and functions as transcription, replication and DNA repair as well as epigenetic modifications. Overexpression of Hmgn1 may be linked to the etiology of Down syndrome while underexpression may be linked to some leukemias. Hmgn3 is highly expressed in eye and in brain and might influence behavioral phenotype. For Hmgn5 effects on transcription levels e.g. in liver are suggested.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from four homozygote mutant and wildtype male mice were compared.
