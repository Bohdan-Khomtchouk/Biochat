TITLE
Peripheral blood cells expression data form 7 patients with severe pdm(H1N1) influensa and 7 gender and age matched healthy controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using PAXgene tubes, peripheral blood samples were collected  from seven patients > 18 years with documented pdm(H1N1) influenza, bilateral chest infiltrates, and in need of ventilation support. Significant co-morbidity was exclusion criterion. Expression profiles were compared with 7 age matched controls. Using  a false discovery rate < 5% and  an absolute fold change > 2, 370 genes  were differentially expressed in case and controls. A second sample was collected after ca 6 days in the 7 patients and temporal changes in expression profiles investigated. Over expressed putative mediators of inflammatory lung dammage were measured on the protein level.

DESIGN
14 patient samples (7 paired samples) and 7 control samples were performed.
