TITLE
Genome wide host gene expression analysis in duck lungs infected with highly or low pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus

ORGANISM
Anas platyrhynchos

SUMMARY
The underlying molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis and outcome of disease to different pathotypes of H5N1 influenza infection in ducks remain unclear. For that, we studied genome wide host gene expression of lung tissues infected with A/duck/India/02CA10/2011(AD2011) H5N1 virus and A/duck/Tripura/103597/2008 (AD2008) H5N1 virus in ducks using custom designed microarray.  AD2011 is highly pathogenic whereas AD2008 is low pathogenic to ducks. Comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that 688 genes were commonly expressed, 877 and 1556 genes are uniquely expressed to infection with AD2011 and AD2008 virus isolate, respectively. The up-regulation of cytokines genes OAS, IL1B, IL17, IFITM2, CCL4, CXCR4, STAT3, TGFB1 and TGFB2 in the lungs tissues may cause high mortality in ducks infected with AD2011 virus.  The expression of important antiviral immune genes IFIT5, IFITM5, RSAD2, EIF2AK2 (PKR), Mx, Î²-defensins, TRIM23 and SLC16A3 to AD2008 infection, but not in AD2011 infection, cause the host may fine-tune their innate immune responses and prevent from cytokines storms and tissue damage. Several immune related Gene ontology (GO) terms and immune pathways activated were qualitatively similar but quantitatively different to both virus infections.  Based on these findings, we conclude that subtle differences in host immune responses may determine the different outcome of H5N1 infection in ducks.
