TITLE
Digital Gene Expression Tag Profiling after Wt1 deletion in Sertoli cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Wilms tumor gene, Wt1, is specifically expressed in Sertoli cells (SCs) which support spermatogenesis. Germ cell loss was found in Wt1 knockout mice. In  vitro  studies  demonstrated  that  Wt1  was  essential  for  cell  polarity maintenance  in  SCs. We used Digital Gene Expression Tag Profiling to detail the global programme of gene expression after Wt1 deletion in sertoli cell and identified 710 gene expression level change more than 2 times.

DESIGN
Digital Gene Expression Tag Profiling  analysis  were  performed  using  mRNA  from  control  and Wt1-deficient   Primary Sertoli cells, every group primare sertoli cell were from more than 30 mice.
