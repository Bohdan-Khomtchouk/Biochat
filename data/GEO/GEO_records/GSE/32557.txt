TITLE
A conserved transcriptional regulator governs fungal morphology in widely diverged species [ChIP-chip, Transcriptional regulation by Mit1 and orthologs]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
In this paper, we examine orthologs of a transcriptional regulator in three fungal species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. We show that, despite an estimated 600 million years since those species diverged from a common ancestor, Wor1 in C. albicans, Ryp1 in H. capsulatum, and Mit1 in S. cerevisiae recognize the same DNA motif. Previous work established that Wor1 regulates white-opaque switching in C. albicans and that its ortholog Ryp1 regulates the yeast to mycelial transition in H. capsulatum. Here we show that the ortholog Mit1 in S. cerevisiae also regulates a morphological transition, in this case pseudohyphal growth. Full genome chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that Mit1 binds to the control regions of approximately 94 genes including the previously known regulators of pseudohyphal growth. Through a comparison of full genome chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments for Mit1 in S. cerevisiae, Wor1 in C. albicans, and Wor1 ectopically expressed in S. cerevisiae, we conclude that genes controlled by the orthologous regulators overlap only slightly between these two species. We suggest that the ancestral Wor1/Mit1/Ryp1 protein controlled aspects of cell morphology and that evolutionary movement of genes in and out of the Wor1/Mit1/Ryp1 regulon is responsible, in part, for the differences of morphological forms among these species. Consistent with this idea, ectopic expression of C. albicans Wor1 or H. capsulatum Ryp1 can drive the pseudohyphal growth program in S. cerevisiae.
