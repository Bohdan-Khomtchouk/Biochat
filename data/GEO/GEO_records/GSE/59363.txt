TITLE
Effect of type 2 diabetes on transcriptional signatures during exercise and recovery

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We performed gene expression microarray analysis of skeletal muscle biopsies from normal glucose tolerant subjects and type 2 diabetes subjects obtained during a 60 min bicycle ergometer exercise and the 180 min of recovery phase

DESIGN
We analysed skeletal mucle biopsies from patients with T2D and from control subjects (n=7 each) at three time points during exercise and recovery
