TITLE
DNA microarray analysis of global gene regulation by AdpAch in Streptomyces chattanoogensis

ORGANISM
Streptomyces chattanoogensis

SUMMARY
The effects of AdpAch on transcription of all protein-coding genes of S. griseus were evaluated by comparison of the transcriptomes of the wild-type to that of the ∆adpAch mutant strain

DESIGN
We compared the pattern of gene expression of the wild-type (WT) to that of the ∆adpAch mutant strain. Mycelium was harvested after 16h, 24h, and 36h of growth and RNA was isolated from three independent cultures of each strain. For DNA microarray analysis of mutant strains, we considered a fold change of ≥2 and ≤0.5 of that of the WT strains, respectively, with a P-value < 0.05 to be significant. According to these criteria, approximately 1400 genes were differentially expressed at all time points
