TITLE
Corticosteroid responsive genes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Three groups of Wistar rats with different manipulated levels of corticosterone were used to identify corticosteroid-responsive genes in hippocampus: 1. rats were adrenalectomised (ADX) 2. In addition to ADX these rats were implanted with a subcutaneous pellet containing 20 mg corticosterone and 80% cholesterol (ADX + low CORT) 3. In addition to ADX and implantation of a corticosterone pellet, these rats received a subcutaneous injection with corticosterone (1 mg/kg bodyweight) three hours prior to decapitation ((ADX + low CORT) + acute high CORT). All 3 groups of rats were decapitated three days after ADX and their hippocampus was isolated. Hippocampal RNA from 6 rats per group was pooled and used as input material for the SAGE libraries. Keywords: parallel sample
