TITLE
Gonadal Adipose Tissue Profiling In HMDP (high-fat/high-sucrose diet)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identify genes in the gonadal adipose tissue whose expression is under genetic regulation in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP).  The HMDP comprises classical inbred and recombinant inbred wild type mice.  The RMA values of genes were used for genome wide association as described in Parks et al Cell Metabolism 2015.  These data are used to identify candidate genes at loci associated with obesity and dietary responsiveness.

DESIGN
GWAS for expression of gonadal adipose tissue in inbred strains fed chow diet for 8 weeks followed by high-fat/high-sucrose diet 8 weeks

PLATFORM
GPL8759 [HT_MG-430A] Affymetrix HT Mouse Genome 430A Array
