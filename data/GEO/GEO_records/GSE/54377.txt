TITLE
Different nucleosomal landscapes at early and late replicating origins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Sequencing of mononucleosomal DNA during G1 and S phases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

DESIGN
Samples from mononucleosomal DNA from WT and rpd3 mutant strains (W303-1a background) in G1 or in S phase in the presence of 0.2 M HU were sequenced (Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx) using the single-end read protocol

PLATFORM
GPL13272 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
