TITLE
Post-Transcriptional Role for the Yeast Paf1-RNA Polymerase II Complex is Revealed by Identification of Primary Targets

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
To identify the direct targets of the Paf1/RNA polymerase II complex we compared expression profiles of isogenic wild type and paf1 and ctr9 mutant strains. We also created a Tet-regulated form of Paf1 and monitored expression patterns after shut off of Paf1. Samples were isolated at one hour intervals from 1 to 8 hours after shut off. Keywords: single channel nucleotide

DESIGN
Transcripts were compared on Affymetrix microarrays using standard protocols.
