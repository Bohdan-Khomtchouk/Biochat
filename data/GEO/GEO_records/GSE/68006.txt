TITLE
Oxidative quality control regulates response to ER stress through translation control

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The transcriptomic response after 3 hours of DTT treatment shows there is not a drastic difference in most genes between WT and skn7∆, yap1∆ . Vma13∆, sse2∆ were also used as part of the study.
