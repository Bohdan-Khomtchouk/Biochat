TITLE
ChIP-Seq for Nkx3-1 in whole mouse prostate

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the genome-wide binding sites of the NK homeodomain transcription factor, Nkx3-1, in mouse prostate. Three different mouse genotypes were used: Nkx3-1 wild-type (WT), Nkx3-1 heterozygote (HET), and Nkx3-1 knock-out (KO). Two biological replicates were performed for WT and HET, and one replicate for KO. The mice used were a recombinant inbred C57BL6/J x 129 strain. The KO dataset was used as a control in lieu of an IgG.

DESIGN
Examination of Nkx3-1 binding sites in Nkx3-1+/+ (WT), +/- (HET) and -/- (KO) mouse prostates
