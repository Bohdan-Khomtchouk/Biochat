TITLE
Expression data from mice brain implanted GSC272 glioma stem cells or POSTN knockout

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Differential mRNA expression patterns were seen in GSC272-vector compared to GSC272-POSTN shRNA tumors. We used microarrays to POSTN regulated gene expression in glioma stem cells.

DESIGN
Gene expression comparisons were shown between: 1. mRNA control from GSC272 glioma stem cells implanted mouse brain tumor at 7 weeks after implantation, and 2. mRNA deplection of POSTN from  knock down of POSTN of GSC272 glioma stem cells implanted mouse brain tumor  at 7 weeks after implantation.
