TITLE
A transcriptome map of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae at single-nucleotide resolution using RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 3 str. JL03

SUMMARY
We used the RNA-seq technology to do a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of A. pleuropneumoniae strain JL03 and investigated the transcriptome structure at a single-nucleotide resolution.The RNA-Seq based transcriptome map validated annotated genes and corrected annotations of open reading frames in the genome, and led to the identification of many functional elements (e.g. regions encoding novel proteins, non-coding sRNAs and operon structures).

DESIGN
Transcript profiling of a single sample by RNA-Seq
