TITLE
Expression data in Arabidopsis fry1-6, xrn2-4, xrn3-3 and xrn4-6 mutants.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We applied the tiling arrays to study the Arabidopsis whole-genome transcriptome in Arabidopsis  fry1-6, xrn2-4, xrn3-3 and xrn4-6 mutants.

DESIGN
The total RNA was prepared from 15-day-old Arabidopsis plants  grown on the agar plates and used for the microarray hybridization. Three replicative hybridization experiments for each strand array were carried out using the independent biological RNA samples.
