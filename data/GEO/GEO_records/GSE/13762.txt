TITLE
Comparative gene expression profile of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-treated human monocyte-derived dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have carried out global gene expression analysis to clarify the interrelationship between 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and differentiation-driven gene expression patterns in developing human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Monocytes were treated with 10 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or vehicle 14 hours after plating for 12 hours or 5 days. Monocytes, differentiating dendritic cells (+/-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 12 hours) and immature dendritic cells (+/-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 5 days) were harvested. This design allows one to identify genes regulated by differentiation and/or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.

DESIGN
Human monocytes were obtained from buffy coats from healthy donors by Ficoll gradient centrifugation followed by immunomagnetic cell separation with anti-CD14-conjugated microbeads. Monocytes were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 800 U/ml GM-CSF and 500 U/ml IL-4. Monocytes were treated with 10 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or vehicle 14 hours after plating for 12 hours or 5 days. Monocytes, differentiating dendritic cells (+/-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 12 hours) and immature dendritic cells (+/-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 5 days) were harvested. Experiments were performed in biological triplicates representing samples from different donors. 15 samples were processed and hybridized to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.
