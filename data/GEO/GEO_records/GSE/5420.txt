TITLE
Auratus goldfish genome project: effects of fluoxetine on female goldfish

ORGANISM
Carassius auratus

SUMMARY
A goldfish brain enriched cDNA combined with a carp microarray (Gracey et al., 2004). Female adult goldish were treated twice a week for 17 days, for a total of five injections.  Each of the injections consisted of 5 μg fluoxetine/g of body weight with an injection volume of 1μl/g.  The telencephalon was tissue used. Keywords: i.p.injection of muscimol, 6 hours, pharmacological

DESIGN
4 slides (n=3 treatment samples and common control pool) slide 19 = treatment sample 1 slide 30 = treatment sample 2 slide 36 = treatment sample 3 (dye swap) slide 39 = treatment sample 3 (dye swap)
