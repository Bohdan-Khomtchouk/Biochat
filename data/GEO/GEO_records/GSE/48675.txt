TITLE
Comparison of gene expression profiles between N2 wild-type C. elegans and an nhr-8(hd117) mutant

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of N2 vs. nhr-8 mutant worms, aiming to identify direct and indirect targets of the nuclear receptor.

DESIGN
Seven independent synchronized populations of N2 and nhr-8(hd117) animals were grown from eggs on low cholesterol plates at 25 degrees C until mid-L3 larval stage and collected for microarray RNA expression analysis.

PLATFORM
