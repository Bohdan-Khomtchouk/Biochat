TITLE
Growth of B. thetaiotaomicron on purified host mucosal glycans and glycan fragments

ORGANISM
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron

SUMMARY
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was grown and transcriptionally profiled on a number of different host mucosal glycans and their component mono- and disaccharides.

DESIGN
Experiments are performed in biological duplicate (2 replicates per growth condition). All cultures were harvested at similar points in mid-log phase of growth in minimal medium plus 0.5% (total amount, w/v) of a defined carbon source. Cultures on individual carbon sources are designed to be referenced to a minimal medium glucose control (GSM302686 and 302791) grown in the same growth format. Note that the hybridization targets used for these two reference datasets are from the exact same prep used for similar targets on the GPL1821 platform (sets GSM301720 and 301721)

PLATFORM
GPL7006 [BacEubMsa520350F] Affymetrix Human gut microbiota community GeneChip
