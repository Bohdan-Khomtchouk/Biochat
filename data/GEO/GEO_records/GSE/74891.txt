TITLE
Expression data for xenograft tumor treated with IL-6 or siCUL4A.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The miRNAs expression was altered with the treatment with IL-6 or siCUL4A in xenograft tumor of human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HCT116 cells. And various miRNAs induced by IL-6 also may contribute to tumor growth .

DESIGN
Using a Affymetrix® GeneChip® miRNA Arrays platform, we analyzed the  miRNA expression levels in tumorous tissues of xenograft tumor that were treated with IL-6 or siCUL4A.
