TITLE
Expression data from rhesus macaque blood CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta

SUMMARY
Immunization of macaques with simian immunodeficiency virus with deletions in nef (SIVΔnef) has been shown to elicit protective immunity to infection by pathogenic SIV, yet our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate protection and prevent pathogenesis remains limited.  In the study, we utilize whole-genome transcriptional profiling to reveal molecular signatures of protective immunity in circulating CD8+ T cells of rhesus macaques vaccinated with SIVmac239Δnef and challenged with pathogenic SIVmac251. Microarrays were used to characterize changes in gene expression in blood CD8+ T cells that occur following vaccination of rhesus macaques with attenuated SIV∆nef and subsequent challenge with pathogenic SIVmac251, in comparison to corresponding changes in healthy controls and unvaccinated animals infected with pathogenic SIVmac251

DESIGN
CD8+ T cells were isolated by magnetic beads from the blood of healthy uninfected macaques, macaques vaccinated with SIV∆nef, and unvaccinated controls infected with SIVmac251, and used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Blood samples from vaccinated animals were collected prior to vaccination, at 3, 20, and 40 weeks following vaccination. After the 40 week vaccination period, macaques were challenged with SIVmac251, and blood was again collected at 3 weeks following challenge. Blood was collected from the unvaccinated controls at 3 weeks following infection with SIVmac251
