TITLE
Dose- and time- dependent ionizing ratidation effect on mice peripheral blood

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood samples from C57BL/6 mice exposed with ionizing radiation. We used mice as model animal to study biologial recovery response after radiation damage. Therefore, we obtained gene expression profiles from C57BL/6 mice exposed with various levels of ionizing radiation, including low and high doses and control groups. In order to measure recovery rate, we collected peripheral blood samples at different time durations after the exposure. In order to obtain robust signatures specific to radiation response, we are interested in knowing if the radiation signarures will be present in the presence of confounders. Therefore, mice were given intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS),  or treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), otherwise no treatment after ionizing radiation exposure. The underlying mechanism of confounder treatment is that LPS induces strong immune response resembling the effect of infection, and GCSF stimulates mobilization of HSCs. Exploratory analysis shows that the confounding effects did affect the radiation signature to some extent. This study provides insights into the molecular basis of time- and dose- dependent response to ionizing radiation in mice hematopoietic system.

DESIGN
A total of 536 C57BL/6 mice peripheral blood gene expression profiles were measured in 3 different batches using the Affymetrix mouse 430A 2.0 microarray. The experiment is designed to assess blood gene expression changes after exposure to ionizing radiation of 0, 100, 150, 200, 300, 450, 600, 800 and 1050 cGy. Samples were collected at 6, 24, 48, 72, 120 and 168hrs after a single dose exposure.
