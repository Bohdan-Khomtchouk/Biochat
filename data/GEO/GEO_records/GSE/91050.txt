TITLE
Expression analysis of MADM based glioma mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) based glioma mouse model, which homozygously lacks Tp53 and Nf1, spontaneously developed gliomas at the post-natal 90-120 days. Tp53 and Nf1 are among the most frequently mutated genes in human glioma patients. Investigating the expression changes of genes induced by inactivation of Tp53 and Nf1 can be a clue to clarify the mechanism of gliomagenesis. We examined the expressions of glioma in MADM mouse at post-natal 150 days (n=3) and of normal brain in Tp53 and Nf1 wild type mouse at post-natal 150 days (n=2). We used SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8Ã—60K array slides (G4858A, Agilent Technologies).

DESIGN
Microarray experiment was performed as single-color hybridization on SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8 x 60K array.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
