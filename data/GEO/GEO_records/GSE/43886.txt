TITLE
Expression data profile of A498 cells treated with DRB or E. coli 83972

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) constitute a highly relevant model of microbial adaptation, in which the contrasting effects of pathogens and commensals on host tissues are clearly displayed. While virulent Escherichia coli cause severe, potentially life-threatening disease by breaking the inertia of the mucosal barrier and infecting the kidneys, the most common outcome of bacteriuria is an asymptomatic carrier state resembling commensalism at other mucosal sites. It remains unclear if the lack of destructive inflammation merely reflects low virulence or if carrier strains actively inhibit disease associated responses in the host. To address this question, we examined the effects of asymptomatic bacterial carriage on host gene expression. The asymptomatic strain E. coli 83972  caused reduction in  Pol II phosphorylation in the nuclei of human kidney epithelial A498 cells. To specifically address if Pol II inhibition alters the response to infection, A498 cells were pretreated with 5,6-dichloro-1-b-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB). This adenosine analogue has been proposed to specifically and reversibly inhibit Pol II transcription without directly affecting other cellular functions.  A498 cultered cells were infected with E. coli 83972 or DRB for 4 hours. The culture medium with DMSO was used as a background control.

DESIGN
A498 cells were infected with E. coli 83972 or DRB for 4 h. Isolated RNA was subjected to whole genome transcriptome analysis.
