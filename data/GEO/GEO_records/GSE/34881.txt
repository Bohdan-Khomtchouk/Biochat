TITLE
HNSCC Cells: ctrl vs six tumour lethal miRNAs transfected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Some microRNAs have antiproliferative effects in cells and are believed to act as tumour suppressors. We used a retroviral human microRNA expression library to identify six microRNAs, miR-181a, miR-323, miR-326, miR-342, miR345 and miR-371, that induce antiproliferative effects in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but do not in normal oral keratinocytes. By gene expression profilling we showed that the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene is a common target for three of these microRNAs. Transcriptional profilling of head and neck cancer cells comparing transiently transfected with either one of the six miRNAs to the cells transfected with a control vector.

DESIGN
