TITLE
IL-10 or IL-6 stimulation of IL-6-/- and IL-10-/- murine bone marrow derived macrophages in the presence of LPS

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
IL-10 or IL-6 stimulation of control 129xC57BL/6 murine bone marrow derived macrophages in the presence of LPS. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression changes in response to IL-6 or IL-10 stimulation in the presence of lipopolysaccharide.  BMDMs were isolated from control, IL-6-/-, and IL-10-/-  mice on a 129XBL/6 mixed background mice and differentiated in the presence of CSF-1 for 6-7 days.  Cells were scraped and plated in 6 well plates at 2x10e6/well.  Cells were washed with complete DMEM and rested for 1-2 hr before stimulation with combinations of IL-10 (10 ng/ml), IL-6 (2 ng/ml) or LPS (100 ng/ml) for 45 min or 180 mins.  Complete biological replicates were performed. Keywords: time course
