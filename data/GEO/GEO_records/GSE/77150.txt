TITLE
Human colorectal cancer cell line CRC#21: Sphere-cultured cells vs. Adherent-cultured cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of cancer stem cells (sphere-cultured cells) comparing non-cancer stem cells (adherent-cultured cells). Goal was to identity cancer stem cell-specific genes.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, sphere-cultured cells vs. adherent-cultured cells: 1 sphere-cultured replicate and 1 adherent-culture replicate.

PLATFORM
GPL10332 Agilent-026652 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Feature Number version)
