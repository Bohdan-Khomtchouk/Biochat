TITLE
Brown Adipogenic Reprogramming Induced by a Small Molecule

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of early adipogenesis induced by  basal adipogenesis medium(AM) and AM+Bex for 2 days in C2C12 cells Global gene expression profiling has shown Bex induced adipogenic genes expression change

DESIGN
We analyzed 4 samples from basal adipogenesis medium(AM) and AM+Bex(10uM) treated C2C12 cells using the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Affymetrix Expression Console and Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC) software.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
