TITLE
Transcription facilitated genome-wide recruitment of topoisomerase I and DNA gyrase

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv ; Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra

SUMMARY
Genome-wide distribution of topoisomerase I and DNA gyrase is directed by transcription induced supercoiling

DESIGN
Mtb H37Rv cells were ChIP-ed with either anti-TopoI or anti-gyrA antibodies. Mtb H37Ra cells were ChIP-ed with anti-TopoI or anti-gyrA antibodies, or mock ChIP-ed (no antibody).
