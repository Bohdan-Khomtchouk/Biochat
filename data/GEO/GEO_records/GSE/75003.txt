TITLE
Single and double knock-down of ETV6 and NFKB1 in U251 glioblastoma cell line.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying the synergistic interaction between ETV6 and NFKB1, we analyzed the genome-wide transcriptional consequences of single and double knock-downs of the two TFs in U251 cells.

DESIGN
The glioblastoma U251 cell line was transiently transfected with ETV6 and NFKB1 siRNA alone and then in combination, and were compared against control siRNA that doesn't target any known human transcript.
