TITLE
ChIP-seq of bovine cells (MDBK) to study butyrate-induced histone modification

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Utilizing next-generation sequencing technology, combined with ChIP (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation) technology to analyze histone modification (acetylation) induced by butyrate and to map the epigenomic landscape of normal histone H3, H4

DESIGN
Cells were treated with 10 mM butyrate for 24 hr, The cells were scraped from the flask and homogenized with ice-cold Dounce homogenizer to release the nuclei.  The collected nuclei were resuspended in digestion buffer and enzymatic shearing was performed. ChIP with anti H3, H4 and acetyl-H3 and acetyl-H4.
