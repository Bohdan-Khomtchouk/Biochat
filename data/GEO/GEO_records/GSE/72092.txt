TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of wild-type budding yeast microcolonies encapsulated in alginate particles

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We analysed the transcriptomic signature associated to fast and slow growing microcolonies generated after the encapsulation of single cells belonging to a clonal wild-type population, in alginate microspheres. This allowed us to identify particular gene expression signatures associated to each subpopulation. In particular, we found that slow growing cells display an increased expression of respiratory genes even when growing in glucose rich media.

DESIGN
S. cerevisiae cells were encapsulated in alginate particles using a Cellena microencapsulator (Ingeniatrics), as described (GÃ³mez-Herreros et al, NAR 2011). Encapsulated cells were allowed to divide in rich media (YPD) and harvested. We analyzed 3 biological replicates of non-sorted particles (total), 3 biological replicates of big colonies (big) and 4 replicates of small particles (small). Due to the limited RNA amount, replicates 1 and 3 of the small colonies lead to very low sequencing quality and were excluded from the analysis. As control experiments we analysed biological duplicates from encapsulated cells not fixed with ethanol (nofix), and the same cells grown in batch without encapsulation at two different cell densities (YPD05 and YPD2).
