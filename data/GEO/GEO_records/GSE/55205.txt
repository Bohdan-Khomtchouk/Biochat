TITLE
Differential blood biomarkers and PBMC transcriptome profiles in normal-weight and obese individuals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of study was to investigate correlation bewteen peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptome profiles and plasma lipid profiles of Korean adult with varying BMI. In Korean, BMI cut-off points are 18.5~22.9 kg/m2 (normal range), ≥ 23 kg/m2 (overweight), ≥ 25 kg/m2 (obese), ≥ 30 kg/m2 (severely obese). Thus, the obese group was subdivided into mildly obese (BMI 25~27 kg/m2, OA) and highly obese (BMI 27~30 kg/m2, OB). This study indicates that lipid, glucose and inflammation metabolism-related gene expressions were altered according to cahnge of varing phenotype biomarkers such as BMI, plasma total-C, TG, FFA and HDL-C. Thus, blood biomarkers and PBMC gene expression profiles identified in this study may be useful as indicative biomarkers for obese susceptibility in Korean adult as well as response to various intervention for treating obesity.

DESIGN
Total RNA of PBMCs was obtained from normal weight, obese person and mRNA expression was measured.
