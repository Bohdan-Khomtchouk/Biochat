TITLE
Gene expression in intestinal epithelial crypt and villus cell populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression profiles in isolated mouse LGR5+ intestinal stem cells, lineage-specific enterocyte and secretory progenitors, and terminally differentiated villus enterocytes. Gene Ontology analyses of cell type-specific transcripts indicated their expected biological functions.

DESIGN
We hybridized Affmetrix 430A 2.0 mouse microarrays with processed RNA isolated from purified Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells, secretory (Sec-Pro) and enterocyte (Ent-Pro) crypt progenitors, and mature villus enterocytes (ENT).
