TITLE
Redifferentiation of expanded human islet β cells by inhibition of ARX

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We applied RNA-seq analysis to human islet cells, received from 3 independent donors, treated with either redifferentiation cocktail + ARX shRNA, or redifferentiation cocktail + control shRNA or left untreated.

DESIGN
Examination of the effect of ARX inhibition on redifferentiation of β-cell-derived (BCD) cells

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
