TITLE
Hereditary Breast Cancer Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genomic profile of  47 tumors from hereditary breast cancer cases by Array CGH, 7 of which were BRCA mutation carriers (4 in BRCA2 and 3 in BRCA1), previously analyzed for BRCA1 expression by immunohistochemistry. Our goal was to identify specific alterations for BRCA1 not expressing tumors

DESIGN
DNA from 47 Tumors versus DNA pool from normal tissue. BRCA1 expression, Hierarchical clustering and overall survival analyses.
