TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Drosophila melanogaster taste tissue

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To uncover novel molecules involved in taste detection, we performed a microarray-based screen for genes enriched in taste neurons.  Proboscis RNA from flies homozygous for a recessive poxn null mutation was compared to RNA from heterozygous controls.  Poxn mutants have a transformation of labellar gustatory chemosensory bristles into mechanosensory bristles and therefore lack most or all taste neurons.

DESIGN
Proboscises of poxn70 homozygous mutant and poxn70 heterozygous mutant males (8-18 days post eclosure) were dissected, and total RNA was harvested in Trizol according to standard trizol protocol.  Samples for each microarray were prepared from 164-280 proboscises.  We performed 3 biological replicates for each genotype.
