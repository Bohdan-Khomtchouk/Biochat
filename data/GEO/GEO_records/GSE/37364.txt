TITLE
Expression data from human colonic biopsy samples  (adenoma-carcinoma)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genomic microarray analysis was performed in order to identify gene expression profile alterations focusing on the dysplastic adenoma-carcinoma transition. Our aims were to determinate characteristic transcript sets for developing diagnostic mRNA expression patterns for objective classification of benign and malignant colorectal diseases and to test the classificatory power of these markers on an independent sample set.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from colonic biopsy samples of histologically negative patients and of patients with adenoma or colorectal cancer and were hybridized on Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays
