TITLE
Analysis of epigenetic changes in survivors of preterm birth reveals the effect of gestational age and evidence for a long term legacy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of DNA extracted from dried blood spots from preterm and term subjects using longitudinal samples collected at birth and 18 years of age. Infinium HM450 arrays were used to measure methylation at 347,789 autosomal CpGs. DNA was analysed from individuals at birth and 18-years and included 12 preterm and 12 term controls.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 48 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450K Human Methylation Beadchip

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
