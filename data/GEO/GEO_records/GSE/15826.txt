TITLE
Affymetrix 6.0 study of sporadic motor neuron disease patients and controls.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This data was divided into three experiment sets: 1. A somatic study of sporadic motor neuron disease (SMND) brain samples that were compared to the blood from the same individual, normal control brains and disease control brans (Parkinson Disease patients); 2. A twin study comparing blood and other tissue samples from twins that were discordant for MND, concordant for MND and control twins and 3. A trio study of blood samples MND patients compared to their unaffected parents.

DESIGN
Study 1: 36 sporadic motor neuron disease brain (lateral frontal cortex, Brodmann area 46), 34 matched sporadic motor neuron disease blood, 26 control brain (lateral frontal cortex, Brodmann area 46), 9 Parkinson Disease brain (disease controls, lateral frontal cortex, Brodmann area 46). Study 2 and study 3: 52 twin or trio blood, 4 twin hair, 1 twin sperm. 2 replicate twin blood and 1 replicate trio blood repeated at a different time. External control blood from Coriell GM15510 and GM10851.
