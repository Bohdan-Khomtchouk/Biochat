TITLE
Expression data from bone marrow-derived dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dendritic cells are the sentinels of the innate immune system. We used global microarray analysis to identify genes which are regulated by Toll-like receptor signaling pathways.

DESIGN
Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from WT B6 mice and differentiated into dendritic cells (DCs). Differentiated DCs were treated with Toll-like receptor ligands (LPS and CpG) for 6 h. mRNA samples from treated and untreated DCs were sent for microarray analysis.
