TITLE
Cell lines LS180 vs U937

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Dr. Esko's laboratory focuses on the structure, function, and biosynthesis of glycoproteins and proteoglycans. This laboratory also works on the design and synthesis of small molecule inhibitors of glycosylation.

DESIGN
We analyzed the expression patterns of glycosyltransferase, growth factors, and receptors in endothelial cells derived from NDST1 deficient and wild-type mice using cancer cell line types U937 and LS180 .
