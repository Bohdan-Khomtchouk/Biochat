TITLE
Gene expression data from corticosteroid-treated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Recent studies have highlighted the role of adrenal corticosteroid signaling in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. It is known that glucocorticoids and aldosterone are able to bind glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and these ligand-receptor interactions are redundant. Therefore, it has been impossible to delineate how these nuclear receptors couple with corticosteroid ligands and differentially regulate gene expression for operation of their distinct functions in the heart. Here, to particularly define the role of GR, we applied ligand-based approach involving GR-specific agonist cortivazol (CVZ) and GR antagonist RU486, and performed microarray analysis using rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. We indicated that glucocorticoids appear to be a major determinant of GR-mediated gene expression when compared with aldosterone. Moreover, expression profiles of these genes highlighted numerous roles of glucocorticoids in various aspects of cardiac physiology. Keywords: comparison of the effect of steroidal ligands
