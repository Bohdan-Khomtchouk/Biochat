TITLE
Gene expression data from whole blood of a Phase II randomized clinical trial of the treatment of methamphetamine dependence with topiramate

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A genome-wide RNA expression study based on a Phase II randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of topiramate (TPM) treatment of methamphetamine (METH) dependence. Gene expression data were analyzed based on TPM responses at Weeks 8 and 12, to identify differentially expressed genes and related pathways.

DESIGN
From a previously conducted randomized, Phase II double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of treatment of METH dependence with TPM (Elkashef et al., Addiction. 2012, PMID: 22221594), 99 gave consent to participate in a genome-wide expression study were included in this report. The total RNA was collected from whole blood for each of the 50 TPM- and 49 placebo-treated participants at three time points: baseline, week 8, and week 12, respectively. Gene expression data of a total of 209 Affymetrix Human Genome U-133 Plus 2.0 chips passed quality control from 50 TPM- and 48 placebo-treated participants at baseline (88 chips), Week 8 (65 chips), and Week 12 (56 chips). Gene expression data were analyzed based on METH-dependent participantsâ€™ TPM responses at Weeks 8 and 12, to identify differentially expressed genes and related pathways that could be related to differential TPM responses among METH-dependent study participants.
