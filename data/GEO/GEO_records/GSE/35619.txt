Evolution of human-specific microRNA miR-941 [cerebellum gene expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNA-mediated gene expression silencing has previously been shown to be important for a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Here, we have explored the role of one bona fide human-specific miRNA (miR-941) in evolution of the human-specific expression and function. Using combination of high-throughput sequencing (GSE26545), miRNA transfection and large-scale PCR of various human populations, we have shown that emergence and rapid expansion of miR-941 might take place on the human evolutionary linage between six and one million years ago. Functionally, miR-941 could be associated with hedgehog and insulin signaling pathways, and thus might potentially play a role in evolution of human longevity. Human-specific effects of miR-941 regulation are detectable in human brain and affect genes involved in neurotransmitter signaling. Furthermore, emergence of miR-941 on the human evolutionary linage was accompanied by the accelerated loss of its binding sites. Taken together, these results strongly implicate the contribution of miR-941 in evolution of the human-specific phenotype.
