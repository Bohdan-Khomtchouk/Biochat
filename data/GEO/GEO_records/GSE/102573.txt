TITLE
Expression data from Caco-2 cells infected with F. nucleatum

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Caco-2 cells were infected with F. nucleatum (MOI=100:1) or non-infected (control) for 24 hours. Total RNA of cells was extracted using the TRIzol® Reagent (Life Technologies) and cDNA was generated using the PimeScript TMRT Reagent Kit (Takara). We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Affymetrix’ new GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 chips were used to analysis 10 specimens (5 F. nucleatum infection, 5 control).
