TITLE
Thermal plasticity of the miRNA transcriptome during Senegalese sole development

ORGANISM
Solea senegalensis

SUMMARY
We report the effect of incubation temperature on embryos and larvae of Solea senegalensis subjected to two different incubation temperatures (15 °C or 21 °C). We found that at some stages, a higher incubation temperature was associated with the expression of miRNAs positively related with growth

DESIGN
Examination of miRNA expression in Senegalese sole whole embryos and larvae subjected to two different incubation temperatures, using the SOLiD platform and validation by qPCR

PLATFORM
GPL18766 AB SOLiD System (Solea senegalensis)
