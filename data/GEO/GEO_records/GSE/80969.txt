TITLE
Tissue memory of DNA methylation in iPSC of diverse somatic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several studies have discussed the possibility that donor cell type may influence the epigenetics and differentiation potential of iPSCs, but it remains unclear whether iPS cells derived from different tissue sources reserve their epigenetic memory. Here, we clarify that iPSCs obtained from different tissues exhibit specific epigenetic patterns. We determined the DNA methylation profiles of 12 human cell lines, including 3 adult fibroblast cell-derived iPSC lines, 2 peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cell(PBMC)-derived iPSC lines, 2 amniotic cell-derived iPSC lines and the 5 corresponding parent cell lines. We found that the catalog of tissue-specific DNA methylation was preserved in the iPSC line as epigenetic memory during reprogramming.
