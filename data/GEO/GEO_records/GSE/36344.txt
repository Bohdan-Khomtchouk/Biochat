TITLE
mRNA degradation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis with DosR ectopically induced

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
After induction of DosR from a tet regulated promoter (uninduced controls were treated with an equivalent ammount of the solvent, DMSO), transcription was arrested using 50 ug/ul of rifampin leaving RNA degradation as the sole vector responsible for mRNA abundance. mRNA half-lives were calculated from the decay of signal intensity from T0.

DESIGN
Three replicates for each condition (DosR induced and uninduced) were sampled after 0, 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes of mRNA decay for a total of 30 arrays.
