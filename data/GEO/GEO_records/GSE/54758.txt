TITLE
DNA methylation, H3K27me3, and gene expression statuses of human cancer cell lines and normal cells.

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
DNA methylation, H3K27me3, and gene expression statuses in cancer cell lines and normal cells.

DESIGN
DNA methylation, H3K27me3, and gene expression statuses of cancer cell lines were compared to those in normal cells in three different tissues.
