TITLE
Expression data from ribosomal protein (RP) L23 (RPL23)-KD and NC SKM-1 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ribosomal protein (RP) L23 is a negative regulator of cell apoptosis. RPL23 overexpression is associated with abnormal apoptotic resistance in CD34+ cells derived from patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, the mechanism underlying RPL23-induced apoptotic resistance in higher-risk MDS patients is poorly understood. Gene microarray analysis between RPL23-knockdown (RPL23-KD) and matched control cells (RPL23-NC) was performed to detail global gene expression profiles and to identify differentially expressed genes and potentially involved pathways associated with RPL23 knockdown.

DESIGN
Lentiviral vectors carrying LV-RPL23-RNAi-EGFP (KD group) and LV-RPL23-NC-EGFP (NC group) were constructed to transfect SKM-1 cells, and after efficient knockdown of RPL23 expression (validated by qRT-PCR and western blotting), total RNA was isolated from RPL23-KD and NC SKM-1 cells (triplicate per treatment category) and cDNA and biotinylated cRNA were synthesized and hybridized to a GeneChip® PrimeView™ Human Gene Expression Array. (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA) according to manufacturer’ instructions.
