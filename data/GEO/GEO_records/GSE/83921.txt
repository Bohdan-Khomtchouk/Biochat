SUMMARY
Transcriptome analysis of CD4+ PD1+ T cells during LCMV CL13 infection Gene expression in WT and ERt2-cre;TGFbRII flox virus specific CD4 T cells

DESIGN
Mixed chimeras of WT:ERt2cre+TGFbRII flox/flox were infected 9 days with LCMV and splenic CD4+ PD1+CD49d+ Cd8a- T cells sorted from each compartment by congenic marker

PLATFORM
