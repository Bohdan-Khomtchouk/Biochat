ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of E. coli cells comparing control untreated cells with cells treated with iron-supplemented P. aeruginosa spent media. The goal was to identify the effects of P. aeruginosa spent media on E. coli cells, while neutralizing any effects of the P. aeruginosa siderophores

DESIGN
