TITLE
High-throughput RNA sequencing of human preovulatory cumulus and mural granulosa cells (mRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The granulosa cells in the mammalian ovarian follicle respond to gonadotropin signalling and are involved in the processes of folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation. Studies on gene expression and regulation in human granulosa cells are of interest due to their potential for estimating the oocyte viability and IVF success. The current study determined the mRNA profile by deep sequencing of the two intrafollicular somatic cell types: mural and cumulus granulosa cells isolated from women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation and in vitro fertilization.

DESIGN
Paired cumulus and mural granulosa samples were analysed from 3 women participating in IVF procedure. Differential gene expression study was performed. The identified gene expression profile was also used for predicting targets for miRNAs that were also identified from the same samples (GSE46489).
