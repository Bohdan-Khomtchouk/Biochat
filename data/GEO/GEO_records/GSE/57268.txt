TITLE
RNA-Seq analysis reveals a six-gene SoxR regulon in Streptomyces coelicolor

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor

SUMMARY
We report 6 genes that were found to be regulated by SoxR in stationary phase when the bacteria produce the antibiotic actinorhodin.  Five of these genes are previously confirmed SoxR targets; the sixth is a novel SoxR-target.

DESIGN
RNA was obtained from 1-day or 3-day old wild type or soxR null mutant strains grown on R2YE agar complex medium. Biological replicates were obtained for 3 day-old samples. RNA was sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer for single reads of 100 bp and mapped to the S. coelicolor M145 genome.
