TITLE
Gene expression and intragenic polymorphism in a Populus trichocarpa and Populus deltoides pseudo-backcross pedigree

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides

SUMMARY
A microarray analysis of whole-genome gene expression and single feature polymorphism in a (Populus trichocarpa X Populus deltoides) X Populus deltoides pseudo-backcross pedigree.  Genetic variation in gene expression was quantified for 55,793 predicted gene models based on a single probe per gene.  Concurrently, sequence-level polymorphism was analyzed based on dedicated probes identified in a pilot study comprised of the two parent genotypes (GPL7169).  Resultant data contributed to a high density genetic map and to analysis of the genetic architecture of gene expression in Populus. Keywords: Genetic analysis of gene expression and polymorphism, eQTL

DESIGN
Data include one biological replicate of 178 segregating pseudobackcross progeny analyzed for gene expression (GE) using one probe per gene for 55793 independent gene models (probes E_POPLARSxxxxxPxxxxx) and single feature sequence polymorphism (SFP) using one probe per gene for 12084 independent gene models (probes G_POPLARSxxxxxPxxxxx).  GE and SFP probes were selected from 6-7 probes per gene previously tested in a pilot study of the two parent trees of the cross (Populus deltoides X Populus trichocarpa).
