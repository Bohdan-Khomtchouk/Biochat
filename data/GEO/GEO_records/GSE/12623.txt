TITLE
Gene expression and intragenic polymorphism in a Populus trichocarpa and Populus deltoides pseudo-backcross pedigree

ORGANISM
Populus trichocarpa

SUMMARY
A microarray analysis of whole-genome gene expression and single feature polymorphism in a (Populus trichocarpa X Populus deltoides) X Populus deltoides pseudo-backcross pedigree.  Genetic variation in gene expression was quantified for 55,793 predicted gene models based on a single probe per gene.  Concurrently, sequence-level polymorphism was analyzed based on dedicated probes identified in a pilot study comprised of the two parent genotypes (GPL7169).  Resultant data contributed to a high density genetic map and to analysis of the genetic architecture of gene expression in Populus. Keywords: Genetic analysis of gene expression and polymorphism, eQTL
