TITLE
Targeted bisulfite sequencing to detect TALE-DNMT mediated targeted DNA methylation in human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We use NGS to assess the ability of TALE-guided DNA methyltranferases to make targeted changes to DNA methylation

DESIGN
Targeted bisulfite sequencing of cells infected with wild-type or mutant TALE-DNMT constructs directed to the CDKN2A (p16) locus

PLATFORM
GPL15520 Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens)
