TITLE
Expression data from gastrocnemius of wild type and transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We want to find differential expressed  genes of gastrocnemius from transgenic mice of knockout DGAT1 and WT mice. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of differential expressed  genes of gastrocnemius from transgenic mice of konckout DGAT1 and WT mice.

DESIGN
gastrocnemius were selected at three month of mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Transgenic mice1,Transgenic mice2,Transgenic mice3,WT mice1,WT mice2,WT mice3
