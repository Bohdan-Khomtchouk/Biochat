TITLE
Genome-wide transcript analysis of ErbB2-induced tumors from different tumor-initiating cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ErbB2-induced mouse mammary tumors can originate from different mammary epithelial cells, including both basal epithelial cells and luminal progenitors. Here we used the tumors from basal cells or luminal progenitors to compare the difference in transcripts.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from  basal cell- or luminal progenitor-derived tumors for Illumina whole mouse transcript array analysis. Three paired tumors were analyzed.
