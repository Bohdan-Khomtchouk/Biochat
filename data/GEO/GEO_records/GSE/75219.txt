TITLE
Foxn1 choreographs both early and late events in thymic lympho-stromal cross-talk

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Normal thymic T cell development is enabled by a stromal microenvironment most importantly composed of distinct epithelial cell populations in cortex and medulla. Their differentiation, growth and function require the expression of the transcription factor Foxn1. Direct targets of Foxn1 have, however, remained largely undefined. Utilizing newly created static and inducible genetic model systems, we now provide a genome wide map of Foxn1 target genes and the sequences bound by this master regulator. Foxn1 controls not only essential steps early in intrathymic lymphoid development including T cell lineage commitment but is also indispensable for later stages in T cell maturation such as the selection of CD4 and CD8 T cells. Thus, Foxn1 function critically choreographs both early and late events in thymic lympho-stromal cross-talk.

DESIGN
