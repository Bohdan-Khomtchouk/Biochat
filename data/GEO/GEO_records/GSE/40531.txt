TITLE
Gene expression profiling of CA10 and NHD13 murine AML

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have compared the gene expression profiles of leukemic tissues in two different mouse models of AML, CALM-AF10 and NHD13, to clincally healthy transgenic and wildtype hematopoetic tissue to identify genes and pathways that can collaborate with these oncogenic fusion proteins to promote leukemic transformation.

DESIGN
CA10 and NHD13 transgenic mice were sacrificed when clinical signs of leukemia manifested (mice were hunched, skinny, or had an abnormal complete blood count). For comparsion, we harvested age matched bone marrow, thymi, and spleen from wildtype and clinically healthy trangenic tissues. Transgenic animals were considered clinically healthy if no evident signs of leukemia were present.
