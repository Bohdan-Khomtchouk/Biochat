TITLE
Large differences in small RNA composition between human biofluids - 10 biofluids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
One goal of Phase 1 of our project is to produce reference profiles of miRNAs and other small RNAs in a large and diverse set of biofluids using a systemic approach. This study contains samples associated with 10 different biofluids, and all data (sequencing data, full alignments, etc.) is openly available.

DESIGN
10-12 donors each from 12 biofluids using modified TruSeq protocol with randomized adapters

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
