TITLE
Effects of Intestine-specifc SREBP2 overactivation on gene expression in mouse jejnum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The active form of the SREBP2 transcription factor was specifically overexpressed in the intesitne. This was achieved by generating transgenic mouse model (designated as ISR2) in which the transgene represents the N-terminal active SREBP2 transcription factor driven by the villin promoter. In this project, we investigated the effects of overactivation of SREBP2 on gene expression in mouse jejunum

DESIGN
Gene expression profile in the jejunum of ISR2 was compared to gene expression profile in the jejunum of their wild type littermates.
