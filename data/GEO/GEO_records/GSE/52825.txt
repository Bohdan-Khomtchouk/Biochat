TITLE
Short-term rapamycin treatment in mice have few effects on the transcriptome of white adipose tissue compared to dietary restriction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptome in the epididymal fat of young mice (8 months of age) from treatment of dietary restriction, or rapamycin

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from epididymal fat of 8 month old C57BL6/J mice started on ad libitum (AL) , 40% dietary restriction (DR), or 14 ppm rapamycin (Rapa) from 2 months of age on 6 months of treatment. Number of samples total: 24, with 8 samples in AL, 8 samples in DR, and 8 samples in Rapa
