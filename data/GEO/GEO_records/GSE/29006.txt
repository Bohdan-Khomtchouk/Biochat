TITLE
mRNA-seq of Human Airway Epithelial Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
mRNA expression was profiled from pooled bronchial airway epithelial cell brushings (n=3 patients/pool) obtained during bronchoscopy from healthy never (NS) and current smokers (S) and smokers with (C) and without (NC) lung cancer

DESIGN
4 samples were sequened, each representing a pool of 3 patients.  The phenotypes of the 4 samples were as follows: healthy non-smoker, healthy smoker, smoker without lung cancer and smoker with lung cancer.
