TITLE
Circulating microRNAs and life expectancy among identical twins

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: To characterize miRNAs in 41-year archived plasma in relation to life expectancy independent of genes. Method: Plasma miRNAs from nine identical male twins were profiled using next-generation sequencing. Results: The average absolute difference in the minimum life expectancy was 9.68 years. Intra-class correlation coefficients were above 0.4 for 50% of miRNAs. Comparing deceased twins with their alive co-twin brothers, the concentrations were increased for 34 but decreased for 30 miRNAs. Conclusion: Identical twins discordant in life expectancy were unlike in the majority of miRNAs, suggesting that environmental factors are pivotal in miRNAs related to life expectancy.
