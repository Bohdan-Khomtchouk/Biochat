TITLE
Expression data from dexamethasone treated mouse embryonic hypothalamic progenitor/stem cells isolated from wild type C57Bl/6 male or female mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used RNA-Seq to detail the global program of sexually dimorphic dexamethasone regulated gene expression in embryonic hypothalamic neural progenitor/stem cells.

DESIGN
RNAseq on Primary E14.5 mouse hyothalamic neurosphere cultures. 4 conditions - Male Dex, Male EtOH, Female Dex and Female EtOH. There are 3 biological replicates for each condition and all the 12 samples are run on two lanes (techinical duplicates).

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
