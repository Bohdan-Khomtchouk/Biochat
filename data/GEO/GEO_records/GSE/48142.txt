TITLE
SCL008: icSARS CoV, icSARS-deltaNSP16 or icSARS ExoNI infections of the 2B4 clonal derivative of Calu-3 cells - Time course

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose of experiment was to compare transcriptomics of 2B4 cells (clonal derivative of Calu-3 cells) infected with either icSARS CoV, icSARS-deltaNSP16 or icSARS ExoNI mutants.

DESIGN
2B-4 cells (clonal derivatives of Calu-3 cells) were infected with either icSARS CoV, icSARS deltaNSP16 or icSARS ExoNI.  Wild type and deltaNSP16 mutant infections were at an MOI of 5 while the ExoNI infections were at an MOI of 1.  Cells samples were collected at 0, 7, 12, 24, 36, 36, 48, 60 or 72h post infection. Each infected sample was done in triplicate. (Triplicates are defined as 3 different wells, plated at the same time using the same cell stock for all replicates.)  There are triplicate time-matched Mock for each time point from the same cell stock as rest of samples.  Culture medium (the same as what the virus stock is in) was used for the Mock infections.
