TITLE
Comparison of IS5 Deletion mutant to E.coli Motile and NonMotile Isolates

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
These series of experiments compares the expression profile of the motility variants of E.coli MG1655 ( Motile and NonMotile isolates) to an isogenic E.coli MG1655 strain in which the IS5 upstream of flhDC has been deleted. The expression profiles of genes in the E.coli MG1655 motile isolate and E.coli MG1655 Non_Motile isolate also compared. Keywords: parallel sample
