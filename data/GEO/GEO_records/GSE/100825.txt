TITLE
Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in blood cells from patients with Werner Syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of whole blood samples from 3 subjects affected by Werner Syndrome and 3 age- and sex- matched controls. The Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 850,000 CpGs.

DESIGN
DNA was bisulfite-converted using the EZDNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research) and analysed using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina) following manufacturer's instructions.
