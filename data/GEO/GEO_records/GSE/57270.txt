TITLE
Genomic analysis of low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas [ILOE]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas are typically Ras-pathway mutated, TP53 wild-type, have limited chromosomal aberration, and are frequently associated with borderline tumors. By contrast, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma lack Ras-pathway mutations, are invariably TP53 mutated, show widespread genomic change, and are commonly BRCA-pathway disrupted. We sought to identify differences in genomic copy number changes in borderline and invasive components of serous carcinoma.

DESIGN
Borderline and invasive tumor components were profiled from patients with LGSC
