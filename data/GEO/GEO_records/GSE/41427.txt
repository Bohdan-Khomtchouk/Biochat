TITLE
Gene expression changes in Su(H) induced wing disc hyperplasia

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
The outcome of Notch activation of proliferation depends on cellular context. In Drosophila wing discs Notch pathway overactivation results in hyperplasia. To understand the mechanisms we have used genomic strategies to indetify the Notch-S(H) target genes directly regulated in wing disc hyperplasia. These data are the results from expression profiling the RNAs from hyperplastic wing discs overexpressing Su(H).

DESIGN
Direct comparison of Giant third instar lavae wing imaginal disc (UAS-GFP:Su(H) expressed by the patched[559.1]-Gal4 driver) vs control (UAS-NLS-GFP expressed by the patched[559.1]-Gal4 driver). 3 Biological replicates, the 3rd replicate was performed as a dye-swap.
