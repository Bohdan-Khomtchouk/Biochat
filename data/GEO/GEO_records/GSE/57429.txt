TITLE
Expression data from FIT-039 or Flavopiridol compound treated HeLa cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FIT-039 is a novel antiviral compound. Antiviral mechanism of FIT-039 is the inhibition of the viral transcription through suppression of the CTD phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. We used microarrays to evaluated the effect of FIT-039 on host cellular transcriptome, compared with Flavopiridol which is an existing pan-specific CDK9 inhibitor.

DESIGN
HeLa cells were incubated with FIT-039 or flavopiridol at the concentration of IC80 for 24 hr, and cellular RNAs were collected and subjected to microarray analysis. The solvent DMSO was used as a negative control.
