total RNA-seq from hematopoietic multipotent progenitor cell (ENCSR000CUA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from the whole cell fraction of independent isolates of mobilized CD34+ blood progenitor cells. They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Total RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
