TITLE
miRNA signatures of intracellular and extracellular fractions from cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For the purpose of finding a novel tumor marker, we conducted microRNA profiling analysis in fractions of cells, exosomes, and culture medium from seven cancer cell lines. Ranking data of the intracellular and extracellular microRNAs obtained by microarray analysis, we found that let-7 microRNA family are rich in all fractions from AZ-P7a cells, a metastatic gastric cancer cell line.

DESIGN
miRNA profiling in fractions of cells, exosomes, and culture medium were conducted by miRNA microarray analysis. Two replicates of intra-samples were performed.
