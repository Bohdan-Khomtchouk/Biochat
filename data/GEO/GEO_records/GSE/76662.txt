TITLE
The expression of microRNAs in embryoid bodies derived from mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse embryonic stem cells can spontaneously differentiate and assemble into a spherical embryoid body (EB) during suspension culture. The initial study aims to identify the up-regulated or down-regulated microRNAs during the differentiation process of pluripotent stem cells. From the microRNA profiling, we will focus on the microRNAs associated with mesodermal and endothelial differentiation of embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells.

DESIGN
In this study, the EBs were collected at 0 and 10-day differentiation of ESCs (ATCC: CRL-1934). The miRNA transcripts listed in Sanger miRBase Release 19.0 was detected by microarray.
