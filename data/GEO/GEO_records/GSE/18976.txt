TITLE
Analysis of deferoxamine treated leaves and roots: Arabidopsis transcriptome in response to deferoxamine

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
au08-04_dfo - analysis of deferoxamine treated leaves and roots - What are the effects of the siderophore deferoxamine on Arabidopsis leaves and roots? - Plants were allowed to grow for 5-6 weeks. The nutrient solution contains 0.25 mM Ca(NO3)2.4H2O, 1mM KH2PO4, 0.5 mM KNO3, 1mM MgSO4.7H2O, 50 µM H3BO3, 19 µM MnCl2.4H2O, 10 µM ZnCl2, 1 µM CuSO4.5H2O, 0.02 µM Na2MoO4.2H2O and 50 µM FeNa-EDTA. Plants were subjected to an 8 h light/16 h dark cycle, at 19°C, with 70% relative humidity. Leaves of six week old hydroponically grown A. thaliana Col0 plants were infiltrated with 1mM deferoxamine or sterile distilled water. Leaves were harvested 7 and 24 h.p.i. Keywords: time course,treated vs untreated comparison
