TITLE
miRNA Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of EAE CD4+T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
EAE is a mouse model of human multiple sclerosis. We used miRNA low density array to screen abnormally expressed miRNAs in autoimmune CD4+T cells.Generally, splenic CD4+T cells were isolated from three groups: healthy C57BL/6 mice, C57BL/6 mice with the induction of EAE for 16 days, and C57BL/6 mice with the induction of EAE for 32 days. Then we did miRNA profilings on these samples.

DESIGN
Splenic CD4+T cells were isolated from the above three groups. Each group consist of six mice.  Equal amount total RNA from each mouse was pooled prior to miRNA expression analysis.
