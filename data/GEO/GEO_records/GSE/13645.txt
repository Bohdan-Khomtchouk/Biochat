TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of p56lck-deficient regulatory and memory T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Signaling through the T cell antigen receptor is essential for the formation of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the thymus and for their involvement in antigen-directed suppression of immune responses.  Using a conditional null allele of the gene encoding p56Lck we show here that T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling is also essential for sustaining the phenotype and homeostasis of Treg cells.  Inactivation of p56Lck in Treg cells resulted in large-scale changes in their gene expression profile, blocked their capacity to suppress responses, inhibited their proliferation, and caused them to redistribute in the body.  The results make clear multiple aspects of the Treg cell phenotype that are dependent on a sustained capacity to respond through their TCRs. Keywords: Genetic deficiency of p56lck

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment:  wild-type memory or regulatory T cells versus lck-deficient memory or regulatory T cells.
