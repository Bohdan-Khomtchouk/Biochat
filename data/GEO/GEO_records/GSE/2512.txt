TITLE
Multiple Lab Comparison of Microarray Platforms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A consortium of ten labs from the DC and Baltimore area was formed to compare three leading platforms. Each lab was given identical RNA samples (A1 and B1) which were processed according to what each lab considered best practice. Five of the labs used Affymetrix GeneChips, three used two-color spotted cDNA arrays, and two used two-color long oligo arrays. Keywords: repeat sample

PLATFORM
GPL1953 Human 20K cDNA array
