TITLE
Transcript Level Expression Profiling: anticancer pathways of Smilax Glabra rhizome extract (SW)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Find the possible signaling pathways which contribute to the cell growth inhibition effect of SW-treated AGS cells Global gene expression profiling is an ideal technique to obtain useful clues for exploration of the anticancer mechanism of SW. Through comparing microarray results between solvent- and SW-treated cells, differentially expressed genes were obtained ( > 1.5 fold). The microarray results were validated using real-time RT-PCR. We used the KEGG database, STRING database and GO database for further ananlysis, and therefore got the possible signaling pathways underlying the anticancer effect of SW.

DESIGN
We analyzed total RNA samples of solvent- and SW-treated AGS cells using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST platform. No techinical replicates were performed.
