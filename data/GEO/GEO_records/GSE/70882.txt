TITLE
H5N1 and X179A influenza infection of mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of lung samples from mice infected with a severe H5N1 influenza virus (VN/1203/04/H5N1) or a mild H1N1 influenza virus (NYMC-X-179A) on day 3 and day 5 post-infection. Uninfected controls were used for comparison.

DESIGN
Lung samples collected from uninfected mice, or mice on day 3 and 5 post infection with H5N1 or X-179A. One H5N1 sample per time point (2-3 biological replicates per time point pooled and hybridised onto one chip [2 uninfected, 2 day 3, 3 day 5]); three X179A samples per time point (each biological replicate hybridised separately)
