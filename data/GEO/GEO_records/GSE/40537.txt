TITLE
IP of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) enriched DNA fragments from control and PB treated mouse livers (28 day)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
5-hmC is a novel epigenetic mark derived from oxidation of methylcytosine. Phenobarbital (PB) is a well studied non-genotoxic carcinogen with roles in epigenetic perturbation.  We profile 5hmC in both control mouse livers as well as in the livers of 28 day PB treated mice. 5hmC is largely found to reside in the bodies of active genes and promoter levels are perturbed upon PB induced gene activation events. 5-hmC is enriched in the bodies of active genes as well as a subset of TSS regions associated with transcriptional silencing. Upon PB exposire a handfull of genes are induced which reveal increases in promoter 5hmC levels

DESIGN
comparison of 5hmC profiles in 5 control and 5 PB exposed mouse livers
