TITLE
Expression data from HCV infected hepatoma carcinoma cell line Huh7-MAVSR cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV can be sensed by host innate immunity to induce expression of interferons (IFNs) and a number of antiviral effectors. HCV-encoded NS3/4 serine protease can subvert host innate immune responses by cleaving MAVS, a critical adaptor protein in the RLR-mediated IFN signaling. To study innate immunity in the context of HCV infection, we constructed Huh7-MAVSR cells which express a mutant MAVS resistant to NS3/4A cleavage. HCV infection induces robust IFN response in Huh7-MAVSR cells, providing a cellular system to study antiviral innate immune response against HCV infection. To analyze host innate antiviral effectors against HCV infection, we performed an mRNA microarray analysis in the HCV-infected Huh7-MAVSR cells.

DESIGN
Huh7-MAVSR cell were infected with HCVcc at an MOI of 5 for 12, 24, 48, 72 hours. The uninfected Huh7-MAVSR cells that are similarly cultured for 72 h were used as a mock infection control. The totoal cellular RNAs were extracted and analyzed by an mRNA microarray analysis for determining genes that are differentially expressed in the HCV-infected cells.
