TITLE
Evaluation of Inter-Batch Differences in Stem-Cell Derived Neurons

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of Neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iCell Neurons) at different time points were abtained by the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K array) Kit (WG-314-1002), which interrogates > 480,000 CpG sites in the human genome.In total, 36 samples were profiled using the 450K arrays.

DESIGN
1 ug purified DNA from each timepoint was submitted to the University of Chicago Genomics Core where it was converted with the EZ-96 DNA Methylationâ„¢ Kit (Deep Well Format), as per manufacturer's protocol, followed by array analysis using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K array) Kit (WG-314-1002), which interrogates > 480,000 CpG sites in the human genome.
