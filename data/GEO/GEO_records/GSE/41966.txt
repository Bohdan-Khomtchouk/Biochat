TITLE
Legionella pneumophila transcriptomic response to CuO nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Legionella pneumophila

SUMMARY
Legionella pneumophila was exposed for 3h to 160 ug/ml of CuO nanoparticle. Untreated samples are used as the control condition.

DESIGN
Two conditions: CuO (treated) and UN (untreated control. Three bioilogical repliucates. Genomic DNA is used as a reference channel. (Talaat, 2002, NAR).
