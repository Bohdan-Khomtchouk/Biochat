TITLE
Suppressio​n of MicroRNA-9 by Mutant EGFR Signaling Induces FOXP1 to Enhance Glioblasto​ma Tumorigeni​city

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The EGF-receptor (EGFR) is amplified and mutated in glioblastoma (GBM) where its common mutation, (∆EGFR, also called EGFRvIII) has a variety of activities that promote growth and inhibit death, thereby conferring a strong tumor-enhancing effect. This range of activities suggested to us that ∆EGFR might exert its influence through pleiotropic effectors and we hypothesized that microRNAs (miRs) might serve such a function. To test this, we determined the miR profiles of GBM cells with activated wild type EGFR (wtEGFR) and mutant EGFR (∆EGFR) to cells with non-activated EGFR or kinase dead ∆EGFR.

DESIGN
To identify miRs regulated by EGFR, RNA from 2 different glioma cell lines (U87 and U373) were hybridized to miR expression arrays and analyzed. Each cell type was engineered to express wild type EGFR (wtEGFR), dead kinase ∆EGFR (DK) or ∆EGFR at elevated levels similar to those observed in primary glioblastomas displaying EGFR overexpression. Parental cells expressing endogenous EGFR and wtEGFR cells stimulated with EGF for 1hr were also included in the analyses.
