TITLE
Microarray analysis of genes regulated by SpxA1 and SpxA2 in Streptococcus suis serotype 2

ORGANISM
Streptococcus suis

SUMMARY
To reveal the scope of the Spx regulation and explore the differences in the regulatory roles of SpxA1 and SpxA2, the global gene transcription profiles of the WT, ∆spxA1 and ∆spxA2 strains were determined by DNA microarray analysis performed using an Agilent custom-designed oligonucleotide microarray.

DESIGN
S. suis strains were grown in TSB with 10% (vol/vol) newborn bovine serum to mid-exponential phase. Total RNA was isolated using an SV total RNA isolation system (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. RNA concentrations and integrity were determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.Two biological replicates of total RNA from WT strain and three from each mutant strain were used for array.

PLATFORM
GPL18421 Agilent-057949 Streptococcus_suis_SC84 8X15K Microarray (Probe Name version)
