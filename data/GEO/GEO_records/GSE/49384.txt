TITLE
Transcriptional targets of Hippo signaling in mammalian cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Hippo pathway is an emerging signaling cascade involved in the regulation of organ size control.  It consists of evolutionally conserved protein kinases that are sequentially phosphorylated and activated.  The active Hippo pathway subsequently phosphorylates a transcription coactivator, YAP, which precludes its nuclear localization and transcriptional activation.  Identification of transcriptional targets of YAP in diverse cellular contexts is therefore critical to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms in which the Hippo pathway restricts tissue growth. We used microarrays to profile the gene expression patterns upon acute siRNA knockdown of Hippo pathway components in multiple mammalian cell lines and identified a set of genes representing immediate transcriptional targets of the Hippo/Yap signaling pathway.

DESIGN
Three mammalian cell lines (HEK293T, HepG2, HaCaT) were transfected with scramble siRNA controls or siRNAs against NF2 and LATS2, two core components of the Hippo pathway, simultaneously.  Total RNAs were harvested four days after transfection to reveal the gene expression pattern unsing microarry.  YAP and TAZ siRNAs were also transfected along with NF2 and LATS2 siRNAs to identify YAP/TAZ-dependent transcriptional targets upon loss of NF2/LATS2.
