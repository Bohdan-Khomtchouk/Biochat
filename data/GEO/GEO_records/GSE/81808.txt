TITLE
Calcium effect to the Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 degenerate strain for the solvent producing recovery

ORGANISM
Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052

SUMMARY
Solventogenic Clostridium species ferment carbohydrates to acetone, butanol and ethanol which are well-known next-generation biofuels. However, repeated subculture of or continuous fermentation by Clostridium often decreases and eventually terminates the solvent production and spore formation, which is a process called strain degeneration. Supplementation of CaCO3 to fermentation medium could partially recover metabolism of degenerated strain by more than 50% increase of cell growth and solvent production. The transcriptome profile of Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 (DG-8052) and its response to CaCO3 treatment were analysed by microarray. Since fermentation by C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 is a biphasic process, gene expressions of two fermentations were compared at each stage, i.e. 12h and 24h fermentation time representing acidogenic phase and solventogenic phase, respectively. This study examined expression of 5168 genes capturing 98.6% of the C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 genome. With the addition of CaCO3, DG-8052 had 565 and 916 genes significantly up-regulated at acidogenic phase and solventogenic phase, respectively. According to the enrichment analysis of pathway and Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, these genes were significantly overrepresented in cellular functions such as Amino acid transport and metabolism, organic acid biosynthetic process, bacteria chemotaxis and defense mechanisms. On the other hand, there were 704 and 1044 genes significantly down-regulated at acidogenic phase and solventogenic phase, respectively. These repressed genes were mainly enriched in functions such as ion transmembrane transport, ATP synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation.

DESIGN
Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB8052 degenerated strain cells in P2 medium vs. Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB8052 degenerated strain cells in P2 medium with 4g/L CaCO3 Two-fermentation time points (12h and 24h) experiments (degenerated strain cells in P2 vs.degenerated strain cells in P2 with CaCO3);Biological replicates: 3 replicates of degenerated strain cells in P2 at 12h; 3 replicates of degenerated strain cells in P2 at 24h;3 replicates of degenerated cells in P2 with CaCO3 at 12h;3 replicates of degenerated cells with CaCO3 at 24h.
