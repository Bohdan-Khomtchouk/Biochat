TITLE
Retinal gene expression in Egr-1 knock-out mice during development (p30 and p42)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In chicks, the avian homologue of the early growth response protein-1 (ZENK) has been shown to be increased in a special cell type of the retina, the glucagonergic amacrine cells, under conditions that lead to a reduction in eye growth (myopic defocus, recovery of myopia) and decreased under conditions that enhance ocular growth (hyperopic defocus, form-deprivation). The investigation of Egr-1 knock-out mice showed that homozygous knock-out mice with no functional Egr-1 protein developed relative axial myopia at the age of 42 and 56 days, compared to heterozygous- and wildtype Egr-1 knock-out mice. To clarify the role of Egr-1 in the retinal regulation of eye growth, and to get an idea about the biochemical pathways underlying this mechanism, we studied the role of Egr-1 in more detail using Affymetrix microarrays.

DESIGN
Retinal samples of young homozygous Egr-1 knock-out and wildtype mice at the age of 30 days (hm30 and wt30; no difference in axial eye length yet) and 42 days (hm42 and wt42; already a difference in axial eye length of 59 Âµm) were taken to compare the mRNA expression changes over time between these two genotypes and within the same genotype between the two age groups.
