TITLE
Expression profile of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of tumor and adjacent non-tumorous tissues of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients. Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip was used to obtain expression profiles across more than 31,000 annotated genes. Samples included 59 tumors and 59 adjacent non-tumorous samples.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from the 39 tumors and 39 adjacent non-tumorous samples

PLATFORM
