TITLE
A validated gene regulatory network and GWAS identifies early regulators of T-cell associated diseases (ChIP-Seq)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
For the purpose of the Gene Regulatory Network validation we have performed chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) experiment for three transcription factors; namely GATA3, MAF and MYB.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq of GATA3, MAF and MYB in human na√Øve CD4+ T-cells differentiated toward Th1 and Th2 until day 6. Matched INPUT samples were also sequenced for each condition.
