TITLE
Gene expression profiling of M tuberculosis BCG strain during extended stationary and resuscitation phase of growth

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Objective of the study is to find out the differentially regulated genes of Mycobacterium BCG strain in extended stationary phase comparison to log phase growth and resuscitation phase. Mycobacterium BCG culture was grown in Sauton medium at 37o C without shaking. Cells at A600 0.6-0.8   were harvested as log phase culture. The cells harvested after 5 months incubation at 37oC without shaking became non culturable and were harvested as extended stationary phase cells. The extended stationary phase cells were treated with resuscitation promoting factor (Rpf) from Micrococcus luteus and harvested after 8 days. Cells of this stage were treated as resuscitation phase cells. Gene expression profiling was carried out using Agilent microarray platform. Keywords: Extended stationary phase, Log phase growth and Resuscitation phase.
