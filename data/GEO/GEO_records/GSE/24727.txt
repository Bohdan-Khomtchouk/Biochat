SUMMARY
The transcription factor ZNF217 is a candidate oncogene in the amplicon on chromosome 20q13 that occurs in 20-30% of primary human breast cancers and that correlates with poor prognosis. We show Znf217 overexpression drives aberrant differentiation and signaling events, promotes increased self-renewal capacity, mesenchymal marker expression, motility and metastasis, and represses an adult tissue stem cell gene signature downregulated in cancers. By in silico screening, we identified candidate therapeutics that at low concentrations inhibit growth of cancer cells expressing high ZNF217. We demonstrate that the nucleoside analog triciribine inhibits ZNF217-induced tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance, and inhibits signaling events (e.g., P-AKT, P-MAPK) in vivo. Our data suggest ZNF217 is a biomarker of poor prognosis and a therapeutic target in breast cancer patients, and triciribine may be part of a personalized treatment strategy in patients overexpressing ZNF217. Since ZNF217 is amplified in numerous cancers, these results have implications for other cancers.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from samples overexpressing ZNF217 (3 Primary and 5 SCp2). RNA was also harvested from each cell line expressing a vector control to use as a reference for each microarray sample analyzed. Total RNA was hybridized to mouse MEEBO arrays as described ( ). Samples were verified to have strong overexpression of ZNF217 by qRT-PCR or Western analysis.
