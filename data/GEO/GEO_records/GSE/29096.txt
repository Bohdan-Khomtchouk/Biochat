TITLE
MicroRNA profiling in dorsal root ganglion after sciatic nerve injury

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression in the mouse L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglion following unilateral sciatic nerve transection. The timepoint of 7 days post-axotomy was chosen to capture miRNA expression profiles at a time when the injured neurons were beginning to regenerate.

DESIGN
Two condition experiment, paired control DRG vs axotomised DRG following unilateral sciatic nerve transection. 3 biological replicates, one replicate per array. Dye swap in Replicate 2.
