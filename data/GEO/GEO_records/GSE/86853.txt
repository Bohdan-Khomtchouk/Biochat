TITLE
A genome-wide RNAi screen identifies genes and networks governing hematopoietic stem cell development [Illumina_Expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report a genome-wide microarray analysis of gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) and in vitro ES-derived cells. iHoxB4 ESCs were transduced with a library of shRNAs targeting > 15,000 genes, and were differentiated towards hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by forcing HoxB4 expression in the cells. Five cell populations were isolated on differentiation days 6 and 20. Differentiated mesodermal/endothelium cell population D6F (Ssea1-Flkl+Cxcr4-), endodermal cell population D6C (Ssea1-Flkl-Cxcr4+), D20LS (Lin-Sca1+c-Kit–), D20LK (Lin–Sca1–c-Kit+), and D20LSK (Lin–Sca1+c-Kit+) cells were purified by FACS. Transduced iHoxB4 cells were analyzed as undifferentiated control cells. The experiment was performed three times independently.

DESIGN
A total of 18 samples from three replicates were analyzed for microarray. Sample ESC serves as control.
