TITLE
Survival and Diversity of Human Homologous Dietary MicroRNAs in Conventionally Cooked Top Sirloin and Dried Bovine Tissue Extracts

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We report the human homologous microRNA profiles in food-grade, bovine-sourced sirloin, heart and adrenal tissue (raw, cooked, and laboratory-prepared pasteurized, freeze-dried extracts)

DESIGN
Deep miRNA sequencing of sirloin (raw and cooked), heart tissue (raw, cooked, and pastuerized, freeze-dried extracts) and adrenal tissue (raw, cooked, and laboratory-prepared pasteurized, freeze-dried extracts), 3 replicates each process group
