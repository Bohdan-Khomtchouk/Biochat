TITLE
Effect of milk intake on circulating PBMC miRNAs of adult humans

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study examines circulating PBMC miRNAs of adult human subjects before and after bovine milk intake. We sought to confirm and expand findings previously reported by Baier, et al., J Nutr, 2014, PMID 25122645, using the same samples.

DESIGN
PBMC RNA samples were provided by the Zempleni lab (see Baier, et al., J Nutr, 2014, PMID 25122645) and had been taken from five healthy donors prior to milk intake (T0) and at six hours post-intake (T6). miRNA profiles were generated for each sample by OpenArray (Thermo Fisher).
