TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling of 30 uM curcumin treatment of immortalized prostate fibroblasts (PShTert-AR)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identifying the effect of the natural agent curcumin on global transcriptional activity of PShTert-AR prostate fibroblast cells over time with a view to understanding mechanisms of action over time. Treatment of PShTert-AR cells for 4, 8, 12 and 16 hours in PShTert-AR cells significantly altered the expression of approximately 1200 genes. Through non-hierarchical cluster analysis, these genes were classified into 3 distinct groups depending on their pattern of temporal response.

DESIGN
PShTert-AR cells were treated with vehicle control (16 hours DMSO) or 30 uM curcumin (4, 8, 12 or 16 hours). Total RNA was extracted. Triplicate RNA samples were pooled and hybrydised to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array chips.
