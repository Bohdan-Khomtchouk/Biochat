TITLE
Discovering novel bile protection systems in Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 through functional genomics

ORGANISM
Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003

SUMMARY
Tolerance of gut commensals to bile salt exposure is an important feature for their survival in and colonization of the intestinal environment. A transcriptomic approach was employed to study the response of Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 to bile, allowing the identification of a number of bile-induced genes with a range of predicted functions. The potential role of a selection of these bile-inducible genes in bile protection was determined by heterologous expression in Lactococcus lactis with subsequent characterization of the recombinant strains. Genes coding for three transport systems belonging to the MFS superfamily, Bbr_0838, Bbr_0832 and Bbr_1756, and three ABC-type transporters, Bbr_0406-0407, Bbr_1804-1805 and Bbr_1826-1827, along with the dps gene Bbr_0016, were thus analyzed. L. lactis cells expressing selected transporters exhibited enhanced resistance and survival to bile. In addition, L. lactis cells expressing the Dps protein also demonstrated a higher resistance to bile. This work significantly improves our understanding as to how bifidobacteria respond to and survives bile exposure.

DESIGN
In order to investigate differences in global gene expression upon growth or exposure of B. breve UCC2003 to cholic acid and ox-gall compared to normal growing cells, DNA microarray experiments were performed. Total RNA was isolated from B. breve UCC2003 cultures under normal conditions and cultures grown on or exposed to cholic acid and ox-gall. All experiments were performed as single experiments and targets where confirmed with QRT-PCR.
