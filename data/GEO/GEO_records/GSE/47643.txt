TITLE
Gene expression of in vitro cultivated preB cells before and after 8, 16 and 24 hours induction of miR-221

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
PreB cells were analyzed for differences in gene expression before and after the overexpression of miR-221. In order to dissect possible targets for the miR-221, gene expression profiles of preB cells un-induced or induced for the miR-221 expression after 8, 16 and 24 hours were compared. All induction time-points, e.g. after 8, 16 and 24 hours were compared to un-induced preB cells and to each other group.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of un-induced preB cells, preB cells induced for miR-221 expression after 8, 16, and 24 hours were analyzed using Affymetrix MG 430 2.0 whole genome arrays. Each time-point was performed in triplicates for un-induced preB cells and preB cells induced for miR-221 expression after 8, 16, and 24 hours (12 arrays in total). To obtain genes significantly downregulated upon induction of miR-221, the expression profiles of un-induced preB cells were compared to preB cells activated for 8, 16, or 24 h and were also compared to each other. After total RNA extraction, reverse transcription, cDNA extraction, the biotinylated cRNA was transcribed, fragmented, and 15 Âµg cRNA hybridized in triplicates for each of the four groups to the 12 GeneChip arrays: Group1, un-induced preB cells, Group2, preB cells induced for miR-221 expression after 8h, Group3, preB cells induced for miR-221 expression after 16h, Group4, preB cells induced for miR-221 expression after 24h.
