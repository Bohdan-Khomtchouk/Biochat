TITLE
PKCδ regulates the transformed growth of K-ras dependent lung cancer cells through regulation of integrin αVβ3 expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To explore how PKCδ regulates tumorigenesis, we performed mRNA expression analysis of four KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines that stably express scrambled shRNA or PKCδ targeted shRNA

DESIGN
Four human lung cancer cell lines (A549, H441, H460 and H2009) with scrambled and PKC-delta knock down (shRNA), in triplicate.
