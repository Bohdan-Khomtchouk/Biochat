TITLE
GE/miRNA expression profile of Human Epicardial Adipose Tissue (EAT) and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT) in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) vs. Controls (CTRL) - PART 1 - Genes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of Human EAT vs. SAT (CTRL & CAD). The aim of the present study was to assess a gene expression chart characterizing EAT vs. SAT, and CAD vs. CTRL. Results provide the information that EAT is characterized by a differential expression of different genes when compared to its reference tissue (SAT), and that EAT is characterized by specific gene expression changes in patients with CAD.

DESIGN
RNA obtained from EAT & SAT of the same patients (paired samples). Comparisons: EAT vs. SAT (paired samples) & CAD vs. CTRL
