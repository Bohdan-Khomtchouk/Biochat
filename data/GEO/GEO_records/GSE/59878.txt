TITLE
R-loops induce repressive chromatin marks over mammalian gene terminators

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The formation of R-loops is a natural consequence of the transcription process, caused by invasion of the DNA duplex by nascent transcripts. These structures have been considered rare transcriptional by-products with potential harmful effects on genome integrity, due to the fragility of the displaced DNA coding strand. However R-loops may also possess beneficial effects as their widespread formation has been detected over CpG island promoters in human genes. Furthermore we have previously shown that R-loops are particularly enriched over G-rich terminator elements. These facilitate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing prior to efficient termination. Here we reveal an unanticipated link between R-loops and RNA interference (RNAi)-dependent H3K9me2 formation over pause site termination regions of mammalian protein coding genes. We show that R-loops induce antisense transcription over these pause elements which in turn lead to the generation of double-strand RNA (dsRNA) and recruitment of Dicer, Ago1, Ago2, and G9a histone lysine methyltransferase (HKMT). Consequently an H3K9me2 repressive mark is formed and Heterochromatin Protein 1γ (HP1γ) is recruited, that reinforces Pol II pausing prior to efficient transcriptional termination. We predict that R-loops promote a chromatin architecture that defines the termination region for a substantial subset of mammalian genes.

DESIGN
