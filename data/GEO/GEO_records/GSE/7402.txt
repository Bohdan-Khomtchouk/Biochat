TITLE
Toxicogenomic analysis of sodium sodium hypochlorite antimicrobial mechanisms in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1

SUMMARY
In the present study, we employed Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa GeneChip arrays to investigate global gene expression profiles during the cellular response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to sodium hypochlorite Keywords: Antimicrobial response

DESIGN
We calculated fold change as the ratio between the signal averages of four untreated (control) and five sodium hypochlorite-treated (experimental) cultures for 20 min exposure.
