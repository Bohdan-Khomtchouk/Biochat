TITLE
modENCODE_White Lab: genome-wide ChIP data of KW3-Trl-D2 from WPP on Illumina Genome Analyzer.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains genome-wide binding profile of the factor KW3-Trl-D2 from WPP generated by ChIP and analyzed on Illumina Genome Analyzer.

DESIGN
A validated dataset is comprised of three biological replicates for ChIP-chip experiments and two replicates for ChIP-seq and meet the modENCODE quality standards. The control sample is the chromatin Input used for ChIP. Most factors binding profiles are generated by using specific antibodies for the protein of interest. However, some factors have been tagged by GFP in a transgenic line. In that case, ChIP is generated using an anti-GFP antibody.
