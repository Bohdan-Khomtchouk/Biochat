TITLE
AML1-ETO transduced human cord blood cells, CD34 selected, compared to normal cord blood cells, CD34 selected

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AML1-ETO expression in normal human umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells leads to long-term proliferation of an early self-renewing primitive progenitor cell with multilineage potential and stem cell ability, but these cells do not induce leukemia in immunodeficient mice. This comparative microarray study was initiated to determine the differences in the transcriptome of AML-ETO-expressing CD34+ cells after extended culture in vitro, using normal cord blood cells expanded for 6-8 weeks in vitro and subsequently purified for the CD34+ population as the control comparison. Keywords: Disease state analysis; comparison of changes in transcriptome due to long-term AML1-ETO expression in normal human hematopoietic CD34+ progenitor cells
