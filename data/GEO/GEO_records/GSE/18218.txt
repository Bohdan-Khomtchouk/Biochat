TITLE
Expression data from AFB1-treated GNMT knockout mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that liver nodules from 5/8 (62.5%) male and 4/5 (80%) female Gnmt-/- mice were diagnosed as having HCC. Microarray analysis showed that genes involved in the following pathways were deregulated in different stages of tumorigenesis: Methylation, metabolism, signal transduction, cell proliferation, and cell adhesion. This study reveals that GNMT plays an important role in the prevention of hepatotumorigenesis through regulating detoxification pathways. We postulate that GNMT is a stress-responsive protein and its expression may account for the gender difference of the susceptibility to liver cancer.

DESIGN
Liver tissues from aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-treated wild-type or Gnmt knockout mice at 11weeks old were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Total RNA were mixed in equal proportion from 3 mice.
