TITLE
D11.5 Tubular Porcine Conceptus

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Transcriptome profiling of  in vivo-derived porcine conceptus at the tubular stage (12-80 mm) during the elongation period of peri-implantation development. Keywords: Embryo stage of development

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling of in vivo derivied porcine conceptuses at critical stages of pre-implantation development is being investigated to ascertain gene expression profiles associated with competent embryo development.
