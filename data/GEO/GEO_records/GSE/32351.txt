TITLE
Rap1 Competition-ChIP Galactose Induction Time Course (High Resolution)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
A strain harboring two copies of RAP1 is used for a competition-ChIP experiment. One copy of RAP1 is expressed from the endogenous RAP1 promoter and a c-terminal 3X FLAG epitiope tag and the other is expressed from a weakened Galactose inducible promoter and a c-terminal 9X MYC tag. Following induction by 2% galactose Rap1-Myc and Rap1-Flag levels are determined genome wide using ChIP-chip.

DESIGN
Time Course ChIP-ChIP experiment, Rap1-Flag IP and Rap1-Myc IP. 10 Time Points (0,10,20,30,40,50,60,90,120,150 Minutes) 2 Biological Replicates. Total Rap1 Occupancy at times 0 and 60 minutes in the time course; 2 Biological Replicates. mRNA expression levels at times 0 and 60 minutes in the time course; 2 biological Replicates.
