TITLE
Expression data from breast cancer cell lines with various colony-forming ability

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cultured cancer cells exhibit substantial phenotypic heterogeneity when measured in a variety of ways such as sensitivity to drugs or the capacity to grow under various conditions.  Among these, the ability to exhibit anchorage-independent cell growth (colony forming capacity in semisolid media), has been considered to be fundamental in cancer biology, because it has been connected with tumor cell aggressiveness in vivo such as tumorigenic and metastatic potentials, and also utilized as a marker for in vitro transformation.  Although multiple genetic factors for anchorage-independence have been identified, the molecular basis for this capacity is still largely unknown.  To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying anchorage independent cell growth, we have used genome-wide DNA microarray studies to develop an expression signature associated with this phenotype.  Using this signature, we identify a program of activated mitochondrial biogenesis associated with the phenotype of anchorage-independent growth and importantly, we demonstrate that this phenotype predicts potential for metastasis in primary breast and lung tumors. Keywords: Breast cancer cell lines with various colony-forming ability

DESIGN
To develop an expression signature reflecting the capacity for anchorage-independent cell growth, we first carried out colony formation assays with 19 breast cancer cell lines in suspension culture dish with methyl-cellulose containing media.  Starting with 20,000 plated cells, five cell lines (MDA-MB-361, HCC38, ZR75, Hs578T and BT483) gave rise to less than 20 colonies, while 8 cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, BT20, SKBR3, MDA-MB-435s, T47D and BT474) showed formation of more than 500 colonies.  The rest of the cell lines showed an intermediate phenotype in colony forming ability (20-200 colonies; HCC1143, HCC1806, HCC1428, MDA-MB-453, CAMA1, BT549 and MDA-MB-157).  Among 19 cell lines, 11 cell lines have duplicates of expression data in a different batch. We removed the batch effect of this Affymetrix expression data using ComBat according to the instruction of http://statistics.byu.edu/johnson/ComBat/Abstract.html. Therefore, this dataset is a combined and standardized data that are originally RMA formatted.
