TITLE
RNA expression in P1 sciatic nerves

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA seq was performed comparing SC-specific Dicer mutants with SC-specific Lin28B transgenics to obtain an unbiased list of potentially de-regulated miRNA target candidates.

DESIGN
total RNA from sciatic nerves of P1 Dicer mutants, P1 Lin28 transgenics and their respective controls was used to perform RNA sequencing analysis.
