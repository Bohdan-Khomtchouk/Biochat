TITLE
Determination of the influence of caNrf2 expression and/or Dextran Sulfate Sodium treatment on genome wide mRNA expression in whole colon wall or colon epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a major modulator of the cellular antioxidant response. To study the role of Nrf2 on mucosal inflammation we used transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active Nrf2 in epithelial cells and induced mucosal inflammation by administration of dextran sulfate sodium. Genome wide expression was studied by mRNA sequencing.

DESIGN
mRNA profiling of epithelial cell or colon wall samples from VilCre-caNrf2 or VilCre control mice treated with/without Dextran Sulfate Sodium, each condition was performed in triplicate

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
