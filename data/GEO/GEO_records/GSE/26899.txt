TITLE
Characterization of gene expression profiles of gastric cancer in the Korea University cohort

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Clinical heterogeneity of gastric cancer reflected in unequal outcome of treatment is poorly defined in molecular level, and molecular subtypes and their associated biomarkers have not been established to improve prognostification and treatment of gastric cancer. Using microarray technologies, we analyzed gene expression profiling data from gastric cancer patients and uncovered potential prognostic subtypes and identify gene expression signature associated with prognosis and response to adjuvant chemotherapy.

DESIGN
Primary gastric adenocarcinoma and Surrounding normal fresh frozen tissues were used for microarray. All the tissues were obtained after curative resection after pathologic confirm at Korea University Guro Hospital. Microarray experiment and data analysis were done at Department of Systems Biology, MDACC with DNA microarray (Illumina human V3).
