TITLE
Gene expression signatures for hyperoxia in lung cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene profile of normoxia (20% O2) was compared with that of hyperoxia (50% O2) in lung cancer cell lines.

DESIGN
Lung cancer cell lines, H1975 and SK-MES-1 were exposed to 50% O2 for 24h, and total RNA was extracted.
