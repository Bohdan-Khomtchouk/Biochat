TITLE
Arabidopsis transcription factor ANAC017 is a necessary and central control point for normal transcriptome changes in response to reactive oxygen signals, such as H2O2, and specific mitochondrial retrograde stress signals

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Stresses that target mitochondrial function lead to altered transcriptional responses for 100-1000s of genes genome wide, and are signalled via retrograde communication pathways within the cell. rao2 mutants contain a mutation in the NAC family transcription factor ANAC017 and cannot induce stress responsive genes (such as the mitochondrial alternative oxidase 1a) in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. We sought to define the global gene network regulated through RAO2 function in response to mitochondrial stress (mimicked through treatment of plants with antimycin A - a specific inhibitor of complex III in the mitochondrial electron transfer chain), and non-specific stress signals such as hydrogen peroxide. We have defined global stress responses that are positively and negatively mediated by RAO2 function, and show that greater than 80% of transcripts that are differentially regulated under H2O2 stress require proper functioning of ANAC017 for a normal stress responses. We used Affymetrix microarray to characterise global gene expression profiles for mutant plants with compromised mitochondrial retrograde signalling (rao2 mutants), to define the genome wide transcriptional network regulated through RAO1 function under mitochondrial stress and hydrogen peroxide stress.

DESIGN
rao2 EMS lines, independent T-DNA knock-out lines for ANAC017 (anac017-1), ANAC017 gain of function mutants (anac017-2) and wild type seedlings were grown for 14 days, the optimal stage as defined by forward genetic screens that identifed rao2 mutants. Seedlings were grown on GamborgB5 plates and treated by spraying plants with 50 ÂµM antimycin A (an elicitor of mitochondrial retrograde signalling) or 20mM hydrogen peroxide while mock control samples were sprayed with deionised water. Samples were collected after 3hr of treatment for global expression profiling.
