TITLE
Role of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction on RelA-activated genes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A structure-function study of NF-kB subunit RelA and coactivator CBP/p300 interaction reveals the critical role of CBP/p300 in recruitment of RelA to its target promoter site.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of unstimulated or stimulated with TNFa rela-/- MEF reconstituted with RelA wild type or mutants were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate
