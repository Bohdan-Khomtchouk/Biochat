TITLE
Patterns of gene expression during Arabidopsis flower development from the time of initiation to maturation

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Microarray timecourse experiments conducted across flower development from initiation of floral development to anthesis of the mature flower

DESIGN
3 replicates for each of 14 timepoints collected from Arabidopsis flowers using a previously described Floral Induction System, conducted using a common reference design on two channel microarrays
