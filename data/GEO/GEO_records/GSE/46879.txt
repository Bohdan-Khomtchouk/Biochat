TITLE
RNA methylation destabilizes developmental regulators in murine embryonic stem cells (MoGene-2)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent methylome studies have located N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification on thousands of mammalian transcripts.  However, its functional mechanism remains unclear.  In this study, we examined the role of m6A methylation in mouse embryonic stem cells. To gain an understanding of dynamic changes in cells depleted with (proposed) methyltranferases at molecular level, we examined the time-series gene expression pattern in mESC lines using microarray analysis.

DESIGN
After 0, 4 and 8 h incubation with scramble, shRNA for Mettl3 or Mettl14, mESC cells were collected and RNAs were isolated for microarray analysis using Affymetrix Genechip Mouse Gene 2.0 ST array. After 0 h incubation with scramble, shRNA for Mettl3 or Mettl14, mESC cells were collected and RNAs were isolated for microarray analysis using Affymetrix Genechip Mouse Gene 2.0 ST array.
