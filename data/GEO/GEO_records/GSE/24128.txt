TITLE
Cyclin D1 in AL Amyloidosis Baseline Plasma Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD138-selected marrow plasma cells from newly diagnosed AL patients were studied for cyclin D1 expression. We identified patients whose plasma cells overexpressed cyclin D1 and compared them to those whose cells did not.

DESIGN
We compared two groups of AL patients based cyclin D1 expression being high or low.
