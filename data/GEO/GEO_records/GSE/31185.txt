TITLE
The human Ewing's Sarcoma oncoprotein EWS-FLI1 causes developmental defects in zebrafish embryos

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The  fusion oncoprotein EWS-FLI1 arises from a t(11;22)(q24;q12) chromosomal translocation and causes Ewing's Sarcoma, a malignant bone tumor.  The mechanism whereby EWS-FLI1 transforms cells is unknown.  We made germline transgenic zebrafish expressing human EWS-FLI1 under the control of the heat shock promoter.  Induction of EWS-FLI1 expression causes multiple defects in embryonic development. We compared gene expression in control and transgenic EWS-FLI1 zebrafish.  The results identify a conserved set of EWS-FLI1-regulated genes, and provide insight into the pathogenesis of Ewing's Sarcoma tumors.

DESIGN
We performed heat shock and isolated total RNA for microarray studies comparing wildtype AB strain zebrafish with transgenic zebrafish expressing human EWS-FLI1 [Tg(HSP:EWS-FLI1)].  RNA was biotin-lableled and hybridized to zebrafish-specific Affymetrix arrays.
