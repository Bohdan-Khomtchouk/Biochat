TITLE
Irradiated feeder cells and Y-27632

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from this experiment is part of a larger project aimed at defining the individual effects and synergistic effects of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and conditioned media from irradiated J2 cells when applied to epithelial cells. This data set consists of four individual samples, each of which are total RNA collected from human foreskin keratinocyte cells, either grown in F medium (control), treated with Y-27632, grown in conditioned medium (as described in associated publication), or both treatments.

DESIGN
Four total RNA samples from HFK cells grown in F media (control) or treated with either Y-27632, conditioned media from irradiated J2 cells, or both.
