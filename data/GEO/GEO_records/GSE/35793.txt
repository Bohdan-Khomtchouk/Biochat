TITLE
Expression data from day 3 Flk-1 mesoderm between ER71 overexpressed and ER71 knockout mouse embryonic stem cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Ets transcription factor ER71 is critical for Flk-1 mesoderm specification to different cell lineages. In this dataset, we determine to investigate the mechanisms by which ER71 regulates hematopoietic and endothelial cell versus cardiac cell lineage development.

DESIGN
Expression of all four Flk-1+ mesoderm populations (i.e. Er71 overexpressed versus control, Er71 deficient versus control Flk-1+ mesoderm) was compared. Specifically, we sorted Flk-1+ mesoderm  from day 3 differentiated embryonic stem(ES) cells, including induced Er71 and control ES cells, as well as  Er71+/+ as well as Er71-/- ES cells .
