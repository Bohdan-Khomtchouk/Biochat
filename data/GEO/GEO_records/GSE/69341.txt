TITLE
Towards a new standardized method for circulating miRNAs profiling in clinical studies: Interest of the exogenous normalization to improve miRNA signature accuracy

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
In our study, we proposed first to reduce the profiling variability by selecting the miRNA isolation kit offering the higher input RNA concentration for microarray profiling and second to control the profiling step variability by adapting the widely used exogenous normalization of the validation step to the profiling one. The new strategy proposed could improve the overlap between independent studies using microarray profiling, but also potentially with other high-throughput methods, to finally identify pertinent miRNA signatures in biofluids. Because this project is only a methodological study, the cohort of serum and plasma samples used in this study were all obtained from patients with FIGO stages III/IV serous ovarian cancer.   This study was approved by the ethics committee Nord-Ouest III [CPP N° 2011-02] and national authorities (AFSSAPS N°B110260-20). Plasma samples were obtained from the Comprehensive Cancer Center F. Baclesse biological collections that have been declared (# DC-2010-1243) to the French Ministry of Research and Superior Education. Prior to scientific use of samples and data, patients were appropriately informed and asked to consent in writing, in compliance with French and European regulations.
