TITLE
The Gene Expression Profile of Lung Tissue Following Sulfur Mustard Inhalation Exposure in Large Anesthetized Swine

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Sulfur mustard (HD) is a vesicating agent that targets the eyes, skin, and lungs, producing skin burns, conjunctivitis, and compromised respiratory function. Underlying mechanisms of this damage are a critical area of research for the development of medical countermeasures. This study utilized mRNA analysis to evaluate molecular effects of HD on lung tissue from anesthetized swine inhalationally exposed to HD

DESIGN
Anesthetized large swine were exposed for 10 minutes to either air, 60 ug/kg (low), or 100ug/kg (medium) HD vapor. At 12 hours, animals were euthanized, lungs removed and dissected by lobe, and stabilized in RNAlater. Total RNA was isolated and processed for hybridization to Affymetrix Porcine GeneChip.
