TITLE
MicroRNA-independent functions of DGCR8 are critically required for neocortical development and TBR1 expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Recent evidence indicates that DROSHA, DGCR8 and DICER exert non-overlapping functions, including miRNA-independent regulatory mechanisms. It is currently unknown whether miRNA-independent functions of DGCR8 play any role in corticogenesis. Here, by phenotypic comparison of conditional knockout cortices for Dgcr8 and Dicer, we uncover that Dgcr8 deletion, in contrast to Dicer, leads to premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells and overproduction of Tbr1 positive neurons. Remarkably, miRNA depletion does not account for these phenotypic differences, indicating that miRNA-independent functions of DGCR8 are critical for corticogenesis. We propose Tbr1 transcript, bearing evolutionary conserved hairpins that resemble miRNA precursors, as one of DGCR8 targets. Our study uncovers, for the first time in the nervous system, an earlier and stronger phenotype occurring in Dgcr8 compared to Dicer mutant and proposes that this effect is mediated by miRNA-independent functions of DGCR8.

DESIGN
miRNA expression by deep-sequencing in the cortex of Wild-Type, DICER and DGCR8 conditional knock-out mice. Two mice for each genotype.
