TITLE
DNA methylation changes induced by overexpression of IDH1mut or treatment with 2HG in the sorted mouse bone marrow cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mutations in the enzymes IDH1 and IDH2 have been identified in a wide variety of tumors like glioma, chondrosarcoma, thyroid cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and in acute myeloid leukemia. Mutated IDH1/2 produces the metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which interferes with epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and thus may promote tumorigenesis.

DESIGN
HoxA9 immortalised bone marrow cells from C57BJ/6 mice were tranduced with either empty vector or pSF91-IDH1wt-IRES-EGFP, or pSF91-IDH1mut-IRES-GFP and transplanted in irradiated recipient mice. Alternatively, HoxA9 immortalised cells transduced with empty vector transplanted mice were treated with R-2HG at dose of 1mg/day for four weeks. Four weeks after transplantation/treatment GFP+ cells were sorted from mouse bone marrow, from which total DNA was extracted and subjected to Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) to determine the genome-wide methylation signature.
