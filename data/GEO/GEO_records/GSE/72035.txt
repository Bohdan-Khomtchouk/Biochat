TITLE
Transcriptomic Analysis of Stage 1 Versus Advanced Adult Granulosa Cell Tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the changes in gene expression that reflect the transition from Stage 1 to advanced GCT.

DESIGN
Established transcriptome profiles for 6x Stage 1 and 6x advanced adult GCT (as defined by FOXL2 C134W mutation status).

PLATFORM
