TITLE
Dose and temporal effects of Phenobarbital on the  liver miRNAome of male Fischer rats

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Male Fischer rats were fed a control diet or a diet supplemented with 50, 500 or 1000 ppm Phenobarbital. The 500 and 1000 ppm PB doses induced a transient hyperplasia and a sustained hepatomegaly in treated animals. The animals were sacrificed and liver miRNAome was profiled in three animals per group after 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of treatment. The aim was to investigate the time and dose dependent effects of phenobarbital treatment on the liver miRNAome

DESIGN
Three animals were profiled from control or each treatment group after 1, 3, 7, and 14 days
