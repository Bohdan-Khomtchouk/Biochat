TITLE
Expression analysis of N. europaea (ATCC 19718) wildtype and pFur::Kan mutant grown in Fe-replete and Fe-limited media

ORGANISM
Nitrosomonas europaea ATCC 19718

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Nitrosomonas europaea (ATCC 19718) wildtype and pFur::Kan mutant [kanamycin resistance cassette insertion in the promoter region of the fur gene (NE0616)] strains grown in Fe-replete and Fe-limited media. The Nitrosomonas europaea (ATCC 19718) wiltype cells grown in Fe-limited media were compared to cells grown in Fe-replete media to gain a better understanding of the metabolic changes occurring in response to iron stress. The Nitrosomonas europaea (ATCC 19718) pFur::Kan mutant strain grown in Fe-replete & Fe-limited media were compared to wildtype cells grown in Fe=replete & Fe-limited media to gain a better understanding of the role Fur (NE0616) plays in iron homeostasis control.

DESIGN
A 4-plex 3 chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures each of N. europaea grown in Fe-replete media and Fe-limited media and three seperate cultures each of N. europaea pFur::Kan mutant strain grown in Fe-replete and Fe-limited media. Each chip measures the expression level of 2368 genes from Nitrosomonas europaea (ATCC19718)  with 4 X 72,000  60-mer 14 probe pairs per gene, with two-fold technical redundancy.
