TITLE
the transcript profiles of Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514 (wild type) and its ethanol tolerant mutants (Xm and Xe) with or without ethanol

ORGANISM
Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514

SUMMARY
The ethanol shock and stress response mechanisms by Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514 (wt) and mutants (Xm and Xe) were characterized by whole genome cDNA micorarrays.

DESIGN
In this study, X514 (wt) and mutants (Xm and Xe) cell grew in difeined medium supplement with 50mM glucose under different ethanol treatment. Each sample was prepared harvested at different treated times respectively. Samples were used to acquire expression profiles of total 2322 unique genes, leading to metabolic mechanism construction.
