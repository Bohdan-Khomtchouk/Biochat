TITLE
RAW264.7 cells were treated with KDO, IFN beta and 8Br

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with KDO (100 ng/ml), IFN-β (300 pM) and/or 8-Br 100 μM. These ligands were applied individually or in combination with KDO for 60 min and 120 min. Total RNA was extracted using TriPure (Roche) following its protocol. Keywords: designed

DESIGN
RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with KDO (100 ng/ml), IFN-β (300 pM) and/or 8-Br 100 μM. These ligands were applied individually or in combination with KDO for 60 min and 120 min. Total RNA was extracted using TriPure (Roche) following its protocol. The detailed procedure is available at http://www.signaling-gateway.org/data/ProtocolLinks.html (AfCS Procedure Protocol PP00000009). Duplicate experiments were done for each treatment. Oligonucleotide array fabrication and annotation 16 K mouse oligonucleotide arrays were fabricated with 15,631 oligomers of 65-bp or 70-bp long. The oligomers were purchased from Operon and Sigma-Genosys and were inkjet-printed onto glass slides by Agilent Technologies. The list of genes is available through the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo ) as an accession number GPL254. Gene expression analysis The hybridization experiment and analysis were performed as previously described (Park et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2004). Cy5-labeled cRNA (RNA of ligand treated cells) and Cy3-labeled cRNA (RNA of time matched controls) were hybridized in the array. Dye-swap labeling was performed for each pair of samples. The arrays were scanned with Agilent Scanner G2505A (Agilent Technologies) and image files were extracted with background subtraction and dye-normalization using Agilent G2566AA Extraction Software version A.6.1.1 (Agilent Technologies).
