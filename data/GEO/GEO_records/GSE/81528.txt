TITLE
Gene expression profiles of HEK293T cells following EBV-miR-BART6-3p mimics transfection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
EBV encodes 44 mature miRNAs, a number of which have been found to promote carcinogenesis by targeting host genes. To determine the biological functions of the BART cluster miRNAs, we singly transfected these miRNAs into HEK293T cells. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of EBV-miR-BART6-3p in HEK293T cells dramatically altered HEK293T cell shape. To explore the mechanism of EBV-miR-BART6-3p-mediated inhibition of cell migration and invasion, we attempted to identify its downstream host cellular genes by whole genome microarray, which contains probes to all known human protein coding genes (mRNAs) and long non-coding RNA genes (lncRNAs).

DESIGN
EBV-miR-BART6-3p induced gene expression in human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T was measured after transfected by EBV-miR-BART6-3p mimics.
