TITLE
The response regulator ArcA uses a diverse binding site architechture to globally regulate carbon oxidation in E. coli [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655

SUMMARY
We found many binding sites for ArcA under glucose fermentative anaerobic growth conditions.  Descirbed in the manuscript " The response regulator ArcA uses a diverse binding site architechture to globally regulate carbon oxidation in E. coli "

DESIGN
Examination of occupancy of ArcA under anaerobic growth conditions.
