De novo kidney transplantation without use of calcineurin inhibitors preserves renal structure and function

SUMMARY
Background: Despite significant improvements in short-term kidney transplant survival, comparable increases in 5 and 10-year outcomes have not been achieved. Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is a major cause of late graft loss. Toxic nephropathy and inadequate long-term immunosuppression are possible factors. We performed a randomized prospective trial comparing calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free to CNI-based immunosuppression to determine the impact on renal function, structure, and gene expression. Methods: Sixty-one kidney recipients received mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisone (P). Randomized patients received concentration-controlled sirolimus or cyclosporine. Two years post-transplant 55 patients underwent renal function studies, 48 (87%) underwent transplant biopsies; all classified by Banff scoring and 41 by DNA microarrays. Findings:  Comparing sirolimus/MMF/P to cyclosporine/MMF/P at two years, there was a significantly lower serum creatinine (1.35 vs. 1.81 mg/dl; p=0.008), significantly higher Cockroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (80.4 vs. 63.4 cc/min; p=0.008), iothalamate GFR (60.6 vs. 49.2 cc/min; p= 0.018), and Banff 0 (normal) biopsies (66.6 vs. 20.8%; p=0.013).  Regression analysis of calculated GFR’s from 1 to 36 months yielded a positive slope for sirolimus of 3.36 ml/min/year, and a negative slope for cyclosporine of –1.58 ml/min/year (p=0.008). Gene expression profiles of kidney biopsies with higher Banff CAN scores confirmed significant up regulation of genes responsible for immune/inflammation and fibrosis/tissue remodeling. Interpretation:  At two years the sirolimus-treated patients have better renal transplant function, a diminished prevalence of CAN, and down regulated expression of genes responsible for the progression of CAN. All may provide for an alternative natural history with improved graft survival.
