TITLE
Gene expression changes in anti-FcgRIIb treated DCs and monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to activate immunity is linked to their maturation status. In prior studies we have shown that selective antibody-mediated blockade of inhibitory FcgRIIB receptor on human DCs in the presence of activating immunoglobulin (Ig) ligands leads to DC maturation and enhanced immunity to antibody-coated tumor cells. Here we show that Fcg receptor (FcgR) mediated activation of human monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs is associated with a distinct gene expression pattern, including several inflammation associated chemokines as well as type 1 interferon (IFN) response genes including the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Keywords: response to antibody

DESIGN
To further characterize FcgR mediated enhancement of DC function, we analyzed the gene expression profiles (GEP) of pure populations of monocyte-derived DCs from healthy donors (n=5) using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus2.0 microarrays. Immature DCs cultured in 1% plasma were treated for 24 hours with either anti-FcgRIIB or isotype control antibody. To test whether FcgR mediated DC maturation was distinct from other maturation stimuli, we also compared DCs matured using the inflammatory cytokine cocktail (TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and PGE2) commonly utilized in DC immunotherapy trials. In addition, we also treated Cd14+ monocytes (n=3) with anti-FcgRIIB antibody or isotype control. In order to better characterize the interferon responsive genes in DCs, we treated immature DCs (n=3) with 1000 U/ml of IFN-a2b.
