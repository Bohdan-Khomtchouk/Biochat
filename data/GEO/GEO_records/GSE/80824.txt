TITLE
Identification of in vivo binding sites for YY2.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the application of next generation sequencing for high-throughput profiling of Yin Yang 2 (YY2) binding sites in mammalian Trophectoderm Stem cells. Sequencing of chromatin obtained in chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays carried out with Î±YY2 serum yielded over ten million sequence reads. Peak finding allowed us allowed us to identify a limited number of chromatin targets for YY2. Putative binding sites were validated in regular ChIP assays and gene expression of a few genes nearby was altered in the absence of Yy2. This study provides a framework to understand the role of YY2 in diverse mammalian cell populations.

DESIGN
Examination of YY2 binding sites in TSB7 cells.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
