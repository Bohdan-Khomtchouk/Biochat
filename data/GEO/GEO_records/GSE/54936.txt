TITLE
Inhibition of Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Impairs Cancer Cell Growth via Promotion of Autophagy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression levels in response to inhibition of Hh signaling in ovarian and glioma cancer cells using a cDNA microarray technique. Microarray analyses revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in human cancer cells are enriched in the senescence and autophagy pathways in response to the inhibition of Hh signaling. Further investigations showed that inhibition of Hh signaling induced autophagy..

DESIGN
ES2 and H4 cells were treated with GANT61 (20 Î¼M for 32hr and 48hr) and control vehicle DMSO, respectively.
