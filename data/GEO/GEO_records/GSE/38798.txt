TITLE
Gene expression analysis of molecules with known function in HLA class II antigen processing and presentation in hematopoietic and (cytokine pre-treated) non-hematopoietic cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of molecules with known function in HLA class II antigen processing and presentation. Various hematopoietic cell types and (cytokine pre-treated) non-hematopoietic cells that are targeted in Graft-versus-Leukemia reactivity and Graft-versus-Host Disease were collected. Expression was compared between the different hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types for the Invariant chain, HLA-DMA, HLA-DMB, HLA-DOA and HLA-DOB genes. The data show that the Invariant chain, HLA-DMA, HLA-DMB and HLA-DOA genes are expressed in all or the majority of cell types with HLA class II surface expression, whereas expression of the HLA-DOB gene is restricted to professional antigen presenting B-cells and mature dendritic cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from various hematopoietic cell types isolated (and cultured) from (G-CSF mobilized) peripheral blood from five different individuals and from (IFN-g pre-treated) fibroblasts cultured from skin biopsies from four different patients transplanted with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells.
