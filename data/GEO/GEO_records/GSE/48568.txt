TITLE
Agilent-013282 array CGH on NCI-60 cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The NCI-60 cancer cell lines have been used for studying cancer pathogenesis and for drug discovery. This dataset adds to the growing number of datasets on various genomic platforms that have been made public on Cellminer ( http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/ )

DESIGN
60 cell lines (including PR:DU145 and its drug resistant derivative PR:RC01) were arrayed. LC:A549 was done with 8 replicates. LC:NCI_H226 was done on one array. All others were done with 2 replicates. All cell lines with 2 or more replicates were done with dye flips

PLATFORM
GPL11068 Agilent-013282 Human Genome CGH Microarray 44B (Probe name version)
