TITLE
Differentially methylated genes in saliva are linked to childhood stress

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling from saliva of prepubescent girls that experiences childhood stress. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 430,000 CpGs. Data included 22 samples with LSI (stress) scores ranging from 1 (mild) to 9.5 (severe).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 22 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip.

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
