TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene methylation by effect of proton beam on breast cell line MCF-7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of estrogene receptor postive breast cancer cell line MCF-7, treating proton beam. The Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450k Bead chip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 450,000 CpGs. This profiling indicates that proton beam induces epigenetic and cellular changes.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA obtained from  MCF-7 effected by proton beam

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
