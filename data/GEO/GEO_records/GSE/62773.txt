SUMMARY
Copy number analysis of KAT6B gene deletion in small cell lung cancer cell lines

DESIGN
We perform genotyping microarray (Illumina HumanOmni5) on small cell lung cancer cell lines in order to predict copy number aberrations.

PLATFORM
GPL14157 Illumina HumanOmni5-Quad BeadChip (HumanOmni5-4v1_B)
