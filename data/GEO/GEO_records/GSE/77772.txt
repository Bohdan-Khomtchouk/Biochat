TITLE
Bivalency - Histone H3 Lysine4 and Histone H3 Lysine27 Methylation Dynamics

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The molecular signature at histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 involved in epigenetic regulation of normal (MCF10A) and transformed (MCF7, MDA-MB-231) breast cells using ChIP-Seq technology.  This study examines the dynamic distribution of H3K4me3, associated with active chromatin, and H3K27me3, associated with repressed chromatin, histone modifications to provide an understanding of the changes in epigenetic regulation associated with the unique breast cancer subtypes.

DESIGN
histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq normal (MCF10A) and transformed (MCF7, MDA-MB-231) breast cells Please note that the 'H3K4me3' and 'input' data are duplicated records of the samples represented in GSE69377 for the convenient retrieval of the complete raw data from SRA.
