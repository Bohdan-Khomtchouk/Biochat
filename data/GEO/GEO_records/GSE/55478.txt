TITLE
Dysregulation of miRNA in adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We identified an altered miRNA expression in adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix compared with normal cervix and futhermore analyzed their association with clinicopthologic characteristics.

DESIGN
miRNA expression was measured in four cancerous tissues from the cervical adenocarcinoma and four non-cancerous from the normal uterine cerivx respectively, all of which were obtained from different donors.
