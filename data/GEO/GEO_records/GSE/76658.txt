TITLE
Transcriptional reprogramming and resistance to colonic mucosal injury in PARP1-deficient mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Poly(ADP-ribose)     polymerases (PARPs)  synthesize  and  bind  branched  polymers of  ADP-ribose  to acceptor  proteins using NAD  as a  substrate,  and  participate  to  the  control  of  gene transcription  and  DNA  repair.  PARP1,  the  most abundant   isoform,   regulates   the   expression   of proinflammatory        mediator        -        cytokines, chemokines     and     adhesion     molecules,     and inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity reduced or ameliorated    autoimmune    diseases    in    several experimental  models,  including  colitis.  However, the mechanism(s) underlying the protective effects of PARP1 inhibition in colitis and the cell types in which Parp1  deletion  has  the  most  significant impact are unknown.  The objective of the current study   was   to   determine   the   impact   of Parp1 deletion   on   the   innate   immune   response   to mucosal   injury. Genome-wide  analysis  of  the  colonic  transcriptome  was   performed.  Compared  to  WT,  we  demonstrated  that Parp1-/-were  protected  from  DSS-induced  colitis  and  that this  protection  was  associated  with  a  dramatic transcriptional    reprogramming in    the    colon.

DESIGN
WT or Parp1-/- mice were treated with drinking water administered ad libitum without ot with 4% dextran sulfate (DSS) for seven days. Whole colon was collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Thee mice from each genotype/treatment groups were used in the analysis.
