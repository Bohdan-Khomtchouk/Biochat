TITLE
Human lung cancer cell lines DMS-273 (SCLC) and NCI-H1437 (NSCLC): scrambled vs. shRNA clones

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of two human lung cancer cell lines, DMS-273 (small cell lung cancer) and NCI-H1437 (non-small cell lung cancer), stably transfected either with innocuous scrambled shRNAs or SETDB1-specific.The objective was to identify global gene expression changes due to the depletion of the H3K9me3 methyltransferase SETDB1.

DESIGN
3 replicates for DMS-273 and 1 Control; 2 replicates for NCI-H1437 and 1 Control
