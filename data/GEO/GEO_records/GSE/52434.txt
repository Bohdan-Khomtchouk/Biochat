TITLE
Transcriptional responses of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) lines to IKKB inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MCL cell lines were treated with DMSO or 5uM AFN700 for 20hrs This experiment is designed to see if NFKB-target genes are downregulated by inhibition of IKKB in MCL cell lines that are insensitive to ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor) or sotrastaurin (PKC inhibitor)

DESIGN
MCL cells were seeded in 6well dishes and treated for 20hrs with DMSO or 5uM AFN700
