TITLE
Ecological success of a group of Saccharomyces cerevisiae / Saccharomyces kudriavzevii hybrids in the Northern European wine making environment.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces kudriavzevii

SUMMARY
The aim of this project was to evaluate the ploidy of a S. cerevisiae *S. kudriavzevii hybrid  in comparison to the lab strain S288C. Other wine yeast have been icluded in the project for the global analysis.

DESIGN
Comparison of Eg8 (2 arays) ,  to S288C (3 arrays), other strains V5, U13, Eg25 (2 arrays) are used to enable signal normalization acccross arrays with RMA package.

PLATFORM
