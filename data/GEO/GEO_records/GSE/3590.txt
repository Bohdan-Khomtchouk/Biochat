TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression during Bacteriophage T4 Infection

ORGANISM
Enterobacteria phage T4

SUMMARY
Genomic microarrays were used to examine the complex temporal program of gene expression exhibited by bacteriophage T4 during the course of development.The microarray data confirm the existence of distinct early, middle, and late transcriptional classes during the bacteriophage replicative cycle.This approach allows assignment of previously uncharacterized genes to specific temporal classes.The genomic expression data verify many promoter assignments and predict the existence of previously unidentified promoters. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
The present study used microarrays to identify temporal classes of RNA produced during T4 infection of E. coli.  Briefly, the data were produced from time course studies from T4 infections of E. coli B. Samples were isolated at various time points throughout the course of infection. Samples were analyzed using Integrated Genomics T4 genomic arrays.
