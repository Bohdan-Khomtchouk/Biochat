TITLE
Gene expression data after acute withdrawal of TERT in mouse skin

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
TERT is an essential protein component of telomerase, a ribonuclearprotein complex that protects chromosomal ends. Ectopic expression of TERT in mouse skin activates hair follicle stem cells and induces active growth phase of hair cycles, called anagen. This activity of TERT is independent of its reverse transcriptase function, indicating that this is a non-telomeric function of TERT. We performed time-course microarray analysis using conditional bi-transgenic mice (iK5-TERT) to understand the mechanism of this novel non-telomeric function of TERT. Keywords: Time course, 2 cohorts (control, experimental)

DESIGN
Hair follicles of iK5-TERT mice at postnatal day 60 is in TERT-induced anagen. To those mice, we injected either PBS, to maintain TERT transgene expression, or doxycycline, to rapidly extinguish transgene expression. We then took time-course dorsal skin biopsies (0,6,12,24 hr) of these mice and analyzed differential gene expressions using Affymetrix Genechips and various bioinformatic tools, including SAM, to discover TERT-regulated genes.
