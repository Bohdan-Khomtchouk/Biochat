TITLE
Platinum-based chemotherapy induces methylation changes in blood and tumour DNA at time of relapse that are associated with patient survival

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across  485,577 CpGs . Samples included 11 clones of each of the four groups derived from the A2780/CP70 ovarian cancer cell line. Groups included MLH1 minus treated with 5uM Cisplatin (A), MLH1 plus treated with 5uM Cisplatin (B), MLH minus mock treated (C) and MLH1 plus mock treated (D).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA was hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip
