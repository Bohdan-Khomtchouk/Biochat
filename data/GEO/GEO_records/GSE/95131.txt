TITLE
Identification of splice variants and RNA binding partners of STAT3-induced long noncoding RNAs (STAiRs) in multiple myeloma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Interleukin 6 (IL-6) activates the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We previously identified several STAT3-induced long noncoding RNAs (STAiRs) in INA-6 multiple myeloma cells (Hackerm√ºller et al. 2014). Here, we analyze five STAiRs by CAPTURE- and ChIRP-RNA-sequencing, a pulldown of a target RNA by transcript tiling oligonucleotides. The CAPTURE technique allows the identification of different STAiR splice variants and shall give rise to the transcript architecture. ChIRP, a method first published by Chu et al 2011, is the original method on which the CAPTURE approach is based on and enables the identification of RNAs interacting with our STAiRs.

DESIGN
Identification of (1) the transcript architecture analyzed by Capture-seq and (2) the RNA interaction partners analyzed by ChIRP-seq of five different STAiRs in INA-6 multiple myeloma cells

PLATFORM
GPL15520 Illumina MiSeq (Homo sapiens)
