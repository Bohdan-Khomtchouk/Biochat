TITLE
Orthotopic xenografts of RCC retain histological, immunophenotypic and genetic features of tumors in patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Development of a clinically relevant animal models of RCC for preclinical investigations. For DNA copy number analysis, the Sty I (250K) SNP array of the 500K Human Mapping Array (Affymetrix) was used. Arrays were scanned by GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Probe-level signal intensities were normalized to a baseline array with median intensity using invariant set normalization and SNP-level signal intensities were obtained using a model-based (PM/MM) method. Keywords: SNP array data, renal cell carcinoma

DESIGN
To ensure at least 70% contribution from tumor cells, enriched tumor areas from 10 original RCCs and 10 corresponding xenografts were isolated from 7 Âµm-thick tissue frozen sections using a fine needle with the aid of an optical microscope. DNA was then extracted using phenol chloroform
