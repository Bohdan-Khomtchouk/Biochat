Expression data from roots of rice seedlings

SUMMARY
Potassium (K+) is one of the most important nutrient ions in plant cells and play crucial roles in many plant physiological and developmental processes. K+ deficiency is the common abiotic stress in natural environment, which inhibits plant growth and reduces production of crops. We used microarrays to analyse the transcriptomic changes in rice roots after suffering K+ starvation at different times. The results of GO analysis showed that these transcriptionally changed genes mainly fell into the categories of metabolic process, membrane, cation binding, kinase activity, transport and so on.

DESIGN
The two-week-old hydroponic rice seedlings were transferred to K+-free solution (-K) and K+-replete solution (+K, 1 mM K+) as treatment (LK) and control (CK) conditions respectively. The fresh roots of both control and treated rice seedlings were collected after K+-deficient treatment at indicated times (6 h, 3 d and 5 d). The roots were frozen immediately using liquid nitrogen and stored at -80â„ƒ for further RNA extraction. Every RNA sample was derived from 5 independent seedlings. In sum, three time points were selected and three biological replicates were performed at each time point, totally 18 rice genome arrays were used.
