TITLE
Tolerance mechanisms towards high-temperature and -acid stress conditions during itaconic acid biosynthesis in Aspergillus terreus

ORGANISM
Aspergillus terreus

SUMMARY
A. terreus LYT10 is an industrial strain for itaconic acid production, in which the biosynthesis of itaconic acid and glucose conversion rate were affected by temperature and initial concentration of itaconic acid  in industrial production. RNA-seq was used to identify the key regulators related to tolerance mechanism toward various stress conditions.

DESIGN
A total of 4 samples were analzyed. The mycelia cultivated in itaconic acid production medium (IPM) on a rotary shaker at 220 rpm and 37°C for 36 h  was considered as a reference. IPMs with 5 g/L and 40 g/L itaconic acid (pH 3.25)  were used for high-acid culture respectively. High-temperature condition was possesed at 42°C for 36 h in IPM.
