TITLE
Smallpox vaccination with LC16m8 vaccinia virus provides a gene expression profile similar to DryVax vaccination

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of global gene expression changes in na√Øve subjects in response to smallpox vaccination with either DryVax or the replication-competent, attenuated LC16m8 vaccinia virus.

DESIGN
Subjects were vaccinated with either DryVax or LC16m8 (5 from each group), and blood samples were taken at days 0, 3, 7, 10, 13, and 21 post-vaccination.  PBMCs were isolated from the samples, and were then further separated into cell subpopulations using positive selection against CD markers (CD4+, CD20+).  There are a total of 142 samples analyzed in this dataset.
