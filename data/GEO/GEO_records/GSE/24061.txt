TITLE
MAQC-II Project: Hamner data set

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The Hamner data set (endpoint A) was provided by The Hamner Institutes for Health Sciences (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). The study objective was to apply microarray gene expression data from the lung of female B6C3F1 mice exposed to a 13-week treatment of chemicals to predict increased lung tumor incidence in the 2-year rodent cancer bioassays of the National Toxicology Program. If successful, the results may form the basis of a more efficient and economical approach for evaluating the carcinogenic activity of chemicals. Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays on three to four mice per treatment group, and a total of 70 mice were analyzed and used as the MAQC-II's training set (GEO Series GSE6116). Additional data from another set of 88 mice were collected later and provided as the MAQC-II's external validation set (this Series). The training dataset had already been deposited in GEO by its provider and its accession number is GSE6116.
