TITLE
Cell-autonomous function of LSH ATPase in de novo DNA methylation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: We aimed to determine whether the expression of either wild-type or catalytically inactive LSH, carrying a single point mutation in its ATP binding site (K237Q), could restore the levels and patterns of DNA methylation in Lsh-/-  mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Methods: Lsh-/- MEFs were transduced with lentiviral particles carrying empty pMSCV vector, pMSCV-LSH-3xFLAG and pMSCV-LSH K/Q-3xFLAG, respectively. Clonal cell lines were generated and tested for LSH expression. Two independent cell lines expressing wild-type LSH and two expressing LSH K/Q were used for further analyses and comparison with wild-type MEFs and Lsh-/- MEFs carrying the empty vector. Genomic DNA was purified from all six cell lines and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) was performed as described in Weber et al., 2007, Nat Genetics. MeDIP libraries were generated and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument. Results and conclusions: Our experiments demonstrate that the expression of wild-type LSH, but not the catalytically inactive LSH K/Q, in Lsh-/- MEFs leads to reestablishment of DNA methylation at repetitive sequences and unique developmentally regulated loci in a cell-autonomous manner.

DESIGN
