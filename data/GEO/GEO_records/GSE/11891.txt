TITLE
Expression data from mouse aorta-gonad-mesonephros(AGM) derived stromal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A mouse AGM-derived cell line, AGM-s3, was shown to support the development of hematopoietic stem cells. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating early hematopoiesis, we obtained subclones from AGM-s3, some of which were hematopoiesis supportive (s3-A9) and others which were non-supportive (s3-A7), and we analyzed the gene expression profiles by gene chip analysis. Keywords: cell type comparison
