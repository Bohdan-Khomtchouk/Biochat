TITLE
Expression data from mouse aorta-gonad-mesonephros(AGM) derived stromal cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A mouse AGM-derived cell line, AGM-s3, was shown to support the development of hematopoietic stem cells. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating early hematopoiesis, we obtained subclones from AGM-s3, some of which were hematopoiesis supportive (s3-A9) and others which were non-supportive (s3-A7), and we analyzed the gene expression profiles by gene chip analysis. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Genome-wide gene expression was examined using Affymetrix GeneChip array. Assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was isolated from each stromal cell lines. We analysed 3 cell lines, AGM-s3-A9, AGM-s3-A7 and OP9. AGM-s3-A9 and OP9 are hematopoiesis supportive cell lines. AGM-s3-A7 is a hematopoiesis non-supportive cell line.
