TITLE
Gene expression profiles in skin biopsies of Red Deer Cervus elaphus experimentally infected with Bluetongue virus

ORGANISM
Cervus elaphus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study is to determine differential gene expression on skin biopsies of experimentally BTV-infected hinds (Cervus elaphus) using serotypes 1 and 8 to understand the possible role that these genes play during BTV infection.  Understanding the strategies used by this virus for their cellular uptake, and detection of differentially expressed transcripts in experimentally infected hosts, can provide identification of detailed information that might be used to prevent infection.

DESIGN
Four seven-month-old red deer Cervus elaphus were kept in a P3 facility to be experimentally infected with Bluetongue virus, and 4 more red deer were kept as controls. Skin biopsies were taken at 14 days post-infection to determine gene expression in response to this virus.
