TITLE
Neuroinflammation in Advanced Canine Glaucoma

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Dogs frequently develop glaucoma, a disease that leads to vision loss due to loss of retinal ganglion cells and degeneration of axons within the optic nerve.  We used Affymetrix Gene chips to characterize transcriptional changes between healthy and glaucomatous retinas.

DESIGN
These data describe gene expression changes in the canine retina with glaucoma. RNA was isolated from the retinas of 5 dogs with advanced glaucoma and from 5 normal individuals.
