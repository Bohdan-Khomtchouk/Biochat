TITLE
Gene expression profile analysis of HepG2 cells upon PSTAR or hnRNP K knockdown

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We discovered  lncRNA PSTAR as a novel hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - associated lncRNA, which could interact with hnRNP K protein. To explore the function of PSTAR in HCC and underlying molecular mechanism, we examined the global gene expression change in HepG2 cells with PSTAR knockdown. The gene expression profile of HepG2 with hnRNP K knockdown was also analyzed to investigate the correlationship between PSTAR and hnRNP K. Further, doxorubicin (DOX) was applied to induce DNA damage, and the effect of PSTAR and hnRNP K under DNA damage was also investigated.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells transfected with si-PSTAR, si-hnRNP K or si-scramble RNAs were treated with 400 nM DOX for sixteen hours, and then, the total RNA was extracted from above cells
