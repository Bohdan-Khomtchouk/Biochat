TITLE
Gene expression data from longissimus dorsi muscle 25-day-old male pigs

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
To explore the difference in gene expression in the Yorshire and Shaziling pig, and could contribute to further studies on porcine myogenesis and adipogenesis, we studied the mRNA expression profile using microarray technique. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and identified the difference between the two pig breeds during this process.

DESIGN
These pigs were selected at the early stage for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays,were Yorshire and Shaziling pig, each breed has three replicates.
