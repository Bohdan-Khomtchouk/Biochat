TITLE
AtWRKY1 regulates light and nitrogen signalling pathways

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
When light and exogenous nitrogen levels are limiting, the AtWRKY1 transcription factor mediates regulatory crosstalk between nitrogen and light signaling pathways in an energy conservation mechanism. Transcriptome experiments were performed for WT and wrky1 mutant lines under no treatment; N treatment; light treatment; or combination treatment.

DESIGN
14 samples consisting of three replicates, 2 samples consisting of 2 replicates. WT (Col-0) and wrky1 mutant lines: steady treatment is on full MS media under long day; N treatment (KCl control or KNO3 + NH4NO3 treatment); light treatment (normal light control or dark treatment); combination treatment is N and light.
