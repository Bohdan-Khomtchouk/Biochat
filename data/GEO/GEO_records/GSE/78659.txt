TITLE
polyA mRNA RNA-seq from NCI-H460 (ENCSR586SEE)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from cytoplasmic fractions of immortalized cell line NCI-H460 derived from a large cell lung carcinoma of a 37 year old male.  They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq RNA-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Poly-A+ RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
