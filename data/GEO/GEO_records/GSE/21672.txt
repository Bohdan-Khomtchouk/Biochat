TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array for CSES1, CSES8, CSES1 maternal, and CSES8 maternal

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
These SNP arrays were used to genotype hESCs and their corresponding matenal sample. Expression analysis of some of the SNPs located on the X chromosome was used to identify the pattern of X Chromosome inactivation in these human embryonic stem cells

DESIGN
Affymetrix 250k Sty SNP arrays were used to genotype CSES1 and CSES8 embryonic stem cell lines and CSES1 maternal and CSES8 maternal DNA
