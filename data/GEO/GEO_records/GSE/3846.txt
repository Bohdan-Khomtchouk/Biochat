TITLE
Influence of beverages on blood gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to measure the influence of beverages on blood gene expression. We wanted to explore the underlying mechanisms of the cardioprotective effects of red wine. Keywords: Treatment effect

DESIGN
Six healthy volunteers participated in this randomized controlled cross-over experiment. On 4 independent days they had 4 different beverages (500mL each: grape juice, red wine, 40g diluted ethanol, water). Blood samples were taken at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 12 hours after the drink together with standardized nutrition. RNA of 120 PBL samples was hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. Three sources of variations were examined: individual, time and beverage.
