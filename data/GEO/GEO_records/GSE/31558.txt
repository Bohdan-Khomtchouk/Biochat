TITLE
Distinct p53 Genomic Binding Patterns in Normal and Cancer-derived Human Cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report here genome-wide analysis of the tumor suppressor p53 binding sites in normal human cells. 743 high-confidence ChIP-seq peaks representing putative genomic binding sites were identified in normal IMR90 fibroblasts using a reference chromatin sample. More than 40 % were located within 2 kb of a transcription start site (TSS), a distribution similar to that documented for individually studied functional p53 binding sites and to date not observed by previous genome-wide studies. Nearly half of the high-confidence binding sites in the IMR90 cells reside in CpG islands, in marked contrast to sites reported in cancer-derived cells. The distinct genomic features of the IMR90 binding sites do not reflect a distinct preference for specific sequences, since the de novo developed p53 motif based on our study is similar to those reported by genome-wide studies of cancer cells. More likely the different chromatin landscape in normal compared to cancer-derived cells influences p53 binding via modulating availability of the sites. We compared the IMR90 ChIP-seq peaks to the recently published IMR90 methylome1, and demonstrated that they are enriched at hypomethylated DNA. Our study represents the first genome-wide, de novo mapping of p53 binding sites in normal human cells and reveals that p53 binding sites reside in distinct genomic landscapes in normal and cancer-derived human cells.
