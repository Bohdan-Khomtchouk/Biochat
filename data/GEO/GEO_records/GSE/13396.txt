TITLE
Rhinovirus-induced modulation of gene expression in bronchial epithelial cells from subjects with asthma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human Rhinovirus (HRV) infection can trigger exacerbations of asthma. Understanding of the mechanisms provoking airway inflammation and remodeling in asthma, as well as the pathogenic mechanisms of HRV infection and its association with asthma exacerbations, may offer significant opportunities for improved disease management. Genome-wide expression analysis of HRV type 1A-infected primary bronchial epithelial (PBE) cells from normal and asthmatic donors was performed to determine whether asthma is associated with a unique pattern of gene expression after HRV infection in vitro. Keywords: response to rhinovirus infection
