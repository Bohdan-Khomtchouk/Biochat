TITLE
Diurnal and circadian gene expression profile of root throughout the entire growth of rice in the field

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
A continuous gene expression profiling of roots was performed at regular interval during a 48-hr period in 2 different growth stages to characterize the diurnal and circadian gene expression profile of rice growth under natural field conditions.

DESIGN
Root was collected at 2-hr intervals during a 48-hr period at 2 different growth stages corresponding to early and late vegetative stages.  All samples were obtained from rice plants grown in the field during the 2008 cultivation season.
