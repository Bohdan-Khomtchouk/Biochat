TITLE
Diurnal and circadian gene expression profile of root throughout the entire growth of rice in the field

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
A continuous gene expression profiling of roots was performed at regular interval during a 48-hr period in 2 different growth stages to characterize the diurnal and circadian gene expression profile of rice growth under natural field conditions.
