TITLE
Gene expression profiling of tumor cells and M2 macrophages from WT mice and mice with deletion of integrin beta3 in macrophage lineage cells (b3KOM)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand the impact of integrin beta3 signaling in myeloid cells on the tumor microenvironment, we compared the gene expression profiles of FACS isolated GFP+ PyMT-BO1 MFP tumor cells and also M2 TAMs (CD11b+Gr1-F4/80+CD206+) from tumor tissue of WT mice and b3ΚΟΜ mice.

DESIGN
PyMT-BO1-GFP-Luc tumor cells (100,000) were injected into mammary fat pad (MFP) tissue from WT and b3KOM mice. PyMT-BO1-GFP-Luc cells and CD206hi tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were FACS-sorted from day 10 MFP tumor tissue. FACS-sorted cells directly used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
