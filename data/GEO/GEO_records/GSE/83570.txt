TITLE
LMO2 expression in HSCs causes T-ALL in the presence of an intact thymic niche [preleukemic and leukemic cells]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in tumor-bearing Sca1-TOMATO-Lmo2 mice and in preleukemic cells from Sca1-TOMATO-Lmo2 mice.

DESIGN
Tumor-bearing thymus of eleven Sca1-TOMATO-Lmo2 mice compared with thymus cells from  4 WT mice, with TOMATO-positive thymus preleukemic T cells from 5  Sca1-TOMATO-Lmo2 mice and with TOMATO-negative  thymus preleukemic T cells from 5 Sca1-TOMATO-Lmo2 mice GSM2209749 - GSM220975 and GSM2209757 - GSM2209759 were re-analyzed by GSE83571 (GSM2209767 - GSM2209776).

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
