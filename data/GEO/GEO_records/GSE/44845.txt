TITLE
Comparison of vineyard, enological and laboratory yeast transcriptomes at different steps of the fermentation curve

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Here we report the massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis performed using high throughput sequencing of four vineyard yeast strains collected from the vineyards of the “Prosecco di Conegliano-Valdobbiadene” (P283 and P301 strains) and Piave AO (Appellation of origin) (R008 and R103 strains) regions in North East of Italy. Results were compared with RNA-seq performed on a commercial yeast strain (EC1118) and a laboratory strain (S288c). Yeast cells were collected at two different steps of the fermentation curve: at the beginning of the process, when the CO2 produced by the cells was 6 g/l (middle exponential growth phase), and in the middle of fermentation, at 45 g/l (early stationary phase). Three biological replicates of the fermentations were performed for each strain and samples for RNA-seq were gathered at the beginning of the process. The aim of this experiment was the comparison of the transcriptomes of the six yeast strains to identify the genes characterizing wild type yeast isolates, " commercial " and laboratory strains.

DESIGN
Twelve samples were analyzed: S288c strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced), S288c strain in the middle of fermentation (45 g/l CO2 produced), EC1118 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced), EC1118 strain in the middle of fermentation (45 g/l CO2 produced), P283 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced), P283 strain in the middle of fermentation (45 g/l CO2 produced), R008 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced), R008 strain in the middle of fermentation (45 g/l CO2 produced), R103 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced), R103 strain in the middle of fermentation (45 g/l CO2 produced), P301 strain at middle exponential growth phase (6 g/l CO2 produced), P301 strain in the middle of fermentation (45 g/l CO2 produced).
