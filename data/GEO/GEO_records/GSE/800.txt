TITLE
HCT116-Clone2 cells 6 hours after XR treatment at 4 Gy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cDNA microarray study of X-radiation (XR) resistant HCT116-Clone2 cells 6 hours after XR treatment at 4Gy versus unirradiated HCT116-Clone10 cells. HCT116-Clone10 cells have similar XR response with parental HCT116 cells. Keywords = X-radiation (XR) Keywords = XR resistant Keywords = colorectal cancer cells Keywords = HCT116 Keywords: repeat sample
