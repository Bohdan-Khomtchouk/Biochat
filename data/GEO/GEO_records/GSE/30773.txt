TITLE
Ctnnb1-targeted genes in mouse post-meiotic germ cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To determine differential gene expression in Ctnnb1 CKO mice testis compared to CTRL mice testis.

DESIGN
The Agilent Mouse Whole Genome 4x44K array (Samples are from pooled total testes RNA from 4 CTRL and 4 Ctnnb1 CKO mice; dye-swap was performed.)
