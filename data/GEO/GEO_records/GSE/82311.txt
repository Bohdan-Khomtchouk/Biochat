TITLE
Effect of Hsp70 inhibitor JG-98 on gene expression in mouse macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
JG-98 reduces migration of macrophages. We assessed how this compound affects expression of genes associated with motility and migration. A number of motility/migration genes were significantly downregulated.

DESIGN
Mouse bone marrow macrophages were treated with 0.3 micromole of JG-98 for 16 hours, and RNA was isolated.
