TITLE
Peripheral blood transcriptome profiles from an RNA Pilot Study within the United States Health and Retirement Study (HRS)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Individual differences in peripheral blood transcriptomes in older adults as a function of demographic, socio-economic, psychological, and health history characteristics.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was carried out on peripheral blood RNA samples collected from 121 community dwelling older adults participating in the United States Health and Retirement Study.  In addition to basic demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), participants were also assessed on health-related characteristics (body mass index/BMI; history of smoking or heavy alcohol consumption; history of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, stroke), household annual income (log transformed), and measures of loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale; Russell D, Peplau LA, Cutrona CE: The revised UCLA Loneliness Scale: concurrent and discriminant validity evidence. J Pers Soc Psychol 1980, 39:472-480; higher values indicate greater loneliness) and purpose in life (PWB_Purpose; Purpose scale of the Ryff Scales of Psychological Well-being; Ryff CD (1989) Happiness is everything, or is it?  Explorations on the meaning of psychological well-being. J. Pers Soc. Psychol 57: 1069-1081; higher values indicate greater experience of purpose in life).  Additional analyses examined measures of optimism and pessimism (6 items from the Life Orientation Test; Scheier MF Carver CS Bridges MW (1994) Distinguishing optimism from neuroticism (and trait anxiety, self-mastery, and self-esteem): A reevaluation of the Life Orientation Test. J Pers Soc Psychol 67:1063-1078; higher values indicating greater optimism or pessimism), anxiety symptoms (5 items from Beck Anxiety Inventory; Beck AT et al (1988) An inventory for measuring clinical anxiety: Psychometric properties. J Consult Clin Psychol 56:893-897; higher values indicating greater anxietn), depressive symptoms (CESD; Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; Radloff LS (1977) The CES-D scale:  A self-report depression scale for research in the general population. Applied Psychol Meas 1:386-401; higher values indicating greater depression), life satisfaction (Diener E et al (1985) The Satisfaction With Life Scale. J Pers Assess 49:71-75; higher values indicate greater life satisfaction), and positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA; Watson D et al (1988) Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect:  The PANAS scales. J Pers Soc Psychol 54:1063-1070; higher values indicate greater positive or negative affect). Binary characteristics are coded yes=1 and no=0.
