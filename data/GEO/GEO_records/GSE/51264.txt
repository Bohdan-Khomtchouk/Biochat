ORGANISM
Macaca mulatta ; Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
78 tissue samples from prefrontal cortex (PFC) in human and macaque

DESIGN
The data from human and macaque PFC samples with different ages were used to estimate gene expression changes, including both protein-coding genes and lincRNAs, in PFC along lifespan in the two species.
