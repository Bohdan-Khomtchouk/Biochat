TITLE
Comparative intraindividual transcriptome analysis of B-precursor ALL of childhood

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of this study was the assessment of transcriptional dysregulation in particular with regard to B-cell differentiation factors. Most studies focus on cross-section analyses of various leukemia subtypes to identify differentially regulated genes lacking suitable reference models. Here we applied comparative intraindividual transcriptome analysis of B-precursor ALL of childhood, which introduces a side-by-side analysis of leukemic cells and matched normal lymphoblasts from the same individual in complete continuous remission after the end of re-induction therapy. This approach reduces noise by eliminating interindividual variability.

DESIGN
Comparative matched pair analysis of (single sorted) initial leukemia and single sorted lymphoblasts isolated from the same individual, n=4 pairs, reference samples are the single sorted normal lymphoblasts. Please note that there are sorted samples form only three of the patients. Due to experimental circumstances, a " sorted " sample from the last patient was not included.
