TITLE
Conserved nutrient sensor O-GlcNAc transferase is integral to the C. elegans pathogen-specific immune response

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Discriminating pathogenic bacteria from energy-harvesting commensals is key to host immunity. Using mutants defective in the enzymes of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) cycling, we examined the role of this nutrient-sensing pathway in the Caenorhabidits elegans innate immune response. Using whole genome transcriptional profiling, O-GlcNAc cycling mutants exhibited deregulation of unique stress- and immune-responsive genes as well as genes shared with the p38 MAPK/PMK-1 pathway.  Moreover, genetic analysis showed that deletion of O-GlcNAc transferase (ogt-1) yielded animals hypersensitive to the human pathogen S. aureus but not to P. aeruginosa. Genetic interaction studies further revealed that nutrient-responsive OGT-1 acts through the conserved ÃŸ-catenin (BAR-1) pathway and in concert with p38 MAPK/PMK-1 to modulate the immune response to S. aureus.  The participation of the nutrient sensor O-GlcNAc transferase in an immunity module conserved from C. elegans to humans reveals an unexplored nexus between nutrient availability and a pathogen-specific immune response.

DESIGN
In C. elegans, three mutant strains(genotypes used: N2 (wild-type), ogt-1 (ok1474), oga-1 (ok1207), and pmk-1 (km25)) were treated with the human pathogen S. aureus (SA) or  P. aeruginosa(PA) and OP50 (E. coli control) with three biological replications.
