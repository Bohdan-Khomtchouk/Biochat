TITLE
RNA-Sequencing of human papillary thyroid carcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA-Sequencing analysis of 18 papillary thyroid carcinoma biopsies and of 4 healthy donors' thyroids. In this analysis we assessed differential gene expression and investigated the mutational landscape in this tumor type. Analysis of gene fusion was also performed, leading to the identification of a novel chimeric transcript, potential driver in tumor initiation.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from 18 papillary thyroid carcinoma biopsies and 4 healthy donors' thyroids.
