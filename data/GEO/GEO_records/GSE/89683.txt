TITLE
Dynamic changes in chromatin states during specification and differentiation of adult intestinal stem cells [rnaseq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To follow the changes in the transcriptional programs accompanying the specification, maintenance and differentiation of the adult ISCs we sequenced whole transcriptomes of embryonic intestinal epithelium progenitors (at E12.5 and E14.5), adult ISCs and their differentiated progenies, the majority of which are absorptive enterocytes. EpCAM positive embryonic gut epithelium was isolated from dissected small intestines using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Adult ISCs were purified on the basis of GFP fluorescence from crypts of Lgr5GFP-Cre-ERT mice (Barker et al. 2007), whereas enterocytes (EpCAM+ CD45- CD31-) were isolated from villi.

DESIGN
Intestinal epithelial cells from two embryonic stages (E12.5 and E14.5), adult Lgr5+ ISCs and enterocytes were used. For each stage biological triplicates were analyzed.
