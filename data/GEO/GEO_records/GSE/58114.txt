TITLE
Gene expression profiles of blood vascular endothelial cells (BECs) in response to larminar shear flow [RNA-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of a genome-wide gene expression change in primary human neonatal dermal BECs when subjected to laminar flow-induced shear stress

DESIGN
Primary human neonatal dermal BECs were subjected to low level laminar flow (2 Dyne/cm2) -induced shear stress for 12 hours. Total RNA were isolated from these cells as well as from the equivalent cells cultured under the static condition as a control.
