TITLE
Genome-wide identification of HIF-1 and HIF-2 binding sites in hypoxic human macrophages alternatively activated by IL-10

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Primary human macrophages with a HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha knockdown were pretreated with IL-10 for 16h and afterwards for 4h additionaly under hypoxi (1% O2), RNA was isolated usind the Qiagen RNAeasy Kit and cDNA synthesis wos done using  Ambion WT Expression Kit. Expression was compared to si control under control conditions.

DESIGN
Samples from 3 donors treated with si control, si HIF-1α or si HIF-2α were compared with each other
