TITLE
Gene expression analysis of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells after RNAi-mediated depletion of the insulator factor CP190

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We analyzed transcriptional effects after depletion of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells from CP190 via specific dsRNA treatment in comparison to cells treated with control dsRNA.

DESIGN
Drosohila melanogaster S2 cells were treated with either CP190-specific dsRNA or control dsRNA corresponding to the firefly luciferase gene. Four independent replicates were performed.
