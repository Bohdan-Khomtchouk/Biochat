TITLE
cDNA Microarray Analysis of Soybean NILs under Fe Sufficient Hydroponic Conditions

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to identify any genes differentially expressed between the Soybean Near Isogenic Lines iron efficient Clark and iron inefficient IsoClark under iron sufficient hydroponic conditions.  These genes would represent constituative genetic differences between the NILs. Keywords: Near Isogenic Line Comparison of Unstressed Soybean Plants

DESIGN
This experiment consists of three biological replicates each with two technical replicates (dye swaps) for a total of six hybridizations.  Arrays 195 and 196 are dye swap technical replicates of biological replicate 1, arrays 197 and 198 are dye swap technical replicates of biological replicate 2, and arrays 199 and 200 are dye swap technical replicates of biological replicate 3.
