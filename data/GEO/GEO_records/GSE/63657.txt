TITLE
Expression data from Rhesus macaques (Macaca fuscata) brain

ORGANISM
Macaca fuscata

SUMMARY
Japanese macaques learn to use rakes to acquire food, and this learning is associated with rapid electrophysiological and morphological changes in the brain. To examine the molecular mechanisms of these plastic changes, we performed comprehensive gene expression analysis with a cDNA microarray and identified many candidate genes.

DESIGN
We compared gene expressions between experimental  (Rhesus_E) and control (Rhesus_C) animals from Surrounding areas of the lateral sulcus. We also compared gene expressions between experimental  (IPS_E) and control (IPS_C) animals from Surrounding areas of the Intraparietal sulcus.
