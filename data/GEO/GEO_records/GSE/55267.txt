TITLE
Gene expression Profiling in Follicular Lymphomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent, but incurable subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These tumor harbor t (14;18) translocation in at least 90% of patients. Recently, activating EZH2 mutations have been Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent, but incurable subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These tumor harbor t (14;18) translocation in at least 90% of patients. Recently, activating EZH2 mutations have been found in a significant number of patients with FL. Gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed to determine differential gene-expression between the EZH2 mutated vs unmutated subgroups in FL.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from fresh frozen specimens with FL diagnosis were processed for hybridization to Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2 arrays. To enhance the identification of differential gene expression in FL tumor cells only, FL cases with a high B-cell content (enriched B-cell signature of > 2-fold above the mean of the B-cell signature (pan B-cell markers) in the entire FL data set) were chosen for analysis.
