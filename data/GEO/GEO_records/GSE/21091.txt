TITLE
SNP data from Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases and controls

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
SNP profiling can reveal copy number abnormalities and loss of heterozygosity associated with distinct biologic subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We performed SNP profiling of Down syndrome ALL cases and controls to identify unique biologic features of this ALL subgroup.

DESIGN
Ficoll-enriched, cryopreserved bone marrow aspirate samples were obtained from patients with B-precursor ALL at diagnosis and in remission; and from control patients without leukemia.
