ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This series of microarray data contain transcript intensity of mpkCCD cells.

DESIGN
The mpkCCDc14 cells were cloned into colonies with varying aquaporin 2 (AQP2) expression levels in the presence of vasopressin analogy dDAVP.  Transcript profiling was done for the original cells and cell clones 2, 3, 9, 10, and 11.  By studying transcripts that correlate with AQP2 mRNA levels among cell clones, the objective was to identify transcripts responsible for cell-specific expression of AQP2.
