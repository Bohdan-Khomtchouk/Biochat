TITLE
Expression data from cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) and rho0 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mitochondria have been implicated in insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction, both of which comprise the core pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It has also recently been found that mtDNA haplogroups are distinctively associated with susceptibility to T2DM at least in Koreans and Japanese. To investigate the functional consequences of different mtDNA, we compared gene expression profiles between cybrid clones harboring three different mtDNA haplogroups (D5, F, and N9a). To produce hybrid clones, we fused mtDNA-depleted osteosarcoma cell line (143B TK- rho0) with nucleus-lacking platelets from twelve donors harboring the three haplogroups.

DESIGN
A total of twelve cybrid clones from the three mtDNA haplogroups were obtained: D5 (n=3), F (n=5), and N9a (n=4). For each clone, four technical replicates were obtained and hybridized to the array. For rho0 cell, six technical replicates were obtained and hybridized to the array.
