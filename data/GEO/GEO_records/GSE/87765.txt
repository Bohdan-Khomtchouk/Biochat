TITLE
Expression data from precancerous mouse liver under PI3K signaling activation with or without Kdm3a defficiency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epigenetic gene regulation in various oncogenic pathways is currently an important focus of cancer research. The PI3K pathway plays a pivotal role in hepatocellular carcinoma, but the significance of histone modification in the PI3K pathway-dependent hepatotumorigenesis remains unknown. We used microarrays to investigate the oncogenic gene regulation by histone demethylase Kdm3a under PI3K signaling activation in the liver.

DESIGN
We investigate the role of a histone demethylase KDM3A in liver tumor development by crossing the hepatocyte-specific Pik3ca transgenic mice and the Kdm3a knockout mice. We obtained the material specimen from precancerous liver tissue and analyze it.
