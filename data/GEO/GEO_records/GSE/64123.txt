TITLE
Human embryonic stem cell based neuro-developmental toxicity assay: response to valproic acid and carbamazepine exposure

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we studied the effects of anticonvulsant drug exposure in a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) based neuro- developmental toxicity test (hESTn). During neural differentiation the cells were exposed, for either 1 or 7 days, to non-cytotoxic concentration ranges of valproic acid (VPA) or carbamazepine (CBZ), anti-epileptic drugs known to cause neurodevelopmental toxicity.

DESIGN
93 samples (multiple time points, multiple exposures, multiple concentrations, multiple replicates)
