TITLE
CIC and ATXN1L knockout gene expression data [NHA]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CIC has recently been implicated as a negative prognostic factor in multiple cancers. CIC and ATXN1L have been reported as interactors in several cellular contexts including development and disease state. To investigate the relationship between CIC and ATXN1L on a transcriptomic level, CIC-KO and ATXN1L-KO cell lines were generated. Gene expression profiling of CIC-KO and ATXN1L-KO cell lines was performed by microarray and differentially expressed genes were compared. We found a high degree of overlap in differentially expressed genes in CIC-KO and ATXN1L-KO suggesting loss of either interacting partner to lead to similar transcriptomic changes.

DESIGN
The parental CIC/ATXN1L-WT NHA, two CIC-KO NHA derived (A2, H9) and one ATXN1L-KO NHA derived (B82) cell lines were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. Gene expression profiling was performed in 3 biological triplicates for each cell line.
