TITLE
Toxicogenomics and phenotypic characterization of adult female zebrafish liver treated with arsenic [As(V)]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We performed microarray-based expression profiling on liver of male zebrafish exposed to 15ppm (~ 192 ÂµM) of arsenic [As(V)] for 8-96 h, to identify global transcriptional programs and biological pathways involved in chloroaniline-induced adaptive responses under in vivo environment.

DESIGN
We analyzed 12 arrays of chloroaniline-treated adult female zebrafish liver and 12 arrays of control fish.
