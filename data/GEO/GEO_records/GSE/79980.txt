TITLE
LIN28B is overexpressed in specific subtypes of pediatric leukemia and regulates lncRNA H19 [K562]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The stem cell gene LIN28B was recently shown to be overexpressed in a foetal-like subgroup of juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia. Given the involvement of LIN28B in a variety of solid paediatric cancers, we conducted a meta-analysis of LIN28B levels using publicly available gene expression data of 1361 paediatric leukaemia samples. Interestingly, this analysis revealed LIN28B overexpression in 102 childhood leukaemia patients (7.5%), suggesting oncogenic activity for LIN28B in the context of paediatric haematological diseases. As the mode of action of LIN28B during normal and malignant haematopoiesis remains largely unexplored, we subsequently analysed the transcriptional consequences of LIN28B modulation on normal and malignant haematopoietic cells and identified the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 as the first LIN28B-regulated lncRNA.

DESIGN
K562 cells were retrovirally transduced with shRNA GN36578 against LIN28B and a shRNA-miR non-targeting control TRH1103 (both Transomic), selected with puromycin and hybridized on Agilent microarray.
