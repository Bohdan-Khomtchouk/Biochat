SUMMARY
HistoneÂ modifications play critical roles in regulating developmental genes expression during embryo development in mammals1,2. However, genome-wide analysis of histone modifications in pre-implantation embryos has been impeded by technical difficulties and the scarcity of required materials. Here, by using a small-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) method3, for the first time, we mapped the genome-wide profile of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), associated with gene activation and repression respectively, in mouse pre-implantation embryos. We found that the establishment of H3K4me3 mark occurs much more rapidly than that of H3K27me3 following fertilization. Furthermore, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 possess distinct features in sequence preference and dynamics in pre-implantation embryos. Although most H3K4me3 signature constantly exists on transcription start site (TSS) region, the breadth of H3K4me3 domain is of high-dynamic feature. Interestingly, the broad H3K4me3 peak (wider than 5kb) is associated with higher transcription activity and cell identity not only in pre-implantation embryos but also in the process of deriving embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) from the trophectoderm (TE). Unlike those observed in ESCs, we found that the bivalency (containing both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) is unstable and not frequently observed in early cleavage stage embryos until the morula to blastocyst transition. Taken all together, our study provides a genome-wide map of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications in pre-implantation embryos, which offers us opportunities to further understand the epigenetic regulation mechanism in early embryo development.

DESIGN
We mapped the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications on embryos from 2-cell stage to blastocyst stage (with separated ICM and TE). The mouse metaphase II (MII) oocytes, as well as mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and mouse trophoblast stem cells (mTSCs) were also analyzed. In the ChIP-seq analysis on pre-implantation embryos, 500 cells were used for per reaction and two or three replicates were performed for each stage.
