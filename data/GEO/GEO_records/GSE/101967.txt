TITLE
DNA bisulfite sequencing of Invader 4 LTRs in Drosophila

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
It has been claimed previously that loss of (cytosine-5) DNA methylation in Dnmt2 mutant embryos affected the establishment of silent chromatin at Invader4 LTRs (Phalke et al., 2009). The inability of Dnmt2 mutants to control TE expression after heat shock (GSE40432) raised the possibility that DNA methylation could be required for control of Invader 4 during the heat shock response. We used DNA bisulfite sequencing at Inv4 LTRs that were previously suggested to be methylated (Phalke et al., 2009).

DESIGN
8 samples examined: genomic DNA from wild type controls and Dnmt2 mutant adult flies under standard, heat shock and recovery conditions

PLATFORM
GPL23840 454 GS Junior (Drosophila melanogaster)
