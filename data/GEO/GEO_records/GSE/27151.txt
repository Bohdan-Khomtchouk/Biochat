TITLE
Expression data from Tregs purified from WT-CD3KO or IIKO-CD3KO chimeras

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Disruption of TCR /MHC class II interactions leads rapidly to alterations of the common CD4 Treg transcriptional signature Self-deprived, non-functional Tregs were compare to fully functional Tregs by microarrays.

DESIGN
CD3Îµ-/- mice were lethally irradiated and their immune system reconstituted with WT mouse (WT-CD3KO chimeras) or IIKO mouse (IIKO-CD3KO) Bone Marrow cells. Twenty eight days later, peripheral Tregs from these chimeras were purified for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
