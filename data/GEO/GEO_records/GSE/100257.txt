TITLE
ChIP-seq for histone modifications during MCF10A-ER-Src cell transformation

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
We performed ChIP-seq for histone modifications to map chromatin status and dynamics during MCF10A-ER-Src cell transformation.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K36me3, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 at 0, 2, 12, 24 and 36 hr during MCF10A-ER-Src cell transformation

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
