TITLE
Arabidopsis protoplasts : TMV*rep vs. TMV*CP.MP transfected

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis in response to infection with TMV in the initial infection stage (0.5, 4 and 6 hours post inoculation). Analyze the relative transcriptome change of TMV*CP.MP- and TMV*rep-inoculated samples.

DESIGN
TMV*rep vs. TMV*CP.MP transfected cells. 2 biological replicates conducted at each time (0.5, 4 and 6 hours post inoculation)

PLATFORM
GPL16816 AFGC 15K cDNA array
