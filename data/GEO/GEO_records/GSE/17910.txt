TITLE
In vitro differentiation of P19CL6 cardiogenic embryonic carcinoma cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pluripotent P19CL6 embryonic carcinoma cells can be differentiated to a cardiac lineage by culture in the presence of DMSO. The goal of this study was to characterize temporal gene expression patterns associated with cardiogenic differentiation. Gene expression analysis was conducted on differentiating P19CL6 cells at several time points following induction with 1% DMSO. Samples were processed for analysis by Affymetrix GeneChip.

DESIGN
Analysis was done on P19CL6 cells growing in the absence of DMSO or in the presence of DMSO for 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 days. Three independent samples (n=3) were used for all conditions except for 6-day and 12-day DMSO cultures (n=2).
