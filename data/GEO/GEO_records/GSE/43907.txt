TITLE
Identification of p130Cas/ErbB2 dependent invasive signatures in transformed mammary epithelial cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding transcriptional changes during cancer progression is of crucial importance to develop new and more efficacious diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. It is well known that ErbB2 is over-expressed in about 25% of human invasive breast cancers. We have previously demonstrated that p130Cas over-expression synergizes with ErbB2 in mammary cell transformation and promotes ErbB2-dependent invasion in three-dimensional (3D) cultures of human mammary epithelial cells.  Here, by comparing coding and non-coding gene expression profiling, we define the invasive signatures associated with concomitant p130Cas over-expression and ErbB2 activation in 3D cultures of mammary epithelial cells. Specifically, we have found that genes involved in amminoacids synthesis (CBS and PHGDH), cell motility, migration (ITPKA, PRDM1), and angiogenesis (HEY1) are up-regulated while genes involved in the inflammatory response (SAA1, S100A7) are down-regulated. In parallel, we have shown that the expression of specific miRNAs is altered. Among these, mir-200b, miR-222, miR-221and miR-424 are up-regulated while miR-27a, miR-27b and miR-23b are down-regulated. Overall this study present, for the first time, gene expression changes underlying the invasive behaviour following p130Cas over-expression in an ErbB2 transformed mammary cell model.
