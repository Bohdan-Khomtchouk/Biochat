TITLE
Zebrafish embryos exposed to the model hedgehog pathway inhibitor cyclopamine, as well as to the potential hedghog pathway disrupters SANT-2 and GANT-61.

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is important for various developmental processes during embryogenesis and for homeostasis of adult tissue in vertebrates. Aberrant signaling results in severe birth defects and malignancies, respectively. The small molecules SANT-2 and GANT-61 were identified as potential Hh-pathway inhibitors in a reporter gene assay (Shh-light II cells). We aimed to analyze the effects of these compounds on the gene expression level in zebrafish embryos in comparison with the well known Hh-pathway inhibitor cyclopamine.

DESIGN
Zebrafish embryos were treated with Ethanol (0,1%) (control), 10 µM Cyclopamine (C), 10 µM SANT-2 (S), and 10 µM GANT-61 (G), for 24 h (0.5 - 24 hpf), respectively; all in 5 independent replicates with 100 zebrafish embryos per treatment. Total RNA was extracted and processed as recommended by Agilent. One color arrays were used and data is given as normalized log2 of the gprocessed signals.
