TITLE
Targeted interference of sin3a-tgif1 function by SID decoy treatment inhibits WNT signaling and invasion in triple negative breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Targeted interference of sin3a-tgif1 function by SID decoy treatment inhibits WNT signaling and invasion in triple negative breast cancer cells.  MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with scrambled SID control, 2.5µM SID peptide or untreated for 24h.

DESIGN
Sub-confluent cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with scrambled SID control, 2.5µM SID peptide or untreated for 24h. Experiments were performed as three independent replicates.
