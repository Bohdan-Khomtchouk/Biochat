TITLE
Epigenome analysis of adipose tissue DNA from MZ twins discordant for BMI

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of adipose tissue of MZ twins discordant and concordant for BMI. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip  was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 485,000 CpGs. Samples included 24 pairs discordant  and  11 pairs concordant for BMI.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 70 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.
