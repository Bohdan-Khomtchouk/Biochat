TITLE
Single cell transcriptome analysis of mouse thoracic sympathetic ganglia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We explore the heterogeneity of mouse thoracic ganglia demonstrating the presence of an unexpected variety of cell-types and identify specialized populations of nipple- and pilo-erector muscle neurons. These neurons extend axonal projections and are born amongst other neurons during embryogenesis, but remain unspecialized until target organogenesis occurs postnatally. Target innervation and cell-type specification is coordinated by an intricate acquisition of unique combinations of growth factor receptors and the initiation of expression of concomitant ligands by the nascent erector muscles.

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis of 298 single sympathetic neuronal cells from the mouse thoracic ganglion
