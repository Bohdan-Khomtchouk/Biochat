TITLE
Methylation signature of pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two iPSC clones (iKCL004 and iKCL011) were compared with parental human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts BJ (ATCC, CRL-2522) as a negative and hESC line KCL034 as a positive control Biological triplicates for each line were analyses for epigenome-wide methylation ( > 480,000 CpG sites) using Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip Kit (Illumina).

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA (500 ng/sample) from the 12 samples (3 biological replicates from 4 lines) were hybridized to the Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip Kit (Illumina)

PLATFORM
