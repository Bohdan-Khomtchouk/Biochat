TITLE
miRNA profiling in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we performed miRNA profiles analysis of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma compared to normal fallopian tube fimbria using microarray (Exiqon, Denmark) to evaluate  their potential role in the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyoma.

DESIGN
miRNA profiling analysis of the 10 samples including 5 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas and 5 normal fallopian tube fimbria.
