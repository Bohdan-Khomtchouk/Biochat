TITLE
Effect of sphingosine kinase 1 deletion on HER/neu-induced mammary tumor development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression of mouse mammary tumors with different SphK1 expressions. The hypothesis tested in this study is that SphK1 deletion in mice influence the cancer promoting/inhibiting genes.

DESIGN
MMTV-neu Tg and SphK1 KO mice wre intercrossed and tumors from MMTV-neu Tg mice with homozygous KO, heterozygous KO and wild-type SphK1 were analyzed. Please note that WT are SphK1 +/+  from the intercross and control MMTV-neu single Tg mice (SphK1+/+).
