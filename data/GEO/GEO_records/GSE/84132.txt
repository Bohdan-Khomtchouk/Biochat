TITLE
Sequencing data of Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside-Enhanced Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) of QKI-5 and QKI-6

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study was designed to look for the RNAs that directly bind with QKI

DESIGN
HA tagged QKI-5 and QKI-6 were overexpressed in QPP GSCs and were applied to PAR-CLIP protocol. RNAs were exacted and sent for sequencing with Illumina HiSeq2000 Sequencer.
