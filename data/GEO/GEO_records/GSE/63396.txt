TITLE
Expression profiling of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs in mouse Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNA and Long noncoding RNA profiles in the mouse abdominal aorta with AAA and without AAA.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, we mixed the five mouse abdominal aorta samples,five mouse abdominal aorta samples for mourse with AAA, and five mouse abdominal aorta samples for mouse with AAA treated by naringenin (NGN). We identified the genome-wide expression level of mRNAs and lncRNAs.
