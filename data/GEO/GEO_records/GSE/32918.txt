TITLE
Whole genome expression profiling based on paraffin embedded tissue can be used to classify diffuse large b-cell lymphoma and predict clinical outcome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling was carried out for RNA extracted from Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies for 172 patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) using the Illumina DASL platform.  Classification into GCB, ABC or Type-III subtypes was carried out revealing a significant relationship between subtype and survival.

DESIGN
A retrospective study of 172 patients, 140 treated with R-CHOP, 32 not treated with curative intent

PLATFORM
GPL8432 Illumina HumanRef-8 WG-DASL v3.0
