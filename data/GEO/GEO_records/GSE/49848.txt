TITLE
Genome-wide mapping of Klf4 and Klf5 in pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified the binding profile of Klf4 and Klf5, which are both transcription facyors involved in the maintenance of pluripotency of ESCs by inhibiting their differentiation either into endoderm or mesoderm respectively.

DESIGN
Undifferentiated mouse ESCs were used to identify Klf4 and Klf5 bidning sites
