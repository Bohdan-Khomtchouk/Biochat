TITLE
Genome-wide expression in the hippocampus of dab1 homozygous mutants in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression in the hippocampus was analyzed between Dab1 and wild type mice on the C57BL/6 and BALB/c mouse strains.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated hippocampus at postnatal day 19 was analysed for gene expression between C57BL6 and BALB/c wild type or dab1 mutant mice. Three samples from separate mice were analyzed from each genotype and strain.
