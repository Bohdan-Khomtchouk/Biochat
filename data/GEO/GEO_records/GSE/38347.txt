TITLE
Genome-wide cistromes of thyroid hormone receptors alpha and beta in C17.2 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tagged versions of thyroid hormone receptors alpha (TRa) and beta (TRb) were stably transfected in two C17.2 cell lines, C17.2a and C17.2b, respectively. We performed an affinity-based purification of chromatin (ChAP), and high-throughput sequencing was used to assess binding sites of both receptors (ChAP-Seq). Standard ChIP-Seq for RXR was also performed in C17.2a cells. These data allow us to compare binding sites for both receptors and to conclude that they were only partially redundant, with co-existence of receptor-specific sites.

DESIGN
Examination of binding sites of the two thyroid hormone receptors (alpha, beta) in two cell lines (C17.2a, C17.2b), each expressing one of the receptors. Examination of RXR binding sites in C17.2a cells.
