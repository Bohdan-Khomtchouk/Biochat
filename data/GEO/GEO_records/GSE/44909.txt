TITLE
Epigenome analysis of HCC samples with paired adjacent tissue

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of paired adjacent and hepatocellular samples and 8 non-diseased liver samples. The Illumina Infinium 27k Human DNA methylation Beadchip v1.2 was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across approximately 27,000 CpGs. Samples included 12 paired adjacent and 12 hepatocellular samples.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 24 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 27k Human Methylation Beadchip v1.2
