TITLE
Comparative expression analysis of the Arabidopsis strigolactone (SL)-response mutant, max2-3, and wild type (WT) plants (Col-0) under dehydration conditions.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand the role of SL-signaling components in water stress response, we have carried out comparative expression analysis of the SL-response max2-3 mutant and WT plants under dehydration and well-watered (control) conditions. Aligentâ€™s whole Arabidopsis Gene Expression Microarray (G2519F-021169, V4, 4x44K) was used.

DESIGN
Two-week-old WT and max2-3 mutant plants were transferred from GM plates to soil and grown for 10 additional day. The aerial parts of 24-d-old plants were detached and exposed to dehydration on KimTowel papers for 0 (well-watered, control), 2 and 4 h. All rosette leaves of independent 24-d-old plants were collected. Total RNA was prepared and used for the microarray hybridization. Three independent biological replicates were used for each plant sample.
