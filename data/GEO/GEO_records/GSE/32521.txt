TITLE
Toxicogenomic responses of C. elegans to gold nanoparticles

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We used Au nanoparticles (Au-NPs) as a model for studying particle specific effects of manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs) by examining the toxicogenomic responses in a model soil organism, free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Global genome expression for nematodes exposed to 4-nm citrate-coated Au-NPs at the LC10 (5.9 mg L-1) revealed significant differential expression of 797 genes. The levels of expression for five genes (apl-1, dyn-1, act-5, abu-11, and hsp-4) were confirmed independently with qRT-PCR.  Seven common biological pathways associated with 38 of these genes were identified.  Activation of 26 pqn/abu genes from noncanonical Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway and up-regulation of molecular chaperones (hsp-16.1, hsp-70, hsp-3 and hsp-4) were observed and are likely indicative of endoplasmic reticulum stress.  Inhibition of abu-11 with RNAi showed increase in mortality in Au-NP exposed nematodes suggesting possible involvement of abu-11 (a gene associated with specific to C. elegans UPR) in a protective mechanism against Au-NPs.  Exposure to Au-NPs also caused activation of genes involved in apoptosis and necrosis and resulted ultimately in 10% mortality.  These results demonstrate that Au-NPs are bioavailable and cause adverse effects to a model ecoreceptor which activate both general and specific biological pathways.

DESIGN
Age-synchronized L3 nematodes (about 2000 nematodes per replicate with 3 replicates per treatment) were exposed to LC10 (5.9 mgL-1 ) of 4-nm citrate-coated Au-NP using 6 cm petri-dishes with 4 ml of exposure solution per dish. The N2 nematodes at L3 stageused were used and they were exposed in 50% K-Medium (31.68 mM KCl, 51.37 mM NaCl) for 12h.  At 12 h all solutions were replaced with 50% K-Medium and left for another 12 h.  After 24 h RNA was extracted from each of the replicates .
