TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression by miR-204/211 in normal breast cell line MCF10A and breast cancer cell line MCF7

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression analysis of MCF-10A and MCF-7 where miR-204 and miR-211 are overexpressed.  The characteristics of differentially expressed genes in both cell lines derives the cells toward being oncogenic.

DESIGN
Total RNA is obtained from MCF-10A and 7 where miR-204/211 are overexpressed using lipofectamine RNAiMAX
