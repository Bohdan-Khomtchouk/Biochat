TITLE
Transcriptionfactor study during the zebrafish development

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We used a self-designed microarray to study the gene-expression of transcription factors in 5 different developmental stages and two tissue-samples

DESIGN
Three to 6 biological replicates were performed, labeled with two different colors
