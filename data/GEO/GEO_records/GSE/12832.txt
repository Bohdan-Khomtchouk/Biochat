TITLE
SAGE tags generated from Triticum aestivum cultivars Scorpion 25 and Xi19 grown under normal and hot/dry conditions

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
Triticum aestivum cultivars Scorpion 25 and Xi 19 were grown under both normal and hot/dry conditions.  We compared the effect of these two growth conditions on these two closely related varieties.

DESIGN
We sequenced two biological replicates each for both Scorpion 25 and Xi19 grown under normal conditions. One library for hot/dry growth conditions was sequenced for each of these two cultivars.
