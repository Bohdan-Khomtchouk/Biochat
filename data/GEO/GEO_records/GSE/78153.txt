TITLE
Expression data from peritoneal macrophages stimulated with lipid A

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Setdb1 is one of the H3K9 methyltransferases and represses gene expression by H3K9 methylation. In an attempt to elucidate the role of Setdb1 in the TLR4-mediated inflammatory responses, we performed DNA microarray analysis using lipid A (the active component of LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from macrophage specific Setdb1 KO (KO) and WT mice. The genes upregulated by lipid A treatment in WT macrophages and further increased in KO macrophages contain many genes associated with interleukins and chemokines.

DESIGN
Peritoneal macrophages from WT and KO mice were stimulated with lipid A 10 ng/ml or vehicle for 4 h. Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0.
