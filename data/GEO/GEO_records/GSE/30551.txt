TITLE
Epigenome characterization at single base-pair resolution

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We have combined standard micrococcal (MNase) digestion of nuclei with a modified protocol for construction paired-end DNA sequencing libraries to map both nucleosomes and subnucleosome-sized particles at single base-pair resolution throughout the budding yeast genome. We found that partially unwrapped nucleosomes and subnucleosome-sized particles can occupy the same position within a cell population, suggesting dynamic behavior. By varying the time of MNase digestion, we have been able to observe changes that reflect differential sensitivity of particles, including eviction of nucleosomes. Our protocol and mapping method provide a general strategy for characterizing full epigenomes.

DESIGN
We used micrococcal nuclease mapping, chromatin immunoprecipitation and paired-end sequencing to determine the structure of yeast centromeres at single base-pair resolution.
