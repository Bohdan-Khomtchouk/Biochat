TITLE
The Study of Gene Expression Profiles of KG-1 Cells Treated with Antrodia Camphorata Extracts using cDNA microarray.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Antrodia Camphorata is well known in Taiwan as a folk medicinal fungus with anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we used a human acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, KG-1, as the experimental model and constructed a high-throughput gene screen integrated platform by using a combination of herbal identification, UV-VIS spectrophotometry, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS), and DNA microarray technology. Based on this science-based platform, we developed a practical quantitative method and also established an organic/inorganic chemical fingerprint for the herbal materials. In the mean while, the global gene expression patterns of the KG-1 cells treated with various A. camphorata mycelia extracts (water and methanol extracts) were compared. Furthermore, several possible biological responses and relevant marker gene would be identified by our high-throughput integrated platform. Keywords: KG-1 treated with AC extracts for 4 days, cDNA microarray, biomarker selection.

DESIGN
We used optimal loop design to calculate the gene expression profile. In this design, we used labeled RNA from each sample to labeled three slides for a total of nine arrays. Therefore, the data computations were consisted of 18 measurements (6 samples with 3 replicates) for each of 7334 genes. Besides, duplicated water-treatment samples were used as internal control
