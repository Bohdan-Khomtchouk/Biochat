TITLE
Effects of eyestalk ablation on the gene expression levels in female black tiger shrimp broodstock (Penaeus monodon)

ORGANISM
Penaeus monodon

SUMMARY
Comparisons of gene expression profiles between ovaries of before (day 0) and after eyestalk ablation (days 1, 4 and 7) of domesticated 14-month-old black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) were made using a cDNA microarray.  Differentially expressed genes were identified through the microarray analysis, and the microarray results were confirmed by real-time PCR.  Selected genes were further characterized.

DESIGN
A cDNA microarray consisting of 5,568 features was constructed from EST libraries of P. monodon. RNA samples were extracted from the ovaries of before (day 0) and after eyestalk ablation at days 1, 4 and 7 from shrimp from the Shrimp Genetic Improvement Center, Thailand. The RNA was converted into cDNA by indirect aminoallyl-cDNA labelling method (LabelStar Array, Qiagen). aa-cDNA from day 0 samples were coupled with Cy3 dye as a reference,  and those from days 1, 4 and 7 were coupled with Cy5 dye.
