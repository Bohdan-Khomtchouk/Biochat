TITLE
Epigenetic stability in the adult cortex is counterbalanced by the expression of long non-coding RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Adult neural tissue was treated with an HDAC inhibitor, TSA to assess changes in gene expression, which was then correlated with control adult tissue as well as early postnatal controls

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from P26 occipital cortex as well as P180 TSA-treated and control occipital and frontal cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Cortical areas are subdivided by lamina, which were microdissected.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
