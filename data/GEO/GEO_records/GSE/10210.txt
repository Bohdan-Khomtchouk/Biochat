TITLE
Gene expression analysis of embryonic stem cells expressing VE-cadherin (CD144) during endothelial differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Endothelial differentiation occurs during normal vascular development in the developing embryo. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were used to further define the molecular mechanisms of endothelial differentiation. By flow cytometry a population of VEGF-R2 positive cells was identified as early as 2.5 days after differentiation of ES cells, and a subset of VEGF-R2 + cells, that were CD41+ positive at 3.5 days.  A separate population of VEGF-R2+ stem cells expressing the endothelial-specific marker CD144 (VE-cadherin) was also identified at this same time point. Microarray analysis of > 45,000 transcripts was performed on RNA obtained from cells expressing VEGF-R2, CD41, and CD144. Keywords: expression analysis

DESIGN
We identified four populations of cells; cells expressing VEGF-R2 (day 2.5), CD41 expressing cells (day 3.5), cells expressing CD144 (VE-Cadherin, day 3.5), and cells expressing CD144 (day 6.5). In addition to this, we have also obtained the negative control cells at each time such as VEGF-R2 (day 2.5) negative, CD41 negative (day 3.5), CD144 negative (VE-Cadherin, day 3.5), and negative CD144 (day 6.5). RNA for the microarray experiments were obtained in duplicate from two separately conducted experiments using the murine embryonic stem cells..
