TITLE
Expression analysis of Arabidopsis ein2 and bak1 mutants treated with the elicitors elf18 and Pep2.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Recognition of microbial patterns and host derived damage signals by host pattern recognition receptors is a key step in immune activation in multicellular eukaryotes. Here we show how mutations in ethylene signaling and the coreceptor bak1 affect host immune responses triggered by elicitors.

DESIGN
A 51 DNA microarray study using total RNA from Arabidopsis mutants (ein2-1, bak1-3, efr-1 and pepr1-1 pepr2-3) as well as wild type treated with elf18 or Pep2 with three biological replicates.
