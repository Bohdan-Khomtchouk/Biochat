TITLE
Negative control and mir-342-3p mimics-transfected RAW264.7 mouse macrophages.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RAW264.7 mouse macrophages were transfected with negative control and miR-342-3p mimics and subjected to microarray analysis 18 hours after the transfection. We used microarray to obtain global mRNA expression data of negative control and miR-342-3p mimics-transfected RAW264.7 cells.

DESIGN
RAW264.7 mouse macrophages were transfected with negative control and mir-342-3p mimics. The global mRNA expression patterns of negative control and miR-342-3p mimics-transfected RAW264.7 cells were analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
