TITLE
Identification of the molecular targets of microRNA-181d in murine thymocytes.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
T cell-specific transgenic expression of microRNA-181d reduced number of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Microarray analysis was performed to reveal differentially expressed genes between the wild type and microRNA-181d transgenic thymocytes.

DESIGN
Whole thymus tissues were isolated from the wild type (C57BL/6) and microRNA-181d transgenic mice (Tg-38 line), followed by total RNA isolation.
