TITLE
Characterisation of the effects of in situ fixation on DNA methylation levels

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Focusing on adult skeletal muscle stem cells, we have developed a protocol that circumvents the impact of the isolation procedures and captures the cells in their native quiescent state. We show that current isolation protocols induce major transcriptional changes accompanied by specific histone modifications, while having negligible effects on DNA methylation.

DESIGN
RRBS analysis of muscle stem cells that were either live or fixed by 0.5% paraformaldehyde after the isolation procedure

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
