TITLE
Re-analysis by microarray using cDNA target of samples from psoriasis patients enrolled in an etanercept trial

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
cDNA and cRNA hybridization technologies have different, probe-specific sensitivities. We used samples from an etanercept trial (GSE11903) to explore in a real-life setting the uniqueness of each platform.

DESIGN
We obtained total RNA for a subset of the samples in GSE11903 from Jim Krueger and generated expression profiles using labeled cDNA target. From 14 patients, available base-line lesional and non-lesional skin biopsy pairs as well as post-dose samples were analyzed. All the samples were run on Affymetrix HU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays.
