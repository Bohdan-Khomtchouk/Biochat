TITLE
Memory B cell subset defined by CD80 and PD-L2 surface expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
NP-reactive murine splenic memory B cells were sorted based on the expression of the surface markers CD80 and PD-L2

DESIGN
AM14 tg+ X Vk8R+/- recipients of B1-8+ B cells were immunized with NP-CGG and 8 weeks later splenic EMA-, CD19+ and NP+ memory B cells were sorted based on their surface expression of CD80 and PD-L2 (DN=CD80- PDL2-, SP=CD80- PDL2+, DP=CD80+ PDL2+). 1x10E5 up to 3x10E5 cells per sample were sorted and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy plus micro kit and cRNA was prepared using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit.
