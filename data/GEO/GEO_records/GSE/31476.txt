TITLE
Host cell gene expression in Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infected CEF cells at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post infection

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
We used the microarray data to analyze host cells response on CEF cells infected with A/WSN/33 (H1N1)

DESIGN
A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infected CEF cells were harvested at 2, 4, 6 and 8 hpi and RNA extraction was performed using standard protocol as described by Affymetrix. The aim of this experiment is to analyze host response to Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infection.
