TITLE
Drosophila the 3rd instar larvae testis: Control vs. Wolbachia-infected

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Drosophila melanogaster larval testes with and without the wMel strain of Wolbachia and found that 296 genes had at least a 1.5 fold change [q-value (%) < 5%] in transcript levels, with 167 genes up-regulated and 129 genes down-regulated when comparing Wolbachia-infected flies to uninfected ones. Differential expression of genes related to metabolism, immunity, reproduction and other  functions were observed.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Wolbachia-infected vs. Wolbachia-uninfected testes. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 infected, independently grown and dissected. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL14667 Drosophila 2 x 15K Genome Array
