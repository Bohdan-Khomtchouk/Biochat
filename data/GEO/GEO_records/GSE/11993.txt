TITLE
Liver gene expression profiling of zinc finger binding protein 90 (Zfp90) transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Zinc finger binding protein 90 (Zfp90) was predicted as a causal gene for abdominal using a novel statistical method named LCMS (Schadt et al., 2005, Nature Genetics). In order to validate this prediction, we profiled the liver tissues of Zfp90 transgenic mice (Zfp90 tg) and their littermate wild-type (wt) controls to examine the gene expression signature as well as pathways/networks resulting from the single gene perturbation.

DESIGN
3 Zfp90 tg mice and 4 wt controls were profiled. Reference pool included RNA extracted from the liver of 4 wt control mice. Dye-swap was involved in the profiling.
