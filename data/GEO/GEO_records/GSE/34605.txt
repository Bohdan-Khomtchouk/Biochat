TITLE
Inferring rules of lineage commitment in haematopoiesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Fractionation of EML cells isolated based on surface expression of immunophenotypic markers reveals the existence of a subpopulation that has undergone spontaneous commitment to an erythroid fate. Uncommitted fractions were compared to committed cells, derived from both spontaneous (EryCP) and cytokine-driven (Ediff) commitment.

DESIGN
EML cells were separated by flow cytometry based on their expression of the markers Sca1, CD34 and cKit as described.
