TITLE
Transcription and enhancer profiling in human monocyte subsets

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human blood monocytes comprise at least three subpopulations that differ in phenotype and function. Here we generated global maps of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac deposition for classical and nonclassical monocytes defining enhanceosomes of the two major subsets. In combination with HeliScopeCAGE data for all three subpopulations we identify differential regulatory elements (including promoters and putative enhancers) that were associated with subset-specific motif signatures corresponding to different transcription factor activities and exemplarily validate a novel downstream enhancer of the CD14 locus.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of 2 histone marks in " classical " CD14++CD16- and " nonclassical " CD14dimCD16+ human blood monocytes
