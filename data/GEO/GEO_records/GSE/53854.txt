TITLE
Gene expression of F.graminearum during maize stalk infection

ORGANISM
Fusarium graminearum

SUMMARY
Fusarium graminearum can infect maize stalk causing Gibberella stalk rot. We want to know the whole genome wide gene profiling when infecting maize stalk.

DESIGN
Using lasr capture microdisecction, we captured 8 time points infecting hyphae samples for maize stalk and after two-round amplification, we hybrid the aRNA to Affymetrix array.
