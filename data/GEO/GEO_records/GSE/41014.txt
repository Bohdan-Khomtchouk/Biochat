TITLE
The GtaR quorum-sensing protein negatively regulates a capsular polysaccharide gene transfer agent (RcGTA) receptor on Rhodobacter capsulatus cells

ORGANISM
Rhodobacter capsulatus

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of wild type and gtaI mutant in logarithmic and stationary phase of growth. The objective was to search for differentially regulated genes potentially associated with EPS production in R. capsulatus.

DESIGN
A single sample of each strain in both growth phases for basic comparison of expression profiles.
