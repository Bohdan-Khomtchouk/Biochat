TITLE
miRNA expression in different tissues from different breeds of chicken

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA Array was used to globally identify different expression miRNAs in hypothalamus, liver, breast muscle and abdominal fat between commercial broilers and indigenous chickens at seven-week old with hypertrophic pectoral muscle or normal pectoral muscle.

DESIGN
A total of 24 microarrays were performed on 4 tissues with 3 replications from 2 different breeds at the 7-week old age.

PLATFORM
GPL8786 [miRNA-1] Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-1 Array
