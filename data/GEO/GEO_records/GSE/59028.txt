TITLE
ABL Tyrosine Kinase Phosphorylates DGCR8 to Stimulate MicroRNA Processing in DNA Damage Response

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miR-seq to find miRs that are induced by DNA damage and whose induction requires ABL kinase activity

DESIGN
Use p53-inactive HEK293T cells. Use doxorubicin to induce DNA damage. Use imatinib co-treatment to inhibit ABL kinase activity

PLATFORM
GPL9115 Illumina Genome Analyzer II (Homo sapiens)
