TITLE
EIN2 mediates histone H3K14 and non-canonical histone H3K23 acetylation in the nucleus in ethylene response [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report that ENAP1 interacts with EIN3CEND and histone H3, and enhances histone acetylation. We examined the gene expression in ENAP1ox lines, compared with that in COL lines.

DESIGN
Whole seedling mRNA profiles of 3-day old wild type (COL) and ENAP1ox (in COL background) were generated by sequencing, in 2 replications, using Illumina HiSeq 2000

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
