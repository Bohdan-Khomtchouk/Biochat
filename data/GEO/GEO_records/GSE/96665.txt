TITLE
Integrated analysis Of Biopsies From Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Identifies SAA1 As A Link Between Mucosal Microbes With TH17 And TH22 Cells [diseased subjects]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are believed to be driven by dysregulated interactions between the host and the gut microbiota. Our goal is to characterize the relationships between mucosal T cells, the host tissue environment and microbial communities in IBD patients to identify new therapeutic targets. We identified 26 predictors from our combined data set that were effective in distinguishing between regions of the intestine undergoing active inflammation and regions that were normal. Network analysis on these 26 predictors revealed SAA1 as the most connected node linking the abundance of the genus Bacteroides with the production of IL17 and IL22 by CD4+ T cells. The SAA1-linked microbial and transcriptome interactions were further validated with data from the pediatric IBD RISK cohort. This study identifies expression of SAA1 as an important link between mucosal T cells, microbial communities and their tissue environment in IBD patients. A combination of FACS, gene expression and microbial profiling can distinguish between intestinal inflammatory states in IBD regardless of disease types.

DESIGN
We characterized mucosal CD4+ T cells using flow cytometry (FACS), along with matching mucosal global gene expression and microbial communities data from 35 pinch biopsy samples from IBD patients. We analyzed these data sets using an integrated framework to identify predictors of inflammatory states and then validated the putative relationship networks by analyzing data from the pediatric RISK cohort.
