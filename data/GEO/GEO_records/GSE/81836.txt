TITLE
Adenomatous polyps and treatment with Sulindac

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Parainflammation is associated with cellular senescence and is apparent in a pure primary epithelial tissue, such as gut epithelial organoids. APC-mutated human and mouse polyps represent early neoplastic lesions, which mostly do not progress, possibly due to senescence-associated PI, thus representing a good source for testing the parainflammation signature we characterized.

DESIGN
We prepared organoid cultures from APC-mutated normal gut epithelium (MIN) and adenomatous polyps of APCmin/+ mice (Adenoma) and analyzed them via RNA-seq on three biological replicates. We also prepared organoids from  adenomatous polyps of APCmin/+ mice, treated them with the NSAID Sulindac and performed RNA-seq on three biological replicates
