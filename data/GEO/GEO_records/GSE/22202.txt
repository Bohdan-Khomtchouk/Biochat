TITLE
Absolute expression level of Saccharomyces kluyveryii genes

ORGANISM
Lachancea kluyveri NRRL Y-12651

SUMMARY
Total RNA versus genomic DNA hybridization on custom arrays designed for all Saccharomyces kluyveryii genes

DESIGN
Total RNA was collected in mid-log phase from Saccharomyces kluyveryii cells grown in rich medium (abbreviated CM, in house recipe).   RNA was then converted to cDNA, Cy3-labeled and hybridized competitively against Cy5 labeled genomic DNA from Saccharomyces kluyveryii.

PLATFORM
