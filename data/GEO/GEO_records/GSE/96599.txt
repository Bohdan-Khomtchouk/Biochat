TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of HN-5 cells exposed to the alkylphosphocholine erufosine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene modulation occurring in OSCC cell line, HN-5, post erufosine exposure was investigated. A dose- and time-dependent change in gene profile was analyzed post 16h, 24h and 48h of erufosine exposure at IC25, IC50 and IC75 concentrations when compared to untreated controls. Results provide important information of the cellular functions modulated by erufosine in OSCC cell lines and gives insight to its mechanism of action at the gene level.

DESIGN
Total RNA from HN-5 cell line was obtained after 16h, 24h and 48h post treatment of erufosine at a concentration corresponding to IC25, IC50 and IC75. Change in modulation was compared respective the untreated controls.
