TITLE
Expression analysis of Human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc1 pretreated with DMSO and Clofibrate.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes of Panc1 pretreated with Clofibrate, compared to Panc1 pretreated with DMSO.

DESIGN
Compare differentially expressed genes by analyzing mRNA profilings between DMSO and Clofibrate pretreating Panc1 cell.
