TITLE
Large scale sequencing of small RNAs in tomato plants

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
In order to compare the small RNA (sRNA) population between the control and  Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) upon infecting the plants, the tomato plants (Lycopersicum esculentum cv. Rutgers) were mock  inoculated. At 21 dpi,tTotal RNA was extracted and subjected for deep-sequencing using Illumina MiSeq platform. The primers were trimmed and the 21- to 24-nt long small RNA species were filtered after quality check of the raw data.

DESIGN
Examination for the small RNA population in tomato plants.
