TITLE
UHRF1 is an upstream regulator of DNMT1-mediated cellular senescence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
During the progress of senescence, cells sequentially acquire diverse senescent phenotypes together with several gene reprogramming steps. It is still unclear what will be the key regulator in charge of collective gene expression changes at the initial senescent reprogramming. In this study, we show that suppression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-mediated maintenance DNA methylation activity was an initial event developed prior to gain of senescent phenotypes by employing time-series gene expression profiles of two different senescence models of human diploid fibroblast (HDF), replicative senescence (RS; GSE41714) and H2O2-induced senescence (HS).

DESIGN
The analysis of gene expression profiling among cellular senescence induced by hydrogen peroxide. two different data sets; a sample set of senescence by H2O2 (n =7 including control sample) and a set of siRNA-mediated knockdown experiment (n=5 including control sample).
