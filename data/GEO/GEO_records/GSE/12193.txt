TITLE
Wild type 3 hours exposure to 0.1 microM OGT2468

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We did transcription profiling on the effect of O-glycosylation inhibitor OGT2468 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using strains SEY6210 (wild type). Yeast cells exposed to OGT2468 in YPD growth medium show a significant inhibition of mating, filamentation and induction of cell wall compensatory mechanism.

DESIGN
Three biological samples were analyzed for each condition, and a microarray experiment were carried out for each sample 1. absence of the drug (but the corresponding amount of DMSO 0.1%) 2. presence of 0.1 microMolar of OGT2468

PLATFORM
GPL2529 [Yeast_2] Affymetrix Yeast Genome 2.0 Array
