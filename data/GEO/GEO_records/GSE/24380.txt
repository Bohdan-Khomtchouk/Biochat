TITLE
Expression data from wild-type and H2B K37A mutant yeast histones

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
We identified lysine 37 of histone H2B as a novel site of histone lysine methylation in budding yeast.  Microarray analysis was performed to determine global changes in gene expression upon mutation of this lysine residue to a unmodifiable form.
