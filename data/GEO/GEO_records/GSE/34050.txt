TITLE
ChIP-chip from DAOY cells stably expressing HA-MXD3 with anti-HA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A subset of medulloblastomas, the most common brain tumor in children, is hypothesized to originate from granule neuron precursors (GNPs) in which the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway is over-activated. MXD3, a basic helix-look-helix zipper transcription factor of the MAD family, has been reported to be upregulated during postnatal cerebellar development and to promote GNP proliferation and MYCN expression. Mxd3 is upregulated in mouse models of medulloblastoma as well as in human medulloblastomas. Therefore, we hypothesize that MXD3 plays a role in the cellular events that lead to medulloblastoma biogenesis. The purpose of this study was to identify MXD3 target genes.

DESIGN
Stable cell line overexpressing HA tagged MXD3 immunoprecipitated with anti-HA; 2 biological replicates on 2 promoter arrays

PLATFORM
GPL7408 Nimblegen HG18 RefSeq promoter array
