TITLE
Tg(actb2:KIT-D816V) transgenic zebrafish versus wild-type at 28 hpf

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 28 hpf zebrafish transgenic expressing human KIT-D816V mutant gene versus wild-type embryos was performed. The aim of this experiment was to determine the expression changes caused by expression of KIT-D816V oncogene. This transgenic zebrafish represents a model of systemic mastocytosis with many features of this disease present in adults, but no very clear phenotypes in embryos. Thus, we attempted to determine if there are certain expression changes, which can be used as molecular features of active KIT expressed in these embryos.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Tg(actb2:KIT-D816V) versus wild-type(AB), 4 replicate experiments with a dye-swap each time

PLATFORM
GPL14664 Agilent-026437 D. rerio (Zebrafish) Oligo Microarray V3 (Probe Name version)
