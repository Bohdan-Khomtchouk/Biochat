TITLE
Identification of differentially expressed genes in LBH589-treated cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify the targets of LBH589 treatment, we compared gene expression profiles in three different types of human cancer cell lines (H295R, HeLa and MCF-7her2) with and without LBH589 treatment.  Affymetrix microarray analysis was performed to determine changes in gene expression that are unique to LBH treatment.

DESIGN
LBH-treated cell lines received 50 nM of LBH589 for 24 hours. DMSO and LBH treatments are in triplicate.
