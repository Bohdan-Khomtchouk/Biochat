TITLE
TRPM7 maintains mesenchymal phenotype of breast cancer cells by tensional regulation of SOX4 (TRPM7 shRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect of shRNA-mediated knockdown of TRPM7 on gene expression levels in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Results were used for the identification of so-called epithelial-mesenchymal transcription factors that were affected by TRPM7 knockdown and for the analysis of overlapping up- and downregulated genes in shT7#1 + shSOX4#1 MDA-MB-231 cells

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transduced with a scrambled shRNA  (shCntrl) or TRPM7 shRNA (shT7#1)

PLATFORM
GPL10904 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip (gene symbol)
