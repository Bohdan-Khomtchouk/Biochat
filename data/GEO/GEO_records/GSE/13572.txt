TITLE
Rat heart cells' gene expression difference compared with that of the adult cells including rat BMC and PEF cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat somatic heart cell had different gene expression level compared with that of the adult cells including rat bone marrow cells(BMC) and rat primary ear fibroblasts(PEF). This difference gave the rat somatic heart cell unique characteristics which could then be compared with the rat iPS cells by genes comparison to show the gene expression difference between rat somatic heart cells and rat iPS cells.

DESIGN
There were two replicates sample of the rat somatic heart cell  named 1, 2.And the control cells were the mixture of rat bone marrow cells(BMC) and rat primary ear fibroblasts(PEF) named mix1. Rat somatic heart cells samples were labled with Cy3 and the mix1 were labled with Cy5. The data was process to show the rat somatic heart cells' gene expression difference compared with that of mix1.
