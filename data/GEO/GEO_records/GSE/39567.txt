TITLE
miRNA profiles in formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast cancer tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We describe a miRNA profiling analysis of matched ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive duct carcinoma components of FFPE breast carcinomas with the purpose to identify potential prognostic markers

DESIGN
miRNA extracted from 16 matched DCIS/IDC and 24 pure DCIS preparations was profiled using Illumina miRNA BeadChip platform
