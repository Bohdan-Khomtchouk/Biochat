TITLE
In vitro selection for chitosan-resistant Staphylococcus aureus - phenotypic and molecular characterisation of resistance development

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
A mutant of SG511 (wild type isolate), resistant to the presence of chitosan (polycationic molecule) was obtained following serial passage experiments resistance to chitosan exposition. Transcriptomic experiments showed alteration in the expression of genes involved in the cell wall regulon resulting in the modification of susceptibility phenotype against cell wall active antibiotics

DESIGN
Microarray was used to evaluate alteration in the transcriptome between wild tpye strain SG511 and its spontaneous chitosan resistant variant (CRV)

PLATFORM
GPL7137 Agilent-017903 Staphylococcus aureus V5 Bis 15K (basic)
