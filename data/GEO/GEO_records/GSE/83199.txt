TITLE
Adverse Health Effects of Cylindrospermopsin in Laboratory Animal (Mouse) Studies in Single Day Study using Affymetrix Array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this project was to determine gene expression changes in the liver at different times post treatment with the common freshwater cyanobacterial toxin, cylindrospermopsin (CYN).  The liver is generally considered to be the primary target of this toxin and all the data has been derived from livers of exposed animals as well as concurrent controls.  Preliminary gene expression effects have been reported (Chernoff et al., 2010) and the current data extend the time course from 1 hour post exposure to 1-day post cessation of a 5-day period dosing period.

DESIGN
Gene expression changes were determined in the livers of pregnant mice exposed to toxic levels of cyanobacterial toxin, cylindrospermopsin.  Animals were exposed to a dose of CYN that elicited significant hepatic toxicity.  This single dose study analyzed liver samples collected at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours post dose. Gene expression changes were analyzed on the GeneChipÂ® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array.
