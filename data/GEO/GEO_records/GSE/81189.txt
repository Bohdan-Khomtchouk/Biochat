TITLE
Expression data from Tbet+ and Tbet- Memory B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of antibody and B cells in preventing infection is established. In contrast, the role of B cell responses in containing chronic infections remains poorly understood. IgG2a (IgG1 in humans) can prevent acute infections and T-bet promotes IgG2a isotype switching. However, whether IgG2a and B cell-expressed T-bet influence the host-pathogen balance during persisting infections is unclear. Here we demonstrate that B cell specific loss of T-bet prevents control of persisting viral infection. T-bet in B cells not only controlled IgG2a production, but also mucosal localization, proliferation, glycosylation, and a broad transcriptional program. T-bet controlled a broad antiviral program in addition to IgG2a since T-bet in B cells was im­portant even in the presence of virus-specific IgG2a. Our data supports a model in which T-bet is a universal controller of antiviral immunity across multiple immune lineages. Naïve, Tbet+, and Tbet- Memory B cells were assayed for gene expression

DESIGN
Tbet GFP reporter mice were infected with LCMV clone 13, and target B cell populations were sorted from splenocytes at day 10 post-infection
