TITLE
Time course RNA-seq analysis of barley powdery mildew fungus Bgh infecting immunocompromised Arabidopsis thaliana

ORGANISM
Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei

SUMMARY
RNA-seq experiments detected fungal expression patterns during infection of immunocompromised Arabidopsis thaliana

DESIGN
3 biological replicates per condition.  Arabidopsis plants without (pps) or with (B12) the MLA1-HA construct in pen2 pad4 sag101 background were challenged with either Bgh isolate K1 expressing the cognate AVRA1 effector for MLA1 or Bgh isolate A6 expressing other AVRA effectors. Samples were collected at 6, 12, 18, 24 hours post inoculation (hpi) of Bgh.
