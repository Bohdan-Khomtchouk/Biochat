TITLE
Regulation of HB-EGF by miR-212 and acquired cetuximab-resistance in head and neck cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To determine the mechanism of cetuximab-resistance in head and neck cancer, a cetuximab-sensitive cell line (SCC1) and its cetuximab-resistant derivative (1Cc8) were analyzed for differentially expressed genes using DNA microarrays. 900 differentially expressed genes were found using the statistical cut-off point of one-way ANOVA with FDR less than 1%.

DESIGN
The SCC1 and 1Cc8 cell lines were grown in biological triplicates. Total RNA was isolated and array experiments were performed. The supplementary file 'GSE21483_differentially_expressed_genes.txt' includes the list of differentially expressed genes that were identified.
