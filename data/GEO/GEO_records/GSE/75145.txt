TITLE
Expression analysis of chinese cabbage (B.rapa ssp. pekinensis) : cold stress conditions

ORGANISM
Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis

SUMMARY
Using 300Kâ€²-high density microarray covering the chinese cabbage whole genome, genome-wide expression analyses of cold stress conditions.

DESIGN
A total of 10 chips were used for microarray. Total RNAs were extracted from cold stress conditions.

PLATFORM
GPL17248 Brassica rapa 300k Microarray v2.0 [2007-10-15_GGB_B_rapa_082207]
