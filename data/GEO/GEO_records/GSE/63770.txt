TITLE
Embryonic small RNA and RNA profiles of Tribolium castaneum and Drosophila oocytes

ORGANISM
Tribolium castaneum ; Drosophila melanogaster ; Drosophila virilis

SUMMARY
Next generation sequencing analysis of the small RNA and RNA profiles of successive time intervals during T. castaneum embryogenesis, and Drosophila unfertilized oocytes

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from oocytes precisely staged embryos at 25Â°C and small RNA or stranded polyA-RNA libraries were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions
