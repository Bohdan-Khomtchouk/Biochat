TITLE
Impact of transposable elements in Pleurotus ostreatus transcriptome profiles

ORGANISM
Pleurotus ostreatus

SUMMARY
Pleurotus ostreatus, also known as the oyster mushroom, is an active lignin decomposer in the forests. The genomes of the monokaryotic strains PC15 and PC9 have been used to characterize the content and distribution of transposable elements. This study analyzes the impact of transposable element insertions on the global transcriptome of P. ostreatus. The transcriptome of PC15 and PC9 has been analyzed in exponential growth during submerged fermentation in malt-yeast extract-sucrose medium

DESIGN
RNAseq of two P. ostreatus strains: PC15 and PC9
