TITLE
Effects of SFP1 deletion and Sfp1p prionization on transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Sfp1p is known to form the [ISP+] prion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Interestingly enough, the consequences and phenotypes of Sfp1p prionization and its absence are quite different. In order to understand the origin of this difference, we compared transcription profiles of an [ISP+], sfp1delta strains against the control strain (SFP1 [isp-]).

DESIGN
3 strains (an [ISP+], [isp-] and sfp1delta derivative of 25-25-2V-P3982, Peterhoff genetic collection), each in quadruplicate (4 biological replicates).
