TITLE
Expression data of male and female floral bud with Populus tomentosa during their development process.

ORGANISM
Populus tomentosa

SUMMARY
Poplar GeneChip was employed to detect genes expressed during the whole floral developmental process, in order to improve understanding of poplar flower development, since current knowledge on flower development was mainly from model plant Arabidopsis.

DESIGN
Male and female floral buds of Populus tomentosa were selected at successive stages of the whole development process for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain genes contributed to floral development, but not the dynamic expression changes. To that end, equal amount of floral buds RNA per gender from different stages were mixed for the detection of expressed genes.
