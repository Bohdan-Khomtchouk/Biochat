TITLE
Expression data of male and female floral bud with Populus tomentosa during their development process.

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
Poplar GeneChip was employed to detect genes expressed during the whole floral developmental process, in order to improve understanding of poplar flower development, since current knowledge on flower development was mainly from model plant Arabidopsis.
