TITLE
Human prostate cancer xenografts on intact mice or after castration.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
cDNA expression arrays on a panel of human prostate cancer xenografts. The xenografts can divided into three groups: 1) androgen-dependent, 2) androgen-independent with functional expression of the androgen receptor, 3) androgen-independent lacking functional expression of the androgen receptor. Four microarrays were performed per xenograft using tissue samples collected in separate experiments. Two samples were taken from intact male mice, whereas the other two samples were taken 1 to 2 weeks after castration. The panel of xenografts have been described in van Weerden and Romijn, 2000; Prostate 43:263-71. Keywords: Different growth characteristics, androgen ablation response

DESIGN
A common reference is used for all hybridizations. This common reference contained two prostate cancer cell lines, Du145 and LNCaP, while the other cell lines originated from breast (MCF7 and ZR75.1), bone (MG63), colon (HT29), endothelium (Ea-hy926), ovary (A2780), skin (SK-MEL-28), B-cell leukemia (Raji), T-cell lymphoblastoma (Jurkat) and fibroblasts (N92-19N and N92-19T). Xenograft cDNA was always labeled with Cy3; the common reference was always labeled with Cy5.
