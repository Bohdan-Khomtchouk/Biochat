TITLE
Gene expression profiling of HepG2 cells after knockdown of β-catenin

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To elucidate the comprehensive changes regulated by β-catenin/TCF-dependent signaling in liver cancer cells, we explored a global gene expression of HepG2 cells after knockdown of β-catenin.

DESIGN
HepG2 cells were transfected with control siRNA or two independent β-catenin siRNAs, followed by gene expression profiling using microarray.
