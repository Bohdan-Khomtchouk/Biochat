TITLE
Track normalization and averaging of H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data across various cell and tissue types.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Data tracks from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments were sorted by tissue or cell types and processed using an in-house algorithm that provides normalization functionality followed by generation of a track average.

DESIGN
Re-analysis of Roadmap Epigenomics H3K4me3 ChIP-seq datasets using an in-house algorithm to create an average data track.
