TITLE
Effects of overexpression of EhMyb-dr on transcription in Entamoeba histolytica

ORGANISM
Entamoeba histolytica

SUMMARY
A myb domain containing protein of the SHAQKY family, EhMyb-dr, was overexpressed in E. histolytica trophozoites, and effects on transcription were measured.

DESIGN
Two arrays of trophozoites expressing Myc tagged EhMyb-dr were compared to two arrays performed on wild type trophozoites. The effects of transfection and drug were controlled for by including data from trophozoites expressing irrelevant plasmids, and grown in the same level of G418. All parasites were of strain HM-1:IMSS
