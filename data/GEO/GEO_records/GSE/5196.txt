TITLE
Detection of gene expression in Anopheles gambiae whole adults

ORGANISM
Anopheles gambiae

SUMMARY
RNA from adult mosquitoes was aminoallyl-labelled and directly hybridized to glass high density microarrays. Intensity values are used in a study of detection of transcription above background. Keywords: High density oligonucleotide array; detection of gene transcription

DESIGN
The five direct hybridizations of male and female biological replicate samples were done with dye swap.

PLATFORM
GPL3955 Anopheles gambiae high density oligonucleotide microarray
