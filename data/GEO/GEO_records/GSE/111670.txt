TITLE
The expression profiles of circRNAs in hippocampus from mice with prenatal glyphosate exposure

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, the circRNAs expression pattern in hippocampus of postnatal day (PND) 28 mice offsprings which were exposured by glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) during pregnancy and lactation was investigated. CircRNA microarray had detected 330 upregulated and 333 downregulated miRNAs in the PND28 mice offsprings' hippocampus

DESIGN
In this study, the isolated total RNA taken from two pooled samples of two groups, was used to acquire expression profiles, and the result shows 663 differentially-expressed circRNAs, some of them are known to be involved in brain development or the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders, indicate that dysregulated expression of circRNAs may be involved in the mechanism of glyphosate-induced neurotoxicity.
