TITLE
Gene expression profiling of regenerating planarian tails after inhibition of myoD and follistatin

ORGANISM
Schmidtea mediterranea

SUMMARY
MyoD is a conserved myogenic factor which controls formation of longitundinal muscle in planarians. myoD(RNAi) animals do not regenerate after amputation due to the lack of expression of a conserved TGF-beta inhibitor follistatin.

DESIGN
Polyadenylated RNA was isolated from dissected wound faces of tail fragments at  0, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-amputation (hpa) from planarians following RNAi (8 dsRNA feedings) of a control gene (C.elegans unc-22; 3 replicates) and myoD (3 replicates) or following RNAi (6 dsRNA feedings) of a control gene (C. elegans unc-22; 3 replicates) and follistatin (3 replicates).
