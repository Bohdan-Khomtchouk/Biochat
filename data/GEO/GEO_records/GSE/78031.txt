TITLE
microRNA profiling of Sprague Dawley organs

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We performed deep sequencing of the miRNAs present in ~20 toxicologically relevant tissues in Sprague Dawley rats and used three independent analysis of the data to determine which miRNAs are tissue specific and tissue enriched.

DESIGN
We performed deep sequencing of miRNAs in 21 organs from 5 male Sprague Dawley rats and 23 organs from 5 female Sprague Dawley rats.
