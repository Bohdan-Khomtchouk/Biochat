TITLE
Establishment and RNA sequencing profiling of two canine mammary gland tumors cell lines

ORGANISM
Canis lupus familiaris

SUMMARY
Purpose: the aim of this study was to characterize cell lines derived from canine mammary gland neoplasia which could be further used for basic and applied oncology research. Methods: samples of canine mammary carcinomas were taken to primary culture and two cell lines were well-established and described in terms of tumorigenesis, cell morphology and gene expression profile through RNA-seq analysis. Results: Both cell lines presented spindle-shape morphology and shown common malignancies features such as invasion potential and co-expression of cytoskeleton proteins. Also, we found dysregulations in gene expression patterns between the two cell cultures as well as compared to normal mammary gland tissue. Conclusion: transcriptomic profile of these cell lines contributed to the characterization of potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers and may enable the development of possible therapeutic molecular targets.

DESIGN
2 cell lines, 3 replicates each
