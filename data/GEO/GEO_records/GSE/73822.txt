TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for long time/short time survivors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ovarian cancer is the seventh-most common cancer and the eight-most common cause of death from cancer in woman. Some women with ovarian cancer survive a long time ( > 10yrs). We want to know if thereâ€™s a genetic difference between these long survivors and the broader population of interest. Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on sample DNA.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis of Affymetrix SNP arrays was performed for 12 short time and 12 long time OVCA survivor samples.
