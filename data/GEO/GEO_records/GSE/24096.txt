TITLE
Gene expression profile in the livers of insulin-resistant mice treated with all-trans retinoic acid

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Therapeutic effect of all-trans retinoic acid on diet-induced insulin resistance was found. To explore molecules involved in this pharmacological effect, the hepatic transcriptome was analyzed.

DESIGN
RNA samples were prepared from the liver biopsies of control, HFHFr-N, HFHFr-NA, HFHFr-F, and HFHFr-FA groups (five mice in each group). The samples were pooled and analyzed using Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K (G4122F).
