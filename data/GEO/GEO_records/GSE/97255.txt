TITLE
FANS-assisted ATAC-Seq to identify developmentally active endothelial enhancers [ATAC-seq]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Fluorescence-Activated Nuclei Sorting (FANS)-assisted Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) This work sought to identify endothelial-specific enhancer elements by applying ATAC-Seq to nuclei isolated from Tg(fli1a:egfp) transgenic zebrafish embryos.

DESIGN
ATAC-Seq performed on GFPplus and GFPminus nuclei isolated from Tg(fli1a:egfp) embryos.  Separate ATAC-Seq libraries were constructed from GFPplus and minus nuclei isolated on three separate occasions to give biological triplicate samples and 6 total samples.

PLATFORM
GPL16509 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Danio rerio)
