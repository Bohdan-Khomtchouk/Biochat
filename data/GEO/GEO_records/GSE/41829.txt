TITLE
Study of miRNA expression profile in HCV infected human serum samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A miRNA microarray was performed from HCV infected patient serum samples of bothe genotype 1b and genotype 3a, which are prevalent in India, with the aim of identifying a set of miRNAs which are uniquely differentially expressed during HCV infection. miR-320c, miR-483-5p, miR-134 and miR-198 were found to be upregulated in the patient samples as compared to the controls and are currenty being validated.

DESIGN
