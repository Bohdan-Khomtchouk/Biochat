TITLE
miRNA expression profiles of PRC SiRNA vs scramble transfected XTC.UC1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
PGC-1 related coactivator (PRC) shares structural and functional features with PGC-1{alpha}. It regulates several metabolic pathways and mitochondrial biogenesis. Its specific role in the early programming of cell proliferation suggests a finely regulated crosstalk between the mitochondrial functions and the cell cycle status.  To explore the PRC-regulated pathways, we used a cell-line model of mitochondrial-rich tumors, presenting an oxidative metabolism and a specific increase in PRC expression. We looked for the feedback loop exerted by miRNAs on the regulation of PRC-related mitochondiral functions

DESIGN
Expression profiles of miRNA at 48h PRC SIRNA treatment compared to scramble in XTC.UC1 cells. In duplicate.
