TITLE
Gene expression profile of neonate mouse epidermis stem cell after transplacental exposure to Arsenic in drinking water

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Background: The metalloid Arsenic is potentially toxic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic to humans. The metalloid poisining in drinking-water is a widespread problem affecting a large population globally. The toxicant is often found to exceed the recomnded level. the risk of repated exposure is direct as well as transplacental. the primary resion of exposure is the contamination of potable water from the geological sources in many region of the globe. The underlying mechanism of As toxicity is still unknown.
