TITLE
Rec8 ChIP-Seq experiment to analyse cohesin localisation in the Ctf19c mutants during meiotic prophase.

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Ctf19c mutants were shown to specifically impair cohesin localisation at the pericentromere during mitosis. The goal of this experiment is to confirm whether this mutant has the same effect on cohesin localisation during meiotic prophase. To do so, diploid S. cerevisiae SK1 cells were constructed containing Rec8-3HA in an ndt80-d background. Cells were allowed to sporulate in sporulation media for 5 hours after which formaldehyde was added to the cultures and cells were fixed for 2hr. Samples were then processed according to the standard lab ChIP-Seq protocol (with 3 times 30cycles of 30sec of sonication)
