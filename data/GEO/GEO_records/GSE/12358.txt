TITLE
Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 wild-type fermentation time course

ORGANISM
Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052

SUMMARY
The Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 wild-type culture was monitored from exponential growth to stationary phase. During this period the culture underwent a shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis. Acetone and butanol production was initiated with the onset of the solventogenic phase. Using DNA microarray changes in gene expression were examined during the transitional period.

DESIGN
RNA samples were taken from Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 wild-type fermentation culture at individual time points during the acidogenic phase and the solventogenic phase. The samples were used for microarray hybridization.
