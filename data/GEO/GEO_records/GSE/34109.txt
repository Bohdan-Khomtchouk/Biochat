TITLE
Expression data from MMTV-PPARd  mice, 1 week GW501516 treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of murine peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPARd) in mammary tumorigenesis was assessed. Microarrays were used to analyse global gene expression to determine changes in MMTV-PPARd transgenic mice versus wild-type mice and the  effect of GW501516.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) from mammary gland tissue of  transgenic and wild-type mice maintained on normal rodent chow or 0.005% GW501516
