TITLE
Expression data of lung tissues from ICR mice treated with or without single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The SWCNTs can induce airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-like changes in mice model. The SWCNTs can induce clusters of proteinases, chemokines/cytokines, and macrophage receptors triggered signaling, which might play critical roles in the SWCNTs-induced pathological changes, including chronic inflammation and tissues remodeling. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.

DESIGN
Lung tissues from adult ICR mice (6 weeks old) treated with or without single dose of 0.5 mg SWCNTs by intratrachael instillation were collected and homogenated under liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Since our data showed that the SWCNTs could induce significantly pulmonary granuloma and COPD-like lesion. Two time points of the samples have been collected for microarray analysis: day 1 after SWCNTs treatment as the acute phase responses; day 7 as the sub-chronic responses. We tried to compare the SWCNTs-regulated gene expression profiles with the PF68-treated (as the solvent control) to identify the possible mechanisms of SWCNTs-induced toxicity in lung.
