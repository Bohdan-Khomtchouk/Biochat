TITLE
Comparison of Trabecular Meshwork-Derived Cells (TMDCs) with other somatic Cell Types

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray study comparing trabecular meshwork-derived cells (TMDCs) from the iridocorneal angle of the human eye, with other human cell types such as scleral fibroblasts, corneal fibroblasts, retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells, corneal stroma, human embryonic stem cells (hESC), neural precursors differentiated from hESC, human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells and human adipose-tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC)

DESIGN
19 samples were analysed, including 6 biological replicates of TMDC, 2 biological replicates of scleral fibroblasts, 3 biological replicates of hAd-MSC
