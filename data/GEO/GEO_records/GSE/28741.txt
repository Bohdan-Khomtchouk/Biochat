TITLE
sncRNAs in E. faecalis V538

ORGANISM
Enterococcus faecalis V583

SUMMARY
Small non coding RNA molecules (sncRNAs) are key mediators of virulence and stress inducible gene expressions in some pathogens. In this work we identify sncRNAs in the Gram positive opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis. Enterococcus faecalis. We characterized 11 sncRNAs by tiling microarray analysis, 5’ and 3’ RACE-PCR, and Northern blot analysis. Six sncRNAs were specifically expressed at exponential phase, two sncRNAs were observed at stationary phase, and three were detected during both phases. This is the first experimental genome-wide identification of sncRNAs in E. faecalis and provides impetus to the understanding of gene regulation in this important human pathogen.

DESIGN
Identification of sncRNA candidates transcribed by E. faecalis V583 was undertaken with two samples of cells harvested in mid-log growth phase and  stationary phase after 24h of incubation at 37°C in M17 glucose media.
