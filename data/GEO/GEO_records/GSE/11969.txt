ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiles of 18,175 unique genes and three major genetic changes, p53, EGFR and K-ras, were investigated in 149 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including 90 patients with adenocarcinomas (AD) to determine their relationships with various clinicopathologic features and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Keywords: Disease state analysis

DESIGN
Expression profiles in 149 patients with NSCLC, 9 patients with SCLC and 5 for normal lung tissue.
