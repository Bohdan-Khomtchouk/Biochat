TITLE
Transcriptome Profiling of the Rumen Epithelial Tissues of Beef Cattle Differing in Residual Feed Intake

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
We functionally analyzed the rumen epithelial transcriptomes from low- and high- feed efficient beef steers to identify differences that might contribute to variation in feed efficiency.

DESIGN
RNA-seq was performed on the rumen epithelial tissues of 9 low RFI and 9 high RFI animals to obtain transcriptomes for functional analysis using bioinformatics.

PLATFORM
GPL15749 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Bos taurus)
