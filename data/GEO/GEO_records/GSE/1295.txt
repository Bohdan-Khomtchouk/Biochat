SUMMARY
STRRIDE is an exercise intervention study of different doses and intensities in overweight women and men with the metabolic syndrome. We profiled biopsies from 3 female and 3 male STRRIDE subjects in the “high” exercise group (2,200 kCal/wk). Muscle biopsies were profiled at entry (0h), and after 9 months of aerobic training (24 hrs post-last bout, 96 hrs post last bout, and 336h (14 days) de-training). Included also are pilot expression data from 3 male subjects. Keywords: other
