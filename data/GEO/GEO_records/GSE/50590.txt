TITLE
A role for H3K4 mono-methylation in facultative heterochromatin assembly and partitioning of chromatin readers

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mono-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me1) is a well-established feature of enhancers and promoters, although its function is unknown. Remarkably, we find H3K4me1 at the promoter regions of conditionaly-repressed muscle and stimulus-dependent inflammatory response genes in myoblasts. During myogenesis, muscle genes are activated and become H3K4-trimethylated. On the promoters of active genes, we find that H3K4me1 spatially restricts the recruitment of “readers” of H3K4me3, including ING1, which, in turn, recruits Sin3A. Our findings point to a unique role for H3K4 mono-methylation in establishing boundaries that restrict the recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes to defined regions within promoters.

DESIGN
Mapping of Wdr5, Menin, MLL1, Sin3A, and LSD1 in growing myoblasts (MB) and ING1 in growing myoblasts (MB) and fully differentiated myotubes (MT).
