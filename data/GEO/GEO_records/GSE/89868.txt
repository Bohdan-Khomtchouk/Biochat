TITLE
Selective packaging of cellular microRNAs into HIV-1 virions inhibits infectivity

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed the incorporation of cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) into highly purified HIV-1 virions and observed that this largely, but not entirely, mirrored the level of miRNA expression in the producer CD4+ T cells. Specifically, of the 58 cellular miRNAs detected at significant levels in the producer cells, only five miRNAs were found at a 2 to 4-fold higher level in virions than predicted based on random sampling. Of note, these included two miRNAs, miR-155 and miR-92a, reported previously to at least weakly bind HIV-1 transcripts. To test whether miRNA binding induces virion incorporation, we introduced artificial miRNA target sites into the HIV-1 genome and observed a 10 to 40-fold increase in the packaging of the cognate miRNA into virions, leading to the recruitment of up to 1.6 copies into each virion. Importantly, this high level of incorporation significantly inhibited HIV-1 virion infectivity. We conclude that target sites for cellular miRNAs can inhibit RNA virus replication at two distinct steps, i.e., during infection and during viral gene expression, thus explaining why a range of different RNA viruses appear to have evolved to restrict cellular miRNA binding to their genome.

DESIGN
This dataset inludes total small RNA libraries for CEM-SS cells and purified HIV-1 virions produced in these cells.  Two replicates for each sample
