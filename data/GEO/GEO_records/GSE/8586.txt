TITLE
Expression profiles of extremely low gestational age newborns as predictors of BPD

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
One third to one half of all infants born before the 28th wek of gestation develop BPD bronchopulmonary dysplasia.  Our objective is to evaluate the feasibility of using expression profiling in umbilical cord tissue to discover molecular signatures for developmental staging and for risk of BPD. Keywords: disease state analysis
