ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_970 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Kevin White. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: The White Lab is aiming to map the association of the main post-translationally modified histones on the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. One technique that we use for this purpose is chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip (ChIP-on-chip) utilizing whole-genome tiling arrays. The data generated by ChIP-chip experiments consist basically of a plot of signal intensity across the genome. The highest signals correspond to positions in the genome occupied by the tested histone modification.
