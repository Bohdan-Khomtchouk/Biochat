TITLE
Gene expression profiles in livers caused by Atg7 and/or Nrf2 deficiency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Autophagy deficiency caused by conditional knockout of Atg7 results in severe hepatitis accompanied by abundant accumulation of p62. p62 stablizes Nrf2 by disrupting the association between Keap1 and Nrf2.  To understand the pathogenesis of hepatitis under the autophagy deficiency, we examined gene expression profiles of livers from Atg7-null, Nrf2-null and Atg7-Nrf2 double mutant mice.

DESIGN
Eight week old Atg7F/F:Mx1-Cre mice and Atg7F/F:Mx1-Cre:Nrf2-/- together with control mice were injected with pIpC. At 4 weeks after pIpC injection, total RNAs were purified from each mouse liver.
