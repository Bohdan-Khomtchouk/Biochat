TITLE
Indole cell signaling occurs primarily at low temperatures in Escherichia coli

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
We have shown the quorum-sensing signals acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs), autoinducer-2 (AI-2), and indole influence the biofilm formation of Escherichia coli.  Here, we investigate how the environment, i.e., temperature, affects indole and AI-2 signaling in E. coli. We show in biofilms that indole addition leads to more extensive differential gene expression at 30°C (186 genes) than at 37°C (59 genes), that indole reduces biofilm formation (without affecting growth) more significantly at 25°C and 30°C than at 37°C, and that the effect is associated with the quorum-sensing protein SdiA. The addition of indole at 30°C compared to 37°C most significantly repressed genes involved in uridine monophosphate (UMP) biosynthesis (carAB, pyrLBI, pyrC, pyrD pyrF, and upp) and uracil transport (uraA). These uracil-related genes are also repressed at 30°C by SdiA, which confirms SdiA is involved in indole signaling. Also, compared to 37°C, indole more significantly decreased flagella-related qseB, flhD, and fliA promoter activity, enhanced antibiotic resistance, and inhibited cell division at 30°C.  In contrast to indole and SdiA, the addition of (S)-4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (the AI-2 precursor) leads to more extensive differential gene expression at 37°C (63 genes) than at 30°C (11 genes), and, rather than repressing UMP synthesis genes, AI-2 induces them at 37°C (but not at 30°C). Also, the addition of AI-2 induces the transcription of virulence genes in enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 at 37°C but not at 30°C. Hence, cell signals cause diverse responses at different temperatures, and indole- and AI-2-based signaling are intertwined.
