TITLE
Gene co-expression networks in human brain predict chromatin modifications in alcohol abusers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A novel systems approach was applied to transcriptome profiling that included the traditional analysis of differentially expressed genes, gene co-expression networks, cell type - specific transcriptomes and a wide range of gene annotations. By integrating our data with previous findings, we generated the first systems hypothesis of human alcoholism that integrates epigenetic regulation of gene expression with structural and functional alterations in alcoholic brain.
