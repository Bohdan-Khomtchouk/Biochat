TITLE
Expression data from Caenorhabditis elegans fed with 13L cocoa peptide

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Cocoa protein content is a very interesting source for isolation of antioxidant bio-peptides, which can be used for the prevention of age-related diseases. We use microarrays to study the global genome expression of C. elegans fed with a peptide (13L) isolated from cocoa.

DESIGN
Wild type strain N2 of C. elegans was fed with 1 Âµg/mL of 13L peptide or in Nematode Growth medium (MGM, control fed) until reach young adult stage. Worm population were age-synchronized. RNA was isolated from each populations (control and treated) using RNAasy Kit (Qiagen) and hybridizated on Affymetrix microarrays.
