TITLE
Non-cancerous liver infiltrating lymphocytes of hepatitis C and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Study goal is to disclose features of gene expressio profile of non-cancerous liver-infiltrating lymphocytes of type C hepatitis patients with hepatocellular carcinomas and  tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of type C hepatitis patients with hepatocellular carcinomas. Keywords: gene expression profile, non-cancerous liver-infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, type C hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma

DESIGN
Non-cancerous liver-infiltrating lymphocytes were obtained by laser capture microdissection from surgically resected liver tissues of 12 type C hepatitis patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The mRNA was amplified and expression profile was comprehensively analyzed with reference RNA using oligo-DNA chip. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were obtained by laser capture microdissection from surgically resected cancer tissues of 12 type C hepatitis patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The mRNA was amplified and expression profile was comprehensively analyzed with reference RNA using oligo-DNA chip.
