TITLE
Purification and ex vivo expansion of fully functional salivary gland stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of genes that are enriched in long-term self-renewing salivary gland stem cells. And analysis of genes that are enriched in the organoids containing differentiated salivary gland cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from long-term self-renewing CD24hi/CD29hi passage-10 cells and compared to that of non-selfrenewing CD24hi/CD29hi passage-0 cells. Total RNA extracted from differentiated organoids compared with that of undifferentiated primary sphere cells.
