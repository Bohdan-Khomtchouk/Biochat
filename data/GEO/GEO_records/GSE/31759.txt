TITLE
Drought stress in Wheat at grain filling stage

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum ; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum

SUMMARY
To provide a global study of transcriptome changes under drought stress, the gene expression levels of a durum wheat genotype (Triticum durum Desf. cultivar Creso) and two bread wheat genotypes (Triticum aestivum L. cultivar Chinese Spring -CS- and its deletion line CS_5AL-10) were investigated. The 5A chromosome deletion line (5AL-10)  lacks the distal part (43%) of the long arm of chromosome 5A.  Each genotype was subjected to two different levels of water stress at the grain filling stage. After anthesis, three different levels of soil water content (SWC) were induced as described below: control (CTRL; SWC=28%), moderate stress (MS; SWC=18%), and severe stress (SS; SWC=12.5%). For each sample, three biological replicates were performed, for a total of 27 hybridizations.   ****[PLEXdb( http://www.plexdb.org ) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Alessio Aprile.
