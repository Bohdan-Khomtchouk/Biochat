TITLE
study of the transcriptional consequences of a growth qtl candidate (sg1)-Functional characterization of Shoot Growth 1 (Sg1)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra11-04_qtl - study of the transcriptional consequences of a growth qtl candidate (sg1) - We want to compare the transcriptome of Sg1 insertion mutant to a WT background to understand if this candidate has a role in gene expression regulation at the genome-wide level. - We are analysing a QTL named Sg1 quantitatively affecting the shoot growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. Sg1 mutation exhibits a large set of phenotypic consequences (growth, fitness,â€¦), and the penetrance of these defects increase over generations. The CATMA collaboration aims to perform a T-DNA mutant vs WT analysis, with the WT control being derived from the heterozygous T-DNA parent. A first homozygous generation hypotheticaly derived from the heterozygous T-DNA parent and a 4th homozygous generation showing more severe phenotypes are being compared to the WT (dye swap, biological repetitions). Whole plants were harvested 10 DAG at 11am for each genotype.

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - gene knock out

PLATFORM
GPL9553 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 34.6K CATMA_v5
