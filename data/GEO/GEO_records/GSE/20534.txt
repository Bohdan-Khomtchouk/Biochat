TITLE
Identification of miRNA from Porphyra yezoensis by high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis

ORGANISM
Pyropia yezoensis

SUMMARY
This study provides a first large-scale cloning and characterization of Porphyra miRNAs and their predicted targets. These miRNAs belong to 224 conserved miRNA families and 7 are novel in Porphyra. These miRNAs add to the growing database of new miRNA and lay the foundation for further understanding of miRNA function in the regulation of Porphyra yezoensis development.

DESIGN
We constructed a small RNA library from Porphyra yezoensis.

PLATFORM
GPL15040 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Pyropia yezoensis)
