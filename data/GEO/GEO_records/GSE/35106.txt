TITLE
Polysome-bound mRNA during oocyte maturation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryonic development occur in the absence of gene transcription. Therefore, it is critical to understand at a global level the post-transcriptional events that are driving these transitions. Here, we have used a systems approach by combining polysome mRNA profiling and bioinformatics to identify RNA binding motifs in mRNAs that either enter or exit the polysome pool during mouse oocyte maturation. Association of mRNA with the polysomes correlates with active translation.

DESIGN
Forty-eight hours (h) after PMSG injection, mice were stimulated with hCG for 0, 4, or 14 h, and GV-, MI- and MII-stage oocytes were collected. Polysome-bound mRNAs were purified, reverse-transcribed and linearly amplified with the WT-Ovation FFPE RNA Amplification System V2 (NuGEN). 5Âµg cDNA were fragmented and hybridized with Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430.2 array chips. Experiments were done using 3 independent sample sets.
