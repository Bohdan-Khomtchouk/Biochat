TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of cells of different cycling speed during Yamanaka reprogramming

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotency by Yamanaka factors is usually slow and inefficient, and is thought to be a stochastic process. We identified a privileged somatic cell state, from which acquisition of pluripotency could occur in a non-stochastic manner. Subsets of murine hematopoietic progenitors are privileged, whose progeny cells predominantly adopt the pluripotent fate with activation of endogenous Oct4 locus after 4-5 divisions in reprogramming conditions. Privileged cells display an ultrafast cell cycle of ~8 hours. In fibroblasts, a subpopulation cycling at a similar ultrafast speed is observed after 6 days of factor expression, and is increased by p53-knockdown. This ultrafast-cycling population accounts for > 99% of the bulk reprogramming activity in wildtype or p53-knockdown fibroblasts. We compared the transcriptomes of the fast cycling cells with those of slower hematopoietic progenitors, bulk fibroblasts and established iPS cells.

DESIGN
3-5 replicates for each of the six cell types were included: 4 replicates for established iPS cells, 4 replicates for bulk mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), 4 replicates for fast cycling MEF, 4 replicates for slow cycling MEF, 5 replicates for fast cycling granulocyte monocyte progenitors (GMP) and 3 replicates for slow cycling GMP.
