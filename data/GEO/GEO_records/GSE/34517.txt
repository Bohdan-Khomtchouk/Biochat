TITLE
Cigarette smoking alters mRNA expression in human alveolar macrophages

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Alveolar macrophages from never smokers and active smokers were isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage and gene expression was measured. Chronic cigarette smoke exposure, as occurs in smoker's lungs, leads to significant changes in gene expression.  Of note, RNA was isolated immediately following bronchoscopy. Alveolar macrophage levels were > 95%.

DESIGN
4 never smokers and 4 active smokers were recruited for the study. After bronchoalveolar lavage and RNA isolation, gene expression was measured using Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays.
