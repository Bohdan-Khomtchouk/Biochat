TITLE
Gene expression data from Arabidopsis C24 wild-type and ros1-1 seedlings.

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We carried out a microarray experiment by using Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genechips in order to identify genes that show reduced expression in ros1-1 plants.

DESIGN
2 samples examined: C24 wild-type and ros1-1 mutant (in C24 background).
