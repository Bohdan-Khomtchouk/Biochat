TITLE
Effects of MBTD1 on gene expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The NuA4/TIP60 acetyltransferase complex is a key regulator of genome expression and stability. Here, we identified MBTD1 as a new stable subunit of the complex and gleaned intriguing insights into TIP60’s function. Harboring a histone reader domain for H4K20me1/2, MBTD1 allows TIP60 to associate with specific gene promoters and to promote the repair of DNA double strand breaks by homologous recombination. Total RNA was analyzed on Illumina Human HT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip by McGill University and Genome Québec innovation Centre

DESIGN
CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to produce MBTD1 knockout cells in U2OS and to perform genome-wide expression analysis on three different clones compared to wild type cells.
