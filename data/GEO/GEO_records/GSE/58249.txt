TITLE
Multi-Omic Integrated networks connect DNA methylation and miRNA with skeletal muscle plasticity to chronic exercise in type 2 diabetic obesity [mRNA data]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of skeletal muscle gene expression from type 2 diabetic volunteers before and after 16 weeks of chronic exercise training (two groups, one undergoing aerobic ecercise and the other resistance training exercise)

DESIGN
A biopsy was collected from the right Vastus Lateralis under local anaesthesia and RNA was isolated from muscle (~10 mg) using mirVana™ Kit ,  200 ng RNA from each sample was used for mRNA expression profiling using HumanHT-12_v4_BeadChip (Illumina). Arrays were scanned using HiScanSQ System. Decoded images were analyzed by GenomeStudio™ (Illumina).
