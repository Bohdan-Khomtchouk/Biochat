TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of Rapamycin-treated ptc6 and ptc1ptc6 mutant yeast cells

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We are interested in the study of the sensitivity of yeast cells lacking either the type 1 protein phosphatase Ptc6 or Ptc1 and Ptc6 to the drug rapamycin. In order to carry out our studies, we analyzed the changes in the transcription profile that a short-term incubation with rapamycin (200 ng/mL) has in wild type, ptc6 mutant and ptc1 ptc6 double mutant cells. It has been shown that inhibition of the TOR pathway by treatment with rapamycin has profound effects on the global transcriptional profile. We confirmed the previously described transcription changes induced by the drug in wild type cells and characterized an notable attenuation of the transcriptional response in cells lacking either PTC6 or PTC1 and PTC6 genes.

DESIGN
* First we compared the expression profile of Rapamycin-treated wild type with that of mock-treated cells. There is one biological replicate with two chips (dye swap). Techical replicate: GSM937443, GSM937444 * In the second set of experiments we compared the expression profile of Rapamycin-treated ptc6 mutant cells with that of mock-treated ptc6 mutant cells. We performed one biological replicate in two chips (dye swap). Techical replicate: GSM937471, GSM937472 * In the third set of data we compared the expression profile of Rapamycin-treated ptc1ptc6 double mutant cells with that of mock-treated ptc1 ptc6 mutant cells. There is one biological replicate with two chips (dye swap). Techical replicate: GSM9373476, GSM9373495
