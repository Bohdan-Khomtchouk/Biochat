TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of fosmidomycin and kanamycin

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2

SUMMARY
Expression profiling on a total of 4,391 genes was conducted to identify regulated S. typhimurium genes upon exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the MEP pathway antibiotic fosmidomycin.  These results were subsequently compared to a similar gene expression analysis of subinhibitory exposures of S. typhimurium to the bactericide kanamycin

DESIGN
In this study, S. typhimurium cells in early stage logarithmic growth were exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of fosmidomycin or kanamycin and the expression profile was subsequently analyzed on a platform which assayed 4,391 unique genes.

PLATFORM
GPL17664 NAU-30K_Salmonella_Typhimurium_str_LT2 v1.0
