TITLE
Parental diet affects metabolism, obesity and hypothalamic DNA methylation in Psammomys obesus

ORGANISM
Psammomys obesus

SUMMARY
Using methyl CpG binding domain capture and deep sequencing (MBD-seq) we examined the hypothalamus of offspring of dams and bucks either provided ad libitum a standard rodent diet or a low fat diet before fertilisation and during gestation. The offspring were provided a standard rodent diet.

DESIGN
Examination of the differences in DNA methylation of offspring with different paternal diets.
