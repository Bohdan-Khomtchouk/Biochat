TITLE
A Brief Bout of Exercise Alters Gene Expression and Distinct Gene Pathways in PBMC of Early- and Late-Pubertal Females

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We compared PBMC genomic response to exercise in both early (EG) and late-pubertal girls (LG) Keywords: stress response

DESIGN
Twenty healthy females (age range 8-17 y/o) participated in this study. A blood sample was taken before the onset of exercise and immediately after 30-min exercise bout. PBMCs were isolated using OptiPrep® Density Gradient Medium (SIGMA). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol®.  cRNA was hybridized onto Affymetrix U133+2 arrays (total of 40 chips).
