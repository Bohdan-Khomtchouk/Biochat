TITLE
Expression data from inducible ES stable cell line

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to identify the effects of the induction of the gene of interest on the mouse ES transcriptome, we performed Affymetrix Gene-Chip hybridization experiments for the inducible not-tagged cell line. Transcriptome analysis of the inducible transgenic mouse ES cell line. The E13 inducible cell lines derived from parental EB3 cell line. The cell line EB3 was obtained from the laboratory of Dr Hitoshi Niwa as previously described in (Masui S et al., 2005). Tthe specific mouse gene is E130012A19Rik.

DESIGN
For the analysis on the inducible not-tagged cell line, total RNA was extracted from three biological replicates grown in medium deprived of Tetracycline for 48 hours; RNA extracted from un-induced clones was used as control.
