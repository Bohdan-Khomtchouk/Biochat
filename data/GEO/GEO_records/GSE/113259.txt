TITLE
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in BxPC-3 and S2-007 cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing technology has been carried out in order to compare mRNA expression changes in epithelial BxPC-3 versus mesenchymal S2-007 cells.

DESIGN
To evaluate the changes in gene expression in BxPC-3 and S2-007 cells we have performed RNA-seq in cells growing in standard condition. Three biological replicates for each cell lines were used for expression analysis (6 samples in total).

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
