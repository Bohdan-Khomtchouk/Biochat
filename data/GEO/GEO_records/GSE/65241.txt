TITLE
Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) persistence in Sockeye Salmon: effect on brain transcriptome and response to the viral mimic poly(I:C)

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
To characterise the transcriptional response in brain of Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that were persistently infected with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and to determine whether carrying the IHNV affects the ability to respond to other immunological challenges we compared the brain transcriptome of IHNV carriers, IHNV-negative survivors, and naïve Sockeye Salmon that were never exposed to IHNV. In addition we determined the transcriptional changes among carriers, survivors and naïve fish in their response to the viral mimic polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), using the cGRASP 44K salmon oligoarray.
