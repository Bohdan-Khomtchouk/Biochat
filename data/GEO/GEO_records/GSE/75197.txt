TITLE
Expression changes following combined treatment with RG7388 + GSK2830371

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarray-based gene expression analysis showed that combination treatment with RG7388 and GSK2830371 increases the subset of early RG7388 induced p53-transcriptional target genes.   These findings demonstrate that potent and selective WIP1 inhibition potentiates the response to MDM2 inhibitors in TP53 wild-type cells.

DESIGN
NGP cells were treated for 4 hours with 0.5% DMSO (solvent control), RG7388 (75nM) + GSK2830371 (2.5ÂµM) before cell harvesting and total RNA extraction. Four independent biological repeats were performed.
