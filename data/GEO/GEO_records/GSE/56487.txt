TITLE
Use of an immune-specific microarray for identifying transcriptome profiles associated to VHSV infection or vaccination with a G gene- DNA vaccine in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus)

ORGANISM
Scophthalmus maximus

SUMMARY
With the aim of shedding light on the protection conferred by the DNA vaccines based in the G glycoprotein of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) we have used a specific microarray highly enriched in antiviral sequences to carry out the transcriptomic study associated to VHSV DNA vaccination/infection. The differential gene expression pattern in response to empty plasmid (pMCV1.4) and DNA vaccine (pMCV1.4-G860) intramuscular administration with regard to non-stimulated turbot was analyzed in head kidney at 8, 24 and 72 hours post-vaccination. Moreover, the effect of VHSV infection one month after immunization was also analyzed in vaccinated and non-vaccinated fish at the same time points.

DESIGN
A total number of 204 juvenile turbot were divided into 3 groups, two of them containing 72 fish and the last one 60 fish. Turbot were anaesthetized by immersion in 50 mg/ml buffered tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222; Sigma) and then, fish from the first two groups were intramuscularly (i.m.) injected with 50 µl of PBS containing 2 µg of pMCV1.4 or pMCV1.4-G860. Turbot from the last batch were i.m. inoculated with 50 µl of PBS. At 8, 24 and 72 h after injection, 12 fish were removed from the first two tanks and, at 8 h after PBS inoculation, other 12 fish were taken from the last tank. These turbot were sacrificed by anaesthetic overdose and the head kidney was removed.  Equal amounts of tissue from three fish belonging to the same tank and sampling point were pooled, obtaining 4 biological replicates for each treatment and time point (3 turbot/replicate). The remaining fish (36 in the plasmid-injected groups and 48 in the PBS-inoculated tank) were maintained during one month and then, 12 fish from the PBS injected group were separated to another tank. This new group of fish was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 50 µl of MEM + penicillin and streptomycin + 2% FBS (PBS - MEM group), whereas the other turbot were i.p. infected with a dose of VHSV860 of 5 x 105 TCID50/fish (pMCV1.4 - VHSV and pMCV1.4-G860 - VHSV groups). At 8, 24 and 72 hours after infection, 12 fish were removed from the VHSV-infected tanks, and at 8 h after MEM injection the 12 fish were taken from the non-infected tank. The fish were sacrificed by anaesthetic overdose and the head kidney was removed. Equal amounts of tissue from three fish belonging to the same tank and sampling point were pooled, obtaining 4 biological replicates for treatment and time point (3 turbot/replicate)
