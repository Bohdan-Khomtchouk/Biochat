TITLE
The effect of imatinib therapy on tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in murine gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene expression profile of TAMs sorted from vehicle control tumors in GIST mice (Sommer et al, PNAS 2003) was compared to TAMs sorted from mice after 2 weeks of imatinib therapy The Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 platform was used

DESIGN
Each treatment group had 8 mice. After 2 weeks of treatment, mice were sacrificed and tumors digested with collagenase. TAMs were then FACS sorted and pooled by group. Pooled groups were run in duplicate for the gene expression array.
