TITLE
Identification of genes associated with TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated renal inflammation and fibrosis by RNA sequencing

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this study, we employed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify the Smad3-dependent lncRNAs related to renal inflammation and fibrosis in Smad3 knockout (KO) mouse models of unilateral ureteral obstructive nephropathy (UUO) and immunologically-induced anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis (anti-GBM GN).

DESIGN
12 kidney tissue samples of Smad3 KO/WT mice from normal control, UUO at day 5 or anti-GBM GN at day 10 models (n=2 in each group) for whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing.
