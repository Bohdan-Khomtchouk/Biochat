TITLE
Exposure of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to three humectants used in the food industry: NaCl, KCl and glycerol

ORGANISM
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. ST4/74

SUMMARY
Salmonella Typhimurium was exposed to NaCl, KCl and glycerol (equilibrated to the same water activity) for 1, 6 and 24 h after which the expression profiles were examined using microarray. An non-exposed early stationary phase culture grown in LB medium was used as the control.

DESIGN
Carried out using 3 biological replicates for each sample; each sample hybridised in a two-channel hybridization against Salmonella genomic DNA as the comparator/reference
