TITLE
Response of muscle to stress

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
As muscle function is relevant for the stress response, and as gene array and proteomics analyses have not been conducted to investigate muscle response in stress paradigm in birds, we developed generic approaches to assess molecular bases of muscle response to stress in chicken. Restraint test was chosen as stress situation because this treatment has previously been shown to be a high stressful situation in birds and mammals. Keywords: comparative genomic expression, skeletal muscle, restraint-transport stress, chicken

DESIGN
5 samples
