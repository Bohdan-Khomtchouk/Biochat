TITLE
Gene expression analysis of PBS or IFNalpha treated wt hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This study aimed at identifying the differences in expression levels between HSCs isolated from PBS or IFNa treated mice to determine the mechanism of activation of HSCs by IFNa.

DESIGN
mRNA expression was analyzed from wt HSCs  isolated 16h post PBS/IFNa injection. 3 biological replicates were used per group.
