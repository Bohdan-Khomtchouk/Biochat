TITLE
Haploid embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mammalian haploid embryonic stem cells (haESCs) provide new possibilities for large-scale genetic screens because they bear only one copy of each chromosome. However, haESCs are prone to spontaneous diploidization through unknown mechanisms. Here, we report that a small molecule combination could restrain mouse haESCs from diploidization by impeding exit from na√Øve pluripotency and by shortening the S-G2/M phases. Combined with 2i and PD166285, our chemical cocktail could maintain haESCs in the haploid state for at least five weeks without fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) enrichment of haploid cells. Taken together, we established an effective chemical approach for long-term maintenance of haESCs, and highlighted that proper cell cycle progression was critical for the maintenance of haploid state.
