TITLE
Yeast gene expression profiles of pressure-sensitive mutant strain

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
High hydrostatic pressure causes physical stress to organisms, and it induces growth inhibition and cellular death. For Saccharomyces cerevisiae, more than 150 MPa at room temperature is lethal conditions. To understand the mechanism of pressure inactivation, we isolated pressure-sensitive mutant strain of S. cerevisiae and analyzed genome-wide mRNA expression profiles using DNA microarray. Mutant strain and parent strain were grown in YPD medium at 30Â°C for 48 h.

DESIGN
Series contains four hybridization results from independent biological samples respectively in both strains of pressure-sensitive mutant strain and that parent strain.
