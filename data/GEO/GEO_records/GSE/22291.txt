TITLE
Timecourse expression data from sciatic nerve distal stump of C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 OlaHsd-Wlds mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Wallerian degeneration (WD) involves the fragmentation of axonal segments disconnected from their cell bodies, segmentation of the myelin sheath, and removal of debris by Schwann cells and immune cells. The removal and downregulation of myelin-associated inhibitors of axonal regeneration and synthesis of growth factors by these two cell types are critical responses to successful nerve repair. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome of the sciatic nerve of mice carrying the Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) mutant gene, a gene that confers axonal protection in the distal stump after injury, therefore causing significant delays in WD, neuroinflammation, and axonal regeneration.

DESIGN
56 C57BL6 mice and 56 C57BL/6 OlaHsd-Wlds mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and underwent a microcrush lesion of their left sciatic nerve at the mid-thigh level (exept naive mice, t0). At 0, 3, 7 and 14 days post-injury, mice were anesthetized and killed by cervical dislocation.   Sciatic nerves were collected and conective tissue removed. A 4-mm long sciatic nerve segment was taken from the nerve distal stump, starting at 1 mm distal from the lesion up to 5 mm distal. Distal nerve stumps were pooled by group and RNA extracted. Samples were hybridized to GeneChipÂ® Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). Biological replicate was done.
