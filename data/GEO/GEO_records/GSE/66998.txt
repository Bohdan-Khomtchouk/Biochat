TITLE
LncRNA  Sequencing Analysis of Mouse spermatogonial stem cells during Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor（GDNF）treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides and have little or no potential for translation. More and more studies have domenstrated mammalian lncRNAs are intrinsically functional and growing data indicate lncRNAs are determinants of stem cell fate by regulating potency, self-renewal and differentiation. There is no report of lncRNAs in spermatogonial stem cells（SSCs）, and importance of lncRNAs in germline linage stem cell has not been investigated yet. here, we presents a large –scale profiling of all lncRNAs in SSCs as well as those lncRNAs regulated by SSC dependent growth factor GDNF through high throughput sequencing.

DESIGN
Spermatogonial stem cells were first suffered from an 18 hr GDNF withdrawal followed by refreshment with GDNF for 8 hrs and RNA samples were collected from normal culture wells (N), GDNF 18hr withdrawal wells (0hr), and GDNF 8 hr refreshed cells (8hr). After all GDNF treatment, cultured germ cell clumps were gently blowed with a 200μl pipette, and followed by Total RNA isolation and sequencing by Illumina HiSeqTM 2000
