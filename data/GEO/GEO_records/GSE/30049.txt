TITLE
Expression data comparing the effect of IKK2 KO on a KRAS mouse model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Given that the NF-κB pathway plays an important role in tumor development and that IKK2 is the seminal kinase responsible for NF-κB pathway activation, we were particularly interested in exploring the therapeutic potential of IKK2 inhibition in non-small cell lung cancers. We crossed IKK2fl/fl and KrasG12D mice so that we could simultaneously activate KrasG12D to initiate tumor formation and inactivate IKK2, upon transduction by Cre lentiviral vectors.

DESIGN
RNA isolated from finely dissected tumor nodules and tumor cell lines (4A3 and1D3) was applied to microarray analysis using Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 STArrays according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
