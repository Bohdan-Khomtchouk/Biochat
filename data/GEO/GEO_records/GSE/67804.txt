SUMMARY
Relationship between miRNAs and SCLC have not been investigated thoroughly. Thus we design this expirment tying to find out the miRNAs involved in SCLC metastasis.

DESIGN
We used 6 patients' serum samples,two-condition experiment. 3 of them were form extensive-stage SCLC patients, and another 3 were from limited-stage SCLC patients.
