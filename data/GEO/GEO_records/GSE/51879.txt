TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of WT and larp1 mutant 21 days old seedling at 20째C or following a heat stress (15 min at 38째C)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We report the identification of a heat-stress mediated mRNA decay in arabidopsis that is mediated by the XRN4 exonuclease and LARP1 RNA-binding protein.

DESIGN
mRNA population in WT and larp1 mutant at 20째C or 15 min at 38째C

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
