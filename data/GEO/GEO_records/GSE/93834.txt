TITLE
Compute the Significant Interactions of Hi-C data through HOMER

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Purpose: We can explain the related biological significance from the enhanced proximity in the Hi-C data. Methods: 1. Look for pairs of regions that have more Hi-C reads between them than would be expected by chance.  2.The expected number of reads is calculated using the background model. Result: We found 261,758 significant interactions from H1 cell line and 133,169 significant interactions from IMR90 cell line.

DESIGN
Significant interactions of Hi-C data from two cell lines. Hi-C data are used from GSE43070.
