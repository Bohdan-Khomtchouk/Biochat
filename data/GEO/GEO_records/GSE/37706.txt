TITLE
Effects of the long noncoding RNA Malat1 on gene expression [MoEx-1_0-st]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Malat1 is an abundant long noncoding RNA that localizes to nuclear bodies known as nuclear speckles, which contain a distinct set of pre-mRNA processing factors. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that Malat1 interacts with pre-mRNA splicing factors, including the serine- and arginine-rich (SR) family of proteins, and regulates a variety of biological processes, including cancer cell migration, synapse formation, cell cycle progression, and responses to serum stimulation. To address the physiological function of Malat1 in a living organism, we generated Malat1-KO (KO) mice using homologous recombination. Unexpectedly, the Malat1-KO mice were viable and fertile, showing no apparent phenotypes. Nuclear speckle markers were also correctly localized in cells that lacked Malat1. However, the cellular levels of another long noncoding RNA, Neat1, which is an architectural component of nuclear bodies known as paraspeckles, were downregulated in a particular set of tissues and cells lacking Malat1. To address if the absence of Malat1 affects the expression of other genes, including other long noncoding RNA, microarrays were used to study the impact of knocking-out Malat1 on global gene expression in hippocampal neurons.

DESIGN
Hippocampi were dissected from two sets of wildtype and Malat1 knock-out mice and RNA from these neurons were hybridized to Affymetix mouse exon array. Individual animals from each pairs of wildtype and knock-out are littermates.
