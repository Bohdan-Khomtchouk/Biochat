TITLE
Expression data from patients of idiopathic portal hypertension

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) is characterized by portal hypertension due to obstruction or stenosis of the intrahepatic peripheral portal branches. Researchers have suggested that IPH may be attributed to intrahepatic peripheral portal vein thrombosis, splenic factors, abnormal autoimmunity, and related factors, however, the etiology of IPH remains unclear. We used microarrays to identify the functions of genes expressed in blood samples from patients with IPH.

DESIGN
In order to examine the specific expression of genes in patients with IPH, we analyzed blood samples from three patients with IPH and three healthy volunteers as control using DNA microarrays.
