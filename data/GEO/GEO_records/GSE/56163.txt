TITLE
To screen miRNA expression of SP and MP cells in mutiply myeloma by miRNA array

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better understand the molecular mechanisms of SP cells, we screened the miRNAs expression patterns in the SP compared with the MP cells. MiRCURY™ LNA array analysis of sorted SP and MP cells from two relapsed myeloma patients with more than 70% bone marrow plasma cells were performed.

DESIGN
In order to identify the miRNA patten between SP and MP cells, the samples were labeled using the miRCURY™ Hy3™/Hy5™ Power labeling kit (Exiqon) and hybridized on the miRCURY™ LNA Array (v.16.0).

PLATFORM
GPL11434 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 6th generation - hsa, mmu & rno
