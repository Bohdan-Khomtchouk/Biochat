DamID from Drosophila CNS with Dam fused FruMA, FruMB, FruMC.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In Drosophila,male courtship behaviour serves as an excellent paradigm to study how innate behaviors are controlled by the nervous system. These behaviors are in large part regulated by the gene fruitless (fru). fru encodes a set of putative transcription factors that promote male sexual behaior by controlling the development of sexually-dimorphic neuronal circuitry. Little is known about how Fru proteins function at the level of transcriptional regulation. To characterize the roles of fru sex-specific isoforms in specifying male behavior, we generated novel isoform-specific mutants, and used a genomic approach to identify direct Fru isoform targets during development. We demonstrate that all Fru isoforms directly target genes involved in the development of the nervous system, with individual isoforms exhibiting unique binding specificities. We observe that fru behavioral phenotypes are specificed by either a single, or combination, of isoforms. Finally, we illustrate the utility of these data for the identification of novel sexually dimorphic genoic enhancers, and novel downstream regulators of male-sexual behavior.
