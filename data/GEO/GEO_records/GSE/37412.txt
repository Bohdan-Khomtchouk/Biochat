TITLE
Placental Growth Factor/Nrp-1 signaling is required for medulloblstoma growth

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we present that growth of medulloblastoma is dependent on PlGF/Nrp-1 signaling. PlGF and Nrp-1 are expressed across different molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma. Data presented here are part of a combined molecular effort to subclassify our medulloblastoma cohort according to current molecular criteria (Taylor et al., 2011). Furthermore, we include aCGH of two medulloblastoma cell lines that were used as models in our experiments.

DESIGN
Analyses were performed on 32 archival specimens of medulloblastoma, WHO Grade IV, seen at the Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital from 1998 to 2009. aCGH data included are for two medulloblastoma cell lines, D283 and D341, and 6 clinical cases for which DNA (good quantity and quality) was available.
