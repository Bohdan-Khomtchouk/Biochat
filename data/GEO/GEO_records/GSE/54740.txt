TITLE
Effect on peripheral blood gene expression profile of lenalidomide plus rituximab in patients with follicular lymphoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Peripheral blood was collected into PAXgene tubes from 7 patients with follicular lymphoma, in a phase 2 clinical trial of lenalidomide plus rituximab as initial therapy for advanced-stage indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Blood was collected at baseline and on Day 15 of the second 28-day cycle, for determination of the gene expression profile after globin mRNA reduction.

DESIGN
The effect of treatment on gene expression profiles was largely based on the paired t test, using the Significance Analysis of Microarrays method.
