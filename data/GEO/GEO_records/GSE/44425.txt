TITLE
Global gene expression analysis of human embryonic stem cells, adult fibroblasts, and CD34+ cord blood (CB) cells before, during, and after generation of stromal primed and non-stromal primed episomal induction of pluripotency

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global gene expression analysis of (a) human embryonic stem cells, (b) adult fibroblasts with and without nucleofection of SOKM, (c) CD34+ cord blood cells at various time points during induction of pluripotency with SOKM, with or without co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), and (d) resulting stromal primed and non-stromal primed cord blood CD34+ myeloid iPSC

DESIGN
Total RNA was harvested from adult fibroblasts, adult fibroblasts three days after nucleofection with 4F (SOKM),  human myeloid progenitors: Non-nucloefected CD34+ Day -3 unstimulated cord blood (CB) cells, Day 0 growth factor stimulated CB cells, Day +3 CB cells with or without nucleofection at Day zero and with or without Day zero to Day +3 co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), followed by FACS-purification of CD45+ myeloid progenitors, Day 23 CB cells nucleofected on day zero and co-cultured on BMSC from Day Zero to Day +3, undifferentiated H9 human embryonic stem cells, and low passage episomal stromal-primed iPSC derived from growth-factor activated CD34+ myeloid progenitors from cord blood or GCSF mobilized peripheral blood. Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchips were used for all samples in this series. Three independent samples of each condition were each run on individual microarrays.
