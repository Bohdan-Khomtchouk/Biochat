TITLE
Low Risk and High Risk Mouse Skin Carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse skin carcinogenesis experiments suggest upon carcinogen treatment and promotion on mouse skin there arise at least two populations of tumors. One population has a higher incidence of progression from benign papilloma to a squamous cell carcinoma. Further studies have shown that a certain carcinogenesis protocol can select for these high risk tumors. These microarray experiments aim to reveal the genetic signatures of the low risk and high risk papilloma. Keywords: Genetic Signatures
