TITLE
Analysis of classical and migratory DC from the skin draining LNs of Flt3L treated mice and comparison to LPS treated DC from skin draining LN and peritoneal macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the differential transcriptome of DC derived from tissue vs. LN origin. The overall hypothesis is these data would reveal how migratory DC may be differently programmed from classical DC and might also suggest difference within migratory DC subsets relating to function.

DESIGN
RNA obtained from migratory DC subsets and classical CD8a DC isolated by flow cytometry sorting from skin draining LNs of Flt3L treated mice or LPS treated mice
