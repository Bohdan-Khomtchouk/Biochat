TITLE
The Zinc Finger Transcription Factor Sp9 Is Required for the Development of Striatopallidal Projection Neurons

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purpose: To assess changes in gene expression profiles from the P0 littermate Sp9Flox/Flox control striatum (including SVZ) and conditional mutant striatum of Drd2-Cre; Sp9Flox/Flox mice. Methods: total RNA was isolated and sequenced from the striatum of the P0 littermate Sp9Flox/Flox control or conditional mutant striatum of Drd2-Cre; Sp9Flox/Flox mice in triplicate using an Illumina high-seq 2500. Raw data was analyzed using TopHat. Genes were considered changed which demonstrated fold-change > =2, and p value < =0.05. Changed genes were then filtered to reveal Sp9 downstream targets which were altered in vivo due to the loss of Sp9 expression. Results: 179 genes were significantly increased and 147 genes were significantly decreased in expression level due to the loss of Sp9 expression.
