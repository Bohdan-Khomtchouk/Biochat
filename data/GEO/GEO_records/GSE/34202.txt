TITLE
Transcript profiling of Arabidopsis plasma membrane proton pump mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plasma membrane proton pump maintains proton electrochemical gradient and provides energy to secondary transporters. Arabidopsis mutant plants with reduced proton pump activity grow normal under ideal growth conditions; however their growth are reduced compared with wildtype plants when placed under the conditions that stress on protonmotive force (high external pH or high external potassium).

DESIGN
Seedlings of wildtype, aha1, and aha2 mutant plants were grown under ideal growth condition. Total RNA from those seedlings were subjected to transcriptome analyses using Affymetrix Gene Chip.
