SUMMARY
Transcriptome of specific cell types residing in human subcutaneous adipose tissue

DESIGN
White adipose tissue (WAT) from 3 lean and 3 overweight-obese patients was collagenase treated and adipocytes were separated from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF). SVF was then FACS sorted for the following fractions CD45-/CD34+/CD31- (progenitor), CD45+/CD14+/CD206+ (total macrophages), CD45+/CD14+/CD206+/CD11c+ (M1 macrophages), CD45+/CD14+/CD206+/CD11c- (M2 macrophages), CD45+/CD3+ (total T cells), CD45+/CD3+/CD4+/CD8- (Th T-cells), CD45+/CD3+/CD4-/CD8+ (Tc T-cells). RNA was isolated from all these fractions as well as from adipocytes and analyzed on the Affymetrix Human ClariomTMD microarray.
