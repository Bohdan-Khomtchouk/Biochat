TITLE
TLR9 deficiency promotes CD73 expression in T cells and diabetes protection in NOD mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analyze the effect of TLR9 deficiency on immue cell function at the gene expression level. Our hypothesis was that TLR9 deficiency promotes CD73 expression in T cells thus regulates autoimmune diabetes development in NOD mice.

DESIGN
Sorted TCRb+ cells were pooled from several mice for furhter RNA extraction and cRNA labeling.
