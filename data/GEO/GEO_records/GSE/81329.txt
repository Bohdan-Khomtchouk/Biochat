TITLE
MEIS2 is a novel oncogenic partner in AML1-ETO positive AML [RNA-Seq mouse]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MEIS2 collaborates with AML1-ETO in inducing acute myeloid leukemia in a murine bone marrow transplantation model

DESIGN
We employed RNA-seq to assess similarities/differences among murine leukemic bone marrow samples transduced with either AML1-ETO/Meis2, AML1-ETO9a/Meis2, or AML1-ETO9a

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
