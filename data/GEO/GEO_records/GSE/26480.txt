TITLE
Gene microarray experiments on RNA samples isolated from murine B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
This laboratory studies 1) enzymes which are involved in selectin ligand formation in leukocytes, 2) how expression of those enzymes is controlled, and 3) basic cell biology of FucT-VII.

DESIGN
B cells vs. plasma cells. Study of primary IgG plasma cells. Plasma cells constitute the final stage of B-cell differentiation, and their migration from the lymph nodes and spleen to bone marrow is thought to be an important step in the maintenance of a long-term antibody response to a pathogen. Dr. Kansas has purified primary IgG plasma cells from E-selectin/P-selectin double knockout mice by a negative selection technique and compared their gene expression profile to that of murine B cells using Affymetrix murine oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Highly distinct gene expression profiles were revealed (see Underhill GH et al, Blood. 2003;101:4013-4021). As a follow-up to that experiment, the same probes (in triplicate) derived from primary murine IgG plasma cells and normal B cells were used to probe Glyco-gene Chips. As a follow-up to that experiment, the same probes (in triplicate) derived from primary murine IgG plasma cells and normal B cells were used to probe Glyco-gene Chips.
