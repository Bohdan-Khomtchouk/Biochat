TITLE
Chip-chip from Mouse E10.5 anterior and posterior immortalised limb cell lines and limb tissue for H3K27me3 antibody and from Mouse E10.5 anterior and posterior limb tissue for Ring1B antibody.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Anterior-posterior differences in H3K27me3 and Ring1B enrichment over the 5 prime Hoxd genes in E10.5 murine distal forelimbs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of H3K27me3 together with Ring1B and by ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated that over the 5 prime HoxD locus H3K27me3 enrichment is decreased and Ring1B enrichment is sparse in limb cells derived from the distal posterior forelimb bud of E10.5 mouse embryos.

DESIGN
Array design includes 2 biological replicates for H3K27me3 in the cell lines and Ring1B in the limb tissue, and 2 biological replicates and 2 dye swap replicates for H3K27me3 in the limb tissue.

PLATFORM
GPL14936 NimbleGen_mouse(MM9)_Hox plus array [Design_ID:11926]
