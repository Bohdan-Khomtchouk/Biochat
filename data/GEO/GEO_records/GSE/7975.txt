TITLE
circadian cycle-The impact of some genes mutations implicated in the amidon metabolism

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
af30_starch_circadian_rythm - circadian cycle - The scientific aim is to study the impact of some genes mutations implicated in the amidon metabolism on the expression profils of other genes and in particular those of the carbonated metabolism. Those analyses will be done from RNAs (total or messenger) extracted from leaves at various time of the day and the night - The first experiments will deal with the wild reference plant (WS) . The RNAm of leaves would be harvested according to day and night hours. Some harvesting will be done every 3 hours during a 24H period (so 10 different points ). This correspond to a total of 20 slides ( 2 samples and 1 swap per point). This account have been done according to the informations obtained from JJ Leguay in dec 2002 Keywords: time course

DESIGN
10 dye-swap - CATMA arrays

PLATFORM
GPL5336 URGV Arabidopsis thaliana 25K CATMA_v2
