TITLE
Targeting the MLL complex in castration-resistant prostate cancer [expression]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Resistance to androgen deprivation therapies and increased androgen receptor (AR) activity are major drivers of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Prior work has focused on targeting AR directly; however, the identification and targeting of co-activators of AR signaling remains an underexplored area. Here we demonstrate that the MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) complex, a well-known contributor in MLL-fusion-positive leukemia, acts as a co-activator of AR signaling. AR interacts with the MLL complex via its subunit, menin. Small molecule inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction blocks AR signaling and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, we find that menin is up-regulated in CRPC and high expression correlates with poor overall survival. Our study identifies the MLL complex as a co-activator of AR that can be targeted in advanced prostate cancer.

DESIGN
ASH2L / Menin / MLL1 were knocked down using shRNA /siRNA in two prostate cancer cell lines, VCaP and LNCaP.
