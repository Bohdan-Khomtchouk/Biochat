TITLE
N6-Methyldeoxyadenosine Marks Active Transcription Start Sites in Chlamydomonas

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
N6-methyldeoxyadenosine (6mA or m6A) is a DNA modification preserved in prokaryotes to eukaryotes. It is widespread in bacteria, and functions in DNA mismatch repair, chromosome segregation, and virulence regulation. In contrast, the distribution and function of 6mA in eukaryotes have been unclear. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the 6mA landscape in the genome of Chlamydomonas using new sequencing approaches. We identified the 6mA modification in 84% of genes in Chlamydomonas. We found that 6mA mainly locates at ApT dinucleotides around transcription start sites (TSS) with a bimodal distribution, and appears to mark active genes. A periodic pattern of 6mA deposition was also observed at base resolution, which is associated with nucleosome distribution near the TSS, suggesting a possible role in nucleosome positioning. The new genome-wide mapping of 6mA and its unique distribution in the Chlamydomonas genome suggest potential regulatory roles of 6mA in gene expression in eukaryotic organisms.

DESIGN
Multiple sequencing methods are developed to profile the distribution of 6mA in Chlamydomonas including MeDIP-Seq, enzyme-treated DNA-Seq, MNase-Seq and RNA-Seq.
