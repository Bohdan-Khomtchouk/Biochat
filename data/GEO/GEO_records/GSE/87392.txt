TITLE
Comparison of Eomes-negative and Eomes-positive human liver NK cells by RNASeq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We sorted Eomes-negative NK cells (CD3- CD56+ CXCR6- CD16-) and Eomes-positive NK cells (CD3- CD56+ CXCR6+) from total leukocytes isolated from the perfusion fluid of five healthy human livers destined for transplantation. Total RNA was extracted from sorted cells, cDNA generated and RNASeq performed.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA levels in paired Eomes-negative/Eomes-positive NK cells from the same donor.

PLATFORM
