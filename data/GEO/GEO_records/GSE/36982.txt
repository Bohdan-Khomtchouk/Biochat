TITLE
MicroRNA profiling of primary high-grade soft tissue sarcomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This screening revealed unique miRNA expression patterns for synovial sarcomas , myxoid liposarcomas, and leiomyosarcomas, and defined unique sets of miRNAs discriminating the different liposarcoma subtypes from non-neoplastic adipose tissue.

DESIGN
We performed a comprehensive miRNA expression analysis in a series of 76 untreated, primary high-grade soft tissue sarcomas representing eight subtypes, and in 15 sarcoma cell lines using microarray technology. Additionally, two normal fat samples were analysed.
