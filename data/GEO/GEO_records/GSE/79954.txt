TITLE
Differential expression of miR-4520a associated with gain-of-function mutations in Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We knocked down the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene by RNA interference (siRNA) in human myelomonocytic cells that express endogenous pyrin, aiming to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that are differentially expressed in siMEFV treated cells. The purpose of this study was to better understand the pathophysiology of FMF, through the identification of novel miRNAs involved in the regulation of MEFV.
