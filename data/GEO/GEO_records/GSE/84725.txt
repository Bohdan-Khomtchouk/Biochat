TITLE
DKK3 overexpression increases malignant property in  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma-derived HSC-3 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We hypothesized that DKK3 may exert oncogenic function supecifically in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). DKK3 overexpression in HNSCC cell resulted in elevated cellular proliferation, migration, invasion and in vivo tumor growth. This elevated malignant properties was not driven by Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

DESIGN
Single analysis for each condition (HSC-3 no transfection, HSC-3 GFP transfection and HSC-3 DKK3 transfection)
