TITLE
total RNA-seq from HT1080 (ENCSR535VTR)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The libraries contained in this experiment come from independent growths of cell line HT-1080, a connective tissue fibrosarcoma from a 35 year old male.  They are stranded PE101 Illumina Hi-Seq libraries from rRNA-depleted Total RNA > 200 nucleotides in size.
