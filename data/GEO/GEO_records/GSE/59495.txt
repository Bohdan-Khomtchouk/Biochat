TITLE
Microarray Analysis of Microcystin-LR

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Microcystins are produced by the cyanobacteria, most commonly Microcystis aerµginosa. Upon ingestion, toxic microcystins are actively absorbed by fish, birds and mammals where they are primarily liver toxins.

DESIGN
Groups of 4-6 rats were exposed to 0, 1, 10, 50 or 100 µg/kg microcystin-LR for 0.5, 1, 3 or 6 hours and gene expression analysis performed on liver with samples hybridized to whole rat genome RG230_2.0 GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix, CA).

PLATFORM
GPL1355 [Rat230_2] Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array
