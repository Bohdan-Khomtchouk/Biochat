ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The PARK2 gene was knocked down using 2 independent siRNAs in SNB19 and SF539 cell lines A non-targeted scramble siRNA was used as the control.

DESIGN
Scramble, PARK2 siRNA#1 or PARK2 siRNA#2 was transfected into each cell line, in duplicate, and RNA analyzed using the Affymetrix U133A 2.0 platform.
