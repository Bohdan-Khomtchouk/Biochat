TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of cellulolytic fungus Penicillium oxalicum and its sporogenesis related genes deletion strains

ORGANISM
Penicillium oxalicum

SUMMARY
RNA-seq was used to compare differential gene expressions for Penicillium oxalicum wild type strain (M12) and sporognesis related genes knock out strains.The goals of this study are to construct the sporogenesis regulation pathway of Penicillium oxalicum.

DESIGN
Examination of differential gene expressions by digital gene expression tag profiling in Penicillium oxalicum wild type strain and nine mutant strains (flbA knoutout strain, flbB knoutout strain, flbC knoutout strain, flbD knoutout strain, flbE knoutout strain,wetA knoutout strain, abaA knoutout strain,stuA knoutout strain, swi6 knoutout strain)

PLATFORM
GPL20250 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Penicillium oxalicum)
