TITLE
Gene expression profiling of dsDNA-transfected reconstituted mouse embryonic fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of dsDNA-induced innate immune response at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in this study was that K224R mutation significantly inhibits hSTING activity. Results provide important information of the response of hSTING and its variants to cytosolic dsDNA, such as induction of type I IFN genes and proinflammatory cytokine genes.

DESIGN
Sting-/- MEFs were reconstituted with wild type hSTING, hSTING-K224R or hSTING-K289R. Total RNA obtained from dsDNA-transfected MEFs was compared to mock-transfected MEFs.

PLATFORM
