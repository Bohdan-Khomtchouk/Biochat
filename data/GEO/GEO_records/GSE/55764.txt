TITLE
Expression data from the transplanted mouse islets into hyperglycemic and normoglycemic mice at 6 hours post-transplantation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
insulin treatment protects islets from the initial rapid loss that is usually observed after transplantation and positively affects the outcome of islet transplantation in Akita mice. To study the molecular mechanism underlying the improved islet survival, expression profile analyses was performed to analyze the differences between the grafts transplanted into hyperglycemic and normoglycemic mice at 6 hours post-transplantation

DESIGN
Cells were harvested at grafts for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We performed gene expression profiles of the transplanted mouse islets into hyperglycemic and normoglycemic mice at 6 hours post-transplantation
