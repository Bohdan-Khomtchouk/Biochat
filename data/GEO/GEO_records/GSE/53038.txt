TITLE
Expression profiling in LIN28A, SET7/9, and TUT4 depleted H9 cells, or in the silent mutations (siR) of  LIN28A and LIN28A-K135R overexpressed H9 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A developmentally regulated RNA binding protein, LIN28A and its homolog LIN28B may share a similar mechanism to regulate the processing of let-7 microRNAs (miRNAs) in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or certain cancer cells, although their predominant localization is different in cells. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of LIN28A for miRNA processing in the nucleus. Here, we show that SET7/9, a known histone methyltransferase, associates with LIN28A in vivo and in vitro. SET7/9-mediated methylation significantly leads to the nuclear retention and protein stability of LIN28A, and remarkably regulated RNA binding ability of LIN28A to pri-let-7. Using RNAi knockdown approach, we find that the methylated nuclear form of LIN28A may function in the nucleoli by sequestering the primary let-7 miRNA to block their processing through a Tut4 (Zcchc11)-independent mechanism to regulate human ESC pluripotency. We propose a new insight toward the understanding of the molecular mechanism for post-translational methylation of nuclear LIN28A along modulating pluripotency by regulating pri-let-7 miRNAs in human ESCs.

DESIGN
Expression expression changes upon depletion of LIN28A, SET7/9, or TUT4 in H9 human embryonic stem cells, or in the silent mutations of LIN28A and LIN28A-K135R overexpressed H9 human embryonic stem cells. H9 was tracked by microarray profiling.
