TITLE
Liver adapts mitochondrial function to insulin-resistant and diabetic states in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Objective: To study if diabetic and insulin-resistant states lead to mitochondrial dysfunction in the liver, or alternatively, if there is adaption of mitochondrial function to these states in the long-term range. Results: High-fat diet (HFD) caused insulin resistance and severe hepatic lipid accumulation, but respiratory chain parameters were unchanged. Livers from insulin-resistant IR/IRS-1+/- mice had normal lipid contents and normal respiratory chain parameters, however showed mitochondrial uncoupling. Livers from severely hyperglycemic and hypoinsulimic, streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice had massively depleted lipid levels, but respiratory chain abundance was unchanged. However, their mitochondria showed increased abundance and activity of the respiratory chain, which was better coupled compared to controls. Conclusions: Insulin resistance, either induced by obesity or by genetic manipulation, does not cause mitochondrial dysfunction in the liver of mice. However, severe insulin deficiency and high blood glucose levels in mice cause an enhanced performance of the respiratory chain, probably in order to maintain the high energy requirement of the unsuppressed gluconeogenesis.

DESIGN
We performed gene expression microarray analysis on liver tissue derived from mice treated with STZ or standard diet (control).
