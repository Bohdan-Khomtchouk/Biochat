TITLE
Effect of DNA extraction method on brain DNA copy number estimation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analysed DNA from two brain regions (cerebellum, CER and frontal cortex, FC) from 4 Parkinson's disease (PD) and 4 control brains on a custom design 8x60k Agilent aCGH targeted to PD genes. All brain DNA samples were hybridised with Agilent sex-matched reference DNA, and three CER samples were hybridised against the FC of the same brain, with a dye swap in one. Male and female reference DNA were hybridised to eachother. The samples were then re-extracted with additional protocols, and hybridisations were performed for two CER samples betwen DNA extracted from the same CER with different protocols, and for one brain between the CER and FC new extraction.

DESIGN
DNA from two regions of 8 brains, hybridised to reference DNA or brain DNA from different region / different extraction protocol

PLATFORM
GPL20732 Agilent-058369 Homo sapiens PD genes aug13 array
