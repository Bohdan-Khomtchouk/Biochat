TITLE
Differential gene expression in BALB/c Npc1-/- and Npc1+/+ cerebellum

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Purkinje cells (PC) of the cerebellum degenerate in adult mice with mutations in the Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease 1 (Npc1) gene. We subjected BALB/c Npc1+/+ and Npc1-/- mouse cerebella from an early and a later time point of PC degeneration to a genome-wide microarray gene expression analysis. We found general underrepresentation of PC-specific transcripts, consistent with PC loss, and elevated markers of microglia activation at the later time point. Keywords: Niemann-Pick type C, Purkinje cell degeneration
