TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of Mtb-infected THP1 cells in response to resveratrol treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of resveratrol-treated cells at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that resveratrol can improve Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) treatment. Results provide important information of the host response to Mtb infection when given resveratrol, such as resveratrol-mediated modulation of inflammatory pathways induced upon infection.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from Mtb-infected THP1 cells subjected to resveratrol treatment or not, and compared to uninfected THP1 cells over 24 hours.
