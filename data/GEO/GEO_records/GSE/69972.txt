TITLE
Chromosome-wide DNA unmethylome profiling examining human chromosomes 2, 9, 19 and mouse chromosomes 1, 9, 19

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The unmodified DNA fraction of jejunal enterocytes and the jejunum lacking enterocytes of humans and jejunal enterocytes of mice was interrogated on Affymetrix tiling arrays

DESIGN
The mTAG technique was used to enrich the unmodified DNA fraction in a total of 56 humans and 26 mice
