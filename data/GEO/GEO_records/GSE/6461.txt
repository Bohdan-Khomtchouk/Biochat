TITLE
SYT-SSX murine synovial sarcoma model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The human SYT-SSX fusion protein was expressed in a developmentally dependent fashion in murine myoblasts.  Tumors harvested from mice in adolescence were compared to normal mouse skeletal muscle samples. Keywords: tumor versus normal muscle tissue

DESIGN
Murine tumors were excised from affected mice for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. For control samples normal mouse skeletal muscle tissue was obtained and RNA extracted for hybridization to the Affymetrix arrays.
