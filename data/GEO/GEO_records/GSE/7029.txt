TITLE
Zfp90 Transgenic Signature in Mouse White Adipose Tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the murine white adipose expression traits that were changed in response to over expressing Zfp90. Keywords: single gene perturbation signature

DESIGN
White adipose tissue from five wild type B6 mice and from three Zfp90 transgenic mice were arrayed against a pool of white adipose tissue from all mice.  All samples were hybridized as fluor-reverse pairs, and then the data between the pairs was combined to form a single experiment.
