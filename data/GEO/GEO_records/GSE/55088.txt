TITLE
miRNA expression data from callus in standard fracture healing models and from fibrous tissues in nonunion models in rats on post-fracture day 14

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Profiling of miRNA expressions comparing standard fracture healing models with nonunion models in rats

DESIGN
12w, male, Spragueâ€“Dawley rats were used in this study. Animals were randomized to receive either a surgical treatment that has been shown to produce a nonunion or to a standard stabilized closed femoral shaft fracture that is known to successfully heal. The details of these procedures have been previously described. Briefly, to produce standard healing models, a 1.2-mm diameter K-wire was inserted retrograde into the right femoral intramedullary canal and a closed transverse femoral shaft fracture was produced using a three-point bending apparatus with a drop weight . To produce the nonunion, the fractured site was additionally exposed, and the periosteum was cauterized circumferentially for a distance of 2 mm on each side of the fracture . Five animals from each group were euthanized on post-fracture day 14 for microarray analysis.
