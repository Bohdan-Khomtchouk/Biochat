TITLE
To study gene expression of PHO13 deleted Xylose isomerase (XI) harboring strain in xylose fermentation

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The main objective is to improve xylose fermentation by deletion of PHO13 gene in Xylose isomerase (XI) harboring yeast strains. Microarray analysis was performed to investigate effects of PHO13 deletion on the gene expression prolife of xylose-fermenting strains.

DESIGN
Samples for 2 strains (control, PHO13 deleted strain) were taken after 9h of xylose fermentation.  Each samples were triplicated resulting in total of 6 samples.

PLATFORM
GPL9294 Agilent-015072 Yeast Oligo Microarray 4x44K G2519F (Probe Name version)
