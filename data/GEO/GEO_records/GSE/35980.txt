TITLE
MicroRNA expression data from IL13-induced allergic airway inflammation of mice lungs

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
Epigenetic changes have been implicated in pathogenesis of asthma. We sought to determine if IL13, a key cytokine in airway inflammation and remodeling, induced miRNAs expression changes in the airways in conjunction with its transcriptional gene regulation. For our studies, we used a well-characterized transgenic mouse model of allergic airway inflammation induced by IL13. In this model, IL13 is conditionally overexpressed in the mouse lung when treated with doxycycline. Upon IL13 induction, these mice showed inflammatory cell infiltration, pronounced emphysema, increased pulmonary compliance, lung volume enlargement, mucus metaplasia, and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases and cathepsins in the lung.
