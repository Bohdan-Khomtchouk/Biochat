TITLE
Gene expression of T47D-MTVL human breast cancer cells upon H1.4 knock-down or overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression of T47D-MTVL human breast cancer cells expressing Dox-inducible shRNAs against histone H1.4 (sh120) or multiple H1 variants (sh225), or overexpressing WT or K26A mutant HA-tagged H1.4.

DESIGN
T47D-MTVL, breast cancer cell line carrying one stably integrated copy of luciferase reporter gene driven by the MMTV promoter, is stably infected with an inducible system for the expression of shRNAs.Cells stably express RedFP and KRAB repressor fused to Tet regulator.Upon Dox treatment, cells express RedFP and the cloned shRNA. Stable breast cancer-derived cell lines expressing an shRNA against one of each of the histone H1 isoforms in response to doxycycline (Dox) were grown for six days in the presence or absence of Dox, in duplicate, and RNA extracted for microarray hybridization. Cell lines used: inducible shRNA against  H1.4 or  multiple H1 variants, and random shRNA-expression vector. Stable breast cancer-derived cell lines expressing  the histone H1.4 isoform, WT or K26A, HA-tagged, in duplicate, and RNA extracted for microarray hybridization. Cell lines used: overexpressing  H1.4 WT or  K26A mutant.
