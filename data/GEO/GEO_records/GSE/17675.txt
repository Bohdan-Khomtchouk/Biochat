TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis ppi2 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis ppi2 plants have a T-DNA insertion in atToc159 and thus display a severe defect in protein import into chloroplasts. These mutants have an albino phenotype and also are seedling lethal. We used microarrays to detail the induced genes in ppi2 plants compard to wild type plants.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis plants, wild-type and ppi2 plants, were grown for 10 or 20 days, respectively, and total RNA was used for analysis.
