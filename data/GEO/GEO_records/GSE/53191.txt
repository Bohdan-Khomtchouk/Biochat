TITLE
DNA Methylation Signature of Childhood Chronic Physical Aggression in T Cells of Both Men and Women (Illumina)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High frequency of physical aggression is the central feature of severe conduct disorder and is associated with a wide range of social, mental and physical health problems. We have previously tested the hypothesis that differential DNA methylation signatures in peripheral T cells are associated with a chronic aggression trajectory in males. Despite the fact that sex differences appear to play a pivotal role in determining the development, magnitude and frequency of aggression, most of previous studies focused on males, so little is known about female chronic physical aggression. We therefore tested here whether or not there is a signature of physical aggression in female DNA methylation and, if there is, how it relates to the signature observed in males.

DESIGN
Genome-wide promoter methylation profiles of T cell DNA from adult males and females on a Chronic Physical Aggression (CPA) trajectory during childhood and adolescence were compared to adults on a normative physical aggression trajectories (NPA). Each sample was bisulphite converted gDNA pooled in equimolar amounts. Three different pools of genomic DNA were made per group: male CPA (2 or 3 different subjects per pool), male NPA (4 different subjects per pool), female CPA (2 different subjects per pool) and female NPA (4 or 5 different subjects per pool) . The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles of the 2 groups in both sex.
