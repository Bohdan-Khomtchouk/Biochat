ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we present genome-wide genotyping data of 70 human samples from Europe (Balto-Slavic speakers, Greeks) that are used in addition to public data in a study of genetic heritage of the Balto-Slavic populations.

DESIGN
70 samples were analysed with the Illumina platforms HumanHap650Yv3 (HumanHap650Yv3_A) and Human660W-Quad v1.0 Genotyping BeadChip and are described herein.

PLATFORM
