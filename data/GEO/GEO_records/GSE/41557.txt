TITLE
Expression data from one-year-old leaves of Populus simonii by high-temperature treatments

ORGANISM
Populus simonii

SUMMARY
We take one-year-old plants for high-temperature treatments and controls. We used the Affymetrix Poplar GeneChip to decrypt the gene functions and mechanisms in Populus simonii leaves.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression during high-temperature treatments. Populus simonii leaves were taken from high-temperature (42C) treatments and controls (25C) for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. H1 and H2 are from high-temperature treatments, CK1 and CK2 are controls.
