TITLE
Correlation of Survival with Gene Expression in Oesophageal Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We evaluated and correlated gene expression profiles of pre-treatment endoscopic biopsies in a pre-defined patient population of resectable oesophageal adenocarcinoma who had received neoadjuvant platinum and fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy with clinical outcome, the primary end-point being overall survival.  At the time of pre-treatment staging EUS, tumour biopsies were collected (approximately 1.5 mm3).  and immediately snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from the biopsies and amplified using a T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase based linear amplification protocol, then expression profiling was carried out. The expression levels of 47 genes selected by biological function, fold change and degree of significance were further validated using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR Keywords: Tumour vs normal comparison
