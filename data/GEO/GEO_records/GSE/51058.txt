TITLE
Risk of T1D progression in islet autoantibody positive children can be further stratified using expression patterns of multiple genes implicated in peripheral blood lymphocyte activation and function

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes with expression levels that are associated with T1D progression from AbP (islet autoantibody positive),   global gene expression changes were analyzed in AbP subjects with different T1D progression rate.

DESIGN
Total RNA were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of total 36 AbP subjects with different T1D progression rate.   Microarray was carried out to analyze gene expression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test were used to compare differences in diabetes-free survival between groups classified based on single gene expression.
