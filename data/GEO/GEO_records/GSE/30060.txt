TITLE
Toxicogenomics and phenotypic characterization of adult female zebrafish liver treated with nitrophenol

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We performed microarray-based expression profiling on liver of male zebrafish exposed to 7 mg/L of nitrophenol for 8-96 h, to identify global transcriptional programs and biological pathways involved in chloroaniline-induced adaptive responses under in vivo environment.

DESIGN
We analyzed 12 arrays of nitrophenol-treated adult female zebrafish liver and 12 arrays of control fish.
