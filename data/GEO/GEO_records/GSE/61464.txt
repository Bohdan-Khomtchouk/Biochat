TITLE
Global mapping of ribonucleotides embedded in DNA

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Capture and massively parallel DNA sequencing of ribonucleotides embedded in S. cerevisiae genomic DNA

DESIGN
We developed a new method to map the positions of ribonucleotides embedded in DNA using the unique specificity of A. thaliana tRNA ligase. Ribonucleotides were generated in budding yeasts of different genetic backgrounds and mapped to single nucleotide resolution using the new method.
