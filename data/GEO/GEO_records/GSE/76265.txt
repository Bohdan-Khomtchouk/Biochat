TITLE
Gene profiling of Tregs across inbred strains.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene-profiling of Tregs across inbred strains. There is a wide inter-individual range in the frequency of FoxP3+ Treg cells, but little is known about the underlying genetic or epigenetic mechanisms. We explored this issue accross inbred strains of mice. During this study, we established the gene expression profiles of Treg cells from the various inbred strains of mice.

DESIGN
For each inbred strain of mice, CD4+ TCRb+ CD25hi Treg cells (50k)  from 9w old male (Jackson laboratory) were double sorted into Trizol. For BM Treg, cells were triple-sorted. Top 50% among CD25high cells were selected to ensure high Foxp3+ purity (over 99%). 2 biological replicates per condition. RNA was amplified, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Expression Analysis).
