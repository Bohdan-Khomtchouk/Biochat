TITLE
Expression data from FoxM1 siRNA knock down Human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcription factor FoxM1 is expressed in proliferating cells, and its expression is critical for cell proliferation in embryos and tumors. FoxM1 regulates a multi-gene transcriptional network for cell cycle regulation. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression either directly or indirectly regulated by FoxM1, and distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes.

DESIGN
Human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HAVSMC) were transfected with FoxM1 siRNA and control siRNA for 48 hours. Total RNA was extracted, purified, and prepared for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
