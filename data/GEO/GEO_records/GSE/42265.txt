TITLE
Deriving Dopaminergic Neurons for Clinical Use. A Practical Approach.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identification of new small molecules that regulate the step-wise differentiation of hPSC into dopaminergic neurons population.  Furthermore, the naturally occurring steroid, guggulsterone, was found to be the most effective inducer of neural stem cells into dopaminergic neurons.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted at different stages of neural differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells
