TITLE
Expression data from stimulated NK cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In an effort to define unique and common signatures of NK cell activity that is non-detected at the protein level, we studied the entire transcriptome of NK cells. We used Human Transcriptome Array (HTA) technology to investigate expression profiles of responding NK cells across the three stimulations in six donors.

DESIGN
Due to down regulation of CD16 within the CD56dimCD16bright compartment, healthy donor CD56dimCD16dim/neg cells, post-stimulation are stained and sorted for gene expression analysis.
