TITLE
Expression data from MOLM-14 human acute myeloid leukemia cell line after AMPK activation by GSK621 according to mTORC1 activation level

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AMPK activation by GSK621 induces cell death in acute myeloid leukemia. Surprisingly, we found that mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin protects cells against GSK621-induced cytotoxicity. A genome-wide gene expression assay was performed to understand the molecular basis of this phenotype.

DESIGN
MOLM-14 cells (biological replicates) were treated or not with rapamycin (10nM, 12h), then with an AMPK activator (GSK621, 30ÂµM, 6h).
