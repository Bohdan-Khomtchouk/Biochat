TITLE
Deep sequencing identify small molecule modulated microRNAs in the J1 mESCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Many small molecular compounds reported were involved in improving reprogramming efficiency during inducing pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or maintain a blastocyst-like state in embryonic stem cells (ESC), including BIO, CHIR99021 (CHIR), and vitamin C et al. However, the knowledge about these small molecules regulating miRNAs in ESC was limited. To understand the role of miRNAs during small molecules induced ESC maintenance and gain an insight how these small molecules regulates miRNAs expression; we performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 under the compounds treatment.The data show the miRNAs regulated by SB431542

DESIGN
J1 mESCs maintained in medium containing 1000 U/mL LIF and supplemented with SB431542 for 24 hours, J1 treated with DMSO were set as the control treatment. Then total RNA was extracted for analysis.
