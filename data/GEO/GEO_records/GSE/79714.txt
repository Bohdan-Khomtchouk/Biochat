TITLE
Oscillating profiles of global genes in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in diurnal light/dark cyles.

ORGANISM
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

SUMMARY
RNA samples from cells collected at twenty four time points in 48-hours diurnal cycles were analyzed, and they compared between each other for transcriptional profiles of global genes

DESIGN
24 RNA samples at different time points will be compared for this cycling condition. An equimolar mixture of RNA from all time points was used as the control.
