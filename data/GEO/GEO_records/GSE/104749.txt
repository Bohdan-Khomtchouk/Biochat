TITLE
Molecular analyses of prostate tumors for diagnosis of malignancy on Fine-Needle Aspiration biopsies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common cancer and remains the second leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in men. To investigate the involvement of differentially expressing genes in PCa with deregulated pathways to allow earlier diagnosis of the disease, transcriptomic analyses of differential expression genes in Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsies were for discrimination of PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The RNA samples were extracted from four PCa biopsy samples and four BPH biopsy controls for microarray profiling and performed in Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2 arrays for gene expression profiling analysis. Microarray data were analyzed using GeneSpring GX 10 (Agilent).On average, we detected expression of 47,000 transcripts.Under the criteria fold change > 2 or < 0.5, we obtained 1819 differential expressed genes(DEGs).Hierarchy cluster analysis also indicated that the 8 samples were distributed into two clusters, 4 PCa samples in one cluster and 4 BPH samples in another cluster.Then,qRT-PCR validation of the DEGs in PCa tissue and prostate cancer cells.The results revealed that grouping was reasonable and the data can be directly applied to further analysis.
