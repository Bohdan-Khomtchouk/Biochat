TITLE
Expression data from Oct4+ cell fraction in SFEBq cultured mouse embryonic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To further characterize residual undifferentiated cells after neural induction of embryonic stem cells, we performed DNA microarray analysis to identify genes expressed predominantly in residual undifferentiated cells expressing Oct4. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularization and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes in residual undifferentiated cells after neural induction of mouse embryonic stem cells by SFEBq.

DESIGN
Oct4-Venus knock-in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were cultured in SFEBq to induce neural differentiation. Oct4-Venus+ cell fraction of undifferentiated ESC (ESC), Oct4-Venus+/Pecam1- cell fraction of ESCs cultured in SFEBq for 3 days (epiblast stem cell (EpiSC)-like cell), and Oct4-Venus+ cell fraction of ESCs cultured in SFEBq for 7 days were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
