TITLE
Gene signature predictive of response to chemotherapy in mCRC [array]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective is to generate a robust and validated predictor profile for chemotherapy response in patients with mCRC using microarray gene expression profiles of primary colorectal cancer tissue.

DESIGN
To define a gene signature of response to chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer, samples were obtained from 40 patients from Marques de Valdecilla Hospital who underwent primary surgery. Gene expression was detected and quantified using the Human Whole Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix), containing 54675 human gene probes. Adequate RNA and microarray analysis were obtained from only 37 patients.
