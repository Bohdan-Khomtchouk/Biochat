TITLE
Expression data of Myh6-MeCP2 transgenic mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hearts of Myh6-MeCP2 transgenic mice and wildtype littermates were rapidly dissected and flash frozen. We used Affymetrix microarrays to assess gene expression changes induced by overexpression of MeCP2 under the control of a cardiomycyte specific promoter.

DESIGN
Hearts were dissected 2-3 weeks after birth from transgenic Myh6-MeCP2 mice and littermates to study gene expression alterations.
