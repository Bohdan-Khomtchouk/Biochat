TITLE
Expression profiling of Abelson interactor-1 (Abi-1) deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profile of LSK-enriched population of hematopoietic progenitor cells from Abi-1 KO mice indicates activation of the NFÎºB pathway. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from Lineage-, Sca-1+, cKit+ (LSK)-enriched population of hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from the bone marow of Abi-1 KO and WT animals. Abi1(fl/fl);Tg (Mx1- cre(-)) or Abi1(fl/fl);Tg (Mx1-cre(+)) mice were subjected to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)]-induced activation of the Cre recombinase under control of the Mx1 promoter to obtain animals with an  Abi1(fl/fl);Tg (Mx1-cre(-)) (Abi-1 WT) or Abi1(-/-);Tg (Mx1-cre(+)) (Abi-1 KO) genotype.

DESIGN
9 Total samples were analyzed: LSK cells from the bone marrow of 4 Abi-1 KO and 5 Abi-1 WT mice. The whole bone marrow was obtained from the individual mice by flushing cells from clavicles, scapulae, humeri, radiuses, ulnas, sternum, pelvis (iliums and ischiums), femurs, tibias, and fibulas. For LSKs sorting lineage-depleted bone marrow cells were stained with BUV395 Streptavidin, APC CD117/c-Kit (2B8), and PE.Cy7 Ly-6A/E/Sca-1 (D7) antibodies. Cells were sorted using a legacy MoFlo High Speed cell sorter equipped with four lasers (355 nm, 405 nm, 488 nm, and 633 nm).
