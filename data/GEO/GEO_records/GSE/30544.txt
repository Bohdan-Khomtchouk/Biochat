TITLE
Changes in the Staphylococcus aureus transcriptome during early adaptation to the lung

ORGANISM
Staphylococcus aureus

SUMMARY
Microarray expression profiling of S. aureus lavaged from murine lungs after residence times between 30 minutes and 6 hours compared to post-exponential phase or early log phase growth in Luria-Betani broth.

DESIGN
21 samples analyzed, all replicates are biological replicates (independent biological experiments): 8 replicates of the overnight culture used for intranasal inoculation, 4 each from lavage at 0.5 hours and 2.0 hours, 3 from lavage after 6 hours and 2 from growth in fresh LB for 30 minutes.

PLATFORM
GPL4047 Saur2a custom-made Affymetrix array
