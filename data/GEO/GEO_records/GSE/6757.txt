Identification of imprinted genes expressed in adult CD3+ splenocytes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Identification of imprinted genes expressed in adult CD3+ splenocytes Keywords: imprinted gene; hematopoietic; transplantation

DESIGN
For analysis of imprinted gene expression of uniparental-derived cells in adult recipients we chose eGFP/CD3-double positive splenocytes as a defined cell type, and first identified imprinted genes that are normally expressed in this cell type by microarray analysis of normal eGFP/CD3-double positive splenocytes from an eGFP transgenic B6129 mouse.
