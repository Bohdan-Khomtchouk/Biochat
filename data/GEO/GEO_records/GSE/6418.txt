TITLE
RNAs associated with LARK in Drosophila pharate adult brain

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Circadian behaviors are regulated by intrinsic biological clocks consisting of central molecular oscillators and output pathways.  Despite significant progress in elucidating the central timekeeping mechanisms, the molecular pathways coupling the circadian pacemaker to overt rhythmic behavior and physiology remain elusive.  The Drosophila LARK RNA-binding protein is a candidate for such a coupling factor.  Previous research indicates that LARK functions downstream of the clock to mediate behavioral outputs.  To better understand the roles of LARK in the Drosophila circadian system, we sought to identify RNA molecules associated with LARK in vivo, using a novel strategy that involves capturing the RNA ligands by immunoprecipitation, visualizing the captured RNAs using whole gene microarrays, and identifying functionally relevant targets through genetic screens. Keywords: Association with RNA-binding protein
