TITLE
SOX7 supresses the expression of RUNX1 target genes during EHT

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The molecular mechanisms regulating endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT) of hemogenic endothelium (HE) are poorly understood.  Here we profile the transcriptional changes resulting from SOX7 overexpression during EHT

DESIGN
FLK1+ cells were sorted from day 3.5 iSox7 EBs and cultured in liquid blast media for 48hours.  Dox was added for 6, 12 and 24 hours to induce SOX7 expression, before samples were harvested for RNAseq.
