TITLE
Interactions between H2O2 and glutathione in gene expression

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
rs08-03_glutathion - glutathion - How does glutathione content or reduction state affect H2O2-induced changes in the transcriptome? - Three single Arabidopsis mutants were used: cat2, knockout for catalase2 and so enriched in H2O2; cad2, defective in glutathione content; cytGR, knockout for cytosolic glutathione reductase. Cat2 was crossed with cad2 and cyt GR, and col0, 3 single mutants, and 2 double mutants were sampled in controlled growth conditions either in 8h or 16h photoperiod. Keywords: gene knock out

DESIGN
20 dye-swap pairs - CATMA arrays: 40 arrays

PLATFORM
