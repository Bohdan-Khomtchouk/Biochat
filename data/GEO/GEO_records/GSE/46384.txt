TITLE
Genome-wide identification of genes involved in tolerance to isopropanol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We performed massive screening of the genes in yeast that were involved in the tolerance to isopropanol using the non-essential genes deleted yeast collection, and identified sixty-five disruptants that grew slower than the wild type strain in the presence of isopropanol. The isopropanol sensitive mutants were tested to know their behaviour under other alcohol stresses. Besides, we conducted microarray analysis to reveal the transcriptional response to isopropanol stress in yeast. Our results certainly provide new insights into yeast response to C3 alcohol isopropanol.

DESIGN
Strain BY4743 was used in this test. The prepared cells were inoculated into 120 ml of fresh media (YPD without isopropanol, and YPD with 20 g/l or 40 g/l of isopropanol) in 500-ml Sakaguchi-flasks. They were cultivated for 3 h at 30Â°C with 130-rpm shaking. At least three independent experiments were performed at each concentration of isopropanol.
