TITLE
Expression profile of potato plants after inoculation with endophytes

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
Two potato cultivars, Russet Burbank and Bionta, were inoculated with three different endophytes containing different AHL types. The impact of the endophytes to the different cultivars was measured by gene expression analysis with a customized microarray
