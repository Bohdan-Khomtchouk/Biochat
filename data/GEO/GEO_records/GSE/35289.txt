TITLE
Placental growth factor as potential target against hepatocellular carcinoma in an orthotopic mouse model.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The placental growth factor (PlGF) is member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-family known to stimulate endothelial cell growth, migration and survival, attract angiocompetent macrophages and bone marrow progenitor cells and determine the metastatic niche. Unlike VEGF, genetic studies have shown that PlGF is specifically involved in the pathologic angiogenesis, thus its inhibition would not affect healthy blood vessels, providing an attractive drug candidate with a good safety profile. In this study, we assess whether inhibition of PlGF could be used as a potential therapy against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), by using PlGF-knock out mice and monoclonal antibodies targeting PlGF in an orthotopic model for HCC. In addition, the effect of PlGF-antibodies is compared to that of Sorafenib, as well as the combination of both therapies. In our study we have found that both in a transgenic knock out model as in a treatment model, silencing or inhibition of PlGF significantly decreased tumour burden, not only by inhibiting the vascularisation, but also by decreasing hepatic macrophage recruitment and by normalizing the remaining blood vessels, thereby decreasing hypoxia and thus, reducing the pro-metastatic potential of HCC. Conclusion: considering its favourable safety profile and its pleiotropic effect on vascularisation, metastasis and inflammation, targeting PlGF could become a valuable therapeutic strategy against HCC.

DESIGN
Hybridisation on the Mouse Gene Expression Microarray (Agilent) was performed in a single sample per chip and in a monocolore mode, using cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeling.  Following conditions were assessed: 25W DEN + 5W αPlGF tumour tissue (n = 5), 25W DEN + 5W αPlGF surrounding tissue (n = 4), 25W DEN + 5W IgG tumour tissue (n = 5), 25W DEN + 5W IgG surrounding tissue (n = 4), 25W saline + 5W αPlGF (n = 3) and 25W saline + 5W IgG (n = 3).
