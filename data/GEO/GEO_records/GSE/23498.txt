TITLE
A novel copper-responsive regulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

SUMMARY
In this study, we report the identification of a five-locus copper-inducible regulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The identification of a copper responsive regulon unique to pathogenic Mycobacteria suggests copper homeostasis must be maintained during an infection.

DESIGN
WT and mutant Mtb cells were grown in Sauton's minimal media to early stationary phase (OD580 = 1.5) and treated with 500 mM copper sulfate (CuSO4) for four hours or the absence

PLATFORM
GPL5773 JCVI PFGRC Mycobacterium tuberculosis 22K v4 array designed primarily based on strain CDC1551
