TITLE
Determinants of nucleosome organization in primary human cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide maps of nucleosome organization in human CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, granulocytes, and from in vitro reconstitution.

DESIGN
8 samples include: nucleosome-bound DNA isolated from primary human CD4+ T-cells, nucleosome bound-DNA isolated from primary human CD8+ T-cells, nucleosome-bound DNA isolated from primary human granulocytes, nucleosome-bound DNA isoalted from in vitro reconstitution of nucleosomes with human genomic DNA, control DNA generated by micrococcal nuclease treatment of human genomic DNA, RNA-seq from human CD4+ T-cells, RNA-seq from human CD8+ T-cells, RNA-seq from human Granulocytes.
