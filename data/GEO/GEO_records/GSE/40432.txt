TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of HMW RNAs (4-10 kb) from Drosophila Dnmt2 mutants during heat shock recovery

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Dnmt2 genes are highly conserved tRNA methyltransferases with biological roles in cellular stress responses. Dnmt2 has recently been implicated in transposon silencing in Drosophila but the exact molecular mechanisms are unclear. Adult Dnmt2 mutants were heat shocked and RNA sequencing was performed on visible high-molecular weight RNAs to determine the identity of up-regulated transposons. Dnmt2 mutants accumulated almost all families of transposons after heat shock, indicating a general mis-regulation of transposon silencing in Dnmt2 mutants during the stress response.

DESIGN
one sample, excised, electroeluted and pooled RNA of different molecular weight, Dnmt2 mutant during recovery from a single heat shock

PLATFORM
GPL13304 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Drosophila melanogaster)
