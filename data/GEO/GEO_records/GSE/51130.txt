TITLE
Using a rhabdomyosarcoma patient-derived xenograft to examine precision medicine approaches and model acquired resistance

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Original patient tumor is directly implanted in mice xenografts. Tumor is propagated to multiple mice for conduct of 6 arm treatment trials and control. Therapies are selected based on T0 and F0 genomic profiles. ICE-T refractory tumor are implanted and additional 6 arm treatment trial and control conducted based on genomic profiles of F2 generation mice to suggested therapies

DESIGN
Original patient tumor expanded in F0 mouse generation to F1 generation for multiple arm therapy trial and then refractory tumors implanted for additional multiple arm therapy trial
