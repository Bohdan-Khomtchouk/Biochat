TITLE
RNA-seq of naive and primed ES cells (NHSM)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Here we propose a set of molecular criteria for evaluating the naive human pluripotent state. We show by RNA-seq that transcription of transposable elements provides a sensitive measure of the concordance between pluripotent stem cells and early human development.

DESIGN
RNA-seq of 3 naive ES samples in NHSM (Gafni et al.) and 3 primed ES cell samples (in hESM)

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
