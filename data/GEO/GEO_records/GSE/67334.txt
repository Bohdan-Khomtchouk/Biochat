TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of early differentiating Tfh vs Th1 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptome between early Tfh vs. early Th1 cells

DESIGN
Blimp-1-YFP LCMV gp specific TCRtg Smarta cells were transferred into B6 mice, which were then infected with LCMV Armstrong. On day 3 after infection, splenocytes were stained to sort Blimp-1-YFP+IL-2Ra+ Th1 cells or Blimp-1-YFP-IL-2Ra- Tfh cells for RNAseq analysis. Contributor: LIAI RNAi center (LIAI)
