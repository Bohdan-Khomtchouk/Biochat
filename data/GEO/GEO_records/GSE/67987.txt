TITLE
Gene expression profile of phenylpropanoid pathway in black and red rice pericarps.

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We analyzed expression change of the genes which involved in anthocyanin and pro-anthocyanin biosynthesis to search an origin of black rice.

DESIGN
The submitted samples were transcriptome data in black and red rice pericarps. Rice pericarps were harvested in 7 and 14 days after heading, respectively.
