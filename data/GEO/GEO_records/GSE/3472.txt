TITLE
Bone marrow microenvironment: interaction of monocytes and stromal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Two human stromal cell lines, HS-5 and HS-27a, represent functionally distinct components of the bone marrow microenvironment.  A third influential component of the microenvironment is resident monocytes and macrophages. The baseline expression profile of normal peripheral blood monocytes was determined and their effect on the gene expression of the stromal cells was investigated in a co-culture sytem. Control RNA for all samples was Stratagene Universal human reference RNA. Keywords: Cell Line Comparison and Culture Comparison

DESIGN
We analyzed 5 arrays for the HS-5 cell line, 5 arrays for the HS-27a cell line and 3 arrays for normal peripheral blood monocytes. Four arrays for HS-5 were biological replicates with cells cultured alone; one is from HS-5 cultured in the presence of monocytes. Four arrays for HS-27a were biological replicates with cells cultured alone; one is from HS-27a cultured in the presence of monocytes. Peripheral blood monocytes were biological replicates from multiple normal donors.
