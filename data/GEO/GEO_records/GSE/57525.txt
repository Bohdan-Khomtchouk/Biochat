TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of High glucose-induced gene expression by Ninjurin1 siRNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Mouse cavernous primary endothelial cells (MCECs) in comparing normal glucose condition with high glucose condition or Ninjurin1 siRNA transfection condition. Objective was to determine the effect of ninjurin1 on high glucose conditioned cells on global gene expression.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from MCECs, which were treated with High glucose (HG) condition or (HG+ninjurin1 siRNA). Biological replicates: 1 control replicates, 1 HG replicates, 1 (HG+ninjurin1 siRNA) replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL11202 Agilent-026655 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 (Probe Name version)
