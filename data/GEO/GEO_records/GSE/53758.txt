TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression and intron retention during development in a U12-type splicing-deficient zebrafish mutant [RNA-seq]

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
To determine the global impact of the clbn mutation on gene expression and efficiency of U2- and U12-type splicing, we analyzed the transcriptome of 108hpf wt and clbn mutant larvae by microarrays and RNA sequencing. RNAseq data was used to characterize intron retention of U2-type and U12-type intron on a genome-wide scale to confirm that rnpc3 deficiency specifically impairs U12-type splicing. RNAseq and microarray data were combined to yield high-confidence lists of differentially expressed genes which show that impaired U12-type splicing has a wide-ranging effect on the developing transcriptome.

DESIGN
RNAseq libraries prepared from 108 hours post-fertilization zebrafish larvae (approx. 60 embryos each, genotyped homozygous wildtype and homozygous clbns841 mutants, respectively)

PLATFORM
GPL10658 AB SOLiD System 3.0 (Danio rerio)
