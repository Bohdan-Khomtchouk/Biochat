TITLE
The miRNA-200 family and miRNA-9 exhibit differential expression in primary vs. corresponding metastatic tissue in breast cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Global miRNA expression profiling was performed on 47 tumor samples from 14 patients with paired samples from primary breast tumors and corresponding lymph node and distant metastases using LNA-enhanced miRNA microarrays. The identified miRNA expression alterations were validated by real-time PCR, and tissue distribution of the miRNAs was visualized by in situ hybridization
