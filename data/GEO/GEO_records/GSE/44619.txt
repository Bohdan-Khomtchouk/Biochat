SUMMARY
Effect of NF-kB inhibition and activation on gene expression in mouse and human lung cancer cell-lines. Publication reference: Hopewell, E.L., Zhao, W., Fulp, W.J., Bronk, C.C., Lopez, A.S., Massengill, M., Antonia, S., Celis, E., Haura, E.B., Enkemann, S.A., Chen, D.T., and Beg, A.A. 2013. Lung tumor NF-kappaB signaling promotes T cell-mediated immune surveillance. The Journal of clinical investigation 123:2509-2522.

DESIGN
Cells were transduced with control retrovirus (MiG) or MiG retrovirus expressing IkB alpha super-repressor (SR) mutant (S32, S36 to A mutations) or activated IKK beta (S177, S181 to E mutations). Cells were FACS sorted by GFP expression. RNA isolated from these cells was used for microarray studies.
