TITLE
Influence of SB431542 on J1 mouse embryonic stem cells growth

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To know exactly how SB431542 contribute to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) undifferentiated state maintenance, microarray experiment for DMSO mock treated and SB431542 treated J1 mESCs was performed

DESIGN
J1 mESCs maintained in  medium containing 1000 U/mL LIF and supplemented without or with SB431542 for 24 hours, then total RNA was extracted for analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
