TITLE
Expression data of GFP-neg and GFP-high cells isolated from mouse SCLC tumors using a GFP reporter for Hes1 expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumors harbor two subsets of cells that are defined by low (or undetectable) or high expression of Hes1, which is a common downstream target of the Notch signaling pathway. To better understand the role of the Notch pathway in SCLC tumor heterogeneity, we first isolated cells from these two populations using a GFP-reporter allele for Hes1 expression. We then used microarrays to identify the gene expression differences between these two groups.

DESIGN
SCLC tumors were induced by Cre-administration in an Rb/p53/p130 conditional triple knockout mouse model for SCLC that also carried a GFP-reporter allele for Hes1 expression. GFP-negative and GFP-high cells were FACS sorted from pooled tumors 5-6 months after tumor induction. RNA was then extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Mouse Gene 2.0 ST array.
