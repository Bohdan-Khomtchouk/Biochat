TITLE
Gene expression profile associated with the PDZ ligand-motif of HPV16-E6 oncoprotin in the skin of transgenic mice models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The K14E6 transgenic mice developskin hyperplasia,benign tumors and skin cancer. The tumor formation capacity diminishes when E6 lacks its PDZ ligand-motif. This study aims to compare the transciptional profiles of transgenic K14E6 mice with K14E6 Î”146-151 (lacking the PDZ domain) in order to explore the role of PDZ in early skin carcinogenesis.

DESIGN
Skin tissue from three different strains of mice were dissected for RNA extraction, processing and hybridization in Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2,0 array. We processed three biological replicates per strain. 3 mice were used for each replicate pool for a final RNA concentration of 3 micrograms. The arrays were analyzed using Partek Genomics suite software.
