TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of energy-starved fibroblasts in quiescence

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This analysis investigated changes in transcripts in quiescent dermal fibroblast cell cultures in response to energy stress. A quiescent control was compared to a 24h energy starvation sample using DNP/2DG inhibitor combination.

DESIGN
Two chips were used for the control sample, and two chips were used each for the treated sample and its biological replicate.
