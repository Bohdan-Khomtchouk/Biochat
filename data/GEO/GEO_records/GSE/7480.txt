TITLE
Mouse Brain Voxelation, Voxels

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse brain voxels from a single coronal slice of the mouse brain comparing each voxel to whole mouse brain RNA.  Goal was to determine the gene expression profiles for the mouse genome in a coronal slice of the mouse brain. Keywords: Genetic modification
