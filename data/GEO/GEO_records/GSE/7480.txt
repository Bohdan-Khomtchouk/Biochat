TITLE
Mouse Brain Voxelation, Voxels

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse brain voxels from a single coronal slice of the mouse brain comparing each voxel to whole mouse brain RNA.  Goal was to determine the gene expression profiles for the mouse genome in a coronal slice of the mouse brain. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Voxel vs. Whole Brain RNA. Biological replicates: 3 independent datasets from mouse brains, independently harvested. One voxel replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL5065 VMSR Mus 20K version 2
