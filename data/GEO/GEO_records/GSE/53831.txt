TITLE
The Meninâ€“Bach2 axis is critical for regulating CD4 T cell senescence and homeostasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Although CD4 T cell senescence plays an important role in immunosenescence, the mechanisms remain unclear.  We found that T cell-specific Menin deficiency results in the premature senescence of CD4 T cells, accompanied by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) after antigenic stimulation.  TH1 and TH2 differentiation was dysregulated in Menin-knockout CD4 T cells.  Bach2, which regulates SASP and TH differentiation, was identified as a Menin target.  Menin binds to the Bach2 locus, and controls its expression through maintenance of histone acetylation.  These findings reveal a critical role of the Menin-Bach2 pathway in regulating CD4 T cell senescence and homeostasis, thus indicating the involvement of this pathway in the inhibition of age-associated development of inflammatory diseases, which are induced by immunosenescence.
