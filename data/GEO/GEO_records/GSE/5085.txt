TITLE
Expression data from female SD rats with access to lifelong exercise

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Gene expression and phenotypic consequences of laboratory housing in rats. Disease related-phenotypes and associated gene expressions of sedentary animals (living solely in a standard cage) were compared with animals that had access to twice-weekly one-hour physical activity in a large box (PA) and with those that had access to voluntary running wheel exercise (EX). Keywords: exercise dose reponse, sedentary, twice weekly physical activity, daily exercise

DESIGN
The left ventricle of 16 month female Sprague-Dawley rats was used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Arrays. Twelve animals from each treatment group (SED, PA, and EX) were used for microarray analysis (4 animals pooled per GeneChip).
