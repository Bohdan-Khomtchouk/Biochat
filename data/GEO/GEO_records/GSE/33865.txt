TITLE
Expression analysis of the AdnA regulon in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas fluorescens ; Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression AdnA in Pseudomonas fluorescens, an ortholog of FleQ in P. aeruginosa, regulates both motility and flagella-mediated attachment to various surfaces.  A whole genome microarray determined the AdnA transcriptome by comparing the gene expression pattern of wild-type Pf0-1 to that of Pf0-2x (adnA-) in broth culture.  In the absence of AdnA, expression of 92 genes was decreased, while 11 genes showed increased expression.  Analysis of 16 of these genes fused to lacZ confirmed the microarray results.  Several genes were further evaluated for their role in motility and biofilm formation.  Two genes, Pfl01_1508 and Pfl01_1517, affected motility and had different effects on biofilm formation in Pf0-1.  These two genes are predicted to encode proteins similar to the glycosyl transferases FgtA1 and FgtA2, which have been shown to be involved in virulence and motility in P. syringae.  Three other genes, Pfl01_1516, Pfl01_1572, and Pfl01_1573, not previously associated with motility and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas had similar affects on biofilm formation in Pf0-1.  Deletion of each of these genes led to different motility defects.  Our data revealed an additional level of complexity in the control of flagella function beyond the core genes known to be required, and may yield insights into processes important for environmental persistence of P. fluorescens Pf0-1.

DESIGN
Catalog design for Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 (Taxonomy Id: 205922) covering NC_007492. Probes selected for 5736/5736 sequences. Median number of probes/sequence is 13 with an average of 13.00. Each probe will be replicated 5 times on the chip. Probes are randomly distributed over the surface of the array. Unused features have been filled with randomly generated probes of comparable GC content.
