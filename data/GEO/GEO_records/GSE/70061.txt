TITLE
Nuclear HNRNPA2B1 HITS-CLIP and RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify HNRNPA2B1 binding sites on endogenous nuclear RNAs, we performed HITS-CLIP for endogenous HNRNPA2B1 and RNA-seq to analyze the nuclear RNA under either METTL3 or HNRNPA2B1 depletion.

DESIGN
Wild type MDA-MB-231 cells were subjected to the HITS-CLIP procedure on immunoprecipitated HNRNPA2B1 associated RNA obtained from the nuclear fraction (Licatalosi D, et al. 2008, Nature 456:464-U22). For RNA-seq, nuclear RNA was extracted from MDA-MB-231 or Hela cells knocked down for METTL3 or HNRNPA2B1.
