TITLE
Syringaresinol delays immunosenescence in aged mice: rejuvenating the immune system and reconstituting the gut microbiota

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Improving immune function during aging contributes to the extension of healthspan. However, little is known about interventions for overcoming immunosenescence. Here, we investigated whether syringaresinol (SYR), an activator of FOXO3, overcomes immunosenescence and the factors associated with this effect. To address this, we administered SYR to 42-week-old mice for 10 weeks and analyzed immunological parameters and the gut microbiota. Compared to control mice, SYR-treated mice exhibited reversal of the age-related changes in lymphocyte subsets—such as CD3+ T, CD19+ B and Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells—and T-cell function in vitro. SYR induced the expression of Bim as well as the activation of FOXO3 in Tregs, which probably regulated Treg homeostasis. Furthermore, SYR reduced the serum level of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, an inflammatory marker, and enriched the gut microbiota with beneficial bacteria, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, effects that were closely associated with the changes in lymphocyte subsets. Finally, SYR enhanced humoral immunity against influenza vaccination to the level of young control mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that SYR may rejuvenate immunosenescence by enhancing the immune response and modulating the gut microbiota, possibly affecting systemic inflammation, although the precise mechanism awaits further study, and suggest SYR to be a potent candidate for anti-immunosenescence intervention.

DESIGN
Comparing the overall structural changes in the gut microbiota in young and old mice treated with vehicle, syringaresinol (SYR, 10 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg), or caloric restriction (CR) by bar-coded pyrosequencing of the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene
