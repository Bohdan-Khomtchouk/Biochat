TITLE
Global transcriptional profiles response to strain variation and medium change for validamycin overproduction

ORGANISM
Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. jinggangensis 5008 ; Streptomyces hygroscopicus subsp. jinggangensis TL01

SUMMARY
To explore the molecular basis of validamycin overproduction at the transcriptional level, the transcriptomes of strain 5008 and TL01 cultivated in Yeast extract-Malt extract-Glucose (YMG) and rice-peanut cake based industrial (IND) fermentation medium were compared by microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Global gene expressions in the strain 5008 and TL01 were measured in fermentation medium YMG and IND, respectively. Three independent experiments were performed at each condition.

PLATFORM
GPL15794 Agilent Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. jinggangensis 15K [Agilent-025874] [Probe version]
