TITLE
Identification of DHT induced cell cycle dependent trascriptome in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Evaluation of the genome wide impact of cell cycle position on DHT stimulated gene expression programs.  Results show differential cell cycle regulated gene expression in different cell cycle phases.

DESIGN
20 samples were analyzed using a GeneChip 1.0 ST Array in LNCaP cells arrested in the indicated stages of the cell cycle and stimulated with DHT
