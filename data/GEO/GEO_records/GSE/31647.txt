TITLE
Nicotinamide mononucleotide, a key NAD+ precursor, treats the pathophysiology of diet- and age-induced diabetes

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become an epidemic in our modern lifestyle, likely due to calorie-rich diets overwhelming our adaptive metabolic pathways.  One such pathway is mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis, and the NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1.  Here we show that NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis is severely compromised in metabolic organs by high-fat diet (HFD).  Strikingly, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a product of the NAMPT reaction and a key NAD+ intermediate, ameliorates glucose intolerance by restoring NAD+ levels in HFD-induced T2D mice.  NMN also enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity and restores gene expression related to oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and circadian rhythm, partly through SIRT1 activation.  Furthermore, NAD+ and NAMPT levels show significant decreases in multiple organs during aging, and NMN improves glucose intolerance and lipid profiles in age-induced T2D mice.  These findings provide critical insights into a novel intervention against diet- and age-induced T2D.

DESIGN
4 regular chow fed mice (RC1-4) vs 4 high-fat diet fed (HFD) (HFD1a-4a) mice were analyzed on one chip (Chip-A). 4 HFD mice (HFD1b-4b) vs 4 HFD-NMN treated mice (NMN1-4) were examined on the other chip (Chip-B).
