TITLE
RNA-seq Transcriptional Profiling of the FK506 Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in Streptomyces tsukubaensis NRRL18488 and General Analysis of the Transcriptome

ORGANISM
Streptomyces tsukubensis NRRL18488

SUMMARY
FK506 (tacrolimus) is a valuable immunosuppressant produced by several Streptomyces strains. In the genome of the wild type producer Streptomyces tsukubaensis NRRL18488 FK506 biosynthesis is encoded by a gene cluster that spans 83.5 kilobases. A whole transcriptome differential shotgun sequencing of S. tsukubaensis was performed to analyze transcription at two different time points; before and during active FK506 production. In total 8,914 transcription start sites were identified in either condition, which enabled precise determination of the 5'-UTR length of the corresponding transcripts as well as the identification of two consensus sequence motifs in the promoter regions. The transcription start sites of all gene operons within the FK506 cluster were identified, including three examples of leaderless RNA transcripts. These data provide detailed insight into the transcription of the FK506 biosynthetic gene cluster and supports future regulatory studies and genetic manipulations.

DESIGN
Differential whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing of Streptomyces tsukubaensis NRRL18488 was performed in duplicates at two time points of growth.
