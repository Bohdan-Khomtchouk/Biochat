TITLE
Identification of miRNA signatures during the differentiation of hESCs into retinal pigment epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells can be obtained through in vitro differentiation of both embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) for cell replacement therapy. We have previously identified 87 signature genes relevant to RPE cell differentiation and function through transcriptome analysis of both human ESC- and iPSC-derived RPE as well as normal fetal RPE. Here, we profiled miRNA expression through small RNA-seq in human ESCs and their RPE derivatives. Much like conclusions drawn from our previous transcriptome analysis, we found that the overall miRNA landscape in RPE is distinct from ESCs and other differentiated somatic tissues. We also profiled miRNA expression during intermediate stages of RPE differentiation and identified unique subsets of miRNAs that are gradually up- or downregulated, suggesting dynamic regulation of these miRNAs is associated with the RPE differentiation process. Indeed, the down-regulation of a subset of miRNAs during RPE differentiation is associated with up-regulation of RPE-specific genes, such as RPE65, which is exclusively expressed in RPE. We conclude that miRNA signatures can be used to classify different degrees of in vitro differentiation of RPE from human pluripotent stem cells. We suggest that RPE-specific miRNAs likely contribute to the functional maturation of RPE in vitro, similar to the regulation of RPE-specific mRNA expression.
