TITLE
Ultraconserved elements are associated with control of splicing regulators by alt splicing and nonsense mediated decay

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We blocked nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway and used a custom alternative transcript sensitive Affymetrix microarray to seek alternatively spliced RNAs whose levels increased compared to controls. Keywords: Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD)
