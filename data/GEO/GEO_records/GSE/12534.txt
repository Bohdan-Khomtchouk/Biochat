TITLE
The expression profiles analysis of shigella flexneri incubated in rabbit ileum

ORGANISM
Shigella flexneri

SUMMARY
To find the alterations of expression profiles of shigella flexneri, we performed DNA chip analysis and proteomic analysis at the same time.

DESIGN
an overnight culture of the wild-type strain in LB broth was harvested and resuspended in 20 ml PBS buffer and then incubated in PBS at 37 degree and in rabbit ileum for 4 hours respectively.

PLATFORM
GPL7185 Beijing Institute of Biotechnology NimbleGen Shigella flexneri 12K array
