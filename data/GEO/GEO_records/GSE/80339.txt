TITLE
Gene expression analysis of ambient or 0.5% oxygen exposed rat trophoblast stem (TS) cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Analysis of transcriptomic profile of TS cells grown in ambient (21% oxygen) and hypoxic (0.5% oxygen) conditions.

DESIGN
3 replicates of rat TS cells in ambient (21% oxygen) conditions and 3 replicates of rat TS cells grown under hypoxic (0.5% oxygen) conditions
