SUMMARY
Low-grade chronic inflammation plays an important role in the development of obesity and obesity-associated disorders such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. One possible link between obesity and inflammation is the enhanced activation of circulating monocytes making them more prone to infiltration into the adipose and vascular tissues of obese persons. Furthermore, weight loss after bariatric surgery is associated with less inflammation. Transcriptome analysis of circulating monocytes from control and obese patients before and after bariatric surgery will potentially provide insights into the pathophysiology of obesity and associated disorders and supply biomarkers for diagnostic purpose. The cohort comprised 6 lean age-matched controls (BMI: 20.3±0.5 kg/m2, mean±SEM) and 18 obese individuals without clinical symptoms of cardiovascular disease (BMI: 45.1±1.4 kg/m2, P < 0.001 compared with lean controls). These 18 morbidly obese subjects were referred to our hospital for bariatric surgery. Before they were included, individuals were evaluated by an endocrinologist, an abdominal surgeon, a psychologist and a dietician. Only after multidisciplinary deliberation, the selected patients received a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. CD14+ monocytes were collected before and three months after bariatric surgery (BMI: 37.5±1.3 kg/m2, P < 0.001 compared with before weight loss), total RNA was extracted and subjected to genome-wide expression analysis.

DESIGN
Samples consisted of CD14+ monocytes from 6 lean controls and 18 morbidly obese patients before and three months after bariatric surgery. The 6 lean controls were also used to make 6 control pools.
