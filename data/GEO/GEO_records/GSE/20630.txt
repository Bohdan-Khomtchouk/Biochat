TITLE
Transcriptional Profiling of Host Gene Expression in Chicken Embryo Lung Cells Infected with Laryngotracheitis Virus

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of chicken embryo lung cells infected infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) comparing control uninfected lung cells. Goal was to determine the changes of host gene expression by ILTV infection and host-virus interaction.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, uninfected chicken embryo lung cells vs. infected chicken embryo lung cells. Biological replicates: 1 control uninfected sample, 1 infected experimental sample at each 1dpi, 3dpi, 5dpi, and 7 dpi.

PLATFORM
GPL6413 Chicken 44K custom Agilent microarray (2nd version)
