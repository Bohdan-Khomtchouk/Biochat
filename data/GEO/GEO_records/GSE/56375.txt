TITLE
Wound healing process after TBI in zebrafish: time course (zebrafish)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
The interaction between neurogenesis and angiogenesis after traumatic brain injury is a complex and dynamic process. To resolve this, we chose the zebrafish model organism for studying brain wound healing via systems biology approach. Transcriptome microarray data and histological analysis of injured fish were sampled at different time points during recovery process. Time-course microarray data following wound healing of zebrafish were obtained. From this set of data, we constructed two intracellular protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks for the traumatic brain injury healing mechanism.

DESIGN
Each fish in each group was injured by a 1.5 mm, 27G needle tip from day 0 to 28, respectively. These injured fish were collected at 0, 0.25, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28 dpi (day post injury).  0.625μg of Cy3 cRNA for C. albicans array and 1.65 μg of Cy3 cRNA for zebrafish array was fragmented to an average size of about 50-100 nucleotides by incubation with fragmentation buffer at 60°C for 30 minutes. Each time point contain two biological repeats.
