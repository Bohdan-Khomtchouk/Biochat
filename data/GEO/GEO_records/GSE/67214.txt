TITLE
Transcriptome sequencing and analysis of rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell.) to discover putative genes associated with tapping panel dryness (TPD)

ORGANISM
Hevea brasiliensis

SUMMARY
This study is committed to de novo sequencing and comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of healthy (H) and Tapping panel dryness (TPD)-affected (T) rubber trees to identify the genes and pathways related to the TPD. Total raw reads of 34,632,012 and 35,913,020 bp were obtained from H and T library, respectively using Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencing technology. De novo assemblies yielded 141,456 and 169,285 contigs, and 96,070 and 112,243 unigenes from H and T library, respectively. Among 66535 genes, 107021 genes were identified as differential expressed genes between H and T library via comparative transcript profiling. A majority of genes involved in natural rubber biosynthesis and jasmonate synthesis with most potential relevance in TPD occurrence were found to be differentially expressed. In TPD-affected trees, the expression of most genes related to the latex biosynthesis and jasmonate synthesis was severely inhibited and it probably the direct cause of the TPD. Our de novo transcriptome data sets provide a significant resource for the discovery of genes related to TPD and improve our understanding the occurrence and maintainace of TPD.
