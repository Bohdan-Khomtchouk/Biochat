TITLE
Bovine follicular fluid extracellular vesicles RNA contents

ORGANISM
Bos indicus

SUMMARY
The goal of this experiment was to determine the RNA contents of extracellular vesicles isolated from 3-6mm bovine ovarian follicles.

DESIGN
We performed RNA-seq analysis of extracellular vesicles isolated from a pool of ovaries in order to determine the highly abundant RNA molecules within these vesicles.
