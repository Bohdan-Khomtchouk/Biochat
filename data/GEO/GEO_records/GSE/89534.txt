TITLE
Transcriptional profile Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 : olive oil (OO) treated cells

ORGANISM
Lactobacillus plantarum

SUMMARY
Whole genome transcriptional profiling was used to characterize the response of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 human isolate during challenge with olive oil (OO). Twelve independent experiments were performed and mixed at random in groups of four for total of three RNA samples. The transcriptional profile reveals the downregulation of processes associated with rapid growth and the induction of stress-related pathways indicating the involvement of the stringent response. The fatty acid biosynthetic pathway is thoroughly downregulated at the transcriptional level and genes involved in host-cell signalling are differentially regulated.

DESIGN
Biological triplicates: untreated cells: Control vs. Olive oil treated cells: Experimental
