TITLE
Gene expression profiles after infection of zebrafish with Viral haemorrhagic septicemia rhabdovirus (VHSV)

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We describe for the first time transcripts induced after infection of zebrafish with VHSV. Two days after infection, differentially expressed transcript levels from selected immune-related zebrafish genes were studied  using qRT-PCR in both fins and internal organs (pooled spleen, head kidney and liver).

DESIGN
VHSV-induced gene expression in zebrafish fins and organs was measured by qRT-PCR at 2 days after infection.  Six (fins) and three (organs) independent experiments were performed for each treatment and their corresponding uninfected controls.
