SUMMARY
Next Generation Sequencing with differdent pluripotent transcript factor overexpression in MEF Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by defined factors. The low efficiency of reprogramming limited the potential application of iPSCs. Here we found that knockdown LSD1 , which demethylates histone H3 Lys 4 or 9 , could increase iPSCs generation. It has been reported that LSD1 interaction with Oct4 which is the core factor of reprogramming. So we try to find out the different of overexpression Oct4 or Kllf4/Sox2 in MEF and LSD1 inhibitor.

DESIGN
Retrovirus-mediated different pluripotent transcript factor overexpression in MEF cells after 4 days collect mRNA profiles processing with Illumina MiSeq; MEF, Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast O, MEF infected with Oct4 KS,MEF infected with Klf4 and Sox2 OSK, MEF infected with Oct4 Klf4 and Sox2 T20, MEF infected with Oct4 Klf4 and Sox2 and treated with 20nm LSD1 inhibitor Tranylcypromine

PLATFORM
GPL16417 Illumina MiSeq (Mus musculus)
