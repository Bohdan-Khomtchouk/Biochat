TITLE
The role of Foxp1/2/4 in lung endoderm identity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our previous work has demonstrated an important role for the Foxp1/2/4 subfamily of transcriptional repressors in promoting lung epithelial differentiation. However, the overall role of this transcription factor subfamily in early lung endoderm identity is unknown.

DESIGN
To explore the overall role of Foxp1/2/4r subfamily in early lung endoderm identity , we performed microarray analysis of Shh-Cre control and Foxp1/2/4Shh-CreDKO mutant lungs at E14.5, 3 embryos, respectively.
