TITLE
Expression data from LMO2 knockdown G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to examine what genes could be regurated by LMO2 in erythroid cells.

DESIGN
Comparing expression profile in murine G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells treated with control and Lmo2 siRNA on Agilent array.  After siRNA transfection, the cells were treated with b-estradiol for 24h to induce GATA-1-mediated erythroid maturation.
