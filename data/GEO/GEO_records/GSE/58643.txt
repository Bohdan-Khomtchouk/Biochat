TITLE
An epigenetically distinct breast cancer cell subpopulation promotes collective invasion

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A distinct highly invasive subpopulation was identified in breast cancer cell lines.  The molecular characteristics of these cells was investigated, revealing a set of genes whose high expression confers the ability to invade.

DESIGN
Total RNA  isolated from the invasive subpopulation from 2 cells lines was  compared to total RNA isolated from 2 noninvasive populations.
