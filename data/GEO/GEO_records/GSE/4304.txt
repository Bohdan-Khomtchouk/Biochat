TITLE
Nutrition-induced ketosis alters metabolic and signaling gene networks in liver of periparturient dairy cows

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Hepatic molecular adaptations underlying periparturient metabolic diseases such as ketosis in dairy cows are largely unknown.  We used a simple model for induction of ketosis to examine liver gene expression profiles using a microarray consisting of 13,257 annotated cattle oligonucleotides.  At 4 days post-partum, 7 cows classified as healthy after a physical examination were fed at 50% of intake at day 4 from day 5 to signs of ketosis or until 14 days post-partum. Another group of 7 healthy cows served as controls. Liver was biopsied at 9-14 (ketosis) or 14 days post-partum (controls).  More than 9,000 sequences represented on the microarray were expressed in liver. Keywords: disease state analysis
