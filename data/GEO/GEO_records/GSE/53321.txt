TITLE
Expression data from polarized macrophages: effect of p53

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
p53 is critically important in preventing oncogenesis but its role in non-cancer biology remains unclear.  Macrophages exist as two subtypes (M1 and M2). Nutlin-3a (p53 activator) inhibits M2 gene expression and phenotype. p53 acts by suppressing transcription of c-Myc and thence regulates expression of a subset of M2 markers. This work has implications for our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate plasticity of macrophages in health and disease. We used microarrays to study the global programme of gene expression in nutlin-3a and 10058F4 (C-myc inhibitor) treated polarised mouse macrophages

DESIGN
5 groups of cultured mouse macrophages: (i) M0 (untreated), (ii) M1, (iii) M2, (iv) M2+nutlin-3a, (v) M2+MYC inhibitor (10058F4). 3 biological replicates per treatment group.
