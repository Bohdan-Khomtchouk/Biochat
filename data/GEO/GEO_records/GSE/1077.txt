TITLE
MeHg intervention with PK11195

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In this time course pregnant CD-1 (outbred) dams were exposed to MeHg as monomethylmercuric chloride intraperitoneally on 9 d.p.c. The test dose of 5.0 mg/kg MeHg was selected as a dose with an estimated 20% increased risk for encephalopathy in term fetuses, with no evidence of maternal toxicosis. Exposed embryos were co-treated with PK11195, a nontoxic ligand of the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (Bzrp) that effectively suppresses developmental toxicity induced with MeHg. The anticipated remediation with 5.0 mg/kg and 4.0 mg/kg PK11195 is < 10% malformations. Sampling intervals ranged from 3.0h to 6.0h post-exposure. All measurements were on RNA from the embryonic forebrain (prosencephalon).
