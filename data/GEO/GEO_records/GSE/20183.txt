TITLE
Meyerowitz Lab Arabidopsis Operon Array v4 - 4000B scanner - AP1-GR ap1cal inflorescences - time series (hours)

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
This experiment describes gene expression after the activation of APETALA1-GR, to study and identify AP1 target genes. We used a 35S:AP1-GR ap1 cal line to induce a synchronized response activating the AP1-GR fusion protein in ap1 cal inflorescence-like meristems through dexamethasone treatment. Tissue samples were collected immediately after the treatment, as well as subsequent timepoints. The expression profiles of the individual samples were then analyzed by gene expression profiling using whole-genome oligonucleotide arrays (non-commercial; Meyerowitz Lab Arabidopsis Operon Array v4).  Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Four sets of biologically independent tissue samples were collect at 0, 2, 4 ,8, and 12 hours after the application of dexamethasone (Dex-; activation of the AP1-GR fusion protein) or a mock solution (Mock-; control). In each of the biological replicates of the time course experiments, all the samples derived from dexamethasone (Dex)-treated plants were labeled with one dye (i.e., Cy3), and all the samples derived from the corresponding Mock-treated plants were labeled with the alternative dye (i.e., Cy5). The dyes used for labeling RNA from a given treatment type (Dex and Mock) were switched for two of the replicate experiments, to reduce dye-related artifacts. Dex- and Mock-derived samples for each timepoint and biological replicate were co-hybridized. This experimental setup resulted in a total of 5 hybridizations per set (0h, 2h, 4, 8h, and 12h; Dex vs. Mock at each timepoint), and two biological replicate sets labeled with each dye polarity (Mock-Cy3/Dex-Cy5, and vice versa). The combined ratio data results are available as a supplementary file on the Series record.
