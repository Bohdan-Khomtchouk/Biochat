TITLE
Endogenous germline nuclear RNAi-mediated transcriptional silencing and histone H3 lysine 9 methylation in defined regions of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
We describe the identification and characterization of genomic regions that are targeted by germline nuclear RNAi in C. elegans for transcriptional silencing and heterochromatic response.

DESIGN
We compared the wild type and germline nuclear Argonaute protein hrde-1 mutant for their RNA polymerase II ChIP-seq, H3K9 trimethylation ChIP-seq, pre-mRNA seq, mRNA-seq, and small RNA-seq profiles.
