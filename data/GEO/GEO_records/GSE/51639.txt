TITLE
E. coli rnpb mutants: wild type proxy strain DW2/pFLP-Ec vs. DW2/pFLP-Bs strain

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of DW2 E. coli cells in exponential growth phase that have a chromosomal deletion of the rnpb gene (which encodes the catalytic subunit of Ribonuclease P). We compared the test strain DW2/pFLP-Bs that expresses Bacillus subtilis rnpb from plasmid pFLP-Bs to reference strain DW2/pFLP-Ec, which expresses E. coli rnpb from plasmid pFLP-Ec.

DESIGN
Two-strain experiment, wildtype proxy strain DW2/pFLP-Ec (reference) vs DW2/pFLP-Bs RT-10-2 (test) on each array. Biological replicates: 1 reference, 2 test. Four slides plus one dyeflip slide

PLATFORM
GPL17833 E. coli April-07_v2
