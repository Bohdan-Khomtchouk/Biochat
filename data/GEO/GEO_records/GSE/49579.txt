TITLE
Identification of miRNAs and Their Target Genes in Peach (Prunus persica L.) Using High-Throughput Sequencing and Degradome Analysis

ORGANISM
Prunus persica

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs play critical roles in various biological and metabolic processes. The function of miRNAs has been widely studied in model plants such as Arabidopsis and rice. However, the number of identified miRNAs and related miRNA targets in peach (Prunus persica) is limited. To understand further the relationship between miRNAs and their target genes during tissue development in peach, a small RNA library and three degradome libraries were constructed from three tissues for deep sequencing. We identified 117 conserved miRNAs and 186 novel miRNA candidates in peach by deep sequencing and 19 conserved miRNAs and 13 novel miRNAs were further evaluated for their expression by RT-qPCR. The number of gene targets that were identified for 26 conserved miRNA families and 38 novel miRNA candidates, were 172 and 87, respectively. Some of the identified miRNA targets were abundantly represented as conserved miRNA targets in plant. However, some of them were first identified and showed important roles in peach development. Our study provides information concerning the regulatory network of miRNAs in peach and advances our understanding of miRNA functions during tissue development.

DESIGN
To identify more conserved and peach-speciÔ¨Åc miRNAs and their target genes and to understand further the mechanism of miRNA-regulated target genes during tissue development in peach, a small RNA library and three degradome libraries were constructed from three different tissues for deep sequencing.
