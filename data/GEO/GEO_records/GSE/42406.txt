TITLE
Genome-wide expression profiling and functional characterization of SCA28 lymphoblastoid cell lines.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify altered pathways in SCA28 LCLs, we performed a whole genome expression profiling, based on Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Chip Array, on LCLs from four unrelated patients, each carrying a different AFG3L2 mutation.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling of 4 patients and 6 healthy controls

PLATFORM
GPL571 [HG-U133A_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array
