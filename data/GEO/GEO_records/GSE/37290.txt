TITLE
Expression Data from HNF1b-knockdown RMG2-ovarian cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a morphologically and biologically distinct subtype of ovarian carcinomas. We previously reported a gene expression profile characteristic of OCCC (OCCC signature), which contains hepatocyte nuclear facter-1b ( HNF-1b). To elucidate the biological role of HNF-1b in OCCC, we performed the suppression of the HNF-1b expression in human ovarian cancer cell line RMG2 using short hairpin RNA. We are now evaluating the functional effect using these cells.

DESIGN
Affimetrix Human Genome U133A plus 2.0 chips was conducted for HNF1b knockdown and non-silencing cells (five replicates each for RMG2-HNF1b-sh1 and RMG2-HNF1b-sh2, ten replicates for the RMG2-control). All specimens were arrayed in parallel and used for RMA normalization.
