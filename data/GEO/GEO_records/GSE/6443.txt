TITLE
Intestinal crypt stem and transit cell proliferation and villus cell migration in mice lacking Klf9

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Kr√ºppel-like factor 9 (Klf9), a zinc-finger transcription factor, is implicated in the control of cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell fate in brain and uterus.  Using Klf9 null mutant mice, we have investigated the involvement of Klf9 in small intestine crypt-villus cell renewal and lineage determination.  We report the predominant expression of Klf9 gene in small intestine smooth muscle (muscularis externa).  Jejunums null for Klf9 have shorter villi, reduced crypt stem/transit cell proliferation, and altered lineage determination as indicated by decreased and increased numbers of Goblet and Paneth cells, respectively.  A stimulatory role for Klf9 in villus cell migration was demonstrated by BrdU labeling.  Results suggest that Klf9 controls the elaboration, from small intestine smooth muscle, of molecular mediator(s) of crypt cell proliferation and lineage determination, and of villus cell migration. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted in parallel from the jejunums of five WT and five Klf9-/- male mice (PND 30) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).  Conversion of each RNA preparation to corresponding fragmented cRNA.  Fifteen ug of each cRNA was hybridized for 16 hours to an Affymetrix mouse 430A GeneChip.  Ten GeneChips (each corresponding to a single animal) were hybridized, washed and scanned in parallel.  Following the wash, signal amplification, and signal detection steps, GeneChips were scanned (Agilent GeneArray laser scanner) and the resultant images quantified using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software.
