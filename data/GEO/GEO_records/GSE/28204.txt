TITLE
mRNA expression profile in PCa And BPH from Chinese patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To study the miRNA modulating network and different expressed miRNA lists in prostate cancer, we use hight-throught method to genomically detect the expression profile of miRNA, mRNA and protein.

DESIGN
Agilent microarray products for miRNA and mRNA expression profile are choosed. As possible as we can to use the same sample for miRNA, mRNA and protein experiment. 4 prostate cancer and 4 normal tissue are applied to mRNA microarray experiment. The mRNA microaaray experiment service are supplied by ShanghaiBio Corporation(Shanghai,China).

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
