TITLE
Physical exercise on proteoglycan_induced arthritis (PGIA) mice_transcriptome responses on tarsal joint

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles in the tarsal bones and joints of mice that performed treadmill exercise vs. those who were not exercised were compared. Exercise induced the downregulation of genes and signaling pathways that mediates and promotes the inflammatory process and triggered the upregulation of genes associated to cartilage remodeling and bone mineralization.

DESIGN
Pools of total RNA were made per study group (seven mouse per group): PGIA exercised mice (test group) and PGIA non-exercised mice (reference). The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and the resulting complementary DNAs were labeled with Alexa547 (PGIA exercised mice) or Alexa555 (PGIA non-exercised mice). Hybridation analysis used the mouse 65-mer oligo library from Sigma-Genosys to compare the expression of 23,232 gene-specific oligonucleotide probes for mouse. The '2_M22K_09_24.xlsx' contains the raw data; the '3_M22K_09_24_normalized.xlsx' contains the normalized and background data for each channel (prior to generating the ratio data) Please note that AIPG (in the sample title) corresponds to PGIA (proteoglycan_induced arthritis) in the Series title
