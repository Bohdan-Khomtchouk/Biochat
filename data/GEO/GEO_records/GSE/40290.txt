TITLE
Molecular classification of non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma using mRNA expression profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To uncover potential molecular subtypes of non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gene expression profiles of primary NK-NPCs and NPs were conducted and analyzed using bioinformatics methods.

DESIGN
We collected 25 primary NK-NPCs and 8 nasopharynx tissues obtained from patients with inflamed nasopharyngeal mucosa. mRNA expression profiling was performed followed by bioinformatics analysis.
