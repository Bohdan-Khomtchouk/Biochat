TITLE
Microarray analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained in 27 moderate obese women

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms responsible for weight loss-induced improvement in insulin sensitivity are partially understood. Greater insight can now be achieved through deep phenotyping and data integration. Here, we used an integrative approach to investigate associations between changes in insulin sensitivity and variations in lifestyle factors (diet and physical activity), subcutaneous adipose tissue (sAT) gene expression, metabolomics in serum, urine and feces, and gut microbiota composition after a 6-week calorie restriction period in overweight and obese adults

DESIGN
Subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained by needle (BTA), in 27 moderate obese women.(BMI 33.3 Â± 3.8 kg / m2). Comparison of two periods: After diet (after 6 weeks VLCD) compared to before diet (J0). Total RNA was amplified and labeled using kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.
