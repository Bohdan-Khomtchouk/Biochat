TITLE
Senescent carcinoma associated fibroblasts up-regulate interleukin 8 to enhance pancreatic cancer progression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of the gene expression profile of senescent versus non-senescent cancer associated fibroblasts. The hypothesis tested is that senescent CAFs secrete higher levels of cytokines that promote cancer progression.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from control as well as senescent pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts
