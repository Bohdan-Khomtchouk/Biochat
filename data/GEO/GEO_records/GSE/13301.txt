TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933 during anaerobic growth using microarrays

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. EDL933

SUMMARY
The transcriptome of Escherichia coli K-12 has been widely studied over a variety of conditions for the past decade while such studies involving E. coli O157:H7, its pathogenic cousin, are just now being conducted. To better understand the impact of an anaerobic environment on E. coli O157:H7, global transcript levels of strain EDL933 cells grown aerobically were compared to cells grown anaerobically using microarrays.
