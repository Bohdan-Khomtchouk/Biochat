TITLE
Genome wide profiling of MBD2 binding

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We show that in vivo MBD2 is mainly recruited to CpG island promoters that are highly methylated. We also report that MBD2 binds to a subset of CpG island promoters that are characterized by the presence of active histone marks and RNA polymerase II (Pol2). At such sites, MBD2 binds downstream of the transcription start site. Active promoters bound by MBD2 show low to medium gene expression levels and H3K36me3 deposition suggesting a putative role for MBD2 in blocking polymerase II (Pol2) elongation at these promoters.

DESIGN
To gain further insight into the function of and epigenetic regulation by MBD2 we generated a tagged version of the protein and stably expressed it in the MCF-7 cell line. We mapped genome wide binding of MBD2 by ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) and together with base resolution whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) we were able to determine the methylation content and the role of methylation density at MBD2 enriched regions. We further dissected MBD2 binding properties, taking advantage of a large set of ChIP-seq data including active histone marks, RNA polymerase II (POL2) and strand specific RNA-seq.
