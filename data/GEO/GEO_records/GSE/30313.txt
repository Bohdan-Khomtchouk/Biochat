TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of the Neurospora crassa Δcre-1 mutant (FGSC 10372) compared to the wild type strain (FGSC 2489) in response to minimal medium or Avicel medium

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
In filamentous ascomycete fungi, the utilization of alternate carbon sources is influenced by the zinc finger transcription factor CreA/CRE-1, which encodes a carbon catabolite repressor protein homologous to Mig1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In Neurospora crassa, deletion of cre-1 results in increased secretion of amylase and β-galactosidase. Here, we determined the CRE-1 regulon by investigating the transcriptome of a Δcre-1 strain compared to wild type when grown on Avicel versus minimal medium (MM). Our data provide comprehensive information on the CRE-1 regulon in N. crassa and contribute to deciphering the global role of carbon catabolite repression in filamentous ascomycete fungi during plant cell wall deconstruction.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment (minimal medium vs. Avicel medium) of the Δcre-1 mutant strain compared to the wild type strain. Cy3 and Cy5 dye swaps were performed.
