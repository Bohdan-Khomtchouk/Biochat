TITLE
Transcriptional analysis of apoptotic cerebellar granule neurons following rescue by Gip, Sp, Pacap and Igf1

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Primary cultures of Cerebellar Granule Neurons (CGNs) have been extensively utilized to examine the signal transduction mechanisms underlying neuronal apoptosis. We conducted whole-genome expression profiling to decipher the transcriptional program controlling the apoptotic/survival switch in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) following the induction of apoptosis by serum and potassium deprivation and their rescue by gastric inhibitory polypeptide (Gip), substance p (Sp), insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1) or pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (Pacap). Our results reveal the transcriptional changes intersecting neuronal apoptosis and survival and form the basis for further functional analyses and pharmacological exploitation to identify neuroprotective drugs.

DESIGN
After six days “in vitro” (DIV), extracellular KCl of CGNs was shifted from 25 to 5 mM for neuronal apoptotic death induction. After two washes with serum-free BME containing 5 mM KCl, neurons were incubated with the same medium for 6 h (K5), while control neurons were incubated with serum free medium supplemented with 25 mM KCl (K25). K5 neurons were also treated with a maximal effective dose of Gip, Sp, Igf1 and Pacap.  Four biological replicates (derived from the same litter) for each of the experimental conditions (K25, K5, K5 + Gip; K25, K5, K5 + Sp; K25, K5, K5 + Igf1; K25, K5, K5 + Pacap) were analyzed.
