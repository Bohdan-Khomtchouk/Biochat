TITLE
Expression data from 45 paired of gastric cancer tissues and gastric normal tissues

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from gastric cancer tissues and gastric normal tissues to determine the differentially expressed genes in gastric cancer tissues.

DESIGN
90 tissues (45 paired of gastric cancer vs.normal tissues) were analysed. We generated the same number as pairwise comparisons. Genes with a fold-change > 1.5 were selected
