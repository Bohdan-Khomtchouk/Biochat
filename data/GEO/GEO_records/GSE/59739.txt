TITLE
RNA-Seq of single cells from the mouse lumbar dorsal root ganglion

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In order to establish a consensus catalog of dorsal rott ganglion cell types, we used comprehensive transcriptome analysis of single cells for unsupervised identification and molecular classification of sensory neurons independent of any a priori knowledge of sensory subtypes.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq was performed on 799 dissociated single cells dissected from the mouse lumbar dorsal root ganglion distributed over a total of nine 96-well plates

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus) GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
