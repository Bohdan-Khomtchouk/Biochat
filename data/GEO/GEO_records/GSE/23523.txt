TITLE
Hepatic gene expression profiling during Genistein and Quercetin treatments

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Differential gene expression in mice liver after Quercetin administration. Gene expression from control mice were compared with Quercetin treated mice at different dose level

DESIGN
2-color experiment. The normalization was done using channel split method as biological replicates were hybridized to the same microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL10569 Agilent Mouse 60K Genotypic Designed Array
