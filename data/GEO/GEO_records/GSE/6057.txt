TITLE
NGM versus CeMM growth

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
These three arrays are replicate extractions and hybridizations. Each array hybridizes labeled RNA from NGM plate grown, mixed stage, animals (Channel 1) against labled RNA from liquid CeMM grown, mixed stage, animals (Channel 2). A replicate experimental design type is where a series of replicates are performed to evaluate reproducibility or as a pilot study to determine the appropriate number of replicates for a subsequent experiments. Media: Channel 1 is NGM grown mixed stage animals, Channel 2 is CeMM grown mixed stage animals Keywords: replicate_design
