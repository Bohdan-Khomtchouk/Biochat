TITLE
RNA-Seq in hair follicle stem cell lineage

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNA_Seq on purified hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs)and their direct progenty, transit amplifying cells (TACs) using temorally and spatially regulated Cre lines.

DESIGN
Consequences of loss of Bmpr1a in either HFSC (K15-CrePGR;Bmpr1a fl/fl), or TACs (1. Shh-CreER:Bmpr1a fl/fl or 2. K15-CrePGR;Bmpr1a fl/fl derived)

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
