TITLE
Expression of seaweed genes induced by perwinkle grazing

ORGANISM
Fucus vesiculosus

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to elucidate changes in gene expression related to the induced anti-herbivory response in the brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus. Microarray hybridizations were used to identify genes differentially expressed in response to grazing by the periwinkle Littorina obtusata. This study shows that modifications in gene expression occur simultaneously to a reduced palatability and that defence induction entails reallocation of resources from primary to secondary metabolism with down-regulation of photosynthesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA of Fucus vesiculosus pieces that were or were not previously grazed by Littorina obtusata for 3, 12, 15, 21, and 24 days (5 biological replicates each) was hybridized against pooled RNA from 5 F. vesiculosus pieces that were collected before onset of grazing (day 0).
