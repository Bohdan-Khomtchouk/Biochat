TITLE
Mouse oocytes: High hydrostatic pressure (HP) treated vs. Control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcription profiling of mouse oocytes treated with 20 MPa hydrostatic pressure for 60 minutes at 37 Â°C comparing control oocytes kept under identical conditions as pressure treated ones, except HHP treatment.

DESIGN
One-condition experiment, HP treated oocytes vs. Control oocytes. Biological replicates: 4 HP treated replicates, 4 control replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL4134 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Feature Number version)
