SUMMARY
All samples were gathered from mouse RAW 264.7 cells (macrophages). Control total RNA was extracted from untreated RAW 264.7 cells cultured for either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 48 hours. Test total RNA was extracted from lipopolysaccharide (100ng/ml) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (100pM) treated RAW 264.4 cells cultured for either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 48 hours.
