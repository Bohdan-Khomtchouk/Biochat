TITLE
Gene expression in the Atlantic salmon adipose-derived stromal-vascular fraction during differentiation into adipocytes

ORGANISM
Salmo salar

SUMMARY
Changes of gene expression in primary cell cultures of salmon adipose-derived stromal-vascular fraction were studied at six time-points that covered the key differentiation events: confluence, clonal expansion, determination and establishment of the mature adipocyte phenotype.

DESIGN
Time-course experiment: six developmental stages of stromal-vascular fraction against the pooled reference. Biological replicates: 5 per developmental stage, pooled samples of all 6 stages were used as common reference. One stage per array.
