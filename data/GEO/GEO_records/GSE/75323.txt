TITLE
Genetic and Epigenetic Variation, but Not Diet, Shape the Sperm Methylome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The diet consumed by fathers prior to procreation impacts metabolic phenotypes in their offspring, but the mechanisms underlying such intergenerational information transfer remain obscure. Here, we carried out extensive analysis of cytosine methylation patterns in murine sperm, generating whole genome methylation maps for 4 pools of sperm samples and for 12 individual sperm samples, as well as 61 genome-scale reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) methylation maps, using samples obtained from male mice consuming various diets. We found that epivariation, either stochastic or due to unknown demographic or environmental factors, was a far stronger contributor to the sperm methylome than was the diet consumed. Variation in cytosine methylation was particularly dramatic over tandem repeat families, including ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats, and rDNA methylation levels were heritable from one generation to the next. However, rDNA methylation was strongly correlated with genetic variation in rDNA copy number, and analysis of hundreds of sperm samples revealed no consistent effect of diet on rDNA copy number or methylation level in sperm, indicating that paternal diet exerts an rDNA methylation-independent effect on offspring gene expression. These results reveal loci of genetic and epigenetic lability in the mammalian genome, but strongly argue against a direct mechanistic role for sperm cytosine methylation in dietary reprogramming of offspring metabolism.

DESIGN
4 Pooled WGBS libraries are analyzed. Each pool contains DNA from 7-8 mice. Methylation call data could not be located. Processed data not available for this study.
