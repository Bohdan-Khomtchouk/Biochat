TITLE
Differentially expressed transcripts in SLE blood monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To better characterize the molecules that could potentially confer antigen presenting capacity to SLE monocytes, we assessed their gene expression profile.

DESIGN
Blood monocytes from five healthy controls and five pediatric SLE patients were isolated using CD14+ selection. Because drugs used to treat SLE could induce considerable transcriptional changes, we selected active, newly diagnosed patients who had never received oral or intravenous (IV) medications.
