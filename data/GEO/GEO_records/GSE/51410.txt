TITLE
Profiling of circulating microRNAs in patients with Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNAs were extracted from plasma samples of healthy volunteers, patients with Barrett’s esophagus and patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. We used the Serum / Plasma Focus miRNA PCR panel (Exiqon, Denmark) to quantitate miRNA presence in the different patient groups.

DESIGN
PCR miRNA profiling. miRNA from three different patient groups were extracted from their plasma.
