TITLE
Expression data from Mst knockout embryoid bodies and wild type embryoid bodies

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mst1/Mst2 are central components of Hippo pathway. We examined the role of Mst1/Mst2 in ES cell differentiation. In this data set, we include expression data from day 4 and day 8 Mst1/Mst2 knockout ES cell formed embryoid bodies and wild type embryoid body controls.

DESIGN
total 4 samples.
