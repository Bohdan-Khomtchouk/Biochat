TITLE
Expression data of hAEC, hAFSC and hBMSC before and after osteogenic induction in vitro

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hAEC, hAFSC and hBMSC have been reported.The final tissue-forming potential of all three cell types may vary in terms of different anatomical origin and molecular response to osteogenic induction. We used microarrays to detail the global genes expression profiles of hAEC, hAFSC and hBMSC before and after osteogenic induction in vitro.

DESIGN
Global gene expression profiles of hAECs, hBMSCs and hAFMSCs were evaluated before and after 7-day osteogenic induction in vitro. Samples were subjected to gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix human HTA2.0 microarray.
