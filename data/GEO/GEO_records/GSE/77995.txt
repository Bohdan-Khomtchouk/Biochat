TITLE
Affymetrix CytoScan HD array data of iPSCs and iPSC-derived-NSPCs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cytoscan HD analysis on DNA samples from iPSCs, iPS-derived NSPCs

DESIGN
Affymetrix CytoScan HD array analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from three iPSCs, and their neural induced derivatives (NSPCs) using two different protocols. Each NSPC was cultured over 10 passages, and then their DNAs were also analyzed.
