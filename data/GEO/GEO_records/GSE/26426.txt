TITLE
Responsive genes upon deletion of the ohkA gene in Streptomyces coelicolor M145

ORGANISM
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)

SUMMARY
Transcription profile analysis between the wild-type strain M145 and the ohkA-deletion mutant to determine the overall transcription changes caused by the deletion of orphan histidine kinase gene ohkA in S.coelicolor.

DESIGN
Transcription changes between the ohkA mutant and the wild-type strain M145 were performed at three time points, 48,64,88h.
