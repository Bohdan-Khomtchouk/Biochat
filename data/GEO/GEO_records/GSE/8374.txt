TITLE
Gene regulation in Erbb2 transfected NIH3T3 cells after Azacytidine treatment

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
5-Azacytidine or 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine is a chemical analogue of the cytosine nucleoside used in DNA and RNA. Cells in the presence of 5-azacytidine incorporate it into DNA during replication and RNA during transcription. The incorporation of 5-azacytidine into DNA or RNA inhibits methyltransferase thereby causing demethylation in that sequence, affecting the way that cell regulation proteins are able to bind to the DNA/RNA substrate. Inhibition of DNA occurs through the formation of stable complexes between the molecule and with DNA methyltransferases, thereby saturating the cells methylation machinery. 5-azacytidine is mainly used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Changes in gene expression levels in Erbb2 transfected murine fibroblast cell line after treatment with Azacytidine in two different concentrations were analysed. Keywords: cDNA microarray, murine fibroblast, azacytidine treatment, carcinogenesis

DESIGN
Gene expression levels of Erbb2 transfected NIH3T3 cell lines treated with 5µM and 10µM Azacytidine were compared to Erbb2 transfected but non-treated NIH3T3 cell line. For each Azacytidine concentration 4-8 experiments were performed including 50% dye swaps. As a controll experiments gene expression levels of NIH3T3 cells with and without Azacytidine treatment were analysed
