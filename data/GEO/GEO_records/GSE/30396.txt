TITLE
Profile of gene expression signatures on DT40 cell for bursal-derived peptides

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To further elucidate the mechanism of bursal-derived bioactive peptides on avian B cell proliferation on the broad molecular level, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to examine gene expression patterns during BP5 and BSP-II treatment in DT40 cell culture system. Analysis of our expression microarray data in this manner defined 3163 genes up-regulated and 3539 genes down-regulated by BP5 treatment and 3117 genes up-regulated and 3531 genes down-regulated by BSP-II treatment at 95% confidence, with a commonly regulated gene set of 2253 upregulated genes and 2083 downregulated genes. Various pathways were significantly impacted by BP5 and BSP-II treatment, and gene Ontology annotations show changes in the expression of molecules involved in DT40 cell with BP5 and BSP-II treatment. Expression of 12 genes (FGF3, RAP1B, TCEB1, CSNK2A1, DNMT1, HIF1A, HDAC1, FZR1, GDF3, FGF8, IRF7, and SKP1) from this signature was quantified in the RNA samples by QRT-PCR, confirming low variability between the predicted response patterns.

DESIGN
BP5 and BSP-II induced gene expressions in DT40 cell were measured at 4 hours after exposure to doses of 0.02ug/ml and 2ug/ml, respectively.  Two independent experiments were performed using different cells for each experiment.Three independently generated populations of cells were used for these experiments.
