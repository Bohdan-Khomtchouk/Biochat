TITLE
Gene expression in luh mutant seeds in the dark: wild type (Col-0) vs. luh mutant

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of Arabidopsis far-red light pulse treated seeds comparing luh mutant with wild type (Col-0). Seeds were imbibed within 1 hr under white light and treated far-red light pulse for 5 min followed by 12 hr dark incubation. Goal was to determine the effects of LUH as transcriptional co-regulator during seed germination process.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wild type vs. luh mutant. Biological replicates: 3 wild type replicates, 3 luh mutant replicates.
