TITLE
Comparison between WT and apl in a novel in vitro tissue culture system, VISUAL

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We established a novel in vitro tissue culture system (named VISUAL), in which xylem and phloem differentiation can be induced with Arabidopsis thaliana cotyledons To compare gene expression profiles between WT and apl during vascular development, we performed GeneChip analysis using VISUAL.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis cotyledons cultured with the induction medium were sampled at 72 hours after the induction.
