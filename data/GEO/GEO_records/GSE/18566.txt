TITLE
Gene expression analysis of diet induced obesity model zebrafish

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
As microarray based gene expression profiling is well suited to study the complex diseases such as obesity, we revealed gene expression changes of fat tissues on obesity model zebrafish to elcidate the pathophysiological function of each fat tissue in metabolic syndrome.

DESIGN
Zebrafish in over-feeding group were fed three times per day with Artemia (60 mg cysts/fish/day) through 8weeks. 1week over-feeding group were fed three times per day with Artemia (60 mg cysts/fish/day) through 1week. For caloric restriction, zebrafish were fed with Artemia (2.5 mg cysts/fish/day) for 2 weeks after over-fed with Artemia for 8 weeks.
