TITLE
Expression data between FOXP3 wild type and 2T

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of the role of FOXP3 in CD4+ T effector cells. FOXP3 is transiently upregulated in T effector cells under activation. This temporary expression in Teff cells is insufficient to suppress expression of reported targets of FOXP3 repressor activity. The role of FOXP3 in T effector cells remains unclear. We used microarray analysis to detail the differentially expressed genes between FOXP3 wild type and 2T > C(mut) clones and identified classes of up-regulated or down-regulated genes based upon FOXP3 expression.

DESIGN
We used T effector cells from one IPEX disease carrier mother that consist of a mixed population ofFOXP3 wild type and 2T > C(mut) clones. We activated them using anti-CD3, anti-CD28. We compareFOXP3 wild type and 2T > Cl clones at different stages: resting phase and activated phase at 72hrs.
