TITLE
Identification of miRNAs associated with chemotherapiutic response in lung adenocarcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of chemo-responders and non-responders reveals miRNAs expression differences, we therefore demonstrated that miRNAs could be a therapeutic biomarker of chemotherapy to lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). we have employed miRNAs microarray expression profile as a discovery platform to identify miRNAs differentially expressed between responders and non-responders to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. In total 40 cases of our study cohort, including 16 responders and 24 non-responders, we found that a 3-miRNAs signature (miR-1290, miR-196b, and miR-135a*) could predict the responder with the highest accuracy in study cohort (82.5%). This finding further validated in an independent additional cohort.

DESIGN
MiRNA microarray expression was measured in 40 LADC cases, including 16 responders and 24 non-responders to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.
