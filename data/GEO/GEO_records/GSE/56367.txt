TITLE
Jmjd3-mediated H3K27me3 dynamics orchestrate brown fat cell fate transition and regulate white fat plasticity (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We performed RNA-Seq for brwon fat, epididymal white fat and soleus muscle of mice to identify brown fat-selective, white fat-selective and common fat genes.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq for brown fat, white fat and soleus muscle of wild type C56BL6 mice.

PLATFORM
