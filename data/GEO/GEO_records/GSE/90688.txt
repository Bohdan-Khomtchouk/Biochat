TITLE
Genome-wide data of RNAs associated to Mmi1 in wild type Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Mmi1 is a YTH domain containing protein. We used Solexa Deep Sequencing to identify the mRNas and lncRNAs specifically associated to Mmi1.

DESIGN
Solexa libraries were made with RNA purified from anti-Mmi1immunoprecipitations or irrelevant immunoprecipitations from wild type S. pombe cells. Libraries were made in duplicates and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2000

PLATFORM
GPL13988 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe)
