TITLE
Wild type yeast and H3del(1-28) and H4del(2-26) yeast grown in complete synthetic media

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Yeast lacking the H3 or H4 amino termini, and corresponding wild type strains, were grown in synthetic media.  These conditions induce Gcn4-activated transcription. Keywords: Genetic modification

DESIGN
Three replicates of the H4del(2-26) and corresponding wild type strains, and four replicates of the H3del(1-28) and corresponding wild type strains, were performed.  Note the strains are congenic, but differ in whether the histones were present on TRP1 marked (H4) or LEU2 marked (H3) plasmids.  Samples were analysed using Affymetrix S98 microarrays.
