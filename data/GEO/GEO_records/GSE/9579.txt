TITLE
Gene Expression in Acute Appendicitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression was evaluated in 9 appendix samples removed from patients who went to the operating room with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and 4 samples removed for non-inflammatory reasons. A circumferential piece of tissue was obtained at the distal aspect of each specimen.  The tissue was flash frozen at -80 degrees for later processing.  Frozen specimens were homogenized into TriReagent  and RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instruction.  RNA was processed and hybridized to Affymetrix microarray. Keywords: Disease state analysis
