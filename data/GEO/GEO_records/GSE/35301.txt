TITLE
Total Gene expression analysis of H3f3b conditional knockout MEFs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Total gene expression analysis was performed on CRE induced conditional knockout E12.5 MEFs relative to GFP infected control MEFs. Intent was to analyze the role of H3f3b in overall gene expression.

DESIGN
For conditional KO, three lines of H3f3b FL/FL E12.5 MEFs (cKO1, cKO2 and pcKO1) were transduced with Cre retroviruses and compared to their respective lines of MEFs transduced solely with GFP vector (as control). Total RNA was isolated for gene analysis.
