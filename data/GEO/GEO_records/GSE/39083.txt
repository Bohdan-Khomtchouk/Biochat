TITLE
RNA expression in Drosophila melanogaster mutants lacking HP1a

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
mRNA expression levels were determined by NGS for wildtype larvae as well as for larvae lacking HP1a [Su(var)205^04/Su(var)205^05 transheterozygotes].

DESIGN
RNA samples from wildtype (OR) and HP1a mutant third instar larvae were examined, using duplicate biological samples and Illumina NGS.
