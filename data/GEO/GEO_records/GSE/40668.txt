TITLE
An atlas of in vivo transcribed enhancers in human primary cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Enhancers are powerful regulatory regions, important for development and the maintenance of differentiated cells and tissues. Here, we generate global maps for two enhancer-associated histone marks, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac for a number of major human blood cell types. This data was generated to show that capped RNAs transcribed bidirectionally can identify known and novel enhancers in vivo.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq of 2 histone marks in human blood monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+CD25-CD45RA+ naive T cells, & NK cells

PLATFORM
GPL9052 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Homo sapiens)
