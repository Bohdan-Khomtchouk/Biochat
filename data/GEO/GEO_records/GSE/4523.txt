Expression Studies of Melanotransferrin in Mouse Brain

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Melanotransferrin (MTf) or melanoma tumor antigen p97 is an iron (Fe)-binding transferrin homolog expressed highly on melanomas and at lower levels on normal tissues. It has been suggested that MTf is involved in a variety of processes such as Fe metabolism and cellular differentiation. Considering the crucial role of Fe in many metabolic pathways e.g., DNA synthesis, it is important to understand the function of MTf. To define the roles of MTf, a MTf knockout (MTf -/-) mouse model was developed. Examination of the MTf -/- mice demonstrated no phenotypic differences compared to wild-type littermates. However, microarray analysis showed differential expression of molecules involved in proliferation such as Mef2a, Tcf4, Gls and Apod in MTf -/- mice compared to MTf +/+ littermates, suggesting a role for MTf in proliferation and tumorigenesis.
