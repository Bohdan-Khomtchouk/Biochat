TITLE
High-sucrose/low-oil comparative genomic hybridization analysis in glycine max fast neutron mutants

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
Two high-sucrose/low-oil mutants (FN0176450/2012CM7F040P06/SRX826343 and FN0176450/2012CM7F040P05/SRX826351) were identified in a soybean fast neutron population (Bolon et al. 2014). These mutant lines were then advanced to the M3:7 generation and compared to thier wild-type parent (M92-220-Long) using CGH to identify the causative region/gene associated with high-sucrose/low-oil.Â 

DESIGN
Four samples were analyzed, two plants from CM7F040P05 and two plants from CM7F040P06 fast neutron lines. Each sample was compared to its wild type parent (M92-220-Long) using Agilent CGH arrays.
