TITLE
A transcriptomic signature of mouse liver progenitor cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A transcriptomic meta-analysis of over 400 microarrays was undertaken to compare LPC lines against datasets of; muscle and embryonic stem cell lines, embryonic and developed liver (DL), and HCC. Uploaded here, is the array data from seven of the ten LPC lines used. These seven were prepared in our laboratory. The remaining LPC arrays and arrays from other tissues/cells were obtained from the GEO.

DESIGN
A total of 405 microarrays were analysed in a meta analysis. This included the 381 publically-sourced arrays (13 of which were LPC arrays) and 24 LPC arrays performed within our lab. This data was mined to obtain signature LPC pathways and novel markers. A summary of all arrays used in the analysis can be found in
