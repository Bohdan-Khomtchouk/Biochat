TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in pericytes extracted from pulmonary aterial hypertension (PAH) patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Performed a transcriptome analysis of patient-derived donor control and PAH lung pericytes followed by functional genomics analysis. Diseased pericytes demonstrated significant enrichment of genes involved in various metabolic processes

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from three IPAH pericytes vs. three Control donor pericytes

PLATFORM
GPL10904 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip (gene symbol)
