TITLE
The Scc2NIPBL/Scc4MAU2 complex acts in sister chromatid cohesion and transcriptional regulation by maintaining nucleosome-free regions [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The Scc2/Scc4 complex binds to broad nucleosome-free regions in the promoters of highly expressed genes. The cohesin loader is recruited to these sites by the RSC chromatin remodeling complex

DESIGN
ChIp- Sequencing analysis of the distribution of Scc2 and Scc4 on budding yeast chromosomes.An input sample was analysed as a control.
