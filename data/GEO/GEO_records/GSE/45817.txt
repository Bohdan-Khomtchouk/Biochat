TITLE
mRNA profiling in enterovirus type 71-infected SH-SY5Y cells after transfection with miR-1246 inhibitor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Today, the pathogenesis of human enterovirus type 71 (HEV71) infection in human central neural system remains unclear. HEV71 is the major pathogen of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), and has been associated with severe neurological disease and even death in infants and young children. We employed the human whole genome microarray analyze the mRNA profiling in human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y infected with HEV71 after transfection. Firstly, SH-SY5Y cells were transfected wtih miR-1246 inhibitor and negtive control respectively using HiPerFect Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then the cells were infected with HEV71 after transfection. After 12 hours infection, the cells were harvested to microarray analysis. The results showed the altered expression of mRNAs including up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes.  Overall, this finding will help to understand the functional genes in HEV71-infected human neuroblastoma cells and miR-1246-virus-host interaction.

DESIGN
SH-SY5Y cells were transfected wtih miR-1246 inhibitor and negtive control respectively using HiPerFect Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then the cells were infected with HEV71 after transfection. After infection, the cells were harvested to microarray analysis. Total RNA of cells infected with HEV71 was extracted using the TRIZOL Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene-expression profiling was performed for each pooling RNA sample separately on the GeneChip_ Porcine Genome Array at CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China).
