TITLE
Expression data from Balb/c mice kidney samples

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Males are 50% more likely to develop end stage kidney failure compared to women. As a model of the human condition we analyzed gene expression changes in healthy and diseased mouse kidneys. Interestingly, the set of gender biased genes in healthy kidneys were different from those in diseased kidneys indicating not only baseline gene expression differences but also that the male and female kidney respond differently to disease condition. Keywords: Gender difference

DESIGN
We used AffymetrixM430A2.0 microarrays to determine global gene expression differences in kidneys of 10-week old healthy Balb/c male and female mice. In order to identify gene expression differences under disease conditions, animals were injected with doxorubicin, a substance that is known to induce albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in Balb/c mice as it is directly toxic to podocytes.
