TITLE
Proinflammatory isoforms of IL-32 as novel and robust biomarkers for control failure in HIV-infected slow-progressors.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HIV-infected slow-progressors (SP) represent a heterogeneous group of subjects who spontaneously control HIV infection without treatment for several years while showing moderate signs of disease progression. Here we determined the frequency of SP subjects who showed loss of HIV control within our Canadian Cohort of HIV+ Slow-Progressors and identified the proinflammatory cytokine IL-32 as a robust biomarker for control failure.

DESIGN
Total cellular RNA was extracted from PBMC from 5 donors at two time points ('V1' before and 'V2' after loss of control, and only Long Term Non Progressors (LTNP) were part of the case study), along with 2 control Leuka914 and Aging106032 samples.
