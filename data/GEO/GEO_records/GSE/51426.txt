TITLE
Dynamic profile of gene expression in rice panicle of post-meiosis under high temperature

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
To comprehend the gene expression profile in rice panicle under high temperature, Agilent 4Ã—44k rice oligo microarray experiments were carried out using rice panicle of post-meiosis at 0 min, 10min, 20 min, 60 min, and 2 hr after the treatment of 40 degree centigrade, and the differentially expressed genes at the time course were involved in binding, catalysis, stress response, and cellular process. The significantly expressed genes were mainly up-regulated. Among HR genes, the predominant transcription factor gene families were Hsf, NAC, AP2/ERF, WRKY, MYB, and C2H2. The MapMan analysis demonstrated that, under heat treatment, the HR genes were enriched in the pathways related to biotic stress, abiotic stress including heat and cold, and cell cycle and development, ubiquitin-proteasome , lipid and secondary metabolisms, which revealed the great importance of cross-talk and protein homeostasis in response to heat in rice panicle of post-meiosis.

DESIGN
Heat shock induced gene expression in rice panicle of late developmental stage was measured at 0min, 10min, 20min, 60min, and 2hr after the treatment of 40 degree centigrade in plant growth chamber. Two independent replicate experiments were performed at each time point.
