TITLE
mRNA Sequencing of Human PromoCells Using 3'-directed Digital Gene Expression (3'-DGE) Technique

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The differential gene expression of human cardiomyocytes induced by kinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib is measured by a high-throughput mRNA-sequencing approach called 3'-DGE, that is based on a 3' end-focused reference sequence library and a transcript molecule counting method with unique molecular identifiers (UMI) for correcting PCR bias.

DESIGN
Cells were treated with sunitinib, sorafenib, or vehicle control for 48 hours, and gene expression levels of all samples were measured by 3'-DGE and conventional random-primed mRNA-sequencing methods using paired-end reading to obtain the genome-wide expression profiles for each sample.
