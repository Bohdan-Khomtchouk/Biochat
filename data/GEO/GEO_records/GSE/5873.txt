TITLE
sva53 mutant ovary

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles between sva53 mutant and control ovaries (sva53/+) were examined. Keywords: mutant assay

DESIGN
Total RNA was purified from the ovaries of ~7-day-old sva53 mutant flies. Two pairs of ovaries were pooled for each of the 3 independent experiments. sva53/+ flies serve as a control. Total RNA purified from three pairs of control ovaries were used as a common reference in all hybridizations.
