TITLE
Peripheral blood transcriptome profiles derived from parallel venipuncture (PAXgene and mononuclear cell; PBMC) and dried blood spot (DBS) samples.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcript abundance estimates and bioinformatic inferences derived from DBS vs PAXgene vs peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was conducted using parallel collection and assay of venipuncture samples (PAXgene and PBMC) and DBS samples. Data come from 83 community dwelling adults recruited from the Chicago metropolitan area.  In addition to basic demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), participants were also assessed on health-related characteristics (body mass index/BMI; history of smoking or heavy alchol consumption), and educational attainment (z-score transformed).  Categorial variables were coded 0=no/absent and 1=yes/present.
