TITLE
Gene expression profile in IM-0223 cells transfected with KPC1 or control vector using RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer with increasing incidence rates and a poor survival, particularly in patients with AJCC stage IV and advanced stage III. Deregulation of NF-kB is linked to different pathological states, including melanoma. To identify the involvement of NF-kB pathway regulation in melanoma progression, we manipulated NF-kB pathway activation and profiled gene expression using RNA-sequencing.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of IM-0223 cells overexpressing KPC1 (KPC1) or control (V0) generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500.
