TITLE
Expression data from patient and primary xenografts esophageal tumour samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to assess differences between 1) human tumours that did and did not engraft, 2) human tumours and their matched primary xenografts, 3) early and late passage primary xenografts and 4) small and large primary xenografts for a series of esophageal patient and primary xenograft tumours

DESIGN
Patient esophageal tumour samples were obtained and inplanted in NOD/SCID mice; xenografts that formed were passaged from mouse to mouse. Samples of different passages were selected for profiling.
