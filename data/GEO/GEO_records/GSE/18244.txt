TITLE
Lewis lung carcinoma cells and TDAG8 overexpression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We observed the effects of TDAG8-overexpression in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells on the gene expression pattern.

DESIGN
TDAG8-overexpressing or vector-transfected control LLC cells (5 × e5 in 200 µL of HBSS) were injected into the lateral tail veins of 6–8-week-old C57BL/6 mice. Lungs were removed on day 19 post-injection, and total RNA was extracted.
