TITLE
Mandibular precursor at E13.5 in Ts65Dn Down syndrome mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of mandibular precursor from embryonic day 13.5 trisomic and euploid embryos from the Ts65Dn Down syndrome mouse model. Results provide insight into importance of non-trisomic genes in organogenesis.
