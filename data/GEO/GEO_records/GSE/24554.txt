TITLE
Mandibular precursor at E13.5 in Ts65Dn Down syndrome mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression of mandibular precursor from embryonic day 13.5 trisomic and euploid embryos from the Ts65Dn Down syndrome mouse model. Results provide insight into importance of non-trisomic genes in organogenesis.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from mandibular precursor of 13 trisomic and 11 euploid E13.5 embryos.

PLATFORM
GPL11017 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip (gene version 2)
