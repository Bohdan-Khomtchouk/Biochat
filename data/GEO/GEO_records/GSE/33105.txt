TITLE
Ketogulonicigenium vulgare cells: Acid-stressed vs. Control

ORGANISM
Ketogulonicigenium vulgare

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of K. vulgare cells, co-cultured with Bacillus megaterium, comparing control untreated cells with cells treated with pH 4.0 for 2 h. Differentially expressed genes in acid-stressed cells were analyzed. The aim was to investigate the mechanisms of K. vulgare in response to acid stress on global gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, acid-stressed (pH 4.0) cells vs. control cells. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 acid-stressed replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL14693 Agilent_028085 Ketogulonigenium vulgare custom microarray [Probe Name version]
