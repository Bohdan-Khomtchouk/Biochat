SUMMARY
Array CGH of Mexican patient strains from Javier Torres laboratory analyzed by Carolina Romo. Patients have a range of pathologies form gastritis to ulcer to cancer. Multiple strains were isolated from each patient and all those giving distinct RAPD patterns were profiled against a reference sample of 26695/J99 genomic DNA. For each array 0.25-1 micrograms of genomic DNA of a test strains was labeled with Cy5 and 0.5 micrograms of an equimolar mix of 26695 and J99 genomic DNA was labeled with Cy3. A clinical history design type is where the organisms clinical history of diagnosis, treatments, e.g. vaccinations, surgery etc. Individual: Patient from whom the strain was isolated (#) Disease State: Disease of patient from whom the strain was isolated Replicate: strain isolate (within patient) (#) Keywords: clinical_history_design
