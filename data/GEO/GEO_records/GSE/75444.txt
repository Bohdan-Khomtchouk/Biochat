TITLE
The histone variant H2A.X is a regulator of Epithelialâ€“Mesenchymal Transition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), considered essential for metastatic cancer, has been a focus of much research, but important questions remain. Here, we show that silencing or removing H2A.X, a histone H2A variant involved in cellular DNA repair and robust growth, induced mesenchymal-like characteristics including activation of  EMT transcription factors, Slug and ZEB1, in HCT116 human colon cancer cells. Ectopic H2A.X re-expression partially reversed these changes; as did silencing Slug and ZEB1. In an experimental metastasis model, the HCT116 parental and H2A.X-null cells exhibited similar metastases levels, but the cells with re-expressed H2A.X exhibited substantially elevated levels. We surmise that H2A.X re-expression led to partial EMT reversal and increased robustness in the HCT116 cells, permitting them to both form tumors and to metastasize. In a human adenocarcinoma panel, H2A.X levels correlated inversely with Slug and ZEB1 levels. Together, these results point to H2A.X as a novel regulator of EMT.

DESIGN
9 samples in total including 4 replicates of control shRNA and 5 replicates of shH2A.X.
