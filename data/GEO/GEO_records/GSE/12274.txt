TITLE
Mesenchymal Stromal Cells of Different Donor Age

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this series we have analyzed the effect of donor age on the gene expression profile of mesenchymal stromal cells (alternatively named mesenchymal stem cells; MSC) from human bone marrow. Cells were taken from bone marrow aspirates from iliac crest (BM) of healthy donors or from the caput femoris (HIP) of elderly patients that received femoral head prosthesis.
