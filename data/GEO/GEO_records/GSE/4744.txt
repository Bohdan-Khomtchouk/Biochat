TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of stress-response in cultured porcine islets

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
An increasing demand for cell-based diabetes therapy could be met through xenotransplantation of adult porcine islets. Use of islet xenotranplantation on a large scale would require rigorous safety and quality control measures to maximize transplant success. Development of molecular tools to monitor porcine islet cellular responses to ischemic, osmotic, mechanical and oxidative stresses during islet cell processing and post-isolation culturing would aid the rational design of cytoprotective strategies aimed at improving transplant outcomes. In addition, gene expression signatures informative for islet quality could serve as an adjunct to physiological testing to establish the suitability of islet products for transplantation. Keywords: stress response
