TITLE
Plane of nutrition prepartum and bovine hepatic gene expression profiles

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Cows were selected from two groups of 12 cows enrolled in a large experiment to assess the effects of ad libitum or restricted intake of moderate-energy diets during the entire dry period on pre-partum metabolism and post-partum metabolism and performance.  A corn silage-based diet (26% of diet dry matter) providing 1.59 Mcal/kg during the far-off dry period (first 5 wk of an 8-wk dry period) or providing 1.61 Mcal/kg during the close-up dry period (last 3 wk of the dry period) was fed for ad libitum or restricted intake.  Four multiparous Holstein cows were randomly selected from the ad libitum and restricted intake groups. Keywords: time course, ad libitum or restricted feeding prepartum
