TITLE
Whole human genome expression analysis on left ventricular free wall heart tissue samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human left ventricular free wall heart tissue was obtained from end-stage heart failure patients at the moment of heart transplantation Left ventricular free wall samples were also obtained from healthy hearts of organ donors, which were not used for transplantation due to size mismatch with available recipients.

DESIGN
RNA Extraction was done on frozen tissues without stimulation. Whole genome expression analysis was conducted on 10 CCC and 7 control samples; *CTL (control samples): left ventricular free wall samples were also obtained from healthy  hearts of organ donors, which were not used for transplantation due to size mismatch with available recipients. *CCC (patients samples): patients have severe Chagas  Chronic  Cardiomyopathy (severe dilated cardiomyopathy). Human left ventricular free wall heart tissue was obtained from end-stage heart failure patients at the moment of heart transplantation.
