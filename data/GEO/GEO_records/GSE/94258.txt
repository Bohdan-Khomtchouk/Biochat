TITLE
Seasonal changes of gene expression of eyes in Medaka fish (Oryzias latipes)

ORGANISM
Oryzias latipes

SUMMARY
To examine the seasonal adaptation, we compared the gene expression of eyes between SL (short-day and low-temperature conditions: 10 h light/14 h dark and 8 °C) and LD (long-day and warm-temperature conditions: 14 h light/10 h dark and 26 °C) conditions in Medaka fish (Oryzias latipes).

DESIGN
The gene expression of eyes was measured at 16 hours after light onset (zeitgeber time: ZT16) on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 14 after transfer from SL to LD conditions. For each time point, cRNAs prepared from pooled eyes (n=3) were hybridized to duplicate sets of microarrays.
