TITLE
Opposing Effects of HIF1α and HIF2α on Chromaffin Cell Phenotypic Features and Tumor Cell Proliferation: Insights from MAX [rat]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are catecholamine-producing tumors with diverse phenotypic features reflecting mutations in numerous genes, including MYC-associated factor X (MAX). To establish whether PPGL phenotypic differences reflect a MAX-mediated mechanism and opposing influences of HIF2α and HIF1α, we combined observational investigations in PPGLs and gene-manipulation studies in two pheochromocytoma cell lines. In cell lines lacking Max, re-expression of the gene resulted in maturation of phenotypic features and decreased cell cycle progression. In cell lines lacking Hif2α, overexpression of the gene led to immature phenotypic features, failure of dexamethasone to induce differentiation and increased proliferation. HIF1α has opposing actions to HIF2α. These model systems explain the features observed in PPGLs due to mutations of MAX and other PPGL susceptibility genes.

DESIGN
PC12 cell lines were cultured, one transfected with an emply vector (PC12wt) and the other transfected with an expression plasmid coding the MAX gene. In total four samples were hybridized, each experimental condition had two biological replicates obtained at two different cell passages (8 and 13).
