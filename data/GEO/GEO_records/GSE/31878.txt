TITLE
Gene expression profiling in HEK293 cells overexpressed lactoferrin gene that has the signal sequence (sLF) or not (ΔLF)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional protein involved in immunomodulation, cell growth, and differentiation. In addition to the secreted form (sLF), an alternatively spliced form (ΔLF) that lacks the signal sequence and downregulated in cancer was found. This study was carried out to identify and compare signaling networks provoked by the two LF isoforms. To do this, the two forms were overexpressed in HEK293 cells using the flp-in/tet-on system and genome-wide expression analysis of 18,367 genes was conducted.

DESIGN
Secreted form (sLF) or alternatively spliced form (ΔLF) were overexpressed in HEK293 cells using the flp-in/tet-on system and genome-wide expression analysis of 18,367 genes was conducted.
