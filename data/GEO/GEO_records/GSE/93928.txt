TITLE
Altered expression of genes in HOXD-AS1 knockdown prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that arise after the failure of androgen deprivation therapy is a leading cause of deaths in prostate cancer patients. HOXD-AS1 is reported to play a role in bladder cancer and neuroblastoma. However, its function and underlying mechanism in CRPC remains unknown. The goal of this study is to identify the target genes of HOXD-AS1 in prostate cancer. Our results inditcate that the genes regulated by HOXD-S1 involved in a variety of biological functions, such as proliferation and and Androgen Receptor signaling.

DESIGN
prostate cancer cell lineLNCaP was transfected with the contol siRNA or two different HOXD-AS1 siRNA for 48h. The RNA of the transfected cells was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We indentified the putative target genes of HOXD-AS1 in both HOXD-AS1 siRNAs by comparing  the diferent expressed genes among control, si-HOXD-AS1-1 and si-HOXD-AS1-2. We futher validated the data of microarray in LNCaP and PC-3 by RT-qPCR and Western bloting.
