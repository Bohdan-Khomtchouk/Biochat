TITLE
PTHRP/Adenylate cyclase promotes parietal whereas Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes visceral endoderm differentiation of rat XEN cells.

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
In this study we showed that rat XEN cells grown in the presence of a GSK3 inhibitor exhibited enhanced formation of cell contacts and decreased motility. In contrast, treatment with forskolin induced the PE formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in rat XEN cells. Using microarray and real-time PCR assays, we found that VE versus PE formation of rat XEN cells was correlated with change in expression levels of VE or PE marker genes.  Similar to forskolin, EMT was prompted upon treatment of rat XEN cells with recombinant parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHRP), an activator of the cAMP pathway in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest that rat XEN cells are PrE-like cells. The activation of Wnt pathway in rat XEN cells leads to the acquisition of VE characteristics, whereas the activation of the PTHRP/cAMP pathway leads to EMT and the formation of PE.

DESIGN
Rat XEN cells were cultured in four different conditions with 3 parallels for each condition: (1-3) without treatments control, (4-6) 2 days treated with CHIR alone, (7-9) 1 day treated with CHIR and 1 day with both CHIR and forskolin, and (10-12) 1 day treated with forskolin alone. In all samples on DAY1 cells were plated, at DAY2 cells were cultured in usual conditions (DMEM F12 medium and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, both from Sigma) and inhibitor of GSK3 kinase  3 μM CHIR99021 (Axon Medchem) was added in samples 4-9. On DAY3 all cells were cultured in medium with 0.1% serum to exclude the influence of serum and in CONTROL (1-3) cells were cultured without experimental treatments, in CHIR (4-6) cells were further cultured with  3 μM CHIR99021, in CHIR plus FORSKOLIN cells were cultured with  3 μM CHIR99021 and 10μM Forskolin (Sigma), in FORSKOLIN cells were cultured for 1 day with 10 μM Forskolin. On DAY4 RNA was isolated.
