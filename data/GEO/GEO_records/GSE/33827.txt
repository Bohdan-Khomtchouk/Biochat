SUMMARY
Small-molecule Smac mimetics target inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins to induce TNFÎ±-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells and several Smac mimetics have been advanced into clinical development as a new class of anticancer drugs. However, preclinical studies have shown that only a small subset of cancer cell lines are sensitive to Smac mimetics used as single agents and these cell lines are at risk of developing drug resistance to Smac mimetics. Thus, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying intrinsic and acquired resistance of cancer cells to Smac mimetics in order to develop effective therapeutic strategies to overcome or prevent Smac mimetic resistance. We established Smac mimetic resistant sublines derived from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which exhibit exquisite sensitivity to the Smac mimetic SM-164, and used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying SM-164 resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells and identified differentially expressed genes in SM-164-resistant and -sensitive  MDA-MB-231 cells.

DESIGN
SCID mice with MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors were treated with 5 mg/kg of SM-164 intravenously for 5 days/week for 2 weeks. SM-164-regressed MDA-MB-231 tumors regrew after treatment ended. Tumor cells from these regrown MDA-MB-231 tumors were isolated and total RNAs were prepared for microarray analysis.
