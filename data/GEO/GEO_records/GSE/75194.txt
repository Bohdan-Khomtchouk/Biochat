TITLE
IFNa dose response in primary murine B cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
B cells respond robustly to IFNa. Here we analyze gene expression profiles of primary murine splenic B cells treated with 10 fold serially diluted IFNa in vitro. We explore sensitivity to ISGs to IFNa as they relate to dose. Generally ISGs do not cluster significantly in a dose dependent manner. However there are notable spreads in sensitivity to IFNa.

DESIGN
Splenic B cells were isolated by negative selection from 6wk old male C57BL/6 mice. These were cultured with IFNa (0U/ml-10 000U/ml) for 2hrs in vitro. Cells were then transferred directly into TriZol. RNA was prepared in Trizol for gene expression profiling by  Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays in triplicate for each concentration of IFNa.
