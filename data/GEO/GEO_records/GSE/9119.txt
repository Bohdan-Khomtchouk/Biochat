TITLE
Primary human peripheral Blood B cell Acute Stimulation - anti_IgM

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To identify genes in human peripheral blood B cells whose expression changes with acute stimulation through the antigen receptor using anti_IgM. Keywords: time series design

DESIGN
Peripheral human blood B cells were purified and gene expression from unstimulated cells (resting) was compared to cells stimulated with anti_IgM for 1hr and 3hrs using Affymetrix U133 arrays. Two unistimulated cell microarrays were biological replicates.
