TITLE
Divergent Patterns of Endogenous Small RNA Populations From Seed and Vegetative Tissues of Glycine max

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
An overview of small RNAs sequences existing in seed development and contrasted with vegetative tissues of the soybean

DESIGN
Four small RNA sequence populations from high throughput  deep sequencing-by-synthesis and representing different tissues/organs of the soybean were characterized into small RNA classes, level of expresion, genes of origin and putative targeted genes
