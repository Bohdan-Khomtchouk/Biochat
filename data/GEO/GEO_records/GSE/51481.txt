TITLE
Gene expression profiling of WWOX-overexpressing glioblastoma T98G cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The WWOX gene is known for its tumor suppressor character and seems to be one of the main cellular regulators of cell cycle and apoptosis. The aim of the study was to identify cellular pathways and biological processes influenced by WWOX in glioblastoma cells. Our experiment showed that in this type of cancer WWOX, beside cell cycle and apoptosis control, may be involved in metabolism, cytoskeleton structure and differentiation.

DESIGN
T98G glioblastoma cells were stably transfected with WWOX cDNA. T98G cells transfected with an empty vector served as a control. Total mRNA was isolated to look for gene-expression differences induced by the WWOX overexpression.
