TITLE
nasopharyngeal carcinoma versus nasopharyngeal phlogistic tissue reference

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains a majoy health problem worldwide, specially in Southeast China. In order to find the new candidate genes and molecular markers that are associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), this study focused on the screening NPC relative genes by gene expression profile. Keywords: disease state analysis

DESIGN
23 NPC biopsies and 15 nasopharynx chronic phlogistic biopsies were used to screen NPC relative genes by BioStarH-141s (2004) profile gene chips which contained 14112 points of full length human genes. The tumor samples were labeled with Cy5-dUTP.The nasopharyngeal phlogistic tissues  were labeled with Cy3-dUTP. Biostatistics and bioinformatics were also used to analyse the differently expressed genes.

PLATFORM
