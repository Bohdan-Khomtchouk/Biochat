TITLE
Gene expression in LCMV-specific Blimp-1 deficient effector CD8+ T cells compared to wildtype effector CD8+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Antigen-specific effector CD8+ T cells deficient in Blimp-1 (Prdm1) do not acquire maximal effector functions, evade terminal differentiation, and more rapidly acquire some hallmark properties of memory CD8+ T cells. In this study, we compared the gene expression profiles of wildtype and Prdm1-/- LCMV-specific effector CD8+ T cells to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this striking phenotype.

DESIGN
DNA microarray analysis was performed of DbGP33-41 and DbNP396-404 tetramer-positive effector CD8+ T cells FACS-sorted at day 8 post-LCMV infection from four independent samples of either Blimp-1 conditional knockout mice (CKO;  Blimp-1flox/flox x GranzymeB-cre+) or wildtype (WT) littermate controls.
