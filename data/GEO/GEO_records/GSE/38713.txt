Expression data from intestinal mucosa of patients with UC

SUMMARY
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon with preiods of active disease followed by remission. We performed a whole-genome transcriptional analysis of colonic biopsies from patients with histologically active and inactive UC, as well as non-inflammatory controls.

DESIGN
Ulcerative colitis patients and non-inflammatory controls were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Inclusion criteria for UC patients were: age between 18 and 65, diagnosis of UC established at least 6 months before inclusion and exclusion of concomitant infection. Active disease was defined by endoscopic and histologic score: Mayo sub score > =2 and MATTS > =3 respectively . Inactive disease was also defined by endoscopic and histologic score: Mayo sub score =0 and MATTS < =2 respectively, and a remission state for a minimum of 5 month prior to biopsy collection, and remained inactive for at least 6 months after. Uninvolved mucosa from patients with active UC was defined as a colonic segment with completely normal endoscopic appearance, normal histology, and absence of any previous evidence of active disease. Finally, a total of 43 biopsies were analyzed: 13 healthy controls, 8 inactive UC, 7 non-involved active UC and 15 involved active UC.
