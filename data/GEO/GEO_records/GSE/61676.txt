TITLE
24h-response to bevacizumab erlortinib in non-small cell lung cancer from blood-based exon array profiling

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanisms of action of the combined targeted therapy bevacizumab erlotinib in late stage non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer was investigated by means of whole genome exon arrays. mRNA from peripherial blood was extracted at baseline and 24h after initiation of the therapy and hybridized on Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays

DESIGN
Prospective phase II trial investigating the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer

PLATFORM
GPL5188 [HuEx-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array [probe set (exon) version]
