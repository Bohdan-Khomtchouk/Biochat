TITLE
KDM5 Lysine Demethylases Are Involved in Maintenance of 3'UTR Length [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We discovered that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae lysine demethylase, Jhd2 (also known as KDM5), recruits 3'UTR processing machinery and promotes alteration of 3'UTR length in a demethylase-dependent manner. Interaction of Jhd2 with both chromatin and RNA suggests that Jhd2 affects selection of polyadenylation sites through a transcription-coupled mechanism.

DESIGN
Wild-type yeast or yeast with JHD2 deleted were grown to mid-log phase.  ChIP analysis performed for H3K4me3, Pol2, IgG.
