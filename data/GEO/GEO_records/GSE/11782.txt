TITLE
FOXM1 in Early Human Squamous Cell Carcinoma Oncogenesis and it Is Enhanced by Nicotine during Malignant Transformation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide SNP profilling for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) during FOXM1B-induced malignant transformation in a human premalignant oral keratinocyte line SVpgC2a. Keywords: oral cancer, keratinocytes, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, FOXM1, genomic instability, SNP array, loss of heterozygosity, malignant transformation

DESIGN
Eight FOXM1B-induced malignant clones (SVFN1-8) that grew in soft agar were grown as individual cell lines and gDNA harvested from each clone for SNP array analysis compared to wild-type non-transformed SVpgC2a as control to obtain loss of heterozygosity profiles.
