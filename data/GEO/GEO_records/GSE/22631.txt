TITLE
Whole-genome gene expression profiling of F11 dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-like cells stimulated with forskolin

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We generated whole-genome gene expression profiles of F11 dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-like neuroblastoma cells stimulated with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin for 0, 2, 4, 24 and 48 hours.

DESIGN
F11 neuroblastoma cells were incubated in low-serum medium (DMEM with 0.5% FCS and antibiotics) for three hours and then stimulated with 10 ÂµM forskolin for 2, 4, 24 and 48 hours. All samples are in triplicate. F11 cells incubated in low-serum medium for three hours, but not stimulated with forskolin, were used as a common reference.
