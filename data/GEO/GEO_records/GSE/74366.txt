TITLE
EBF2 promotes the recruitment of beige adipocytes in white adipose tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The induction of beige/brite adipose cells in white adipose tissue (WAT) is associated with protection against high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in animals. The helix-loop-helix transcription factor Early B-Cell Factor-2 (EBF2) regulates brown adipose tissue development. We examined the role of EBF2 in beige fat cell biogenesis by comparing transcriptome in wildtype and EBF2-overexpressing mice in the adipose tissue.

DESIGN
Four control replicates (wildtype) and four experimental replicates (Fabp4-Ebf2) mice were analyzed
