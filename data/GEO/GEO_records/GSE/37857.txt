TITLE
Murine forestomach epithelial sheets: Controls vs. Sox2 overexpression mutants

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of adult forestomach epithelium comparing K5-CreER controsl with K5-CreER;Rosa26Sox2/Sox2 mutants. Two doses of tamoxifen were given and four weeks later the epithelal sheets were harvested for RNA extraction. Goal was to determine the effects of Sox2 overexpression on epithelial phenotypic changes.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, wildtype Vs Sox2 overexpression mutant. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 mutant replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
