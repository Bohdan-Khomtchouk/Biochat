TITLE
Expression data from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with docosahexaenoic acid with or without doxorubicin chemotherapy Microarrays were used to detail changes in gene expression in the treatments

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated for 48h with 60uM docosahexaenoic acid  followed by 24 h with 60uM DHA with or without 4.1x10-7 M doxorubicin chemotherapy whereupon RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.

PLATFORM
