TITLE
Gene expression of CD19+ b cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used DNA microarray technology to assess changes in gene expression after treatment of 11 lymphoma cell lines with epigenetic drugs. We identified genes with upregulated expression in treated cell lines and with downregulated expression in B-cell lymphoma patient samples when compared to normal B cells.

DESIGN
CD19+ b cells were isolated from buffy coats from diffrent healthy donors. Gene expression of healthy controls (CD19+ b cells) was used as a normal counterpart for lymphoma samples (GSE4732, GSE10846).
