TITLE
Single cell analysis of atherosclerosis baseline and regression macrophages-surgical model

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD45+ CD11b+ F4/80+ macrophages were isolated using the BD FACS Aria IIu SORP from pre-transplant baseline (Apoe-/- fed 16 weeks westernd diet) and grafted arches from WT recipient mice (regression). Cells were then sorted using the C1 Fluidigm to analyze their transcriptomes at a single cell level.

DESIGN
Our study used the transplant model of atherosclerosis regression for these experiments. Donor Apoe-/- mice were fed a high fat diet for 16 weeks (baseline). Then atherosclerotic aortic arches from donor mice were transplanted into WT on chow (regression). The mice were sacrificed 3 days after transplantation, the aortic arches enzymatically digested to create single cell suspension and antibody stained to label surface markers. We sorted macrophages by selecting CD45+CD11b+ F4/80+ cells and these cells were used for single cell RNA seq.
