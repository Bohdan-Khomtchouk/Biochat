TITLE
Mycobacterium smegmatis - Comparison of glnR deletion strain MH1 under nitrogen surplus and starvation

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium smegmatis

SUMMARY
In this approach, changes in total transcript of a glnR deletion strain of Mycobacterium smegmatis due to nitrogen starvation were monitored. This is a control experiment for the comparison of wild type and glnR deletion strain resulting in putative nitrogen-related genes which are not controlled by GlnR.

DESIGN
Two biological replicates were analyzed.
