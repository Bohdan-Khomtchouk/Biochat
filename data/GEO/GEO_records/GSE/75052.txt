TITLE
Murine iTreg cells: Control (MIEG3) vs. YY1-expression vector transduced

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of mouse induced Treg (iTreg) cells comparing control (MIEG3) vector-transduced iTreg cells with iTreg cells transduced with YY1-overexpression vector. Tranduced cells were sorted by GFP expression. Goal was to determine the effects of YY1 on global iTreg gene expression.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, iTreg(control MIEG3) vs. iTreg(YY1-overexpressing). Biological replicates: 1 MIEG3 vs. YY1.

PLATFORM
GPL10787 Agilent-028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Probe Name version)
