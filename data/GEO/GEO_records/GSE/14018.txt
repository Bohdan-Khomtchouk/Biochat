TITLE
Metastases of breast cancer (U133A)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparisons among breast cancer metastases at different organs revealed distinct microenvironments as characterized by cytokine content. Such microenvironment distinction might be important to dictate how the cancer cells adapt to survival before they successfully colonize. Keywords: Disease state analyses

DESIGN
58 breast cancer metastases from different organs were  profiled and compared by the expression level of over 400 cytokines. 36 samples were incuded in this series. 22 others as well as 7 of these 36 were profiled on U133plus2 platforms and included in series GSE14017.

PLATFORM
GPL96 [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array
