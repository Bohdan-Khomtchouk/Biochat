TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene transcription in myocardium of the doxycycline inducible Tafazzin shRNA knockdown mouse model of Barth syndrome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the transcriptome of cardiac tissue from mice trangenically engineered with a doxycycline inducible Tafazzin shRNA knockdown to mimic the loss of function of Tafazzin in Barth syndrome.  ShRNA induced knockdown mice were compared to wildtype littermates also fed the doxycyline diet.  The hypothesis was to investigate adaptive metabolic and compensatory gene transcriptional changes in myocardium of the mouse model of Barth syndrome

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 2 month old cardiac tissue from the doxycycline inducible shRNA Tafazzin knockdown mouse model of Barth syndrome compared to wildtype littermates also fed 625 mg/Kg doxycycline diet

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
