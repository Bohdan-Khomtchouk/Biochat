TITLE
Gene expression profiles of mouse ESC cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The differentiation to cardiomyocytes is a prerequisite and an important part of heart development. A good understanding of the complicated cardiomyocyte differentiation process benefits cardiogenesis study. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), cell lines with infinite ability to proliferate and to be differentiated into all cell types of the adult body, are important research tools for investigation of differentiation and meanwhile good models for developmental research. In the current study, genome-wide gene expression of ESCs is profiled through high throughput platform during cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation and maturation. Gene expression patterns of undifferentiated ESCs and ESC-derived cardiomyocytes provide a global overview of genes involved in cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation, whereas marker gene expression profiles of both ESC-related genes and cardiac-specific genes presented the expression pattern shift during differentiation in a pure ESC-derived cardiomyocyte cell culture system.

DESIGN
Transgenic mouse ESC clone  with α-MHC–Pac–IRES–EGFP vector containing the EGFP gene and the PuromycinR (Pac) cassette under control of the cardiac α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) promoter was cultured and induced into differentiation. Puromycin was applied after differentiation start to enable cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation. Cells were harvested at 4 time points after differentiation start (day0, day12, day19 and day26). Two biological replicates were taken for every time point.
