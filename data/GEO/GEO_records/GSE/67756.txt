TITLE
Liver transcriptome analysis of the large yellow croaker under fasting or temperature treatment by RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Larimichthys crocea

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from 4 liver samples of the large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) taken from thermal stress treatment fish, normal temperature treatment fish, cold stress treatment fish and fasting stress treatment fish, respectively, to investigate the transcriptome and comparative expression profiles of the large yellow croaker liver undergoing thermal stress, cold stress and fasting.

DESIGN
Liver mRNA profiles of control group (LB2A), thermal stress group (LC2A), cold stress group (LA2A) and 21-day fasting group (LF1A) were generated by RNA-seq, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.

PLATFORM
