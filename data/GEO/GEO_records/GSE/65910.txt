TITLE
Genomic maps of TUG1 in human glioma stem cell

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Glioblastomas show heterogeneous histological features. These distinct phenotypic states are thought to be originated by the glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly tumorigenic and self-renewing sub-population of tumor cells that have different functional characteristics. We found TUG1, a large non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is highly expressed in GSCs. TUG1 was reported to interact with PRC2 via its exon 2 and represses its target gene expression in trans. In order to identify the genetic loci enriched with TUG1 in GSC, we performed modified RNA pull-down assay coupled with promoter-microarray analysis using BrU-labeled TUG1.

DESIGN
RNA pull-down assay coupled with promoter-microarray analysis was performed as two-color hybridization on Agilent human whole genome catalog 2x400k array.
