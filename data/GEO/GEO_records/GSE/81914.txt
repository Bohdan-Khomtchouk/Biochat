TITLE
microRNA data from atrophied rat gastrocnemius of 5 days post denervation versus sham control

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
microRNAs responsible for skeletal muscle atrophy are largely unclear. We used microarrays to examine microRNA profiles in rat gastrocnemius muscle of 5 days after denervation of sciatic nerve versus sham control.
