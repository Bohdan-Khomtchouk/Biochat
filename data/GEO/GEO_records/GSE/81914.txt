TITLE
microRNA data from atrophied rat gastrocnemius of 5 days post denervation versus sham control

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
microRNAs responsible for skeletal muscle atrophy are largely unclear. We used microarrays to examine microRNA profiles in rat gastrocnemius muscle of 5 days after denervation of sciatic nerve versus sham control.

DESIGN
Muscle atrophy was induced by denervation of right hind sciatic nerve. Rat gastrocnemius muscle samples 5 days after denervation injury (n=4) versus sham control (n=4) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix miRNA 3.0.
