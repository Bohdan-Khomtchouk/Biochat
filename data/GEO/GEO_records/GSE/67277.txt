TITLE
Liver tissue HELP-tagging cytosine methylation data from C57BL/6J mice receiving high-fat diet with or without lingonberries

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The C57BL/6J mouse model develops obesity and pre-diabetes when fed a high-fat diet. In this experiment, DNA methylation was assessed globally at specific CpG sites in liver tissue from mice receiving high-fat diet (45E% from fat) for 13 weeks (Control) or high-fat diet supplemented with 20% (w/w) of freeze-dried lingonberries (n=4). Our findings show that lingonberries prevent development of high-fat induced obesity, hepatic steatosis and low-grade inflammation, and the DNA was hypermethylated in mice receiving lingonberries compared to control.

DESIGN
Genome wide hepatic DNA methylation comparison between mice fed high-fat diet with or without a lingonberry supplement (n=4/group).
