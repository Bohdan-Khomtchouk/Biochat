TITLE
Identification of miRNAs regulated by vitamin D within primary human osteoblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Identified a series of miRNAs transcriptionally regulated by vitamin D treatment within osteoblasts. Several miRNAs were validated in dose escalation experiments. Furthermore, downstream miRNA targets were appraised and found to regulate target message and protein levels. These findings were assessed in early and late passaged osteoblasts and found an age-dependent regulation of some miRNAs, while others were considered constituitiously expressed. Inhibitor studies of one key bone-related miRNA demonstrated the importance of this miRNA to regulate vitamin D-mediate osteoblastic differentiation during mineralizaition.
