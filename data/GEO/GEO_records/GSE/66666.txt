TITLE
Transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression in 4-day-old WT and athb1-1 mutant seedlings grown under short day conditions

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To understand which genes acts downstream AtHB1 affecting hypocotyl growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed transcriptional profiles of 4-day-old seedlings grown in a short-day regime comparing wild-type with athb1-1 mutant plants. These results show that some of the AtHB1-regulated genes modulate cell elongation, particularly cell wall composition and elongation, or encode proteins that serve as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur for early seedling growth.

DESIGN
RNA-Seq data for 4-day-old wild-type (Col-0) and athb1-1 mutant seedlings grown under short-day conditions. Biological triplicates were performed for each genotype analyzed.
