TITLE
Global expression analysis of BAP1 knockdown in transfected 92.1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of the effect that reduced BAP1 levels have on global gene expression.The hypothesis tested was that reduction in BAP1 levels would produce changes in gene expression similar to changes observed in class 2 uveal melanomas. Data provided insight into genes that are disrupted with reduced BAP1 levels.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from 92.1 cells transfected with either control or BAP1 knockdown constructs for global expression analysis.
