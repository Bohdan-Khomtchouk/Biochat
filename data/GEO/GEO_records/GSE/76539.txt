TITLE
AF9/MLLT3 ChIP-Seq in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to characterize the genomic localization of the YEATS domain protein AF9 in the macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 +/- LPS stimulation and +/- sodium crotonate pretreatment. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) for endogenous AF9 or for a FLAG-tagged AF9 transgene in RAW264.7 or a RAW264.7 cell line engineered to express FLAG-AF9, respectively.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq for AF9 in RAW264.7 cells +/- LPS stimulation and +/- sodium crotonate pretreatment
