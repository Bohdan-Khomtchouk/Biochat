TITLE
Breast cancer MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells: LNA-antimiR-21 transfected cells vs. LNA-control transfected cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of breast cancer cells comparing LNA-control transfected cells with cells transfected with LNA-antimiR-21.We searched for miR-21 targets by systematic screening of mRNA profiling of LNA-antimiR-21 transfected MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, LNA-antimiR-21 Transfected vs. LNA-control Transfected MCF-7 cells. One replicate per array.
