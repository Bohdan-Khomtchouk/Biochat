TITLE
Copy number variant (CNV) and Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of UCLA hESC lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Female human ESC-lines can carry active X-chromosomes (Xa) or an XIST-RNA- coated inactive X-chromosome (Xi XIST+ ). Additionally, many ESC-lines have abnormal X-chromosome-inactivation (XCI)-states where the Xi no longer expresses XIST-RNA and has transcriptionally active regions (eroded Xi=Xe). The fate of each XCI-state upon differentiation is unclear because individual lines often contain a mixture of XCI-states. Here, we established homogeneous XiXa, XeXa, and XaXa ESC-lines. We found that these lines were unable to initiate XIST-expression and X-chromosome- wide silencing upon differentiation indicating that the ESC XCI-state is maintained in differentiated cells. Consequently, differentiated XeXa and XaXa cells displayed higher levels of X-linked gene-expression than XiXa cells. Although global transcriptional compensation between X-chromosomes and autosomes is not required for female ESC-differentiation, the degree of X-chromosome- silencing influences differentiation efficiencies. Our data suggest that the Xi XIST+ Xa state is inherent to human ESCs and that all other XCI-states, including XaXa, are abnormal and arise during ESC-derivation or maintenance.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA from ESC lines and differentiated cardiomyocyte derivatives was extracted according to standard protocols. Genomic stability was analyzed on an Affymetrix genome-wide SNP 6.0 array as per manufacturers instructions at the UCLA microarray core. The analysis was performed as described (Greenman et al., 2010).
