TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infected cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to compare the whole transcriptional profile (RNA-seq) of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infected and mock infected human fibroblast KMB17 strain at 48 hours post infection.There is increasing evidence that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in diverse pathogenesis processes; however, their roles in virus infection remain unclear. Here, we profiled global changes of circRNAs, genes and microRNA (miRNAs) under herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection by RNA-seq. Numerous dysregulated transcripts comprised of 536 circRNAs, 3,885 genes and 207 miRNAs were found during viral infection. The dysregulated genes were enriched to NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway and pathways of apoptosis, cell cycle progression and cell death, all of which may be implicated in viral pathogenesis and cellular immunity. Further integration analysis of circRNAs, genes and miRNAs reveals putative involvement of circRNAs in viral pathogenesis and antiviral immunity by circRNA-miRNA-gene regulatory axis. This work provides a comprehensive view for dysregulated circRNAs induced by HSV-1 and their interplay with miRNAs and genes, thus offering new insights into the mechanisms of interactions between HSV-1 and its host.

DESIGN
Whole transcriptome profiles of  herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infected and mock infected human fibroblast KMB17 strain at 48 hours post infection were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 4000 platform.
