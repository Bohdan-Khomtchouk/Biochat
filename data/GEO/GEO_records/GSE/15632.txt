TITLE
Gene expression profiling of Stat3flx/flx/NIC breast tumors compared to wild type NIC tumors.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A Stat3-dependent transcription regulatory network involved in inflammation and metastasis is identified. Analyses of the gene expression data revealed that Stat3flx/flx/NIC tumors exhibited a significant reduction in the expression of factors involved in both tumor angiogenesis (fibronectin, von willebrand factor, annexin a3, thrombopoietin, fibulin 5) and in the acute phase inflammatory response (cebpd, osmr, saa1, saa2)

DESIGN
Common reference design. 8 samples including RNA extracted from 3 pools of Stat3wt/wt/NIC (WT) tumor tissues (5 individual tumor samples per pool) and 5 individual Stat3flx/flx/NIC (Homo) tumor tissue samples.

PLATFORM
