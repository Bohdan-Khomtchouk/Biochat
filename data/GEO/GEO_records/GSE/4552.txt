TITLE
Gene profiling of spleens of adult protected rats from Plasmodium berghei ANKA

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The studies reported here were designed to define in more detail the effector cells responsible for the transfer of protective immunity to young host against P. berghei infection, and to investigate the genes expressed in spleen cells of adult protected rats capable of transferring protection to young rats. Keywords: age, malaria, protection, rat

DESIGN
In order to investigate the differential gene expression in the spleen of adlut protected rats which are involved in the transfer of immunity to young susceptible rats we profiled the genes from RNA extracted from: 3 healthy control rats (101758, 101760, 101761) and 4 adult protected rats that cleared parasitemia (101762, 101763, 10764, 101765)
