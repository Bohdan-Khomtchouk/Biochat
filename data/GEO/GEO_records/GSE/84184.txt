TITLE
Transcription profiling of blood in mice exposed Unpredicatble Chronic Mild Stress and treated with fluoxetine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Groups of 8 adult BALB/c male mice were either untreated or exposed for 9 weeks to unpredicatble chronic mild stress (UCMS), or exposed for 7 weeks to UCMS and  treated for the last 5 weeks with fluoxetine (Flx) diluted in drinking water, or untreated for 2 weeks and received Flx for 5 weeks. Total RNAs from whole blood (WB) were profiled after hybridization with Agilent SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray v1 to identify transcriptional biomarkers of major depression.

DESIGN
Total RNAs were extracted from 32 samples including: (8 control, 8 UCMS, 8 UCMS+Flx, 8 Flx) for whole blood.
