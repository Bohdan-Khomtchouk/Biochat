TITLE
Expression data of mESCs differentiated into Paraxial mesoderm

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Stem cell-derived tissues have wide potential for modelling developmental and pathological processes as well as cell-based therapy. However, it has proven difficult to generate several key cell types in vitro, including skeletal muscle. In vertebrates, skeletal muscles derive during embryogenesis from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). Using PSM development as a guide, we establish conditions for the differentiation of monolayer cultures of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into PSM-like cells without the introduction of transgenes or cell sorting. We differentiated mouse ESCs in serum-free medium supplemented with Rspo3 ( or as an alternative with Chir 9902) and the Bmp inhibitor LDN193189. In vivo, the PSM cells are first expressing Msgn1 (posterior PSM marker) and then mature to express Pax3 (anterior PSM marker). After 4 days of differentiation of mESCs, Msgn1-positive cells were FACS-sorted and their transcriptome analyzed. After 6 days of differentiation, Pax3-positive cells were sorted and their transcriptome analyzed.

DESIGN
Mouse ESCs differentiated for 0, 4 and 6 days in serum-free medium containing a Wnt activator, a BMP inhibitor and DMSO, to study paraxial mesoderm in vitro
