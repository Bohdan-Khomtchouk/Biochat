TITLE
Gene expression in response to axotomy in organotypical slices co-cultures

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Brain slice cultures offer advantages over other in vitro methods, as they mimic numerous in vivo aspects. For most purposes, slices of the developing brain, termed organotypic slice cultures , preserve a high degree of cellular differentiation and tissue organization. The entorhino-hippocampal connection (EHP) is the main entrance of information to the hippocampus proper and the dentate gyrus. Also it has some specific features that make them particularly interesting in studies of axonal regeneration: (i) the culture method obviates the need for extensive animal surgery and requires less time than other in vivo approaches; (ii) the EHP is reproduced easily in vitro in cultures with a degree of laminar specificity similar to that found in vivo; (iii) the EHP is myelinated both in vitro and in vivo; and (iv) most of the cellular and molecular barriers to axon regeneration are present after the axotomy of the EHP in vitro. Altogether this model is useful to evaluate axon regeneration and putative estrategies to promote axonal growth. Keywords: organotypic slice cultures; axonal lession; gene expression

DESIGN
To evaluate the genes whose transcription was regulated after 1, 3 and 7 days after EHP (Entorhino-Hippocampal Pathway) axotomy, RNA samples were analyzed with Agilent whole genome rat long oligonucleotide (44 K base) probe based microarrays.
