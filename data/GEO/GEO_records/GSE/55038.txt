TITLE
Genome wide mapping of histone 3 lysine 79 mono, di and trimethylation and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation in LSKs, GMPs and retroviral MLL-AF9 driven murine leukemias

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the genome wide distribution of the three states of H3K79 methylation (H3K79me1/me2/me3) and H3K27me3 in mouse lineage negative Sca-1 positive Kit positive cells (LSKs), granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and LSK derived MLL-AF9 leukemias in the presence or absence of the Af10 OM-LZ domain. Legend- MIT:MSCV-IRES-tdTomato (Empty vector control) and CRE (MIT vector with the Cre recombinase).

DESIGN
We examined the H3K79 me1,me2,me3 and H3K27me3 profiles by ChIP-seq in  lineage negative Sca-1 positive, Kit positive  (LSK) cells, granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and bone marrow cells from sacrificed terminally ill secondary MLL-AF9 positive leukemic mice. In case of the MLL-AF9 leukemias, the ChIP-seq experiments were performed in 2 conditions in the presence or absence of the Dot1l interacing octapeptide-motif leucine zipper (OM-LZ) domain of Af10.  For the leukemia experiments, leukemias derived from the Af10 OM-LZ homozygous floxed background were transduced with MSCV-IRES-tdTomato control vector (MIT) or its Cre-recombinase expressing counterparts (CRE). Subsequently, we sorted tdTomato positive cells and injected them into sub-lethally irradiated syngenic secondary recipient mice. Seconday leukemias obtained from these MIT or CRE expressing cells were used for ChIP -seq studies.
