TITLE
Identification of a nuclear exosome decay pathway for processed transcripts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The   RNA   exosome   is   fundamental   for   the   degradation   of   RNA   in eukaryotic  nuclei.  Substrate  targeting   is  facilitated  by  its  co-factor Mtr4p/hMTR4,  which  links  to RNA-binding  protein  adaptors. One  such activity  is  the  human  Nuclear  EXosome  Targeting  (NEXT)  complex, composed  of  hMTR4,  the  Zn-finger  protein  ZCCHC8  and  the  RNA-binding  factor  RBM7.  NEXT  primarily  targets  early  and  unprocessed transcripts, demanding   a   rationale   for   how   the   nuclear exosome recognizes processed  RNAs. Here, we describe the  PolyA tail eXosome Targeting  (PAXT)  connection, comprising  the  hitherto  uncharacterized ZFC3H1 Zn-knuckle  protein  as  a  central  link  between  hMTR4  and  the nuclear  polyA  binding  protein  PABPN1.  Individual  depletion  of  ZFC3H1 and  PABPN1  results  in  the  accumulation  of  common  transcripts,  that are   generally   both   longer   and   more   3â€™polyadenylated   than   NEXT substrates. Importantly, ZFC3H1/PABPN1  and  ZCCHC8/RBM7  contact hMTR4  in  a  mutually  exclusive  manner,  revealing  that  the  exosome targets nuclear transcripts of different maturation status by substituting its hMTR4-associating adaptors.

DESIGN
RNA from HeLa cells was analysed by next generation sequencing upon depletion of EGFP(control), RRP40, RBM7, ZCCHC8, PABPN1 and ZFC3H1. Both total and BrU RNA (one hour labeling) were collected for each condition in triplicates. The spike-in sequences used in the samples can be provided upon request.
