TITLE
Transcriptome response of murine alveolar epithelial cells to infection by three unrelated respiratory viruses commonly studied in mouse models

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The severity and outcome of respiratory viral infections is partially determined by the cellular response mounted by infected lung epithelial cells. Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses. We used microarray analysis to compare changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected by one of three respiratory viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, PR8) disease in mice. The viruses prompted changes in host gene expression that differed in magnitude and timing. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued to changes through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. All three viruses elicited overlapping responses in antiviral defense systems, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I IFN response than the other two viruses. Our comparative approach identified signatures of each virus infection that can be used to discover mechanisms of pathogenesis in the respiratory tract.

DESIGN
Microarray analysis of mouse epithial cells infected by one of three viruses. Infections done in triplicate. RNA extracted at 12 and 24 hours post infection.
