TITLE
The genomic context and co-recruitment of SP1 affect ERRα co-activation by PGC-1α in muscle cells [array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) coordinates  the transcriptional network response to promote an improved endurance capacity in  skeletal muscle, e.g. by co-activating the estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) in the  regulation of oxidative substrate metabolism. Despite a close functional relationship,  the interaction between these two proteins has not been studied on a genomic level.  We now mapped the genome-wide binding of ERRα to DNA in skeletal muscle cell line  with elevated PGC-1α and linked the DNA recruitment to global PGC-1α target gene  regulation. We found that, surprisingly, ERRα co-activation by PGC-1α is only  observed in the minority of all PGC-1α recruitment sites. Nevertheless, a majority of  PGC-1α target gene expression is dependent on ERRα. Intriguingly, the interaction  between these two proteins is controlled by the genomic context of response elements,  in particular the relative GC and CpG content, monomeric and dimeric repeat binding  site configuration for ERRα, and adjacent recruitment of the transcription factor SP1.  These findings thus not only reveal an unprecedented insight into the regulatory  network underlying muscle cell plasticity, but also strongly link the genomic context of  DNA response elements to control transcription factor - co-regulator interactions.

DESIGN
We used microarrays to detect changes in gene expression in C2C12 cells following PGC-1alpha over-expression or GFP (control) over-expression. We used 3 biological replicates for each condition. The samples were: shGFP with GFP viral infection, shGFP with PGC-1alpha viral infection, shERRa with PGC-1alpha viral infection and the ERRa inverse agonist XCT790.
