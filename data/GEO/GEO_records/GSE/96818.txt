TITLE
Analysis of WT and IRF1-deficient Th9 cell transcriptomes in the presence of IFN-gamma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Goal of this study was to compare transcriptional changes in IFN-gamma-treated WT compared to IRF1-deficient Th9 cells

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of Th9 cells cultured for 2 days in the presence of IFN-gamma in vitro were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2000

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
