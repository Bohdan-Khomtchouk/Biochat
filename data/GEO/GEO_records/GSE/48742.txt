TITLE
Identification of Transcription Factor RPC-1::RPC-1 Binding Regions in Young Adults

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
modENCODE_submission_4035 This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Michael Snyder. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648 Project Goal: We are identifying the DNA binding sites for 300 transcription factors in C. elegans. Each transcription factor gene is tagged with the same GFP fusion protein, permitting validation of the gene's correct spatio-temporal expression pattern in transgenic animals.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation on each strain is peformed using an anti-GFP antibody, and any bound DNA is deep-sequenced using Solexa GA2 technology. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
EXPERIMENT TYPE: CHIP-seq. BIOLOGICAL SOURCE: Strain: NC1639(official name : NC1639 genotype : [wdIs49 (pttr39::UNC-55a::GFP; dpy-20+) III outcross : 0 mutagen : None tags : GFP description : Expresses functional *GFP-tagged UNC-55* (COUP-TF) in ventral cord GABA motor neurons (also some ectopic expression in other cells). This line is integrated and shows strong GFP expression. made_by : David Miller lab ); Developmental Stage: L2; Genotype: [wdIs49 (pttr39::UNC-55a::GFP; dpy-20+) III; Sex: Hermaphrodite;  EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS: Developmental Stage L2; Target gene unc-55; Strain NC1639(official name : NC1639 genotype : [wdIs49 (pttr39::UNC-55a::GFP; dpy-20+) III outcross : 0 mutagen : None tags : GFP description : Expresses functional *GFP-tagged UNC-55* (COUP-TF) in ventral cord GABA
