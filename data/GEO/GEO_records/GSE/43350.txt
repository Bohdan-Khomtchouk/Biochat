TITLE
Lineage-specific functions of Bcl6  in immunity and inflammation are mediated through distinct biochemical mechanisms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Bcl6 orchestrates the germinal center reaction through its actions in B and T cells, and regulates inflammatory signaling in macrophages. We report that genetic replacement by mutant Bcl6, which cannot bind corepressors to its BTB domain, disrupted  germinal center formation and immunoglobulin affinity maturation, due to a defect in B cell  proliferation and survival.  In contrast, BTB loss of function had no effect on T follicular helper cell differentiation and function, nor other T helper subsets.  Bcl6 null mice displayed a lethal inflammatory phenotype, whereas BTB mutant mice experienced normal healthy lives with no inflammation.  Bcl6 repression of inflammatory responses in macrophages was accordingly independent of the BTB domain repressor function.  Bcl6 thus mediates its actions through lineage-specific biochemical functions.
