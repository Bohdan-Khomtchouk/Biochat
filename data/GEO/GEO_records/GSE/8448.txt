TITLE
Characterization of technical variation in ChIP-on-chip studies

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of technical variance of ChIP-on-Chip studies by characterization of Myc-binding in HL60 cells. Keywords: Chip-on-chip

DESIGN
Fully-blocked study of technical variance in Myc-binding in HL60 cells. Two different antibodies were used to generate 6 biologically independent replicates each. Each replicate was hybridized to arrays from two different batches in both dye-swap orientations, leading to 48 total arrays.
