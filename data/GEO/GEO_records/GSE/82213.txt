TITLE
Cisplatin DNA Damage and Repair Maps of the Human Genome at Single-nucleotide Resolution

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Platinum chemotherapies induce damages in DNA that distort the helical structure. In human cells, these adducts are removed primarily by the Nucleotide Excision Repair pathway. In this study, we mapped both cisplatin and oxaliplatin induced damages and their repair at single nucleotide resolution across the human genome.

DESIGN
We performed Damage-seq to map 2 types of damages in two different human cell lines. The damages were cisplatin and oxaliplatin induced DNA adducts. The two cell lines were normal human skin fibroblasts NHF1 and the GM12878 human lymphoblastoid cells. As control, cisplatin damages were induced in genomic DNA from GM12878. For comparison to repair, XR-seq was performed for cisplatin and oxaliplatin treated GM12878 cells.
