TITLE
Expression data of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells in planktonic or biofilm mode of growth

ORGANISM
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

SUMMARY
Biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa relies on specific changes in gene expression. Some of these genes, for instance, control antibiotic resistance. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying biofilm formation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.
