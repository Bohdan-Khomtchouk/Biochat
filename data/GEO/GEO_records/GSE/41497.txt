TITLE
Development of Helicobacter pylori microarrays to test pathogenicity of clinical isolates

ORGANISM
Helicobacter pylori 26695

SUMMARY
To distinguish between Helicobacter pylori isolates that may cause greater disease in patients, we used whole genome expression profiling as a platform to study host-pathogen interactions and identify gene signatures associated with isolates from patients with higher cancer risk.
