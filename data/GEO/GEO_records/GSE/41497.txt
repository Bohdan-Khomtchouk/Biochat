TITLE
Development of Helicobacter pylori microarrays to test pathogenicity of clinical isolates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To distinguish between Helicobacter pylori isolates that may cause greater disease in patients, we used whole genome expression profiling as a platform to study host-pathogen interactions and identify gene signatures associated with isolates from patients with higher cancer risk.

DESIGN
Expression profiles were studied for 3 clinical isolates from a region of high gastric cancer incidence (PZ5056, PZ5080, PZ5086) in Colombia and 3 isolates from a region with low gastric cancer incidence in Colombia (PZ5004, PZ5024, PZ5026).  Each experiment was done in triplicate by infecting monolayers of gastric epithelial cells for 1 hour with the isolates.
