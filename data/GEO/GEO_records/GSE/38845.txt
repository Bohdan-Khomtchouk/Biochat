TITLE
Regulatory mechanisms on the early process of mouse spermatogenesis investigated by digital gene expression tag profiling analysis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A detailed understanding of the gene regulation mechanisms in premeiosis cells is germane to understanding normal spermatogenesis. The genome-wide expression profiles of type B spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes in mouse were investigated using Solexa/Illumina’s digital gene expression (DGE) system, a tag based high-throughput transcriptome sequencing method, and the developmental process of early spermatogenesis was analyzed systematically. The results suggested that the expression pattern of mouse type B spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes was changed dramatically, especially the genes related to junction assembly, regulation of actin cytoskeleton and pluripotency. The change of the expression levels of these pathways’ main components may be affected by corresponding miRNAs through post-transcriptional regulation. The analysis results will benefit for better understanding the molecular mechanism of early spermatogenesis process.

DESIGN
Using DGE technology to examine gene expression pattern's change between mouse type B spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes cell types.
