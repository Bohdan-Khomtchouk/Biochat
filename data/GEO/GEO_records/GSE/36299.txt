TITLE
Transcriptomic study of the impact of iron toxicity on rice plant

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
transcriptomic study of the impact of iron toxicity on rice plant (Oryza sativa L.; cv ‘I Kong Pao’ ) after short term (3 days) or long term (3 weeks) exposure to ferrous iron (125 ppm). Twenty five days old rice seedlings were exposed to 0 or 125 mg/L ferrous iron for 3 days and 3 weeks in hydroponic culture.  Comparison between control and iron stressed plants were done at the shoot and the root levels. The assays were replicated twice on two independent plant cultures.

DESIGN
8 samples, Two-condition experiment, control (0 ppm ferrous iron) vs. iron treated (125 ppm ferrous iron). Biological replicates: 2 replicates for comparison shoot 3 days of stress, root 3 days of stress, shoot 3 weeks of stress and root 3 weeks of stress.
