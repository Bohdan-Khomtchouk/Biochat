TITLE
RNA-Seq profiling of single bovine oocyte transcript abundance and its modulation by cytoplasmic polyadenylation

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Polyadenylated RNA from individual germinal vesicle and metaphase II ooyctes was amplified and processed for Illumina sequencing. Increases in polyadenylated transcript abundance were observed and are likely due to cytoplasmic polyadenylation.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic analysis of GV and MII bovine oocytes.

PLATFORM
