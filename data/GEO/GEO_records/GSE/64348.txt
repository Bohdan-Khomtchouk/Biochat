TITLE
MicroRNA-221/222 and keratin 8/18 as potential biomarkers of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In a search for biomarkers for patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with high risk of metasitasis, a microarray comparison of  miRNA expression profile between a non-metasitatic mouse keratinocyte cell line Pam212 and its metasitatic derivative LY-1 was carried out. Upregulation of the mir-221/222 cluster was the only notable change observed in LY-1 cells.

DESIGN
Conluent cultures  (single plate of each cell line) were compared. Signal-to-noise ratio was large enough and variation of duplicate spots were minimal for mir-221/222.

PLATFORM
GPL13285 3D-Gene Mouse miRNA Oligo chip V14.1.0.1
