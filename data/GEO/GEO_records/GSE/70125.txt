TITLE
miRNA profile in mice lung after influenza A infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The regulation of host defense against influenza A viruses (IAVs) infection has attracted much attention, especially for type I interferon (IFN)-mediated innate response. Here we revealed that miR-93 expression was significantly downregulated in Alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2) upon IAVs infection through RIG-I/JNK pathway. Inhibition of miR-93 was found to suppress host antiviral innate response by facilitating type I IFN effector signaling, and JAK1 was identified to be directly targeted by miR-93. Importantly, in vivo administration of miR-93 antagomiR significantly inhibited miR-93 expression and markedly suppressed IAVs infection, which in turn prevented the death of IAVs infected mice. Hence, the inducible downregulation of miR-93 suppress IAVs infection by upregulation IFN-JAK-STAT effector pathway, and in vivo inhibition of miR-93 bears considerable therapeutic potential for suppressing IAVs infection.

DESIGN
The miRNA profiling in mice lung was measured at 24 and 36 hours after gave each mouse 50µl of influenza A (50 µl of 10-6 TCID50/µl) via retropharyngeal instillation. Three mice were performed at each time (24 or 36 hours) and RNA from different donors was mixed before determination.
