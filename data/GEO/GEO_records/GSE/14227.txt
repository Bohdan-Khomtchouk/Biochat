TITLE
Time-course gene expression profiles of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type and long-lived sch9-delta mutant

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
The SCH9 null strain has smaller cell size, grows at a slower rate and survives three times longer than wide-type yeast. This study aims to dissect the mechanisms that lead to the yeast life span extension of  sch9-delta.

DESIGN
We measure gene expression profiles of the S. cerevisiae wild type and the long-lived sch9∆ strain every 12 hours from 12 to 120 hours. At each time point, one sample is hybridized to one Affymetrix GeneChip Yeast 2.0 array. In total, ten time points are measured for each strain. When we perform a check of the data quality, all arrays look normal except the 120-hour sch9∆ array. Thus we abandon this array in the further data analysis.
