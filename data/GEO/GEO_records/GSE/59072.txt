TITLE
miRNA and consolidation of cued fear memory

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA profiling was carried out using the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array (6th gen - hsa, mmu & rno) miRNA were profiled in amygdala brain tissue obtained from adult mice 30 mins after auditory fear conditioning and expression levels compared to tissue obtained from Home cage controls

DESIGN
Adult male mice were fear conditioned using tone-shock pairings and brains were harvested 30 mins later. The brains of Home Cage controls and Fear Conditioned animals (n = 4/group) were then punched to collect amygdala tissue. miRNA were extracted using the Qiagen miRNeasy Kit, and then shipped to Exiqon. Exiqon performed labeling, hybridization and data analysis after use of the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array (6th gen - hsa, mmu & rno). https://www.exiqon.com/ls/Documents/Scientific/miRCURY-LNA-microRNA-Array-6th-gen-hsa-mmu-rno-manual.pdf
