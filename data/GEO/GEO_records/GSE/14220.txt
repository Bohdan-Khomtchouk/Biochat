SUMMARY
The chromatin of individual chromosomes is organized into chromosome territories (CTs) in the interphase nucleus. The spatial arrangement of CTs is non-random and evolutionarily conserved. The gene-dense and gene-poor CTs are positioned in the nuclear center and periphery, respectively. As candidates for key molecules involved in nuclear organization, we have investigated the nuclear actin-related proteins (Arps), which include the evolutionarily conserved actin-family together with conventional actin. We used a conditional knockout system with chicken DT40 cells to analyze the functions of the actin-related protein Arp6. Consistent with a previous identification of Arp6 in the SRCAP chromatin remodeling complex, the histone variant H2AZ was significantly decreased in the chromatin of Arp6-deficient cells. Most importantly, Arp6-deficient cells had impaired radial positioning of both gene-poor macrochromosome and gene-rich microchromosome CTs. A transcription microarray analysis of the cells suggests that the radial positioning of CTs impacts only a limited number of genes and plays an active role in repression, rather than in induction. As far as we know, this report is the first observation that an inner nuclear protein is required for the radial distribution of CTs, and will provide new insight into the mechanisms and physical significance of the positioning of CTs in the nucleus.
