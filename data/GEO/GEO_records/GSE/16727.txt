TITLE
Human keratinocytes exposed to tungsten carbide and tungsten carbide cobalt nanoparticles and cobalt chloride

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptional profiles after exposure of HaCaT cells to WC or WC-Co nanoparticles and respective amount of free cobalt in form of CoCl2 after 3 hours and 3 days of exposure. Genes responding especially to nanoparticles or leached cobalt ions should be determined.

DESIGN
Common refernce: pool of 80 RNA Samples of HaCaT cells (treated and not treated), Cy5 labeled. Samples: RNA of HaCaT cells treated 3 hours and 3 days with 30 µg/ml WC nanoparticles, or 33 µg/ml WC-Co nanoparticles (3 µg/ml cobalt content), or 51 µM CoCl2 (equals 3 µg/ml), or water as control, 5 biological replicates for each treatment, all samples were labeled with Cy3 and hybridised together with the common reference.
