TITLE
Appressorium induction by cyclic AMP in Magnaporthe grisea

ORGANISM
Magnaporthe grisea

SUMMARY
This series examines differential gene expression during appressorium formation induced by exogeous cyclic AMP in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. RNA was extracted from spores germinated on hydrophilic (non-inductive) side of GelBond as well as from spores elaborating appressia on hydrophilic surfaces in the presence of cAMP after 9 hrs incubation. RNA from two biological replications of each treatment was pooled in equal amounts and labeled with both cy3 and cy5 dyes using the Agilent Technologies Low Input Linear Amplification Kit. Hybridizations were performed on Agilent Technologies whole genome oligo rice blast arrays (product G4137B) using manufacturer prescribed protocols and reagents in an reference design in which each treatment was paired with every other. This series contains a total of 4 hybridizations; each treatment was used in 4 hybridizations (2 with Cy3 and 2 Cy5). Spot fluorescence was normalized using Lowess within and between microarray slides in Bioconductor. Keywords: Cell development
