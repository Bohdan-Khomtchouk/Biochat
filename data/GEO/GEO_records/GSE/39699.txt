TITLE
gene expression signatures of Akt1 +/- mice at 8weeks and 35weeks

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To know the difference of transcriptome between Wild type and Akt1+/- mice, 8weeks and 35weeks female mice were subjected to microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Wild type and Akt1+/- mice in age 8weeks and 35weeks were subjected to microarray analysis. Liver, muscle and visceral fat were used. Only female mice were used.
