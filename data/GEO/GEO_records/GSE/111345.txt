TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of RALD iPSCs after in vitro differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated roles of KRAS on stemness maintenance and differentiation propensity in the context of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using isogenic KRAS mutant (G13C/WT) and wild-type (WT/WT) iPSCs from the same RAS-associated autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome-like disease (RALD) patients. RNA-seq analysis was conducted to compare gene expression profiles of WT/WT and G13C/WT iPS cells after in vitro differentiation. We found some differences of gene expression profiles regarding stemness and linage markers in the two genotypes.

DESIGN
To investigate the changes of stemness and linage markers between KRAS mutant and wild-type iPSCs after differentiation, the iPSCs were differentiated for 16 days . Two clones were used for each genotype (WT/WT and G13C/WT) before and after differentiation, resulting in total 8 conditions.
