TITLE
Chip-chip from HepG2 cells and HepG2 cells with slug overexpression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor slug represses genes with E-box and then activates cancer stem cell related pathway: Wnt, Notch and Hedgehog pathway. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of slug by ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated that slug indirectly activates cancer stem cell related pathway and thus promotes vasculogenic mimicry formation.

DESIGN
Comparison of HepG2-control in regular culture, HepG2-slug in regular culture and HepG2-slug on Matrigel.

PLATFORM
