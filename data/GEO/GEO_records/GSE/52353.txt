TITLE
Expression data from leaves of rice plants overexpressing the OsCPK4 gene and control plants(empty vector) in normal conditions

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa Japonica Group

SUMMARY
The OsCPK4 gene is a member of the complex gene family of the Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) in rice. Expression of OsCPK4 is induced by high salinity, drought and the phytohormone abscisic acid. The OsCPK4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsCPK4 enhances tolerance to salt and drought stress, the transgenic plants having stronger water-holding capability than control plants. Microarray analysis of OsCPK4 rice plants revealed up-regulation of genes involved in metabolism, particularly lipid metabolism, as well as genes involved in oxidative stress and redox control. Meanwhile, OsCPK4 overexpression has no impact on the expression of the well-characterized abiotic stress-associated transcription factors (i.e. DREB and NAC), or the typical salt and drought-inducible genes (i.e. LEA genes, including Dehydrin genes). Under salt stress conditions, the OsCPK4 transgenic lines showed lesser membrane lipid peroxidation as compared to control plants, indicating that OsCPK4 rice plants have a better capacity to prevent oxidative damage in cellular membrane lipids. Collectively, our data suggest that OsCPK4-mediated processes protect the plant cell from uncontrolled redox reactions affecting membrane functions, which, in turn, results in salt and drought tolerance. OsCPK4 shows great promise for genetic improvement of tolerance to abiotic stress in rice.

DESIGN
Leaves of OsCPK4 and vector control plants that had been grown hydroponically for 15 days were harvested and used for total RNA extraction and hybrizations in two color customized Agilent microarrays.
