TITLE
Clustered regulatory signals at nucleosome-depleted regions punctuate a constant nucleosomal landscape in Schizosaccharomyces pombe [NGS_Illumina]

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Sequencing of mononucleosomal DNA during asynchronous mitosis and 0, 3 and 5 hours into meiosis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

DESIGN
Two samples from mononucleosomal DNA from asynchronous mitosis (haploid 972 h- and diploid pat1.114) and three samples from 0, 3 and 5 hours into meiosis (from diploid pat1.114) were sequenced (Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx) using the single-end read protocol.
