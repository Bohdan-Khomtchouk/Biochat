TITLE
microRNA expression profile in peri-implantation porcine embryos

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as new players in the fine tuning of embryo development and implantation in mammals via posttranscriptional gene regulation mechanisms. Applying custom made multispecies arrays we aimed to analyze expression profile of microRNAs in peri-implantation porcine conceptuses/trophoblasts to identify their potential role at the maternal-fetal interface during the critical period of maternal recognition of pregnancy and implantation.

DESIGN
miRNA expression profiles were analyzed in samples collected from embryos or trophoblast on Days 10, 11, 12, 16 and 20 of pregnancy. Each group was represented by five to nine samples.
