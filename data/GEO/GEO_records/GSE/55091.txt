TITLE
Effect of resting or activated human regulatory T cells (Tregs) on human natural killer (NK) cell differentiation in vitro.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Activated but not resting Tregs affect NK cell differentiation. We used microarray analysis to study differences of gene expression of NK cell differentiation in the presence of resting or activated Tregs.

DESIGN
We compared the effect of resting and activated Tregs on NK cell differentiation by using an in vitro model of NK cell differentiation from umbilical cord blood (UCB) HSC (Grzywacz et al., 2006, Luevano et al., 2014). Tregs were added from day 9 until day 12 of culture, then HSC were re-isolated using a MoFlow cell sorter.
