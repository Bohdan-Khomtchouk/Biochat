TITLE
HGAL Enhances BCR-mediated Syk Activation, Leading to Lymphoid Hyperplasia and Amyloidosis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression data from CD22+B220+ FACS-purified splenocytes of adult Sca1-HGAL knock-in CBAxC57BL/6J mice or wild-type littermates.

DESIGN
Transgenic mice expressing HGAL (GCET2) under control of the Sca1 (Ly-6E.1) promoter were generated. CD22 and B220 dual-positive B-cells were FACS purified from spleens of adult transgenic mice and wildtype littermates, total-RNA was isolated, and transcriptional profiling performed using GeneChipÂ® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
