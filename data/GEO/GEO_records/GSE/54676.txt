TITLE
Transcription factor ATAF1 integrates carbon starvation responses with trehalose metabolism

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Global transcriptome patterns were obtained from ATAF1-IOE seedlings at 1 h, 2 h and 5 h after estradiol induction or mock treatment, and from mature ATAF1-IOE leaves at 5 h after estradiol induction or mock treatment.

DESIGN
To identify genes rapidly responding to elevated ATAF1 expression estradiol induction experiments were performed on ATAF1-IOE seedlings after 1 h, 2 h and 5 h of ATAF1 induction. In addition, expression profiles were obtained from mature leaves after 5 h of ATAF1 induction.
