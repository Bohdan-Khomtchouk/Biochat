TITLE
mRNA expression profiles in far-infrared treated human endothelial precursor cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High glucose impairs the angiogenic activities of late endothelial precursor cells (EPC). We found that far infrared (FIR) treatment restored partially the activity of late EPC. However, the mechanisms are unclear. We performed gene expression microarray analysis to assess the expression profiles of high glucose-treated late EPC with or without FIR treatment.

DESIGN
Late EPCs isolated from peripheral blood were cultured in high glucose condition for 48 hours, and then treated with or without FIR radiation for 30 minutes. Total RNA were extracted and evaluated with the Affymetrix GeneChip Human U133 plus 2.0 arrays.
