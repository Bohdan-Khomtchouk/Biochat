TITLE
Interaction between the light environment and the Arabidopsis wound response

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We have previously identified a significant increase in chloroplast reactive oxygen species in wounded leaves of Arabidopsis and other plants, which is light-dependent (Flor-Henry et al. (2004) BMC Plant Biology 4:19). The aims of this study were to (i) examine the early response to mechanical wounding in Arabidopsis leaves, (ii) test the hypothesis that light-dependent chloroplast ROS may play a role in signalling for changes in gene expression in wounded leaves, and (iii) examine the broader impact of the light environment on the wound response in Arabidopsis. Keywords: Stress response
