TITLE
Microarray Analysis of myb80 versus Wild-Type Anthers

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis thaliana MYB80 (formerly MYB103) is expressed in the tapetum and microspores between anther developmental  stages 6 and 10. MYB80 encodes a MYB transcription factor that is essential for tapetal and pollen development. In order to identify the genes regulated by MYB80, microarray  technology was employed to analyze the expression levels of genes  that were differentially regulated in the myb80 mutant and wild-  type anthers.
