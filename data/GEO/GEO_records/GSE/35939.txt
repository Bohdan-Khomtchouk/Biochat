TITLE
Purified touch receptor neurons: expanded polyGlutamine versus control

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of C.elegans purified touch receptor neuron precursors, comparing cells expressing mutant Huntingtin N-terminal fragment to normal Huntingtin N-terminal fragment, both fused to GFP under mec-3 promoter. As a control the same experiment has been done with comparing cell expressing normal Huntingtin to GFP only. Goal was to determine the specific effect of expanded polyglutamines on gene expression in purified cell population.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: mutant Huntingtin (128Q) versus normal Huntingtin (19Q), and normal Huntingtin versus GFP only, 3 biological replicates of each. Cells were purified based on GFP fluorescence using a cell sorter.
