TITLE
Transcriptional effect of various iron treatments on Caco-2 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated transcriptional response of CaCo-2 cells to iron treatments, we studied hemin effect by adding hemin to DMEM-FBS medium and iron deficiency effects in using an iron free medium compared to the same supplemented with FAC (ferric ammonium citrate). Keywords: various iron treatment, differential gene expression, hemin treatment, iron-free
