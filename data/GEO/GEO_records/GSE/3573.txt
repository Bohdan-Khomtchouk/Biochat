TITLE
Transcriptional effect of various iron treatments on Caco-2 cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We investigated transcriptional response of CaCo-2 cells to iron treatments, we studied hemin effect by adding hemin to DMEM-FBS medium and iron deficiency effects in using an iron free medium compared to the same supplemented with FAC (ferric ammonium citrate). Keywords: various iron treatment, differential gene expression, hemin treatment, iron-free

DESIGN
Biological replicates were used (3 samples) of each iron treatments (SF-FAC, SF-0, DMEM-FBS, DMEM-Hemin). Each sample was labelled with cy5 and a pool of each sample was constituted and labelled with cy3.
