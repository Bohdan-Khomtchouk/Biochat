TITLE
Patient iPSC-Derived Neurons for Disease Modeling of Frontotemporal Dementia with Mutation in CHMP2B

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to obtain an overview of gene expression changes in CHMP2B-dependent frontotemporal dementia (FTD3), RNA sequencing analyses were performed in FTD3 patient neurons compared to their gene-corrected isogenic controls.

DESIGN
Examination of 7 samples in totoal, including 3 samples of FTD3 paitent iPSC-derived neurons, 3 samples of corresponded isogenic controls and 1 sample of age-matched independent healthy control.

PLATFORM
GPL20301 Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Homo sapiens)
