ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra04-07_pgpr - profiling of the root architecture response to phyllobacterium - Experiment 1 : Which genes are up- or down-regulated in Arabidopsis thaliana cultivated in vitro with increased lateral root development in response to Phyllobacterium STM196 inoculation. Experiment 2 : Which genes are up- or down-regulated during the ISR triggered by a rhizobacteria, in comparison with those affected by a pathogenic interaction. Experiment 3 : which genes are specifically induced or repressed in Arabidopsis thaliana by inoculation of the soil with a PGPR vs a bacteria that has the ability to trigger nodule formation in a Legume.  - Seeds of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) were surface-sterilized and sawn on agar mineral medium (see below). 4 days after storage in the dark at 4degreeC, seedling were cultivated 6 days in a growth chamber (16 h daily, 20-22degreeC) and then transferred on a fresh agar mineral medium inoculated or not with Phyllobacterium STM196 (2.108 cfu/ml). 6 days later, root and leaves were collected, froze on liquid nitrogen and stored at -80degreeC. Keywords: treated vs untreated comparison
