TITLE
Expression data from p38 knock out versus wild type fetal liver

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38alpha controls inflammatory responses and cell proliferation. Using mice carrying conditional p38alpha alleles, we investigated its function in postnatal development and tumorigenesis. When p38alpha is specifically deleted in the mouse embryo, fetuses develop to term but die shortly after birth, likely due to lung dysfunction. Fetal hematopoietic cells and embryonic fibroblasts deficient in p38alpha display increased proliferation, resulting from sustained activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun pathway. Importantly, in chemical-induced liver cancer development, mice with liver-specific deletion of p38alpha show enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and tumor development that also correlates with JNK/c-Jun upregulation. Furthermore, increased proliferation of p38alpha-deficient hepatocytes and tumor cells is suppressed by inactivation of JNK or c-Jun.  These results reveal a novel mechanism whereby p38alpha negatively regulates cell proliferation through antagonizing the JNK/c-Jun pathway in multiple cell types and in liver cancer development. We used microarrays to identifiy differental regulated genes by p38alpha in fetal liver cells Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Wild type and p38 deficient fetal liver cell were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
