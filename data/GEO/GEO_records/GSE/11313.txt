TITLE
Drosophila Gene Expression During Metamorphosis in Wild Type and Germline Minus Pupae

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Drosophila melanogaster undergoes a complete metamorphosis, during which time the larval male and female forms transition into sexually dimorphic, reproductive adult forms. To understand this complex morphogenetic process at a molecular-genetic level, we performed whole genome microarray analyses. Genes were identified that were expressed during metamorphosis in both somatic and germline tissues of males and females.  Additionally, genes were identified that display sex-specific differences in abundance in both of these tissues at discrete times during metamorphosis. Keywords: time course; wild type; genetic modification;

DESIGN
Gene expression was examined at five time points during metamorphosis: 0, 24, 48, 71, and 96 hr After Puparium Formation (APF).  Gene expression was examined separately in males and females for both wild type pupae and tudor (tud) progeny.  tud progeny have genetically ablated germline tissues.  All samples were labeled with Cy5 and compared against a common reference sample labeled with Cy3.  The reference sample contained male and female wild type pupae from all stages of metamorphosis.  All experiments were conducted in triplicate.
