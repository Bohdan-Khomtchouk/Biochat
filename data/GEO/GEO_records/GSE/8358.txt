TITLE
Intra- and inter-individual genetic differences in gene expression

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Each expressed gene was tested for differential expression in three mouse tissues (Brain, Kidney, Liver) in a direct comparison of SJL/J vs. C57BL/6J Keywords: direct comparison, multiple tissues

DESIGN
Whole RNA from a pool of 5 SJL/J mice was compared to a pool of RNA from C57BL/6J mice with three technical replicates per tissue, no dye swaps.
