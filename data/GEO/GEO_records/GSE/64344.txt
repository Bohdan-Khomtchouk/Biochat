TITLE
Host-specific transcriptomic pattern of Trichoderma virens during interaction with maize or tomato roots

ORGANISM
Trichoderma virens

SUMMARY
To test the hypothesis that gene expression by the fungal partner in this beneficial interaction is modulated by the plant host, Trichoderma virens was co-cultured with maize or tomato in a hydroponic system allowing interaction with the roots. The transcriptomes for T. virens alone were compared with fungus-inoculated tomato or maize roots by hybridization on oligonucleotide microarrays Based on the relevant role of Trichoderma virens as a biological control agent this study provides a better knowledge of its crosstalk with plants in a host-specific manner.

DESIGN
Trichoderma virens was co-cultured for three days with maize or tomato in a hydroponic system allowing interaction with the roots. 3 experiments were performed for each treatment, and compared to 5 experiments with T. virens grown under the same conditions without plants.
