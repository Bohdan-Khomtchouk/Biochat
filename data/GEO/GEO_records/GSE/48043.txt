TITLE
Late life rapamycin treatment reverses age-related heart dysfunction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the mRNA profile of aged mice (24 months old) fed either a control diet or a diet containing Rapamycin (14 ppm) for 3 months. After drug treatement, the hearts of the mice were removed and total mRNA was removed from the tissue. Analysis revealed that there were 700 significantly differentially expressed genes between the control fed group and the Rapamycin diet group by our analysis.

DESIGN
Heart tissue samples from age-matched control mice (n=10) and rapamycin fed mice (n=10) were extracted for total RNA. The samples were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 (50 basepair paired-end sequencing). The sequencing yielded quality scores greater than 30 with an average of 10 million reads per sample. 34,293 genes were mapped back to the MGSCv37 C57BL/6J mouse genome (maximum paired distance=300 and minimum=130, minimum number of reads per mapping = 5, maximum number of mismatches= 2, with the reads being mapped to unique sites in the genome).
