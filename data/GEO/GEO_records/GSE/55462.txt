TITLE
Transcriptional profiling in Finger millet (Eleusine coracana) genotypes provides insights into the molecular basis of salinity tolerance in tolerant genotype.

ORGANISM
Eleusine coracana

SUMMARY
In present study we compared transcriptional response to salinity stress between susceptible CO 12 and tolerant genotype trichy 1 of finger millet. We found out that several functional group of genes like transporters, transcription factors, genes involved in cell signalling, osmotic homeostasis, compatible solutes biosynthesis were upregulated more in tolerant genotype as compared to susceptible genotype in response to salinity stress. Salnity inhibited photosynthetic capacity and photosynthesis related genes more in susceptible genotype as compared to tolerant genotype. Identified genes are excellent targets for further functional studies in order to understand more specific molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in two genotypes of finger millet and can be further used for developing salinity tolerant crops through genetic engineering.

DESIGN
4 samples were examined:- CO12 without salinity stress, CO12 exposed to salinity stress, Trichy 1 without salinity stress, Trichy 1 exposed to salinity stress
