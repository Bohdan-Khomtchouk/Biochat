TITLE
Live Attenuated Tetravalent Dengue Vaccination in Non-Human Primates

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We measured genome-wide transcript abundance patterns in 246 whole blood samples collected from 35 cynomolgus macaques before and after vaccination with a live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (TDV) or PBS (placebo). Animal work was conducted at the Charmany Instructional Facility of the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and all animal procedures were approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Animal Care and Use Committee. Thirty-five adult male, DENV-seronegative cynomolgus macaques from Vietnam were placed in quarantine for 30 days prior to the start of the study. Five groups of animals (n=6 animals per group) received TDV either subcutaneously (SC) in 0.5 mL inocula or intradermally (ID) in 0.1 mL inocula using a needle-free injector (PharmaJet' device) or needle and syringe (N & S). Animals received two doses (same route) of TDV either on the same day (Day 0) or sixty days apart. One group (n=5) received PBS by ID route and needle-free injector. On day 90 after primary vaccination, 3 animals from each group were challenged with 105 PFU wt DENV-2 (New Guinea C strain) or 105 PFU wt DENV-4 (Dominica/81 strain) by SC route using N & S. Whole blood samples were collected for transcriptional profiling from all animals on days -11, -2, 1, 3, 5, and 7 before and after immunization, and for placebo animals on days 88, 91, 93, 95, and 97 before and after wt DENV challenge. Blood samples were drawn into PAXgene Blood RNA tubes and stored at -80'C prior to RNA extraction and processing.
