TITLE
Large scale analysis of apple mealiness within IM apple progeny

ORGANISM
Malus domestica

SUMMARY
Based on sensorial analysis over 4 years, 6 apple genotypes with contrasted fruit texture (mealy or not) were selected among a progeny. Apple samples were collected at 100 days after flowering (100 DAF), harvest (H), after 2 and 4 months of cold storage (60DAH and 120DAH respectively).

DESIGN
6 apple hybrids were analysed in dye-switch. Biological replicates are fruits from 2 to 4 different harvest years. Each mealy hybrid was compared to a non-mealy hybrid from the same harvest year in 12 dye-swap 3 pairs at 4 four time points).
