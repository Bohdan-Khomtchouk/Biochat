TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of a Streptococcus pyogenes mutant lacking the eukaryote-type ser/thr kinase (SP-STK)

ORGANISM
Streptococcus pyogenes

SUMMARY
We report the mRNA expression profile of Streptococcus pyogenes Type M1 strain M1T15448-derived mutant lacking eukaryote-type Serine threonine kinase.

DESIGN
Measuring transcriptome profiling in M1T1DSTK mutants vs M1T1-WT  5448 strain
