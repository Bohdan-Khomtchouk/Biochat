TITLE
The functional enhancer repertoire of human embryonic stem cells [ChIP-seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We combined Self-Transcribing Active Regulatory Region Sequencing (STARR-seq) with an enrichment step using chromatin immunoprecipitation in a massively parallel reporter assay. We applied this assay, termed ChIP-STARR-seq, to normal (primed) and naive human embryonic stem cells, building up a comprehensive catalogue of functional enhancers. This database record describes the ChIP-seq component.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq for OCT4 (POU5F1), NANOG, H3K27ac, H3K4me1 + Input control in naive and primed hESCs = 10 datasets total

PLATFORM
GPL16791 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)
