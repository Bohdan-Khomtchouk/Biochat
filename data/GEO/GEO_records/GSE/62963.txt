TITLE
RNA half-life analysis after transcriptional blocking with actinomycin D

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of HeLa cells treated with actinomycin D for increasing amounts of time. Relative abundance to  control cells was used to estimate the half-life of lncRNAs.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, actinomycin D-treated vs. untreatted HeLa cells. Biological replicates: 2. Technical replicates: 2.
