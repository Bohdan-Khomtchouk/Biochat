TITLE
SOX7 and ETS factors regulate an endothelial transcriptional program during vascular development (DamID)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Vascular development involves complex changes in gene expression necessary to dictate the behaviour of differentiating endothelial cells within the emerging vascular network.  However, the transcriptional programs regulating vascular development are poorly understood.  Here we use a DamID approach to profile for the first time the global DNA binding pattern of SOX7, FLI1 and ERG in endothelial precursor cells.  We uncover that SOX7, FLI1 and ERG bind together at endothelial specific regulatory regions to drive a transcriptional program important for vascular development.

DESIGN
DamID for SOX7, FLI1 and ERG relative to WT DAM only control

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
