TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of genes regulated by p44/wdr77 and PRMT5 in lung and prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression in lung and prostate cancer cells expressing non-target (NT), p44/wdr77. or PRMT5 shRNA.  Results provide important information on how p44/wdr77 and PRMT5 control cellular proliferation.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from cells expressing NT, p44/wdr77, or PRMT5 shRNA.

PLATFORM
GPL10558 Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip
