TITLE
Mouse Endothelial Progenitor Cell (EPC) Lines - Illumnia Array

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse EPCs were harvested from lung tissue and cultured in hypoxic chambers (2% FiO2) for 48 hrs and then transferred to regular incubators. Cell lines were then stained for the uptake of the acetylated form of low density lipoprotein. These cells were then sorted by flow cytometry and labeled as EPC_acLDL cells. Finally, high passage EPC_acLDL cells (p16-20) were collected and labeled as EPC_late cells. The three cell lines were then grown up, harvested, and RNA isolated and submitted in duplicate for Illumina array analysis of gene expression.

DESIGN
3 samples, in duplicate: EPC, EPC_acLDL, and EPC_Late

PLATFORM
GPL6885 Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip
