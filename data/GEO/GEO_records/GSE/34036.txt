TITLE
Genome-wide distribution of AdpA, a global regulator for secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation in Streptomyces [liquid]

ORGANISM
Streptomyces griseus

SUMMARY
AdpA is a global transcriptional activator triggering morphological differentiation and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces griseus. AdpA influences expression of > 1,000 genes, but the overall picture of AdpA regulon has been obscure. Here, we took snapshots of distribution of AdpA across the chromosome in living S. griseus cells by ChIP/ChAP-seq analysis. In both liquid and solid cultures, AdpA bound to similar > 1,200 sites, which were located on not only putative regulatory regions (65 %) but also regions (35 %) that appeared not to affect transcription. Transcriptome analysis indicated that approximately 40% of the AdpA binding sites in putative regulatory regions were involved in gene regulation. AdpA was indicated to act as a transcriptional repressor as well as an activator. Expression profiles of AdpA-target genes were very different between liquid and solid cultures in spite of similar AdpA-binding profiles. We therefore concluded that AdpA directly controls > 500 genes in cooperation with other regulatory proteins in many cases. In vitro AdpA binding to the selected 304 AdpA-binding sites was examined, revealing several unique characteristics of AdpA regarding its DNA-binding property. This study gave the first experimental insight into the extent of AdpA regulon, indicating many genes under the direct control of AdpA.
