TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of effects of obovatol on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced gene expression in microglia

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of BV-2 microglial cells comparing control untreated BV-2 cells with LPS-treated BV-2 cells or obovatol/LPS-treated BV-2 cells. Objective was to determine the effect of obovatol on LPS-induced gene expression in microglia.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from BV-2 microglial cells, which were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or LPS/obovatol compared to untreated BV-2 cells. Biological replicates: 1 control replicates, 1 LPS-treated replicates, 1 obovatol+LPS-treated replicates.
