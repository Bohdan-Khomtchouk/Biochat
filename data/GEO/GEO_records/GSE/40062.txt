TITLE
Gene expression profile of the stomach from an AGR2 null mouse

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The in vivo function of AGR2 was examined by generating an AGR2 null mouse.  The mice died prematurely due to hyperplasia and dysplasia of the glandular stomach. Gene expression profiling was performed to compare differences in transcription between wild-type and null AGR2 mice.

DESIGN
Female AGR2 wild-type and knockout mice were sacrificed at the age of 26 weeks and the glandular stomachs were removed.  Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The RNA was was reverse transcribed, labeled, and hybridized to mouse oligonucleotide DNA microarrays (Illumina MouseRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip)
