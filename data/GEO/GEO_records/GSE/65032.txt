TITLE
Global expression profiling reveals shared and distinct transcript signatures in arrested act2(-) and CDPK4(-) Plasmodium berghei gametocytes

ORGANISM
Plasmodium berghei

SUMMARY
Gametocytogenesis and gametogenesis in malaria parasites are complex processes of cell differentiation and development likely involving many gene products. Gametocytes develop in the blood of the vertebrate host but mature gametocytes are not activated until taken up by the mosquito vector. Several distinct mutants have been described that block gametogenesis but the detailed molecular causes for the mutant phenotypes are not understood. To investigate whether a block in gametogenesis also results in a changed transcriptional profile, we studied two gene deletions mutants; act2(-) lacking stage-specific actin II and CDPK4(-) lacking calcium-dependent protein kinase 4. Whole-genome microarray analysis was performed from RNA of mature gametocytes to compare the transcriptomes of the mutants with wild-type Plasmodium berghei. The microarray analysis identified ~12% of all genes being differentially expressed in either or both mutants compared to normal gametocytes, as defined by at least two-fold change in transcript abundance. A large proportion of differentially expressed genes in both mutants overlapped consistent with the developmental gametocyte arrest. Distinct profiles in each mutant were also observed.

DESIGN
Microarray experiments were performed as dual-color hybridizations on Agilent-024169 custom whole genome Plasmodium berghei 44K arrays. To compensate for dye-specific effects, a dye-reversal color-swap was applied.
