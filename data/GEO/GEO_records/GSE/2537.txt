TITLE
Assessment of gene expression changes during palatal adherence and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genomic analysis was performed to distinguish expression changes in murine medial edge epithelial cells during both palatal adherence and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). Assessment of changes between sample 0 hours and sample 12 hours represent palatal adherence. Changes between sample 12 hours and sample 24 hours represent EMT. During adherence, we found that genes necessary for TGF-beta/LEF-1 signal transduction upregulate, as well as those necessary for cell adhesion. During EMT, we observed the loss of epithelial markers and upregulation of many genes necessary to promote the transition to mesenchyme and cell migration. Keywords = EMT Keywords = palate Keywords = LEF-1 Keywords = TGF-beta Keywords = craniofacial development Keywords: time-course
