TITLE
Gata2 is a master regulator of endometrial function and progesterone signaling [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The role of Gata2 in regulating uterine function including fertility, implantation, decidualization and P4 signaling in the mouse was investigated by the conditional ablation of Gata2 in the uterus using the (PR-cre) mouse and ChIP-seq for in vivo GATA2 binding sites in the murine uterus upon acute P4 administration.

DESIGN
Gata2 gene ablation was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis in the PR-cre; Gata2fl/fl (termed Gata2d/d) uterus. While littermate controls are fertile, Gata2d/d females are completely infertile. Analysis of the infertility indicates that implantation does not occur, and the uterine stroma is incapable of undergoing the decidual reaction to support further embryonic development. Measure of P4 target genes including PR itself indicate a block in P4 target gene induction and that Gata2 regulates PR expression directly. Microarray analysis demonstrates that ablation of Gata2 leads to specific gene changes, including disruption of the Wnt signaling pathway, Progesterone receptor (PR) signaling, and Ihh signaling pathway. In addition we identified 46,183 GATA2 binding sites in P4 treatment conditions with 7,954 binding sites overlapping that of the PR.Taken together, these data demonstrate that Gata2 is a critical regulator of gene expression and function in the murine uterus.
