TITLE
Expression data from prepubertal and adult derived porcine oocytes

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Oocyte developmental potential is progressively obtained as females approach puberty.  Therefore, oocytes derived from prepubertal females are less developmentally competent, indicated by decreased embryonic development, compared to oocytes derived from adult females. To investigate mechanisms involved in establishing oocyte cytoplasmic maturation and developmental competence, Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays were used. Keywords: oocyte developmental competence, maternal age
