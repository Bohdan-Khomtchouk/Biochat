TITLE
Expression data from prepubertal and adult derived porcine oocytes

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Oocyte developmental potential is progressively obtained as females approach puberty.  Therefore, oocytes derived from prepubertal females are less developmentally competent, indicated by decreased embryonic development, compared to oocytes derived from adult females. To investigate mechanisms involved in establishing oocyte cytoplasmic maturation and developmental competence, Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays were used. Keywords: oocyte developmental competence, maternal age

DESIGN
Porcine oocytes obtained from prepubertal and adult females were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  Oocytes were aspirated from 2 to 6 mm ovarian follicles and matured in vitro.  Analysis of the first extruded polar body ensured that all oocytes used in the analyses had completed nuclear maturation.
