TITLE
SNP array analysis of single cell genomes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This study (McConnell, et al. Science 2012) used both SNP array and sequencing data to examine copy number variation in neuronal genomes. Encolsed here are the SNP Array data from the 42 fibroblasts, 19 human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and 40 hiPSC-derived neurons that were reported in the manuscript.

DESIGN
Copy number analysis was performed on .CEL files using Partek Genomics Suite with a custom single cell reference file.
