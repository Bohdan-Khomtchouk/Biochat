TITLE
Exploring the occupancy and interaction with FXR2, STAT1/3 and H3K4me3 at genomic level of FXR1 in H358 and AGS cell line by ChIP-seq

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) was conducted in the human cancer cell lines H358 and AGS using FXR1, FXR2, STAT1/3 and H3K4me3 specific antibodies on the platform Illumina HiSeq 2000. ChIP-seq data quality was analyzed using FastQC. Target protein binding genomic regions (called ChIP-seq peaks) were identified by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) algorithm using the default p-value cutoff of 1e-5.
