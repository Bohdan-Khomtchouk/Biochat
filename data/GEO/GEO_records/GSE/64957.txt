TITLE
Microarray study of human adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG), zona fasciculata (ZF) and aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Learn about the transcriptome profiling of zona glomerulosa (ZG), zona fasciculata (ZF) and aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA) in human adrenals

DESIGN
21 pairs of zona fasciculata (ZF) and zona glomerulosa (ZG), and 14 paired aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) from 14 Connâ€™s syndrome patients and 7 phaeochromocytoma patients were assayed on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Laser capture microdissection was used to acquire samples of ZF, ZG and APA as previously described (Azizan EA, et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2012;97:E819-E829). For differentiation of ZG from ZF, sections were stained with cresyl violet using the LCM Staining Kit (AM1935, Ambion, USA). Data processing and analysis was performed using AffymetrixGeneChip Command Console Software and PartekGenomicSuite 6.5 (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO). Gene expressions were portrayed as the summarized log-signal of the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) with quantilenormalisation and median polish for probe set summarisation. Validation by qPCR was performed on genes > 10 fold up-regulated in zona glomerulosa (compared to zona fasciculata) and > 10 fold up-regulated in aldosterone-producing adenomas (compared to zona glomerulosa).
