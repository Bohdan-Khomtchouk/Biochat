TITLE
Transcript Response of Fully Expanding and Growing Soybean to Elevated CO2

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
The transcript responses of both growing, trifoliate 6 and fully expanded, trifoliate 4 soybean leaves to elevated CO2 was investigated. We also compared the transcriptome of fully expanded vs. developing leaves in both ambient and elevated CO2. Keywords = soybean Keywords = elevated carbon dioxide Keywords = global change Keywords = leaf growth Keywords = plant Keywords: soybean leaf comparisons

DESIGN
randomized complete block design in SoyFACE, 24 samples, 4 comparisons, 2 technical repeats including dye swaps, 2 biological repeats
