ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
The transcript responses of both growing, trifoliate 6 and fully expanded, trifoliate 4 soybean leaves to elevated CO2 was investigated. We also compared the transcriptome of fully expanded vs. developing leaves in both ambient and elevated CO2. Keywords = soybean Keywords = elevated carbon dioxide Keywords = global change Keywords = leaf growth Keywords = plant Keywords: soybean leaf comparisons
