TITLE
Zic3 ChIP-on-chip in mouse ES cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The transcription factor Zic3 is required for maintenance of embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency (Lim LS et al, Mol Biol Cell. 2007;18:1348-1358). By genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) in ES cells, we have identified 379 direct Zic3 targets, many of which are functionally associated with pluripotency, cell cycle, proliferation, oncogenesis and early embryogenesis.

DESIGN
E14 cells were cultured to a density of 1 x 108 cells for each IP. Two biological replicates were performed per experiment. Cells were cross-linked for 10 minutes at room temperature with 1% (w/v) formaldehyde and the reaction subsequently quenched with 125mM glycine. Nuclear fractions were isolated and the DNA sheared to average lengths of 200-500 bp. For analysis on mouse promoter arrays, purified ChIP material was processed according to the Agilent ChIP-on-chip protocol, and labeled DNA was hybridized to Agilent mouse promoter ChIP-on-chip arrays for 40 hours at 65oC (G4490A; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Chips were washed and scanned as per manufacturer’s protocol and the results were processed with Agilent's ChIP Analytics software v1.3. A p-value cutoff < 0.001 was specified in our analysis. To further minimize false positives, we applied a “neighborhood voting” algorithm [2] to filter for high confidence Zic3-enriched sites, wherein binding was considered genuine only in the presence of a second, significantly enriched, neighboring probe (p < 0.005).
