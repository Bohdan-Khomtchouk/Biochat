TITLE
Expression data for tet-on inducible mouse p53 stable line in H1299 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify novel genes regulated by p53, stable line containing tet-on inducible p53 construct was generated and used for gene expression analysis.

DESIGN
Tet-on p53 inducible stable line was induced by doxycyclin for 24 hours before total RNA was extracted for array analysis.
