TITLE
Methylation status of OCI Ly3 SP vs. nonSP

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Promotor methylation status of Side Population cells of DLBCL cell line OCI Ly3 was compared to non Side Population Cells of OCI Ly3

DESIGN
DLBCL Cell Line OCI Ly3 was cultured and stained using Hoechst33342. FACS analysis showed a distinct Side Population. Side Population Cells and non Side Population cells were sorted, gDNA was extracted and Methylation analysis was performed using Illumin 27k Bead Array.
