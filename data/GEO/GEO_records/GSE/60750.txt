TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression by SCTR siRNA transfection in breast cell line MCF-10A

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of tumor suppression by cell cycle-related genes which are regulated by SCTR(Secretin receptor) at gene expression level. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that SCTR regulates cell cycle-related genes toward tumor suppression in normal breast cells. Results suggest that normal breast cells have tumor suppressor activity when SCTR was knocked down by siRNA.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from  MCF-10A where SCTR was knocked down by siRNA
