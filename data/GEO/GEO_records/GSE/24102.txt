TITLE
Expression data from granulocytic MDSC (G-MDSC) and neutrophils

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) playing the immune suppressive roles in tumor bearing host consists of two major subsets of granulocytic and monocytic cells. Granulocytic MDSC (G-MDSC) express CD11b+ Gr-1high Ly6G+ Ly6Clow and produce high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, neutrophils are well known ROS producing cells during immune defensive process and share same surface markers with G-MDSC. These similar features always brought the fundamental questions what’s the difference between G-MDSC and neutrophils but it’s not yet proven clearly. In this study, we examined the gene expression of G-MDSC and neutrophils using Affymetrix microarray

DESIGN
G-MDSC (CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow) were purifed from splenocytes in EL4 lymphoma tumor bearing mice by positive selection of Ly6G using microbeads isolation. Neutrophils were purified from ascitic fluids induced after injection of milk protein, casein by negative selection of F4/80 and positive selection of Ly6G using microbeads isolation. Their RNA was extracted and gene expression was analyzed using Affymetrix microarray.
