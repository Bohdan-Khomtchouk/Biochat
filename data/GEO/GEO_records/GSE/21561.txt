TITLE
Gene expression analysis of CBFbeta knockdown PPC1 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole genome array expression analysis was performed to identify changes in gene expression associated with the downregulation of the Core Binding Factor subunit CBFbeta.

DESIGN
PPC1 cells were infected with lentivirus containing either a control non-target shRNA or a shRNA specific for human CBFbeta. The cells were collected and lysed in Tri-reagent. Biological triplicates were analyzed for both control and knockdown cells.
