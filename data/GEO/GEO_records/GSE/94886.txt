TITLE
Expression data from muscle of vitamin A restricted steer.

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Vitamin A (VA) restriction for beef cattle improves meat marbling. However, its molecular mechanisms are not completely elucidated. We performed microarray analysis to clarify effect of VA restriction on longissimus thoracis muscle gene expressions in Japanese Black steers.

DESIGN
13 to 14 month of age Japanese Black steers (n = 6) were divided to two groups. Vitamin A suppemented group (n = 3) was supplemented VA during experimental period. Vitamin A restricted group (n = 3) was restricted dietary VA intake. Steers were fattened during 7 months, then longissimus thoracis muscle tissue samples were obtained.
