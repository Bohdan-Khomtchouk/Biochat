TITLE
Microarray analysis of Atelp2, npr1 and wild type (Col-0) infected with the avirulent bacterial pathogen  Pst DC3000/avrRpt2

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
The goal of the microarray experiment was to determine the induction kinetics of transcriptome changes in the Arabidopsis mutant Atelp2, npr1 and wild type in response to infection of the avirulent bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000/avrRpt2.  Results indicated that Atelp2 exhibited slower kinetcis of transcriptional changes than the wild type after Pst DC3000/avrRpt2 infection, whereas npr1 did not show significant alteration in the induction kinetics.

DESIGN
Three biological replicates with leaves from 8 plants per sample were collected at 0, 4, 8, and 12 hours after inoculation with the avirulent bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000/avrRpt2.  After extraction, RNA concentration was determined on a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and sample quality was assessed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  Each replicate was used as one sample for microarray analysis.
