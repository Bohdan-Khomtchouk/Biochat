TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of epithelial and stromal contributions to mammogenesis in prepartum dry cows

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Our overall objective is to identify key differences in gene expression signaling pathways in the epithelial and intralobular stromal compartments during prepartum mammary remodeling and development in the dry cow.

DESIGN
2 cell types (epithelia or stroma) from each of 6 animals were collected by Laser Capture Microdissection
