TITLE
AMPKα Modulation in Cancer Progression: Multilayer Integrative Analysis of the Whole Transcriptome in Asian Gastric Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gastric cancer is the most common cancer in Asia and most developing countries. To identify the molecular underpinnings of gastric cancer in the Asian population, we applied an RNA-sequencing approach to gastric tumor and noncancerous specimens to quantitatively characterize the entire transcriptome of gastric cancer (including mRNAs and microRNAs). A multi-layer analysis was then developed to identify multiple types of transcriptional aberrations associated with different stages of gastric cancer, including differentially expressed mRNAs, recurrent somatic mutations and key differentially expressed microRNAs. Through this approach, we identified the central metabolic regulator AMPK-α as a potential functional target in Asian gastric cancer. Further, we experimentally demonstrated the translational relevance of this gene as a potential therapeutic target for early-stage gastric cancer in Asian patients. Together, our findings not only provide a valuable information resource for identifying and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of Asian gastric cancer, but also represent a general integrative framework to develop more effective therapeutic targets.

DESIGN
Using Life Technologies SOLiD™ sequencing platform, we performed transcriptome-wide profiling of gastric cancer samples from 30 anonymous, unrelated Asians of both sexes. Included were six noncancerous gastric tissue samples and 24 gastric tumor samples that represented stages I through IV of tumor development. From the WT-seq protocol we generated a WT-seq dataset of 2.1 billion 50-nt short reads from the 30 samples; Applying the second small RNA-seq protocol to 19 gastric tumor samples (5 of the original 24 yielded insufficient sample amounts) and 6 noncancerous gastric tissue samples resulted in a small RNA-seq dataset.
