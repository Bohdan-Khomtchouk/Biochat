TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling of prefrontal cortex samples from C57 mice treated with saline or morphine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Our previous study showed that Dicer1 expression is positively correlated with the development of analgesic tolerance. To further understand the miRNA regulation by Dicer in the development of tolerance, we performed microRNA profiling using Agilent mouse miRNA arrays to identify the miRNA profiles in the prefrontal cortex from C57BL/6J (C57) mice under saline or morphine treatment.

DESIGN
8 prefrontal cortex samples derived from C57 mice treated with saline or morphine. 8 RNA samples, purified from the collected prefrontal cortex samples using Qiagen miRNeasy kit, were processed and applied to Agilent-019119 mouse miRNA arrays. Array data was normalized and analyzed using Agilent GeneSpring program.
