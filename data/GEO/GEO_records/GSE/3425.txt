TITLE
Silencing of microRNAs in vivo with " antagomirs "

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using a novel class of chemically-engineered oligonucleotides, termed " antagomirs " , we studied the biological significance of silencing miR-122 in the liver of mice at the mRNA level Keywords: treatment response

DESIGN
Mice were injected on three subsequent days with antagomir-122 or scrambled control (mm-antagomir-122), respectively; 80mg/kg bodyweight/day. 24 hrs after the last treatment, mice were sacrificed and total RNA isolated from the livers. RNA from three mice was pooled and used for generation of biotin-labelled cRNA.
