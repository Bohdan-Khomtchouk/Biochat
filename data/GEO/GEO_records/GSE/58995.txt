TITLE
Sigma factor WhiGch positively regulates natamycin production in Streptomyces chattanoogensis L10

ORGANISM
Streptomyces chattanoogensis

SUMMARY
In LG01 there were a total of 861 genes displaying at least a two-fold change (P < 0.05), including 470 genes with lower and 391 genes with higher expressions

DESIGN
In this study, RNA isolated from LG01 or wild type Streptomyces chattanoogensis L10, was used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 8,117 protein-coding genes in S.  chattanoogensis L10, leading to the successful construction of different expression profiles between  whiGch deletion mutant and wild type S.  chattanoogensis L10.
