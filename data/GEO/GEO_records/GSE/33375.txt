TITLE
Transcriptome and signalling response to As stress

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Arsenic (As) is considered as the most common toxic metalloid, but its molecular mode of action is not well understood. In this study, we demonstrated that As(V) induced intracellular ROS production and Ca2+ accumulation in rice roots. To understand the molecular basis of plant cell responses to As better, we have undertaken a large-scale analysis of the rice transcriptome during As(V) stress. Up-regulated genes were enriched in transcripts involved in abiotic stress, chemical detoxification pathways, secondary metabolic process, transcription regulation and protein degradation while down-regulated genes were enriched in transcripts involved in secondary cell wall biogenesis, cell cycle and oligopeptide transporter. Molecular mechanisms for the As(V) in rice roots

DESIGN
Comparison of mock control and rice seedlings treated with 25 Î¼M As(V); Biological replicates: 3 control replicates, 3 As(V)-treated replicates.
