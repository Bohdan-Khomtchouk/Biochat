TITLE
Mouse cerebellum transcriptome response to a wild type West Nile virus (WNV), New York 99 Strain, and mutant WNV-E218A viruses [WCB001_mRNA]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The purpose is to obtain samples for mRNA, miRNA, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and histopathology analysis in mouse cerebellum infected with wild-type West Nile virus (WNV; WNV-NY99 382), and mutant WNV-E218A (WNV-NY99 382 E218A 2 nt).

DESIGN
Mice were inoculated with WNV intracranially at a dose of 100 FFU. Infected samples were collected in quintuplet; time-matched mocks were collected in quintuplet in parallel with infected samples. Time points: 1, 2, 4, and 6 days post-infection. GSE77193 (WCT001) and this study (WCB001) are 1/4 of cortex and 1/2 of cerebellum from the same mice. Tissues from this experiment are matched to tissues from GSE77193 (WCT001). Infectivity (titer) and pathology are measured from cortex tissue in GSE77193 (WCT001).

PLATFORM
