TITLE
Elevated MAOA Expression Enhances Tumor Growth In-vivo and Alters Transcriptional Profiles

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Subcutaneous xenografts were derived utilizing either PC3 cells engineered to stably overexpress MAOA or empty vector controls in mice receiving docetaxel treatment.  Tumor gene expression was profiled using Agilent gene expression microarrays.

DESIGN
Custom Agilent 44K whole human genome expression oligonucleotide microarrays were used to profile subcutaneous xenograft tumors derived utilizing either PC3 cells engineered to stably overexpress MAOA or empty vector controls in mice receiving docetaxel treatment. Total RNA was isolated and amplified prior to hybridization against a common reference pool of prostate tumor cell lines.
