TITLE
Altered expression of microRNAs in the myocardium of rats with acute myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MicroRNAs are important cellular components and their dysfunctions are associated with various disease. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most serious cardiovascular diseases. Although several miRNAs have been reported to be associated with AMI, more novel miRNAs are needed to be investigated to ascertain if they are associated with AMI.

DESIGN
SD rats (180-200g) was divided into sham-control group and two days group  after AMI, seven days group  after AMI, fourteen  days group after AMI, each group has six individual  animals   total RNA was taken from the border-zone myocardium , low molecular weight RNA was seperate and labeled , and then hybridized to capitalbio V2 biochip  representing about 924 microRNA . three chip were test in each group, and the procedure was repeated twice.
