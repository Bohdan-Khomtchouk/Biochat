SUMMARY
In-vivo Gene Signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis In C3HeB/FeJ Mice

DESIGN
In this experiment we have compared Mtb transcriptomics in-vivo, using samples derived from chronically infected C3HeB/FeJ mice, which produce human like caseating lesions, unlike other murine species, to Mtb cultured in-vitro. Similarly, the genome-wide expression of MtbdeldosR, MtbdeldosS and MtbdeldosT mutants is also compared between lungs from C3HeB/FeJ mice and in-vitro culturing.
