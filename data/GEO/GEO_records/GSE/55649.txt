TITLE
Role of Ubc13 in Breast Cancer Metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We recently found that Ubc13 controls breast cancer metastasis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In order to gain a better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by Ubc13 in metastasis, we performed a gene array analysis on xenografts derived from orthotopically implanted MDA-MB-231 LM2 cells, which preferentially metastazize to lung in NOD/SCID mice.

DESIGN
MDA-MB-231 LM2 cells were infected with lentivial shRNA constructs targeting either GFP (Control) or Ubc13 (ubc13). The resulting Control or Ubc13-silenced cells were implanted into fat pads of six weeks old female virgin NOD/SCID mice.  After eight weeks, tumors were excised, followed by collagenase/hyaluronidase digestion to establish single cell suspension, from which epithelial cells were enriched by depleting mouse cells of hematopoietic, endothelial, and fibroblast origin (CD45, TER119, CD31 and BP-1). The enrihced epithelial cells (three Control and three Ubc13-KD cells) were lysed in TRIZOL to extract RNA, which were then used to run microarray.
