TITLE
CD133+ and CD133- expression from pancreatic cancer cell line KPC001 using mouse WGA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
CD133+ and CD133 negative cells from pancreatic cancer cell line KPC001 were sorted using MACS technique. RNA was isolated using trizol (Invitrogen) and cleaned up using Qiagen RNAeasy columns. The RNA passed QC by the Biomedical Genomic Center (BMGC) of University of Minnesota. cDNA was prepared and hybridized by BMGC according to standard protocol.

DESIGN
The goal of the experiment was to see changes in the expression of genes in the CD133+ vs CD133- population in the pancreatic cancer cell line derived from KPC mouse model.
