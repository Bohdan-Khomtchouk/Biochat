TITLE
Array CGH analysis in primary human renal tumors, categorized by VHL genotype and HIF-alpha expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human renal cell carcinomas (RCC) have differential expression of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, depending on VHL genotype and other events. Here, we have divided a series of RCC samples based on HIF-alpha expression, in order to examine levels of genomic DNA aberration. Keywords: Patient Sample Study
