TITLE
Cellular response to unfolded proteins in cytosol and nucleus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of the coordinated transcriptional response to unfolded proteins in cytosol and nucleus utilizing mRNA-seq

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of NIH3T3 cells which stably expressing DD-sfGFP were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2000. The samples were collected from indicated timepoints after Shield-1 removal.

PLATFORM
