TITLE
RD effect on PC-3 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RD induced DNA damage and suppressed DNA repair in PC-3 cells. Expression profiling of PC-3 cells treated with 10 umol/L RD for 24 hours.

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from PC-3 cells exposed to RD for 24 h using an RNAiso plus kit (TaKaRa). Microarray analysis was performed on separate samples on the Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2 chip.

PLATFORM
GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array
