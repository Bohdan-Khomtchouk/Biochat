TITLE
A transcription factor pulse can prime chromatin for heritable transcriptional memory [RNAseq]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To indentify genes displaying long-term transcriptionnal memory (LTTM) we used a trans-differentiation system where Bcell are reprogramed into macrophages upon induction of the transcription factor Cebpa. We performed RNAseq in untreated Bcells, after 12h of Cebpa induction and after 6days of “wash” of Cebpa, to see if any genes respond more/faster in a second stimulation than in the first.

DESIGN
Genome expression by RNAseq in uninduced Bcell (C10 cell line), after induction Cebpa for 6h (Cebpa6h) or not induced (Control6h), after 6 days of wash (Cebpa6h/Control6h_Chase6d) and (re-)induction of C/EBPa for 13h (Cebpa6h/Control6h_Chase6d_Cebpa13h) .
