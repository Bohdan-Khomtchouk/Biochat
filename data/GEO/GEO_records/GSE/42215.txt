TITLE
yeast wt pool

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Contains a collection of wildtype Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains for estimating the biological variation. Wildtypes are obtained from the yeast wildtypes - wt pool background set HybSet, by randomly taking 100 wt vs. refpool (pooled wts) and 100 refpool vs. wt hybridizations

DESIGN
Two channel microarrays were used. RNA isolated from a large amount of wt yeast from a single culture was used as a common reference. Two independent cultures were hybridized on two separate microarrays.
