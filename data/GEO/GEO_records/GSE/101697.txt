TITLE
Transcriptome profiling of the testis developing and spermatogenesis of Mongolian horse using RNA-Seq

ORGANISM
Equus caballus

SUMMARY
Genes have been identifed in mammalian testes ï¼Œand were essential for development of testis and spermatogenesis.

DESIGN
In order to study those physiological processes, the 3 immature and 3 mature testis of Mongolian horse were collected and 6 libraries were established, using RNA-Seq, the related genes of Mongolian horse development of testis and spermatogenesis were detected.

PLATFORM
