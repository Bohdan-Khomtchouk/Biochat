TITLE
Comparative transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) isolated from pigs exposed to an atherogenic diet (AD) or to an AD supplemented with Grape Extract (GE) and/or Resveratrol (RES).

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
We used Affymetrix microarrays to investigate gene expression changes in PBMNCs isolated from female and male pigs to determine significant modulatory effects that may have been induced by the intake of GE and (or) RES during 4 months in animals fed an atherogenic diet (AD) .

DESIGN
The aim of this work was to determine whether the intake of low doses of a Grape Extract (GE; 1 g/70 Kg animal body weight) and (or) Resveratrol (RES; 18 mg/70 Kg animal body weight) exerted any modulatory effects, at the level of gene expression, in PBMNCs isolated from female and male pigs exposed to an atherogenic diet (AD) for 4 months. We isolated PBMNCs, and the corresponding total RNA, from 2 female and 2 male pigs for each group. Pure RNA was extracted from the PBMNCs for microarrays analyses (Affymetrix) and gene differential expression determined between the AD fed animals and control (CT) animals (to determine the effects of a high-fat consumption) and between the AD fed animals supplemented with GE and (or) RES and the animals fed the AD diet alone (to determine the effects of GE and (or) RES on the fat consumption). In addition, the effects of the consumption of GE and RES against a standard control diet (CT) were also determined. Differential gene expression: 1) AD vs CT (response to exposure to a high-fat diet); 2) AD-GE vs AD (modulatory effects of the intake of a grape extract on high-fat fed animals); 3) AD-GE-RES vs AD (modulatory effects of the intake of a resveratrol-enriched grape extract on high-fat fed animals); 4) AD-RES vs AD (modulatory effects of the intake of resveratrol on high-fat fed animals); 5) CT-GE-RES vs CT (modulatory effects of the intake of a resveratrol-enriched grape extract on animals fes a standard pig chow).
