TITLE
Expression data from anti-EpCAM treated and untreated SP cells compared to lung tissue

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Targeted therapies against cancer stem cells which are enriched in side populations (SP) involves interruption of Wnt-signalling. Furthermore, EpCAM is a SP marker and modulator of Wnt-signalling. Therefore, the effects of an anti-EpCAM treatment on SP-cells and WNT/Î²-catenin signalling was studied. SP of the murine lung adenocarcinoma cell line A2C12 was obtained by fluorescence activated cell sorting and whole genome scans helped to define their molecular phenotype after anti-EpCAM antibody treatment.

DESIGN
Anti-EpCAM treated and untreated A2C12 cells were subjected to Hoechst 33342 dye exclusion assay and sorted to SP fractions by FACS. Gene expression of SP cells was compared to non-transgenic lung tissue.
