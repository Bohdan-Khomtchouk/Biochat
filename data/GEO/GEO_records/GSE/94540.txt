TITLE
GENETIC VARIATION IN CHROMOSOME Y REGULATES SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INFLUENZA A VIRUS INFECTION

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Males of many species, ranging from humans to insects, are more susceptible than females to parasitic, fungal, bacterial, and viral infections. One mechanism which has been proposed to account for this difference is the ‘immunocompetence handicap model’ which posits that the higher infectious disease burden in males is due to testosterone (T), which drives the development of secondary male sex characteristics at the expense of suppressing immunity. However, emerging data suggest that cell-intrinsic (chromosome X and Y) sex-specific factors may also contribute to the sex differences in infectious disease burden. Using a murine model of influenza A virus (IAV) infection and a panel of chromosome Y (ChrY) consomic strains on the C57BL/6J background, we present data showing that genetic variation in ChrY influences IAV pathogenesis in males. Specific ChrY variants increase susceptibility to IAV in males and augment pathogenic immune responses in the lung, including activation of pro-inflammatory IL-17-producing γδ T cells, without affecting viral replication. Additionally, susceptibility to IAV segregates independently of copy number variation (CNV) in multicopy ChrY gene families that influence susceptibility to other immunopathologic phenotypes, including survival following infection with Coxsackievirus B3. These results demonstrate a critical role for genetic variation in ChrY in regulating susceptibility to infectious disease.

DESIGN
B6 mice vs B6 ChrY-PWD consomic mice, both infected with IAV, whole lung at day 7 post-infection, 5 biological replicates (mice) each
