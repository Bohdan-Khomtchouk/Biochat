TITLE
Transcriptional profile of Candida albicans DAY286 versus UPC2 delete, both at 1% oxygen (hypoxia).

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Whole genome microarray were used to generate the transcriptional profile of C.albicans UPC2 delete in hypoxia.

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from DAY286 or UPC2 delete grown in YPD medium in hypoxia at 30 degree Celsius for 3.5 h, and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5. Nine independent biological replicates were compared. 3 dye swaps were perfomed so that 6 out of 9 samples isolated from DAY286 in hypoxic culture were labeled with Cy3, and 3 were labeled with Cy5.
