TITLE
Gene expression data of QRsP-11 mouse fibrosarcoma cell line and its liver metastatic subline

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Mouse QRsP-11 fibrosarcoma cells were injected into the spleens of mice to isolate sub-populations of tumor cells that colonize to the liver. Cells from liver metastatic nodules were established in vitro and subsequently injected intrasplenically for further cycles of selection. After 12 cycles of in vivo selection, the cell subline LV12 was established.  Intravenous injection of LV12 cells produced liver metastases than QRsP-11 cells, whereas the incidence of lung metastases was similar to that of QRsP-11 cells. LV12 cells exhibited adhesiveness to liver-derived but not to lung-derived endothelial cells. DNA chip analysis indicated that an amphoterin-induced gene and open reading frame 2 (Amigo2) was overexpressed in LV12 cells. Knockdown of Amigo2 expression by siRNA in LV12 cells attenuated liver endothelial cell adhesion. Ex vivo imaging showed that siRNA-mediated suppression of Amigo2 in luciferase-expressing LV12 cells reduced attachment to liver tissue to the same level as that observed with QRsP-11 cells.  Moreover, Amigo2-knockdown by siRNA inhibited liver metastasis. Amigo2 expression in human cancer cells was higher in liver metastatic lesions than in primary lesions of colon and gastric cancer specimens. These data indicated that Amigo2 is involved in tumor cell adhesion to liver endothelial cells and formation of liver metastases.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of the parental QRsP-11 fibrosarcoma cell line and its liver metastatic LV12 subline were analyzed. Two samples.
