TITLE
Essential role of lncRNA binding for WDR5 maintenance of active chromatin and embryonic stem cell pluripotency

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Here we delineate the roles of RNA binding for WDR5 function on chromatin state and murine embryonic stem cell (ESC) maintenance.

DESIGN
Examination of global transcriptional changes and mapping genome-wide transcription factors occupancy at distinct time points during the transdifferentiation process

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
