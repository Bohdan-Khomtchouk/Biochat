TITLE
Eye imaginal disc development

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Coordinating cell proliferation and differentiation is essential during organogenesis.  In Drosophila, the photoreceptor, pigment and support cells of the eye are specified in an orchestrated wave as the morphogenetic furrow passes across the eye imaginal disc.  Cells anterior of the furrow are uncommitted to cell type and remain mitotically active, while most cells in the furrow arrest at G1 and adopt specified ommatidial fates.  We used microarray expression analysis to monitor changes in transcription at the furrow and identified genes whose expression correlates with either proliferation or fate specification.
