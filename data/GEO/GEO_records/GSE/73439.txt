TITLE
Changes in gene expression and splicing associated with pregnancy, labor and regions of human adipose tissue.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This is the expression dataset for two studies: 1) Characterization of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue transcriptome and biological pathways in pregnant and non-pregnant women: Evidence for pregnancy-related regional-specific differences in adipose tissue and 2) Characterization of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue transcriptome in pregnant women with and without spontaneous labor at term: Implication of alternative splicing in the metabolic adaptations of adipose tissue to parturition. The studies compare expression profiles and exon usage between adipose tissue regions and groups of women (pregnant vs non-pregnant) and in labor vs not in labor.

DESIGN
Paired design for regional differences within groups of women (identified by Subject _# in the title), and unpaired design between groups of women.
