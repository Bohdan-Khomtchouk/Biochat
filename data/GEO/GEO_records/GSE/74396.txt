TITLE
Azithromycin effects on lung microbiome in COPD patient

ORGANISM
human lung metagenome

SUMMARY
Azithromycin (AZM) reduces pulmonary inflammation and exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with emphysema. The antimicrobial effects of AZM on the lung microbiome are not known and may contribute to its beneficial effects.  Methods. Twenty smokers with emphysema were randomized to receive AZM 250 mg or placebo daily for 8 weeks. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed at baseline and after treatment. Measurements included: rDNA gene quantity and sequence. Results. Compared with placebo, AZM did not alter bacterial burden but reduced Î±-diversity, decreasing 11 low abundance taxa, none of which are classical pulmonary pathogens. Conclusions. AZM treatment the lung microbiome

DESIGN
Randomized trial comparing azithromycin (AZM) treatment with placebo for eight weeks. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were obtained before and after treatment to explore the effects of AZM on microbiome, in the lower airways. 16S rRNA was quantified and sequenced (MiSeq) The amplicons from total 39 samples are barcoded and the barcode is provided in the metadata_complete.txt file.
