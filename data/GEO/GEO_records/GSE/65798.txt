TITLE
Degradome sequencing analysis in developing wheat grains

ORGANISM
Triticum aestivum

SUMMARY
We aimed to identify targets of miRNAs during wheat grain development by using degradome sequencing approach. Two degradome libraries were constructed from wheat grains.

DESIGN
Verification of miRNA targets from two degradome libraries in developing wheat grains.
