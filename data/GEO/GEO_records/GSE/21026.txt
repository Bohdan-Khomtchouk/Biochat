TITLE
Genome-wide assessment of differential roles for p300 and CBP in transcription regulation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Through ChIP-Seq analysis with the Illumina Whole Genome Analyzer, we identify binding sites for P300 (EP300) and CBP (CREBBP) in Human glioblastoma T98G cells that were cell cycle synchronized before and after stimulation. In our analysis, we focused on the identification of genes differentially bound by P300 and CBP.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq with P300 and CBP antibodies over 2 timepoints
