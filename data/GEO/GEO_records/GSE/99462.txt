TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of third instar larva wing imaginal discs deregulating Cyclin G in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We report here the transcriptomic analysis of Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal discs from third instar female larvae expressing Cyclin G deleted of the PEST domain (the 25 COOH-terminal amin-acids) under the control of the daugterless-Gal4 ubiquitous driver. The negative control was transgenic flies wearing only the daugterless-Gal4  driver.

DESIGN
Imaginal wing disc mRNA profiles of female  UAS-CycGÎ”P, da-Gal4/+ or da-Gal4/+  Drosophila melanogaster third instar larvae were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
