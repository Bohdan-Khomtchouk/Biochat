TITLE
Genome-wide mRNA expression analysis of primary cultured mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells after inhibition of PKC-beta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase C beta (PKC-beta) # by the compound LY317615 has been tested on primary cultured mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells, stimulated in-vitro for 8h at a concentration of 5 µM. The aim of the study was the question if inhibition of PKC-beta leads to inhibition of genes responsible for T-cell migration in order to investigate LY-317615 as a possible experimental therapy for multiple sclerosis.

DESIGN
primary cultured mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (MBMEC) have been prepared from new-born mice and cultured for one week. Then stimulated for 8h with 5 µM LY317615. Two samples had been treated for the last 24h with 500 µM TNF-alpha and 500 µM IFN-gamma (inflamed) whereas two samples had been left untreated (naive). RNA was prepared using TRIZOL according to standard protocols.
