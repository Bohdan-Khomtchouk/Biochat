TITLE
A macrophage autonomous α4β1integrin-Syk-Rac2 signaling axis controls macrophage differentiation, tumor growth and metastasis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Macrophages, play an essential role in promoting tumor growth by affecting angiogenesis, immune suppression, invasion and metastasis. The signal transduction events within macrophages which encode the complex cascade of events required for tumor growth and polarization of macrophages are poorly understood. We have discovered an ECM dependent signaling pathway in macrophages that regulates M2 macrophage differentiation, tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. We provide direct evidence that a macrophage autonomous, α4β1 integrin dependent Syk-Rac2 signaling axis acts in concert with the p110 isoform (PTEN-PI-3 kinase pathway) to control metastasis.

DESIGN
SmoA1 Tg MB tumor cells were sorted into CD15+ and CD15- populations. RNA from these samples were hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 1.0 ST array.

PLATFORM
GPL6246 [MoGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
