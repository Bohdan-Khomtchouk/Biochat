TITLE
Identification of genes controlled by LMX1B in the developing limb, embryonic day (E) 13.5

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A control vs. genetic knockout experiment aimed at determining what RNAs are upregulated or downregulated in E13.5 mouse limb tissue lacking the Lmx1b gene. Because LMX1B is required for dorsal-ventral patterning of the limb, this screen gives insight into what putative downstream targets of Lmx1b contribute to dorsal-ventral patterning.

DESIGN
The forelimb or hindlimb of wild-type controls or Lmx1b loss-of-function mutants was used for RNA extraction. Each array was hybridized with cDNAs of an individual limb.

PLATFORM
