TITLE
Expression data from normal brain/glioma associated macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Tumor associated macrophages are contributing to local invasion, angiogensis, and metastasis during the progression of many kinds of tumor including glioma We used microrray to study the difference of expression of glioma associated macrophages and normal brain tissue associated macrophages

DESIGN
The macrophgages were isolated based on the markers of GFP and F4/80+ from Gl261 glioma and normal brain, RNA were extracted for microarray analysis
