TITLE
Determining the effects of the loss of sympathetic drive in bone, hypothalamus, and gut in adrenergic B1 and B2 receptor knockout mice [hypothalamus]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Eight weeks old male Adrb1tm1BkkAdrb2tm1Bkk/J , stock number 003810, were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. These mice are homozygous null for the Adrb1 and Adrb2 genes, and are viable, fertile, normal in size and do not display any gross physical or behavioral abnormalities. Mice were euthanized, and the whole bone marrow was extracted using established methods.1 Whole bone marrow cells from Adrb1tm1BkkAdrb2tm1Bkk/J mice were reconstituted into lethally- irradiated (950 Rad) C57BL/6J mice using a single retro-orbital injection at a ratio of 1:4 (Adrb1tm1BkkAdrb2tm1Bkk/J to C57BL/6J). All reconstituted mice were recovered for 2-3 months prior to tissue collection for mRNA arrays (1) The FASEB Journal 2015:29(1),652.13.

DESIGN
Eight control animals and eight animals that received new bone marrow from double adrenergic receptor knockout (treated KO chimera). Following recovery, tissues that were harvested included bone marrow, brain, and distal colon.
