TITLE
MEF2 Activated Genes

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Expression profiling in hippocampal neurons to identify genes upregulated in response to ectopic MEF2 activation by MEF2-VP16-ER Experiments were conducted to identify activity-regulated MEF2 target genes. Keywords: Gene activation time course

DESIGN
Neurons expressed either control MEF2deltaDBD-VP16-ER or MEF2-VP16-ER and expression profiling was conducted before and after 4-OH-Tamoxifen (4OHT) application.
