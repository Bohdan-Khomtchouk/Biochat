TITLE
Expression profiling of human prostate VCaP and LNCaP cancer cells after silencing ERG or ETV1, respectively

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Chromosomal rearrangements involving ETS factors, ERG and ETV1, occur frequently in prostate cancer. We here examine human prostate cancer cells control VCaP and LNCaP cells with ERG- or ETV1-silenced VCaP or LNCaP cells, respectively, in hormone deprived and stimulated conditions.

DESIGN
VCAP and LNCaP cells, 24 hr after ERG or ETV1 RNA interference, respectively, were grown in hormone-depleted conditions for 2 days, and then in the presence of EtOH (vehicle) or 10nM DHT for 16hr. Total RNA was extracted from three biological replicates. This was used to hybridize to Affymetrix expression arrays using the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 platform.
