TITLE
Identification of Tra2β-associated mRNAs in HCT116 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Human transformer 2β (Tra2β) is a serine/arginine-rich (SR)-like protein splicing factor and is now implicated to play wide-ranging roles in gene expression as an RNA-binding protein. In this study, we identified a subset of Tra2β-associated mRNAs in HCT116 human colon cancer cells using RNA immunoprecipitation with an anti-Tra2β antibody and microarray analysis.

DESIGN
Whole-cell extracts from HCT116 cells were incubated with protein-A Sepharose beads precoated with 3 μg anti-Tra2β antibody or control rabbit IgG for 2 h at 4°C. RNA in the immunoprecipitation (IP) materials was measured by human whole-genome microarray (Agilent Technology).
