TITLE
Identification of genes regulated by the iron dependent transcription factor Urbs1.

ORGANISM
Ustilago maydis

SUMMARY
Urbs1 of Ustilago maydis is a transcription factor that has been shown to repress its target genes (e.g. sid1, sid2) in the presence of iron. To identify additional genes regulated by Urbs1, we compared transcriptional profiles of the Ustilago maydis wild type strain FB1 grown in complete medium containing glucose with the addition of 10 ÂµM FeSO4 to the Ustilago maydis urbs1 deletion mutant BW12 grown under the same conditions. Keywords: gene induction

DESIGN
Strains FB1 (control) and BW12 (urbs1 deletion mutant) were grown in CM glucose in the presence of iron.
