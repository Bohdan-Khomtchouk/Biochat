TITLE
Gene expression profiles of components isolated from developing kidney at E15.5 using LCM. (GUDMAP Series ID: 12)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing kidney.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of laser capture microdissection (LCM) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in laser capture microdissected components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. Keywords: Comparison of kidney components.

DESIGN
At specific developmental time points we isolate discrete elements of the kidney by using laser capture  microdissection and then define their gene expression profiles with microarrays.
