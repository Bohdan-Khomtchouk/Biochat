TITLE
Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast tumors.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In a cohort study of 7 women with primary invasive breast cancer, we obtained a tumor specimen before (biopsy) and after (tumorectomy) 4 cycles of NAC with epirubicine and cyclophosphamide, followed by 4 cycles of taxanes. Total RNA was extracted from tumor specimens and the whole transcriptome was quantified with Affymetrix HuGene1.1ST. Molecular functions changing during chemotherapy were searched.

DESIGN
Whole genome expression of triple negative breast cancer tissues were measured before and after four cycles neoadjuvant chemotherapy
