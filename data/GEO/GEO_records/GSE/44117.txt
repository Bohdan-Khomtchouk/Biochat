TITLE
DNA methylation of hematopoietic stem cells during ontogeny and after enforced proliferative history

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution covering the vast majority of CpG islands and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features generated using high-throughput reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) for murine hematopoietic stem cells during ontongeny and after enforced prolferative history.

DESIGN
Analysis of hematopoietic stem cell methylation during ontogeny and after undergoing enforced proliferative history

PLATFORM
