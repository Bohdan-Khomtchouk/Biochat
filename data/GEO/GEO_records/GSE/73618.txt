TITLE
Spc1/ Spc1K49R overexpression - gene expression changes in S. pombe

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe

SUMMARY
Spc1/ Spc1K49R was overexpressed in wt S. pombe cells for 24 hours and gene expression changes were analysed

DESIGN
All samples were processed in duplicates.  Gene expression in cells overexpressing Spc1 / Spc1K49R was compared with respect to the levels in control cells transformed with the empty vector.
