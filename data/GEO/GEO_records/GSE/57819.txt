TITLE
Effects of hnRNP A1 on gene expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To find the discover target genes regulated by hnRNP A1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma, NimbleGen 12x135K microarrays were used to find the gene expression changes between hnRNP A1 or non-specific (NS) siRNA treated oral cancer cells.

DESIGN
Cal27 cells were treated with hnRNP A1 or non-specific (NS) siRNA twice in a 48-hour interval. After 96 hours, total RNAs were collected for microarray assay.  Total RNAs from hnRNP A1 knockdown (3 samples) or NS siRNA treated cells (3 samples) were used for chip experiment (6 chips). Each chip measures the expression levels of human 45,033 genes. NimbleGen One-Color DNA Labeling Kit was used for sample labeling. Hybridization was performed in NimbleGen Hybridization System. After washing, slides were scanned with Axon GenePix 4000B scanner. Data was extracted and normalized using NimbleScan v2.5 Software.
