TITLE
Effects of Ars2 or DGCR8 siRNA on microRNA expression

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ars2 is a component of the nuclear cap-binding complex that is required for cellular proliferation and contributes to microRNA biogenesis. Arrays were performed to determine the repertoire of microRNAs that change following knock-down of Ars2.  Knock-down of DGCR8 was also performed to determine which microRNAs were expressed and had half-lives short enough to significantly decrease over the duration of the experiment.

DESIGN
9 samples were analyzed including: three biological replicates of control siRNA-transfected HeLa cells, HeLa cells transfected with three independent siRNAs targeting Ars2, or HeLa cells transfected with three independent siRNAs targeting DGCR8.
