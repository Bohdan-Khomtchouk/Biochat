TITLE
EOM and TA Sp cell comparison

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Using Affymetrix GeneChips, we analyzed expression profiles of SP cells from EOM and TA. 348 differentially expressed transcripts defined the EOM-SP transcriptome: 229 upregulated in EOM-SP and 119 in TA-SP. Keywords: Expression Profiling

DESIGN
Six independently separated EOM and six TA SP cell preparations were used for microarray analysis using the AffymetrixÂ® Mouse 430 ver 2.0 GeneChip arrays.
