TITLE
Gene expression-based dentification of microRNA-9-3 target genes in breast epithelial cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In current study, DES could effectively suppress the expression of miR-9-3 through the ERa-dependent epigenetic machinery in MDECs and MCF-7 cells. We want to figure out the biological significance and the potential targets of miR-9-3 and the related signaling cascades.

DESIGN
MCF-7 cells were transfected with two pre-designed maturated mimics of miR-9-3, miR-9 and miR-9*. After 48hr of transfection, total RNA was collected for gene expression analysis to figure out the potential targets of miR-9-3.
