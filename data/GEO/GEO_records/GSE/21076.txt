TITLE
Arabidopsis thaliana/Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis compatible interaction transcriptome

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
We used Arabidopsis full-genome microarrays to characterize plant transcript accumulations at different stages of infection with the biotrophic oomycete downy mildew pathogen, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis : initiation  ( < 1 dpi) and maintenance of infection ( > 4 dpi).

DESIGN
In two independent experiments, cotyledons from the ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) were inoculated with water, or with Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis to establish a compatible interaction. Affymetrix  ATH1 microarrays were used to profile Arabidopsis transcript accumulations at the initiation (mixed samples at 8 and 24 hours post inoculation, hpi; early stage) and maintenance (mixed samples at 4 and 6 days post inoculation; late stage) of the compatible interaction.
