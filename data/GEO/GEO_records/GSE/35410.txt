TITLE
Gene expression divergence in experimentally evolved Drosophila pseudoobscura females

ORGANISM
Drosophila pseudoobscura

SUMMARY
We used experimentally evolved Drosophila pseudoobscura females, who have experienced either enforced monogamy or increased polyandry for 100 generations, to assess divergence in their transcriptomic response to both mating system variation and mating experience.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured from 5-days old females from two experimentally evolved lines (M=monogamous, P=elevated polyandrous). We measured gene expression of females from each of the two selection lines 24h-h after mating with either M or with P males, or as virgins. The same design was repeated for two replicate selection lines per treatment, and within each we obtained three independent biological replicates per treatment category.
