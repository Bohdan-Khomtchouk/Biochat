TITLE
CCR2+ vs. CCR2- murine hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of FACS-sorted CCR2- and CCR2+ HSC in the steady state. CCR2+ HSC have fourfold higher proliferative rates than CCR2- HSC, are are biased towards the myeloid lineage and dominate the migratory HSC population.

DESIGN
Comparison of pooled CCR2- and CCR2+ HSC (bone marrow from 20 mice pooled for each sample), three biological replicates each.
