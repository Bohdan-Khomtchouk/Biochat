TITLE
Novel ABCG2 antagonists to reverse topotecan-mediated chemotherapeutic resistance in ovarian carcinoma xenografts.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to address the treatment difficulties associated with chemotherapetic resistance in ovarian cancer, we combined our compounds with topotecan and admininstered the mixture to chemoresistant Igrov1/T8 ovarian cancer cells in vitro and Igrov1/T8 xenografts in CB-17 SCID mice.

DESIGN
We ran 2 Parental Igrov1 ovarian cancer cells and 2 Igrov1 derived cell line overexpressing ABCG2, Igrov1/T8.
