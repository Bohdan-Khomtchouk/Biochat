TITLE
Gene expression data from Ldlr-/-, Apob100/100, Mttp flox/flox Mx1-Cre mice at different stages of atherosclerosis development

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles from the aortic arch of Ldlr-/-Apob100/100 Mttpflox/flox Mx1-Cre mice at different stages of atherosclerosis development

DESIGN
Total RNAs from the aortic arch were collected at different time points during atherosclerosis development (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 weeks of age), 4-7 mice per time point.
