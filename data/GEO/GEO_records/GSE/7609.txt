TITLE
Halobacterium NRC-1, EMS Stress Response

ORGANISM
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1

SUMMARY
100mM EMS was added to mid-log phase Halobacterium NRC-1 cultures. After constant stress of EMS for 30 minutes, cultures were spun down and pellets were re-suspended in same volume of GN101 media. Cultures were then harvested by centrifugation and pellets were snap frozen on a dry-ice ethanol bath. Samples for RNA preparation were collected during recovery time points at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 120 minutes. Keywords: stress response, dose response
