TITLE
Cyptophyte gene regulation in the kleptoplastidic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum

ORGANISM
Teleaulax amphioxeia ; Mesodinium rubrum

SUMMARY
Time series microarray analysis on the photosynthetic ciliate was conducted using an oligochip containing 15,654 genes designed from Teleaulax amphioxeia ESTs

DESIGN
To identify the gene expression patterns that occur during the sequesteration of the plastid, a total of 15,654 unique genes from cryptophyte were designed. Gene expression was compared in a free-living cryptophyte and in its sequestered state (in Mesodinium cells).

PLATFORM
GPL19881 Agilent-038578 Teleaulax Gene Expression 4 X 44K array (Probe name version)
