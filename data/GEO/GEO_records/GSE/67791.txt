TITLE
Epigenome analysis of liver tissues from Pemt-/- and Pemt+/+ under high fat-high sucrose (HFHS) diet

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of  liver tissues from Pemt-/- and Pemt+/+ under HFHS diets.

DESIGN
Pemt-/- and Pemt+/+ mice were fed HFHS from 5 to 25 weeks of age and liver tissues were obtained at 25 weeks. Bisulphite converted DNAs were enriched with EpiXplore Methylation DNA Enrichment Kit (Clontech). Genomic DNA libraries was prepared by TruSeq ChIP Sample Preparation Kit.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
