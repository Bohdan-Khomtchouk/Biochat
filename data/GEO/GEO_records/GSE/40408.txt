TITLE
Imperfect centered miRNA binding sites are common and can mediate functional repression of target mRNAs [microarray]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Whole transcriptome Identification of  direct targets identify a new class of miRNA::mRNA interactions.

DESIGN
HEK293T cells were transfected with biotinylated miRNAs. The miRNAs and target mRNA were pulled down with streptavidin and compared to a mock transfected control.
