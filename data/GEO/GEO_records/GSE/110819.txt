TITLE
Gene expression profile of Candida albicans SC5314 in response to sanguinarine exposure

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of Candida albicans comparing sanguinarine treated cells with untreated cells.

DESIGN
Wild type Candida albicans strain SC5314 was selected to perform the gene expression microarray. Two-condition experiment, DMSO treated cells vs. sanguinarine treated ones. Biological replicates: 3 control treated with DMSO, 3 sanguinarine treated, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.

PLATFORM
GPL9728 28K Candida albicans Genome Array
