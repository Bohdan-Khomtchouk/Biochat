TITLE
Generation of low passage high grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines from primary tumors

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSC) are deadly malignancies that relapse despite carboplatin chemotherapy.  Many commercially ovarian cancer cell lines are not good models for HGSC. Here we demonstrate that 3 low passage cell lines derived from HGSC have similar transcriptomes to their parental bulk tumors. These cell lines recapitulated tumor characteristics of the primary cancer and had responded to therapy in the same manner as primary HGSC cells, demonstrating they are accurate models for HGSCs.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of low passage high grade serous tumor cell lines and their parental tumors, generated by next generation sequencing, were compared.
