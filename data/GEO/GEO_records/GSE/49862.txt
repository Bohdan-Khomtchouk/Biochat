TITLE
Gene expression profile of oncogenic Ras-induced senescence in normal human diploid fibroblasts.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of normal human diploid fibroblasts(TIG-3) comparing empty vector transducted cells with RasV12 transducted cells.

DESIGN
TIG-3 cells were subjected to infection with retrovirus encoding RasV12 or empty vector. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent and were analyzed using the human 3D-Gene DNA chip (Toray) that contains 25000 genes. The genome wide transcriptional resp
