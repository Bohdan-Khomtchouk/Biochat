TITLE
DCLK1 Marks a Morphologically Distinct Subpopulation of Cells with Stem Cell Properties in Pre-invasive Pancreatic Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As in other tumor types, progression of pancreatic cancer may require a functionally unique population of cancer stem cells. Although such cells have been identified in many invasive cancers, is not clear whether they emerge during early or late stages of tumorigenesis. Using mouse models and human pancreatic cancer cell lines, we investigated whether pre-invasive pancreatic neoplasia contains a subpopulation of cells with distinct morphologies and cancer stem cell like properties. Whole transcriptome anlaysis of AcTub Hi vs AcTub Low cells. Cells were labeled with an acetylated alpha tubulin antibody that recognized epitopes on the cell surface (AAT+).  AcTub Hi vs Low cells were FACS sorted from the human pancreatic cancer cell lines CFPAC and AsPC1

DESIGN
CFPAC and AsPC1 cells were labeling with AcTub (acetylated alpha tubulin antibody) and then FACS sorted based on high or low levels of AcTub, and microarray analyses were run on biological replicates.
