TITLE
Yeast background with high-concentration spikes

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Microarray measurements are susceptible to error caused by cross-hybridization and bulk hybridization. To characterize the effect of these off-target interactions, we analyzed samples made from baseline (S. cerevisiae) alone or mixed with a high-concentration 1kb spike. The spike is a 1 kb sequence amplified from the Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene SPAC27D7.10c, with an added oligo(dT)-T7 promoter. The baseline and spike samples were mixed at the double-stranded cDNA stage.

DESIGN
Three arrays: 100% baseline, 99% baseline + 1% spike, 90% baseline + 10% spike. There are no replicates.
