TITLE
Gene Expression of Kidney from HSRA-S (congenital solitary kidney) and HSRA-C (two-kidney) using  Rat Gene 1.1 ST Array [RaGene-1_1-st]

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
We recently developed a new model of renal agenesis [i.e., the heterogeneous stock derived model of unilateral renal agenesis, (HSRA)]. The HSRA model consistently exhibits unilateral renal agenesis ranging from 50-75% in each generation and is characterized by low nephron number, early kidney hypertrophy, and an inherent susceptibility to develop significant kidney injury and decline in renal function with age. Whole transcriptome analysis was evaluated at month 1 to identify early changes in genes/networks that may be involved in increased susceptibility of HSRA-S to develop kidney injury in the long-term.

DESIGN
An n=4 per group (independent samples) were evaluated for HSRA-S (congenital solitary kidney) and HSRA-C (two-kidney). HSRA-C (two-kidney) samples were set as the control.
