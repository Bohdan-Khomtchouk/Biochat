TITLE
RNAPol2 accounts for tumor cells liability to JQ1 [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We here use B-cell tumors as a model to address the mechanism of action of JQ1, a widely used BET inhibitor.

DESIGN
Examination of transcription factor chromatin binding sites and histone marks in RAJI cells upon JQ1 treatment Please note that only a graphical output (i.e. an enrichment plot over genes) was generated using raw BAM files for the following samples (i.e. no processed data file); Pol2SerP2_DMSO_ChIP Pol2SerP5_DMSO_ChIP Pol2SerP2_JQ1_ChIP Pol2SerP5_JQ1_ChIP Raji_ChIPSeq_Pol2_JQ1_6h

PLATFORM
