TITLE
Alzheimer's Disease Dataset

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This dataset contains microarray data from normal controls (aged 20-99 yrs) and Alzheimer's disease cases, from 4 brain regions: hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, superior frontal cortex, post-central gyrus.   Changes in expression of synaptic and immune related genes were analyzed, investigating age-related changes and AD-related changes, and  region-specific patterns of change. These AD cases were processed simultaneously with the control cases (young and aged) included in GSE11882 (GSE11882 dataset contains data exclusively from normal control brains).

DESIGN
Postmortem brain tissue was collected from ADRC brain banks. Cases were preferentially selected where 3 or more brain regions were available.  Cases labeled " indiv " refers to normal controls (young and aged), and AD cases are labeled " AD " .  These AD cases were processed simultaneously with the control cases (young and aged) included in GSE11882 (GSE11882 dataset contains data exclusively from normal control brains).
