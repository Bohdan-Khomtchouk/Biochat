TITLE
Tenascin-C modifies expression levels and territories of key patterning genes during spinal cord astrocyte specification [mus musculus]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We demonstrate for the first time that the extracellular matrix glycoprotein Tenascin-C regulates the expression of key patterning genes during late embryonic spinal cord development, leading to a timely maturation of gliogenic neural precursor cells. We first show that Tenascin-C is expressed by gliogenic neural precursor cells during late embryonic development. The loss of Tenascin-C leads to a sustained generation and delayed migration of Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 expressing immature astrocytes in vivo. Furthermore, we could demonstrate an upregulation of Nk2 transcription factor related locus 2 (Nkx2.2) and its downstream target Sulfatase 1 in vivo. A dorsal expansion of Nkx2.2-positive cells within the ventral spinal cord indicates a potential progenitor cell domain shift. Moreover, Sulfatase 1 is known to regulate growth factor signalling by cleaving sulphate residues from heparan sulphate proteoglycans. Consistent with this possibility we observed changes in both Fibroblast growth factor 2 and Epidermal growth factor responsiveness of spinal cord neural precursor cells. Taken together our data clearly show that Tenascin-C promotes the astroglial lineage progression during spinal cord development.
