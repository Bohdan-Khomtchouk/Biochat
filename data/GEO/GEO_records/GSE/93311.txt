TITLE
Brain gene expression data from High Drinking in the Dark (HDID) and HS/Npt control mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a complex psychiatric disorder with strong genetic as well as environmental risk factors. One risk factor for developing AUD is binge drinking. High Drinking in the Dark mice (HDID-1) have been selectively bred from genetically heterogeneous mice (HS/Npt stock) for attaining high blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) after a 4-hour drinking session in which a single bottle containing 20% ethanol is available and serve as a genetic model of binge drinking. To discover molecular mechanisms underlying the genetic predisposition to binge drinking, we characterized global gene expression in 7 brain regions across the addiction neurocircuit, precisely excised using laser capture microdissection from male, ethanol-naive HDID-1 and control mice Brain regions included in the analysis are prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens core (AcbC), nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), basolateral amygdala (BLA), central amygdala (CeA), and ventral tegmental area (VTA)

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from 7 brain areas implicated in addiction processes of male naïve HDID mice were compared to the same brain areas of male naïve HS/Npt control mice
