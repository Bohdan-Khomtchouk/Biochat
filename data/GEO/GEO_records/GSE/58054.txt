TITLE
Ssn6, a new regulator of white-opaque switching in Candida albicans

ORGANISM
Candida albicans

SUMMARY
The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans can switch between two phenotypic cell types, termed “white” and “opaque.” Both cell types are heritable for many generations, and the switch between the two types occurs epigenetically, that is, without a change in the DNA sequence of the genome. In this work we describe that SSN6,  the C. albicans functional homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cyc8, is a regulator of the white-opaque switch. Chromatin IP's were performed using the protocol described by Hernday et al (Methods Enzymol. 2010;470:737-58. ).  Briefly, log phase cultures were crosslinked with formaldehyde prior to cell lysis, chromatin shearing, and transcription-factor immunoprecipitation.  Recovered DNA was amplified, dye-coupled, and competitively hybridized to a 244k-probe tiling array with a non-enriched genomic DNA reference.

DESIGN
Immunoprecipitated chromatin was hybridized against a non-enriched genomic DNA reference to identify transcription-factor binding sites
