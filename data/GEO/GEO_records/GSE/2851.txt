TITLE
Resistant response of leaves of upland cotton line Im216 to Xanthomonas campestris pv. malvacearum race 1

ORGANISM
Gossypium hirsutum

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of upland cotton line Im216 to inoculation with Xanthomonas campestris pv. malvacearum race 1. Fifth or sixth leaves of the bacterial blight-resistant cotton line Im216, which had been grown in a plant growth chamber, were infiltrated with a suspension of about 5x10^6 colony-forming units ml^-1 of Xanthomonas campestris pv. malvacearum race 1 in sterile saturated CaCO3 solution or were not inoculated (control).
