TITLE
Expression profile of Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells after Vismodegib treatment

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A cDNA microarray was performed to identify pathways differentially regulated between untreated and Vismodegib-treated cells.

DESIGN
Three RMS cell lines were analyzed: RD, RH4 and RH30. Cells were treated for 48 hours with 50ÂµM Vismodegib and total RNA was extracted. Control plates were treated with equal volumes of vehicle (DMSO). A total of six samples were analyzed in this study.
