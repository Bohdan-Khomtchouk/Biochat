TITLE
Early postnatal expression data from mouse skeletal muscle stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Satellite cells are the primary source of stem cells for skeletal muscle growth and regeneration. Since adult stem cell maintenance involves a fine balance between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, we performed genome-wide chronological expression profiling to identify the transcriptomic changes involved during early postnatal growth till acquisition of satellite cell quiescence.

DESIGN
Muscle samples were isolated from the trunk of Pax3GFP/+ mice. After digestion, GFP cells were purified via FACS and process for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays). The different ages selected for sample isolation were P1-P12-P28 (P, postnatal days), covering proliferant and quiescent satellite cells. The three stages were done in triplicate for P28 and 4 times for P1-P12, so 11 samples included in the microarray.
