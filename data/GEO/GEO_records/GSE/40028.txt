TITLE
The genomic foundation of heterotrophy to photoautotrophy transition in Oleaginous Chlorella

ORGANISM
Auxenochlorella pyrenoidosa

SUMMARY
The understanding of molecular events occurring in Chlorella during heterotrophy to photoautotrophy transition as well as sudden light stress and glucose starvation, are still largely unknown. To well grasp its cellular metabolism, particularly the regulation of biosynthesis and degradation pathways of lipid, protein and carbohydrates, as well as the diverse trophic adaptation affecting carbon partitioning during heterotrophy to photoautotrophy transition process, we sequenced the transcriptome (RNA-seq) in six time points to discover how transcriptional changes in C. pyrenoidosa modulate metabolic flux trends leading to intracellular components dynamic reassortment.

DESIGN
Three independent biological experiments (biological replicates) were carried out in the same batch. In total, eighteen samples collected at six time points (0-, 24-, 72-h from heterotrophic cells and 2-, 8-, 24-h from phototrophic cells) were used for mRNA-Seq library preparation and then submitted to Solexa GA-IIx (Illumina, USA) for sequencing.
