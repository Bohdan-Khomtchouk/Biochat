TITLE
Transcriptome response of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exposed to inorganic or methylmercury

ORGANISM
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

SUMMARY
This study aims at investigating the link between internalized inorganic or methyl Hg and the global expression of genes, obtained by high-throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq), in the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Algal cells were exposed two hours in a simplified artificial medium spiked with series of inorganic Hg concentrations (0.1, 1, 100 nM Hg) or series of methyl Hg concentrations (0.05, 0.5, 5, 50 nM CH3Hg).

DESIGN
Three biological replicates were assessed for each of the 8 tested conditions: Control, 3 Hg concentrations, 4 CH3Hg concentrations.
