TITLE
Molecular characterization of Georgia cohort of primary breast cancer FFPE tissues on custom breast cancer DASL panel

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of 143 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary breast tumors using a Custom Breast Cancer Panel and Human Cancer Panel for the DASL platform. Molecular markers between the pathology defined subtypes of breast cancer were assessed to hypothesize potential therapeutic targets specific to the subtypes

DESIGN
Molecular Characterization of 143 primary breast carcinomas including 101 triple negative (TN: ER-, PR-, HER2-), 3 HER2-positive (HER2+: ER-, PR-, HER2+), and 39 hormone receptor-positive (HR+: ER+ and/or PR+)

PLATFORM
GPL9006 Emory University Custom Breast Cancer DASL Panel
