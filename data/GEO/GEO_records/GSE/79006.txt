TITLE
miRNA profiling in primary human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) and TGF-β1-stimulated

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TORAY microarray assays were performed on HPMCs derived from four independent donors. miRNA expression was measured in control samples and after 1 ng/ml of TGF-β1 treatment for 48 h. TGF-β1-driven mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT) was confirmed in all samples by analysis of the eight molecular markers previously described (data not shown). A total of 1 μg in a volume of ≤2 μl of total RNA from each sample was subsequently used for Toray microarray analysis, performed by Central Biotechnology Services at Cardiff University.
