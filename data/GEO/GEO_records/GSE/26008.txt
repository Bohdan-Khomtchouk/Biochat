TITLE
Non-Biological Variability Study

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Assessment of sources of non-biological (technical) variability in the processing of RNA samples and gene chips during microarray analysis. The purpose of this experiment was to measure technical variability in microarray data introduced by various steps in preparation of the RNA, amplification/labeling of the RNA and hybridization of the sample to the arrays on separate days. The experimental design utilized a single tissue source - homogenized brain tissue pooled from 3 eight week old male C57/Bl mice.
