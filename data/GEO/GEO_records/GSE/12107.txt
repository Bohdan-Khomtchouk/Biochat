TITLE
N-isobutyl-decanamide (decanamide) treatment: Control vs. 60 uM treatment

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of 6 days-old Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 seedlings transfered to alkamide decanamide-containing medium in a 1, 3, 7 and 14 d time course period. Keywords: Pharmacological

DESIGN
A dye balanced modified loop design was implemented. Four biological replicates representing each sampling point were obtained by pooling in a 1:1 proportion shoot and root purified RNA from 120 randomly chosen seedlings. This experiment involved a total of sixteen sets of microarray hybridizations, including direct and dye swap comparisons between treatments as well as across time points for the same treatment. This design allowed us to determine differences in gene expression between N-isobutyl decanamide-treated and control seedlings, and whether the differences were time dependent.
