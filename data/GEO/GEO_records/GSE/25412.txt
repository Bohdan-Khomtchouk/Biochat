TITLE
Resveratrol induces downregulation of DNA repair genes in MCF7 human breast cancer cells.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Breast cancer is a worlwide health problem. One of the factors involved in carcinogenesis is diet. Several studies indicate that resveratrol, a polyphenol present in diet, has several antitumor properties. The purpose of the study is gain an insight of resveratrol effect in cancer by determining the gene expression profile of breast cancer cell lines treated with the compound.

DESIGN
MCF7 cell lines were treated for a 48 hour period with two concentrations (150 and 250 uM) of resveratrol. 9 plates were used for each condition. The RNA obtained from 3 plates of the same condition was pooled, processed and hybridized to the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array. The arrays were analyzed using Partek Genomics suite software-.
