TITLE
Differential gene regulation and tumor inhibitory activities of alpha-, delta- and gamma-tocopherols in estrogen-mediated mammary carcinogenesis

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Purpose: Examination of different forms of tocopherol treatment in mammary tumorigenesis by comparing NGS-derived transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) Methods: Use of cDNA library construction and Illumina sequencing (NextGen 75 bp pair-end) and quality control using FastQC. Results: Differential transcriptome profiling of mammary tumors between different forms of tocopherol treatment was observed. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of mammary tumor transcriptomes with different tocopherol treatment generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles with tocopherols.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of mammary tumors from ACI rats treated with different tocopherols for 30 weeks were generated by cDNA library construction/illumina sequencing

PLATFORM
GPL20084 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Rattus norvegicus)
