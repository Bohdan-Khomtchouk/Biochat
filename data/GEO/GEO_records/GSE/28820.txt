TITLE
Expression profile analysis of Drosophila melanogaster embryonic and larval MANF mutants together with paternal rescue and overexpression conditions

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
To find out possible pathways and processes influenced by DmMANF we  compared the changes in MANF null and overexpressing animals. We used two developmental stages of Drosophila, st 17 embryos and 29-50 hrs after egg laying (AEL) larvae. The timing were decided according to the lethality of MANF mutants with or without maternal contribution of MANF. Maternal and zygotic MANF mutants (MANFmzD96) were compared to paternal rescue and wild type embryos of the same age. Zygotic MANF mutants (MANFD96) with maternal contribution were compared to wild type and MANF ectopic overexpression larvae harvested well before the average lethality occured (75 hrs AEL). The changes in expression profiles were more drastic in MANFmzD96 embryos than in MANFD96 larvae. Gene ontology annotations were analyzed and clustered by DAVID. The major result was alterations in  membranes, changes in membrane transporter expressions and disturbed intracellular membrane traffic. The results were verified by qPCR and transmission electron microscopy.

DESIGN
Two developmental stages - 21-24 hrs and 29-50 hrs AEL of MANFD96 mutants without and with maternal contribution were compared to wild type (Wmix means crossed w1118 x w- ) and with paternal rescue or ectopic overexpression of MANF respectively by Drosophila Agilent microarray expression platform.
