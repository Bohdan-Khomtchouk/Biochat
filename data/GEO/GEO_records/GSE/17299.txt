SUMMARY
IFNα-mediated gene expression pattern. Direct effects of IFNα on human CD8 T cells without any other concomitant signal. This analysis examined the direct effects of IFNa on human CD8 T cells without any other concomitant signal. Total human CD8 T cells were magnetically sorted from peripheral blood by negative selection. In order to minimize the presence of antigen-experienced cells, total human CD8 T cells were depleted of CD45RO+ cells by labelling with anti-CD45RO magnetic bead. In both steps of cellular sorting, negative selection were preferred to positive selection to avoid direct labelling of CD8 T cell surface molecules could interfere with downstream IFNa-mediated signalling. Magnetically sorted untouched human CD8+CD45R0- T cells from three different donors were unstimulated or stimulated with IFNa2b or IFNa5 and cells were harvested 7 hours later. mRNAs from the 3 subjects were pooled and analyzed using Affymetrix human HG-U133A 2.0 array gene chips Fold-change ≥ 2 criterion was used to identify genes which expression differed between treatment and control (unstimulated cells). Keywords: Gene expression pattern analysis

DESIGN
Magnetically sorted untouched CD8+CD45R0-T cells mRNA pooled sample from three different donors unstimulated or stimulated with IFN alfa 2b or IFN alfa 5 for 7 hours.
