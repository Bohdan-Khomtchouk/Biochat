Differential expression of genes in pancreatic islets from high fat fed AKR/J and C57Bl/6J

SUMMARY
Increased fat intake is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. In some individuals, a failure of pancreatic b-cells to increase insulin production in response to the high demands of obesity leads to diabetes. We sought to determine whether the impaired b- cell adaptation in obesity is associated with differential expression of genes involved in b-cell expansion and intermediary metabolism. Two strains of inbred mice prone to obesity, C57Bl/6J and AKR/J, were fed regular rodent chow or high-fat diet, after which islet morphology, secretory function and gene expression were assessed. AKR/J had lower blood glucose and higher insulin levels compared with C57Bl/6J mice on regular rodent chow or high fat diet. Insulin secretion was 3.2 fold higher in AKR/J than C57Bl/6J mice following intraperitoneal glucose injection. Likewise, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated islets was higher in AKR/J. Additionally, islet mass was 1.4 fold greater in AKR/J compared with C57Bl/6J. To elucidate the factors associated with the differences in insulin, we analyzed the gene expression profiles in pancreatic islets in AKR/J and C57Bl/6J mice. Of 14,000 genes examined, 220 were up-regulated and 286 were down-regulated in islets from diet-induced obese AKR/J mice compared with C57Bl/6J mice. Key genes involved in islet signaling and metabolism, e.g. glucagon like peptide-1 receptor, sterol Co-A desaturase 1 & 2 and fatty acid desaturase 2 were upregulated in obese AKR/J mice. The expression of multiple extracellular matrix proteins was also increased in AKR/J mice, suggesting a role in modulation of islet mass. Functional analyses of differentially regulated genes hold promise for elucidating factors linking obesity to alterations in islet function. Keywords: response to high fat diet
