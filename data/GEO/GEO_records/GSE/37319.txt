TITLE
Expression data of CD44loCD8+ T cells from sanroque versus wild-type mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to detect the primary changes caused by the 'san' mutation in Roquin gene by comparing the gene expression profiles of naive (CD44lo) CD8+ T cell population.

DESIGN
Sorted CD44loCD8+ T cells of age-matched sanroque (Roquinsan/san) and wild-type (Roquin+/+) mice in C57BL/6 background were subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
