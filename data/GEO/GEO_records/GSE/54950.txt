TITLE
The systematic shortening of 3’ UTRs has limited influence on the relative change in protein abundance in proliferating cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Alternative polyadenylation is an important cellular mechanism that enables generation of  mRNA isoforms that differ in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) and consequently in their susceptibility to miRNA and RNA binding protein mediated regulation. A dramatic change in polyadenylation site usage, leading to the systematic expression of short 3’ UTR isoforms is known to occur upon induction of proliferation in resting cells. To understand the functional consequences of short 3’ UTR isoform expression we used 3' end sequencing and quantitative mass spectroscopy to determine polyadenylation site use, mRNA and protein levels in murine and human naive and activated T cells. We found that while the process and its impact on the susceptibility to miRNA and RNA binding protein mediated regulation are evolutionarily conserved, the conservation is poor at the level of individual orthologous genes. Contrary to the common belief, we did not find that transcriptome-wide 3' UTR shortening leads to a matched increase in mRNA and protein levels of genes with tandem polyadenylation sites.

DESIGN
3' ends of transcripts were profiled by high-throughput sequencing in murine and human naive and activated T cells.
