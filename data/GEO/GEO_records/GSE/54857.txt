TITLE
Whole genome profiling of whole liver lysates of vehicle and Sorafenib-treated iAST mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of changes in gene expression upon Sorafenib treatment. Looking for candidates, that could potentially be up- or down-regulated upon Sorefanib treatment.

DESIGN
Total RNA were optained from whole liver lysates of vehicle 14d-, Sorafenib 14d- and LT Sorafenib-treated iAST mice
