TITLE
Comparative gene expression analysis between Nipponbare and 6-4 under two conditions

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Nipponbare performs poorly in phosphorus (P) deficient soil whereas a Nipponbare-derived NIL containing the Pup1 allele of donor parent Kasalath is tolerant to P deficiency. In this experiment we compared gene expression patterns in roots of this NIL to Nipponbare, grown either in a P deficient or P fertilized soil. The aim is to separate constitutive differences in expression from those induced by P deficiency. Keywords: genotype comparison, constitutive differential expression

DESIGN
Total RNA was extrancted from root that were grown under two conditions and prepared three biological replicant in each line (total 6 samples in each line). We used 6 slides for this experiment, in each slide, Nipponbare and 6-4 samples grown under same condition were hybridized.
