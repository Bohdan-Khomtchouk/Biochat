TITLE
Right ventricular failure due to pulmonary banding

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Right ventricular failure was induced thourgh pulmonary banding in 11 pigs. Right ventricular failure was defined as a SRVP > 50 mmHg during two hours. After right ventricular failure was induced, half the pigs were treated with a Glenn-shunt combined with pulmonary banding for one hour, and the other half served as control group with pulmonary banding only. The aim was to study the change in global gene expression during right ventricular failure due to pulmonary banding, and the effect of volume unloading during pulmonary banding.

DESIGN
11 pigs. Samples at the following time periods: 1) Baseline 2) Right ventricular failure 3) Treatment with modified Glenn-shunt/Control. After Right ventricular failure, pigs were randomized into two groups a) Treatment with modified Glenn-shunt or b) Control group
