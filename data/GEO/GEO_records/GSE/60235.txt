TITLE
Expression data measured by microarray of CD4+ T cells from healthy individuals stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
This SubSeries in the ImmVar project investigates the response of selected genes in T cells from healthy human individuals to ascertain the impact of genetic or non-genetic variation on T cell activation parameters. We measured gene expression from resting and activated CD4+ T cells derived from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals. We activated the primary T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 beads alone or with IFNb or Th17 polarizing cytokines.

DESIGN
We collected peripheral blood from each human donor. We isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells by Ficoll, and negatively selected for CD4+ T cells using RosettaSep. We then either left cells unstimulated or stimulated them with beads conjugated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Cells from 15 individuals were harvested at up to 5 conditions, lysed and RNA isolated to be profiled on microarray.
