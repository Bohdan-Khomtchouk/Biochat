TITLE
The functions of m6A and Ythdf2 during zebrafish early development

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report the m6A methylation maps of zebrafish embryos during early development, and transcriptome-wide changes occured in ythdf2 LOF mutant embryos. Our study reveals the m6A-dependent RNA decay as a previously unidentified maternal mode mechanism to regulate maternal mRNA clearance during zebrafish   MZT, highlighting the critical role of the m6A mRNA methylation in animal development.

DESIGN
m6A-seq of mRNA from zebrafish embryos at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 h.p.f.; mRNA-seq of wild-type and maternal ythdf2-null mutant embryos at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 h.p.f.; mRNA-seq of embryos injected with control or ythdf2-MO at 4 h.p.f.; mRNA-seq of wild-type and maternal-zygotic ythdf2-null mutant embryos at 6, 8, 12, 24 h.p.f; and mRNA-seq of wild-type and maternal ythdf2-null mutant embryos injected with control or ythdf2-MO at 24, 36, 48 h.p.f. Replicate of each seq is also included.
