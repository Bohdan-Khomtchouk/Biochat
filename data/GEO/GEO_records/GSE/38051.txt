TITLE
Neisseria meningitidis strain MC58 and α522 grown in PPM+ and exposed to human saliva, human whole blood and human cerebrospinal fluid

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Differences in the transcriptional profile of the menigococcal strains MC58 and α710 were compared upon growth in PPM+ and on exposure to human saliva, whole blood and cerebrospinal fluid

DESIGN
Common reference design, MC58 and α522 grown in PPM+ and exposed to human saliva, whole blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Aliquots from the individual samples made the common reference pool. Three replicates per array.
