TITLE
Expression data from highly efficient polycystic kidney disease cystogenesis in kidney organoids derived from CRISPR-mutant human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Computational identification of gene expression pathways in cysts alongside tubular organoids

DESIGN
Using Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Arrays, the global gene profiling of seven paired samples (cysts and remnant tubules from the same organoid) at 71-87 days was performed

PLATFORM
GPL16686 [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
