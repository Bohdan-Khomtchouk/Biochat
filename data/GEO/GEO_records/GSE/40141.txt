TITLE
α-catulin play a role in lung cancer metastasis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Background: α-catulin may functions as an oncoprotein, sustaining proliferation by preventing cellular senescence and promoting cancer cell migration. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of α-catulin in cancer cell migration and metastasis in lung cancer. Method: α-catulin mRNA expression was isolated from A549/AS2neo (control) and A549/AS2neo-α-catulin stable cells. The Phalanx Human OneArray microarray analysis was performed to identify α-catulin downstream genes. Results: Overexpression of α-catulin increased cancer cell migration and metastasis. By using Phalanx Human OneArray microarray we have identified panel of genes altered by α-catulin overexpression, consisting of CDC42, intergrins and genes related to cytoskeleton remodeling. Conclusion: α-catulin is an oncoprotein and promotes lung cancer cell migration and metastasis.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, Vector vs. alpha-catulin overexpression cells.The cDNAs encoding full-length human alpha-catulin were amplified and subcloned into lentiviral pLKO_AS2.neo which generated full-length alpha-catulin. Vector control or alpha-catulin lentivirus were transduced into A549 cells and G418 was used to select stable cells.
