TITLE
MicroRNA expression profiling analysis on a group of 52 heredo-familial and sporadic breast cancer samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, using microarray technology we did a transcriptome profiling of miRNAs on a group of 52 cases of familial (BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutated, or BRCAX, i.e. familial cases with no mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes) and sporadic breast cancers. Class comparison of different clinical characteristics of the samples identified miR-342 as the miRNA with the most significant association with estrogen receptor (ER) status (categorised as positive and negative) of the samples analysed. As ER is one of the bio-pathological features currently used in routine clinical practice to aid treatment decision in breast cancer, identification of this miRNA has been promising for finding new mechanisms involved in this tumour type as we had next demonstrated in a cellular model of breast cancer.

DESIGN
In the study presented here, microRNAs expression profiling on a well defined cohort of 52 breast cancer cases, followed up for more than 5 years, was used for a class comparison analysis with some relevant clinical characteristics of this tumour type like estrogen, progesterone or epidermal growth factor 2 receptor status.
