TITLE
Expression data from synovium, bone marrow and nucleus pulposus

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Synovial and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells after intradiscally injection show regenerative effects of nucleus pulposus. Microarray analyses of rats were performed to investigate the closeness of the gene profiles between the nucleus pulposus cells and the synovial or bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. To investigate interaction between synovial mesenchymal stem cells and nucleus pulposus cells, human synovial mesenchymal stem cells and rat nucleus pulposus cells were co-cultured, and species specific microarray were performed.

DESIGN
Synovium of knee joints, bone marrow and nucleus pulposus were harvested from rat or human, and cells were isolated for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To compare the gene profiles each other, isolated cells were mono-cultured respectively, and human synovial mesenchymal stem cells and rat nucleus pulposus cells were co-cultured.
