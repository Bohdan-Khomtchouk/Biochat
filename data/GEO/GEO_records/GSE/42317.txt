TITLE
Transcriptional profiling of swine lung and hilar node after experimental infection with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
This study aimed at: (1) Establishing the pleuropneumoniae pathological model of artificial infection; (2) Using the Agilent swine genome-wide microarray containing 43,603 probes to detect the changes in gene expression of infected pigs’ lungs and hilar nodes.

DESIGN
Infection induced gene expression in swine lung and hilar node were measured at 48 hours after being inoculated with 1 mL containing 3.8 × 10^7 cfu/mL pleuropneumoniae serotype I by atomizing inhalation in each nostril.

PLATFORM
GPL10162 Agilent-020109 Porcine Gene Expression Microarray (44K) (Probe Name version)
