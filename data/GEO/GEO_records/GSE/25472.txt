TITLE
Gene expression of LNCaP human prostate cells by cholesterol diet

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Understanding the systemic regulation of normal prostate gene expression by cholesterol diet is critical for deciphering the mechanisms responsible for the transition from healthy to pathogenic prostate conditions. To understand mechanism under cholesterol effect on prostate, we performed microarray analysis using LNCaP human prostate cells cultured in low cholesterol medium.

DESIGN
The RNA is obtained from LNCaP human prostate cells serum-starved for 0h, 3h, 16h followed by CLM medium.
