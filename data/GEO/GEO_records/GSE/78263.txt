TITLE
The gene expression landscape of pine seedling tissues.

ORGANISM
Pinus pinaster

SUMMARY
Gene expression analysis of the different tissues of one month old seedlings or Pinus pinaster.

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis of the different tissues of one month old seedlings or Pinus pinaster. The tissue samples were isolated through Laser Capture Microdissection. The RNA was extracted and amplified using the CRA+ protocol (Ca√±as et al., 2014 Tree Physiol. 34:1278-1288). The cDNA was sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing in a GS-FLX+ platform.

PLATFORM
