TITLE
Changes in chromatin accessibility assocaiated with CD8 T cell responses to viral infections

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify the molecular programming using ATAC-seq of CD8 T cells responding to different viral infections.  Mice were infected with either LCMV Armstrong to model an acute infection or LCMV Clone-13 to model a chronic infection.  At various time points following infection, virus-specific CD8 T cells were purified and ATAC-seq performed.  These data identify the changes in chromatin accessibility associated with acute infections and the establishment of functional memory versus those accessibility changes associated with chronic infection.

DESIGN
ATAC-seq time course on CD8 T cells following either LCMV Armstrong and Clone13 infection.
