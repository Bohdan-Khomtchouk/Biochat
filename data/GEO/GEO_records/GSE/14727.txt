Hypoxia-driven alterations in the B16 melanoma cell transcriptome account for a higher metastatic potential

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Hypoxia-driven alterations in the B16 melanoma cell transcriptome account for a higher metastatic potential: evidence for a role of Ero1L We analyzed transcriptomic adaptations to hypoxia/reoxygenation in B16 melanoma cells. By Ero1L over- and down-expression in vivo, we identified this ER oxidase as an actor of tumor growth and metastasis take.

DESIGN
In vitro culture of B16 submitted to hypoxia (oxygen rate less than 1%)
