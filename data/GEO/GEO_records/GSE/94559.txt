TITLE
Hippocampus CA1 pyramidal cells Transcriptomic profile in WT and Fmr1 KO mice, using Wfs1-CreERT2:RiboTag:Frm1 knockout and wildtype mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparing WT mice to a mouse model of mental retardation, this work identifies genes which display differences in ribosome-bound mRNAs, in hippocampus CA1 pyramidal cells. These genes products are potent functional components of neuronal plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory.

DESIGN
Using a triple transgenic mouse line, we immunoprecipitated the HA-Rpl22 protein to isolate and sequence ribosome-associated mRNA in CA1 pyramidal cells. Pairwise comparison of wild type and Fmr1 KO mice defined a specific gene expression profile.
