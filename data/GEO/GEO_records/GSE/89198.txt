TITLE
BCL11B AND COMBINATORIAL RESOLUTION OF CELL FATE IN THE T-CELL GENE REGULATORY NETWORK

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the RNA-seq results from mouse T-cell precursors in different developmental stages including DN1, DN2a, DN2b, DN3 and DP in order to study the gene regulation network in T cell development.  Some of the samples also have certain kind of perturbations, such as Bcl11b knockout and the treatment of Notch signaling pathway inhibitor GSI, in order to study the roles of these factors in T cell development.

DESIGN
Examine the transcriptome of 47 mouse T-cell precursor samples from five developmental stages (DN1, DN2a, DN2b, DN3 and DP).  Among them, 19 have Bcl11b knockout and 4 have GSI treatment.
