TITLE
Caco-2 cells:  21-days differentiated cells maintained with the low density protocol (LD cells) vs 21-days differentiated cells maintained with the high density protocol (HD cells)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profile of 21-days differentiated LD Caco-2 cells compared to 21-days differentiated HD Caco-2 cells. Goal was to find some differences in the genome profile of the LD and HD Caco-2 cells that could be addressed to the different protocols used for the line maintenance.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment: 21-days differentiated Caco-2 cells maintained with the LD protocol and 21-days differentiated Caco-2 cells maintained with the HD protocol. Dye-swap technical replicates.

PLATFORM
GPL6480 Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (Probe Name version)
