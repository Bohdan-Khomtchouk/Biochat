TITLE
Global DNA methylation landscape reveals roles of DNA methylation involved in the regulation of drug metabolizing enzyme [III]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to elucidate the role of DNA methylation in the DME gene regulation, global DNA methylation and mRNA expression profiles of human tissues and cell lines were examinde by HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip and SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8Ã—60K v2. We demonstrated DNA methylation landscape of the DME genes in human tissues. Although a fraction of DME genes can be regulated by their DNA methylation, the variable DNA methylation status probably affects drug metabolism and response.

DESIGN
Bisulphite converted DNA from the 4 samples were hybridized to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Sample L and SI were examined twice).
