TITLE
Copy number alterations in 8 lung cancer in Xuanwei samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to screen potential novel 'driver genes' in lung cancer in Xuanwei (LCXW), genome-wide DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) were detected on 8 paired LCXW and non-cancerous lung (NCL) tissues by array-based comparative genomic hybridization microarrays. The log2 copy-number ratio calculation and CNA calls were determined using segMNT algorithm in NimbleScan. Log2 ratio test/control thresholds of 0.25 and -0.25 were defined as copy number gains and losses, respectively. Deviant signal intensity ratios involving 5 or more neighboring probes were considered as genomic aberrations. A large number of CNAs and DEGs were detected, respectively. Many recurrent CNAs were screened out, including gains at 5p15.33-p15.32, 5p15.1-p14.3 and 5p14.3-p14.2, and losses at 11q24.3, 21q21.1, 21q22.12-q22.13 and 21q22.2.

DESIGN
8 paired LCXW and NCL tissues were tested.
