TITLE
Global analysis of the nuclear processing of unspliced U12-type introns by the exosome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
we analyzed globally the effect of exosome processing on the nuclear pre-mRNA transcripts by inactivating either the RRP41 or DIS3 subunit of the exosome. Using SOLiD RNA sequencing technology, we report 30-120 million mapped cellular compartment specific reads per sample allowing the detection of unspliced pre-mRNAs. We show that RRP41 and DIS3 knockdowns stabilize an overlapping set of U12-type introns.

DESIGN
Studying the global effect of the exosome (Rrp41 or Dis3 subunit) knockdown comparing to the control sample.
