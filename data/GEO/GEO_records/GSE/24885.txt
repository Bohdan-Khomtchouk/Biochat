TITLE
Role of microRNA-214-targeting PTEN in advanced glycation end product-induced apoptosis delay of monocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We studied genome-wide miRNA expression in THP-1 cells treated with/without AGEs. Significant upregulation of miR-214 was observed in THP-1 cells treated with/without AGEs.

DESIGN
Two samples, one treated with AGE-BSA and one without AGEs.
