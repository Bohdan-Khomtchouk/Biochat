TITLE
Expression data from human fetal lung normal diploid fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The interaction between cancer and stroma plays a key role in tumor progression. Inactivation of p53 is often observed in stromal cells surrounding in cancer, suggesting that p53 in fibroblasts is involved in tumor progression. To elucidate the mechanism by which p53 loss in fibroblasts effect on proliferation and invasiveness of cancer cells, we performed comprehensive expression profiling analyses between p53 knockdown and control fibroblasts using GeneChip Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays.

DESIGN
Intact human fetal lung normal diploid fibroblasts TIG-7 cells and TIG-7 cells infected with lentiviruses for the expression of shRNA against p53 were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
