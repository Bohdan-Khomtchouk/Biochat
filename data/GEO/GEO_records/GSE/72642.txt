TITLE
Genomic profiles for human peripheral blood T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, and polymorphonuclear cells: comparisons to ischemic stroke, migraine, and Tourette syndrome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Blood genomic profiling has been applied to disorders of the blood and various organ systems including brain to elucidate disease mechanisms and identify surrogate disease markers. Since most studies have not examined specific cell types, we performed a preliminary genomic survey of major blood cell types from normal individuals using microarrays. CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD56+ natural killer cells, and CD14+ monocytes were negatively selected using the RosetteSep antibody cocktail, while polymorphonuclear leukocytes were separated with density gradient media. Genes differentially expressed by each cell type were identified. To demonstrate the potential use of such cell subtype-specific genomic expression data, a number of the major genes previously reported to be regulated in ischemic stroke, migraine, and Tourette syndrome are shown to be associated with distinct cell populations in blood. These specific gene expression, cell-type-related profiles will need to be confirmed in larger data sets and could be used to study these and many other neurological diseases.

DESIGN
This study includes data from major blood cell types from normal individuals. These cell types include CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD56+ natural killer cells, CD14+ monocytes and PMN (polymorphonuclear cells). The data were hybridized on 3 separate batches of gene chips.
