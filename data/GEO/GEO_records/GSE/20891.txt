TITLE
SDF-1 induced transcriptional changes in human cord blood CD34+ cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling to identify genes differentially expressed in cord blood enriched CD34+ cells( > 95%) after a short-term exposure to the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1).

DESIGN
SDF-1 induced gene expressions of cord blood enriched CD34+ cells were measured at 4 hours. Four biological replicates were performed for each treatment group.
