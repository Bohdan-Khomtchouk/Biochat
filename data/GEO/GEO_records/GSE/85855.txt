TITLE
Whole transcriptome analysis of reaggregated embryoid bodies treated with IWR-1

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified distict mesodermal sub-populations based on Endoglin (Eng) and Flk1 expression in Brachyury (Bry) positive cells. By using whole-transcriptome analysis, we further characterized these populations and how they changed when Wnt pathway is inhibited

DESIGN
Reaggregates mRNA profiles of unsorted, Flk1+ Eng+, and Flk1- Eng+  samples were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate , using  Ilumina.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
