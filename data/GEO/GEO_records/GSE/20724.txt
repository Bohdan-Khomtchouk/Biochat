TITLE
Genome-wide expression analysis of mouse chromosome 2 in gonadal fat and liver tissues reveals a complex architecture of obesity

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcript abundance in adipose and liver tissues was used to map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) underlying fat accretion, weight gain and liver weight. Gonadal fat and liver tissues were used from 48 individuals F2 selected from a cohort (1,200 mice) originated from a cross between M16i and MB2 mice. A complex polygenic architecture within the MB2 locus was observed which was comprised of several locally regulated eQTL (cis-eQTL) with significant correlations to obesity traits.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated gonadal fat and liver tissues were used to mesured transcript abundance in order to detect expression QTLs.
