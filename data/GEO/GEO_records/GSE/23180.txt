TITLE
Expression data of LPS-stimulated bone marrow macrophages induced by M-CSF from wild-type and Jmjd3-/- mice.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Jmjd3 is critical for proper M2 macropahge inducution in response to M-CSF and showed defects in response to LPS. We used microarrays to examine gene expression profiles in wild-type and Jmjd3-/- M-CSF-derived macrophages.

DESIGN
Bone marrow macrophages induced by M-CSF from wild-type and Jmjd3-/- mice were stimulated with LPS for 4 hours, followed by RNA extraction. Then hybridization on affymetrix microarrays was performed.
