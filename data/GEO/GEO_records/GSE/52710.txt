TITLE
Time series expression data  following miR-9 inhibition

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A high-resolution time series study of transcriptome dynamics following antimiR--mediated inhibition of miR-9  in a Hodgkin lymphoma cell-line revealed both general and miR-9 specific aspects of the miRNA--mediated post--transcriptional dynamic response.MiR-9 inhibition induced a multiphasic gene response, with an initial direct response at approximately 4 hours and multiple later responses which showed transcription factor enrichments indicative of indirect causally downstream responses, and an overall shift of gene product function from predominantly mRNA processing at early time points to translation at later time points.

DESIGN
The full time course used was: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,26,32,40,56,80,112 hours post-miR-9 inhibition. Microarrays were Affymetrix HuGene-10-st-v1.   Each LNA-antimiR treated cell sample was matched with an LNA scramble control at each time point.  This overall time schedule was divided into two independent biological replicates: one covering early time points (2 hours to 20 hours), and another covering later time points (22 hours to 112 hours).
