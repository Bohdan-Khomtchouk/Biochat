TITLE
Expression data for resting and activated B and T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The IgH locus encodes for part of the antibody exposed by B cells and is important for the immune system. In B cells, one allele produces protein, the other must remain silenced. It was proposed that both alleles reside in different nuclear compartments and that this is important to maintain mono-allelic productivity. Here we challenge this concept. We provide detailed genome-wide contact maps, which show that IgH adopts different nuclear locations in immune versus other cells but also demonstrate that in B cells both alleles reside in the same environment. Nuclear positioning is therefore not important to maintain allelic exclusion. We did a gene expression analysis on resting (Day 0) and in vitro activated (Day 4) B and T cells in triplicate

DESIGN
Splenic B cells and T cells were separately isolated from spleen, using magnetic activated cell sorting, and activated in vitro for 4 days
