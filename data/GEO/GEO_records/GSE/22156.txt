TITLE
Suppression of TLR9-dependent gene expression in vivo mediated by TTAGGG motifs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Immunostimulatory CpG ODN trigger an innate immune response characterized by the rapid production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, an effect that persists for days to weeks in vivo. Previous studies established that gene up-regulation is maximal 3 hr after CpG ODN treatment of normal mice {Klaschik et al. JLB 2009}. The immunostimulatory activity of CpG ODN is blocked by the addition of immunosuppressive ODN expressing multiple TTAGGG motifs. To clarify the mechanism underlying this suppression, changes in gene expresssion were evaluated by microarray in mice treated with 400 ìg of CpG ODN + 400 ìg of suppressive ODN.

DESIGN
Data from 4 independent biological replicates/time point and treatment group and 6 untreated controls were used for all statistical analyses. A reference design was used. Reference cDNA vs. sample cDNA were hybridized to same array.
