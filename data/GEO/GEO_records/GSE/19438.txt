TITLE
Reference:  MicroRNA expression profiling in adult mouse liver following BaP treatment [Agilent miRNA array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have investigated the effect of exposure to 150 mg/kg benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) for 3 days on mRNA and miRNA expression levels in adult mouse liver. We used Agilent miRNA array platforms to assess effects of BaP exposure on miRNA expression levels. Our results indicate a distinct lack of effect of BaP of miRNA expression, despite widespread changes in mRNA levels. The data in the attached array files were used a positive control for the Agilent platform, to indicate that the platform was able to detect significant differences in abundance of miRNA between two samples with great differences in miRNA content. Keywords: Toxicology, miRNA
