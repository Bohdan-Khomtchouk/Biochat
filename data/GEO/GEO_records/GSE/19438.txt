TITLE
Reference:  MicroRNA expression profiling in adult mouse liver following BaP treatment [Agilent miRNA array]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have investigated the effect of exposure to 150 mg/kg benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) for 3 days on mRNA and miRNA expression levels in adult mouse liver. We used Agilent miRNA array platforms to assess effects of BaP exposure on miRNA expression levels. Our results indicate a distinct lack of effect of BaP of miRNA expression, despite widespread changes in mRNA levels. The data in the attached array files were used a positive control for the Agilent platform, to indicate that the platform was able to detect significant differences in abundance of miRNA between two samples with great differences in miRNA content. Keywords: Toxicology, miRNA

DESIGN
Two reference pools were created from commercially available reference RNA (FirstChoiceÂ® mouse Total RNA including the small fraction (Catalogue # AM7800-AM7828, Ambion, Streetsville, ON)). Reference #1 contained equal parts of mouse testicle, ovary and 10-12 day embryo. Reference #2 contained liver, heart and lung. These references were hybridized to a single mouse Agilent 8x15K miRNA array (4 replicates each), normalized by cyclic lowess and analysed with MAANOVA to find differences in the samples.One reference #1 sample was not included in the analysis because it did not pass Agilent quality control metrics.
