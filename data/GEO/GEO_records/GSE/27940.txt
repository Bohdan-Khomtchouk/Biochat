TITLE
Methylation detection Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis: high resolution method for CpG island methylation detection 3.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The identification of genetic and epigenetic alterations from primary tumor cells has become a common method to identify genes critical to the development and progression of cancer. We provide a bioinformatic analysis of copy number variation and DNA methylation covering the genetic landscape of ovarian cancer tumor cells. We individually examined the copy number variation and DNA methylation for 44 primary ovarian cancer samples and 7 ovarian normal samples using our MOMA-ROMA technology and Affymetrix expression data as well as 379 tumor samples analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas. We have identified 346 genes with significant deletions or amplifications among the tumor samples. Utilizing associated gene expression data we predict 156 genes with significantly altered copy number and correlated changes in expression. We identify changes in DNA methylation and expression for all amplified and deleted genes. We predicted 615 potential oncogenes and tumor suppressors candidates by integrating these multiple genomic and epigenetic data types.

DESIGN
We have developed a method to profile genome wide methylation. 7 ovarian normal samples and 44 tumor samples from other individuals were analyzed for CpG methylation. After inter array normalization, the tumor samples were taken together and the methylation compared to that of the normal samples to identify regions of the CpG islands that are significantly altered between the two datasets. Some of these regions were validated for their methylation as a proof of principle for the method. Kamalakaran S., et. al. Mol Oncol. 2011;5:77-92 (PMID: 21169070).
