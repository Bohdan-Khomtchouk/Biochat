TITLE
Genome wide RNA-seq analysis of E14.5 Smchd1 wild type and mutant placenta

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report the deregulation of expression in Fi (C57Bl6/J x FVB/n) E14.5 male mouse placenta are that homozygous for a mutant allele of the Smchd1 gene (ie Smchd1MommeD1/MommeD1).

DESIGN
RNA-seq analysis of Smchd1+/+ vs Smchd1MommeD1/MommeD1
