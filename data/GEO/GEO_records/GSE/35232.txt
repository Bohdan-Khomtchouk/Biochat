TITLE
Transcription profile of adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells separated by cell surface protein N-cadherin.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of most promising stem cell sources for regenerative medicine. MSCs have a differention ability into several tissues. However, their differentiation efficiency is considered quite limited. Especially, the differentiation efficiency into cardiomyocytes is very low. N-cadherin is one of the cell surface protein that is expressed in developing and adult cardiomyocytes. We found that cell surface expression of N-cadherin in MSCs shows good correlation with the cardiomyogenic differentiation ability. We also analyzed the expression profiles of N-cadherin-positive and N-cadherin-negative fraction by microarray. We found that N-cadherin-positive MSCs show higher expression of some of the cardiomyogenesis-related genes than N-cadherin-negative MSCs.

DESIGN
The ASCs were maintained in MesenPRO RSTM Medium. The ASCs were harvested in a cell dissociation buffer. The ASCs were incubated with biotinylated anti N-cadherin antibody and next incubated with streptavidin –APC. Subsequently cells were incubated with anti-APC microbeads. Immunomagnetic separation of N-cadherin+ cells were performed with autoMACSTMPro separator applying the separation program ‘depl025’
