TITLE
Yeast Membrane Bound Polysome

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Set of arrays organized by shared biological context, such as organism, tumors types, processes, etc. mRNA species bound to membrane-associated polysomes were separated from other mRNAs by sedimentation equilibrium or sedimentation velocity. The distribution of individual transcripts in the 'membrane-bound' and 'cytosolic' fractions was quantitated for thousands of genes by hybridization to DNA microarrays. Transcripts known to encode secreted or membrane proteins were enriched in the membrane-bound fractions, whereas those known to encode cytoplasmic proteins were enriched in the fractions containing mRNAs associated with free and cytoplasmic ribosomes. On this basis, we identified over 275 human genes and 285 yeast genes that are likely to encode previously unrecognized secreted or membrane proteins. Keywords: Logical Set
