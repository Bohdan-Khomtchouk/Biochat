TITLE
Effects of NIK activation on the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcriptome between control and NIK-activated hematopoietic stem cells

DESIGN
Mutant NIK, which can not be targeted by TRAF3, was activated in hematopoietic system by crossing Rosa-loxp-STOP-loxp-NIK mice with Vav-iCre mice (caNIK mice). Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from control or caNIK mice were sorted by FACS and used for RNAseq analysis.
