TITLE
Diabetic db/db mice treated with three doses of rosiglitazone and S compound

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A reference PPARg agonist, rosiglitazone, is compared to a newly synthesised selective PPARg modulator in db/db mice through transcriptomic analysis using microarray technology. Two tissues and three doses are available. These data were used to develop a new methodology of gene selection. Data of a technical variability study are also available for two liver samples.

DESIGN
Two tissues, two compounds and three doses (24 conditions). 6 biological replicates per condition (with a dye-swap design). 6 technical replicates for two of the liver samples.

PLATFORM
GPL7202 Agilent-014868 Whole Mouse Genome Microarray 4x44K G4122F (Probe Name version)
