TITLE
Induction of the IL-9 gene by HTLV-I Tax stimulates the spontaneous proliferation of primary adult T-cell leukemia cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The mechanism whereby IL-9 stimulated monocytes, promote proliferation of co-cultured ATL cells remains undefined. To obtain preliminary clues concerning this contribution, transcription profiles were obtained between monocytes derived from ATL patients and those derived from healthy donors as assessed by cDNA microarray. Keywords: disease state design

DESIGN
The experiment included 3 biological replicate ATL samples and 3 biological replicate normal samples. The Stratagene Universal Human RNA Reference sample was used as a control.
