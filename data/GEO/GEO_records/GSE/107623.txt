TITLE
RNA-seq analysis of cymopol and algal extracts in the intestine

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A natural product algal extract and its major component, cymopol, have demonstrated anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo. RNA transcript levels of Nqo1 and Hmox1 were discovered in multiple organs following oral gavage of 2 doses of the extract and cympopol for 3 consecutive days.  The highest change in gene expression was noted in the digestive tract.

DESIGN
Examination of a high-dose and a low-dose of both a nonpolar (NP) algal extract and cymopol

PLATFORM
GPL19057 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)
