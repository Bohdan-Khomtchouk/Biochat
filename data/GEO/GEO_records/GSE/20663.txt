TITLE
small RNAs sequences from grafted Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana tissues

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana ; Nicotiana benthamiana

SUMMARY
A silencing signal in plants with an RNA specificity determinant moves through plasmodesmata and the phloem. To identify the mobile RNA we grafted Arabidopsis thaliana shoots to roots that would be a recipient for the silencing signal. Using high throughput sequencing as a sensitive detection method and mutants to block small RNA (sRNA) biogenesis in either source or recipient tissue, we detected endogenous and transgene specific sRNA that moved across the graft union.  Surprisingly we found that the mobile endogenous sRNAs account for a substantial proportion of the sRNA in roots and we provide evidence that 24nt mobile sRNAs direct epigenetic modifications in the genome of the recipient cells. Mobile sRNA thus represents a mechanism for transmitting the specification of epigenetic modification and could affect genome defence and responses to external stimuli that have persistent effects in plants.
