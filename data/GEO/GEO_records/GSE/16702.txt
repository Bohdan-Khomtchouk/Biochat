TITLE
ChIP-chip of PolII in Drosophila at different time points of development

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. This Series contains ChIP-chip data on Agilent 244K dual-color arrays for antibody: PolII at 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. Note: 8wg16 is the name of PolII antibody for set2 datasets. Current Dataset: [GSM418514..GSM418522]: ChIP-chip of PolII in Drosophila pupae [GSM418549..GSM418557]: ChIP-chip of 8wg16 in Drosophila adult female [GSM418567..GSM418575]: ChIP-chip of 8wg16 in Drosophila embryos at 0-4 hours of development [GSM418580..GSM418588]: ChIP-chip of 8wg16 in Drosophila embryos at 4-8 hours of development [GSM418593..GSM418601]: ChIP-chip of 8wg16 in Drosophila L3 larvae [GSM442398..GSM442406]: ChIP-chip of PolII in L2 [GSM442407..GSM442415]: ChIP-chip of PolII in L3 [GSM442416..GSM442424]: ChIP-chip of 8wg16 in Drosophila embryos at 4-8 hours of development - Set2 [GSM443110..GSM443118]: ChIP-chip of 8wg16 in Drosophila embryos at 16-20 hours of development For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
For each combination of time-point and antibody, triplicate ChIP experiments have been performed and hybridized on Agilent 244K arrays. 3 arrays per genome have been used so that each time-point is a set of 9 tiling arrays.
