TITLE
Differential hepatic gene expression in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to the fungicide chlorothalonil reveals estrogenicity

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
Chlorothalonil (2,4,5,6-tetrachloroisophthalonitrile) is a broad spectrum fungicide used extensively in agricultural crops . The aim of this study is to analyse the effects of Chorothalonil on the gene expression profiles in zebrafish (Danio rerio), exposed to two concentrations of the fungicide in the water. Nominal concentrations were 1) Low 0.007mg/l  (environmentally relevent) and 2) High 0.035mg/ml . A commercial third generation microarray for Danio rerio (Agielnt V3, 4x44k) was used to identify patterns of gene expression in male  livers during a 96h toxicological assay.

DESIGN
Replicates: Six control, five low and four high concentrations ; 15 samples examined. Expression profiles of male livers compared. Two concentrations of the fungicide chlorothalonil were compared.
