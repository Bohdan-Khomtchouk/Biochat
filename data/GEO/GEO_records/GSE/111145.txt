TITLE
Identification of a novel role of MTF2 in the regulation of H3K27me3 by PRC2 (RNA-Seq)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sequenced mRNA from F9 cells after knockdown of EZH2, SUZ12 and EED by shRNA. EZH2, SUZ12 and EED are the core componnets of PRC2 which repress its target genes by H3K27me3.

DESIGN
Examination of mRNA expression treated with retinoic acid and after the knockdown of core PRC2 components by deep sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
