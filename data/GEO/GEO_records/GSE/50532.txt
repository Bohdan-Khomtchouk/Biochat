TITLE
Gene expression analysis of RB1 knockdown in bone in response to radiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The role of RB1 in response to radiation was examined in human osteoblasts.  We demonstrate that RB1 induced SASP genes, a response which was attenuated in RB1 knockdown osteoblasts.

DESIGN
Subconfluent hOB shEV and shRB1 cells were irradiated at 4 Gy using a 137Cesium source at a dose rate of 1.7 min/Gy and cell pelllets collected 0, 2, 4, 8, 16  and 24 hrs after irradiation.
