TITLE
Expression data of Sorted CD11b+Gr1+ cells from mice with or without LLC tumor challenging

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We sought to identify genes that are differentially regulated in CD11b+Gr1+ cells after tumor challenging. Mice were challenged with LLC-RFP cells (5×10^6 cells, subcutaneous injection) for 9 days. Single cell suspensions were prepared from lungs of both tumor challenged and control wild type mice and stained with antibodies against CD11b and Gr1. Approximately 1×10^5 CD11b+GR1+ myeloid progenitor cells were sorted by FACS (Aria II, BD Bioscience). Total RNA was extracted from the sorted cells for microarray analysis. In this dataset, we include the expression data of CD11b+Gr1+ cells obtained from both control wild type and tumor challenged mice. These data were used to obtain 22 genes that are upregulated in response to tumor challenging.

DESIGN
We analyzed 3 samples from control mice and 2 samples tumor challenged mice. The mean values of the groups were used in the analysis. Genes that were upregulated > 2 fold were sorted out and generate the table in the Matrix datasheet.
