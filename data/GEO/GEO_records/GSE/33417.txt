TITLE
Global analysis of mRNA decay in induced pluripotent stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression data from human induced pluripotent stem cells(iPSCs) and Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with treatment actinomycin D

DESIGN
In order to estimate mRNA decay rates, HFF and iPS cells were treated with actinomycin D to inhibit transcription and total RNA was isolated from three replicates at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes.
