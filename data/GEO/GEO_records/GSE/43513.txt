TITLE
Phenotypic changes in PMN from production to site of infection

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Neutrophils, key cells of the innate immune system, are responsible for preventing bacterial infections. It has recently been established that neutrophils are capable of complex changes in gene expression during inflammation. The concept that neutrophils merely respond to external signals has been replaced by the concept that activated neutrophils can secrete a variety of cytokines and also have an active regulatory role in angiogenesis and tumoural fate. Currently, neutrophil research relies mostly in animal models that reproduce human physiology and pathology. Although, in many respects, there is a conservation of functions in mice and humans, little is known about genomic conservation of neutrophils between mice and humans.   We hypothesize that neutrophils are transcriptionally active cells that alters their gene expression profile as they migrate into different compartments. To identify changes in neutrophil gene expression in the circulation and inflamed tissue we used recent advances in neutrophil isolation, RNA amplification and microarray technologies that allowed us to compare the transcriptome of neutrophils. Additionally, using bioinformatics, we investigate the genomic conservation of neutrophils between mice and humans.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from isolated neutrophils from Bone Marrow, Blood and Peritoneal Exudate from Black 6 mice.
