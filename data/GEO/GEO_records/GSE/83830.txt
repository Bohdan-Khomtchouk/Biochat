TITLE
4T1 breast cancer cells: SPARC knock down vs. Control

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Comparative analysis of the transcriptome of 4T1 cells stably transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing a siRNA against murine SPARC (4T1-C18) with 4T1 control cells stably transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing a scramble sequence (4T1-SCR).

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, 4T1-C18 vs. 4T1-SCR cells. Biological replicates: 4 SPARC knock down, 4 control, independently grown in vitro and harvested. One replicate per array.  Microarrays were hybridized in three different days.

PLATFORM
GPL19507 MI mouse exonic evidence-based oligonucleotide (MEEBO) microarray
