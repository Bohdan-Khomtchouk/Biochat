TITLE
Transcriptome response to embolism in stems of P. trichocarpa

ORGANISM
Populus sp.

SUMMARY
Embolism and the refilling of xylem vessels are intrinsic to the ability of plants to handle the transport of water under tension.  While the formation of an embolized vessel is an abiotic process, refilling against the pressure gradient requires biological activity to provide both the energy and the water needed to restore xylem transport capacity. We used microarrays to analyze the global transcriptome response of xylem parenchyma cells after embolism formation or infiltration of xylem tissue with sucrose solution.
