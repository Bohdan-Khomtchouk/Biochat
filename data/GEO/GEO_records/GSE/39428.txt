TITLE
Screening genes associated with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genotyping was performed using a custom-designed Illumina 384-SNP VeraCode microarray (Illumina) to determine possible associations of genes encoding PADI1, PADI2, PADI3, PADI4, PADI6, PRKD3, Gc, GLRX,CDSN, PSORS1C1, TXNDC5, CA1, bub3, SORBS1, VDR,SERPNA1, PCSK6, DNAH9 to rheumatoid arthrities (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We previously found that encoding genes of PADI1, PADI2, PADI3, PADI4, PADI6, PRKD3, Gc, GLRX,CDSN, PSORS1C1, TXNDC5, CA1, bub3, SORBS1, VDR, SERPNA1, PCSK6 and DNAH9 could be associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We used illumina customer designed microarray to verify the above finding with an increased numbers of samples. Genotyping was performed using a custom-designed Illumina 384-SNP VeraCode microarray (Illumina) to determine possible associations of genes encoding PADI1, PADI2, PADI3, PADI4, PADI6, PRKD3, Gc, GLRX,CDSN, PSORS1C1, TXNDC5, CA1, bub3, SORBS1, VDR, SERPNA1, PCSK6, DNAH9 to RA and AS. A case-control study was performed with 51 AS patients, 266 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 163 health controls. Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) across the above genes were determined by searching the HapMap database. The tag SNPs were selected on the basis of linkage disequilibrium patterns observed in the Han Chinese in Beijing (CHB) samples that were genotyped as a part of the International HapMap Project. Only SNPs with a minor allele frequency of greater than 5% with a pair-wise r2 ≥ 0.8 in the HapMap were considered. SNPs that were in exons and untranslated regions (UTR), as well as promoters and introns within 500 bp of exons were also selected. Candidate SNPs were submitted to Illumina for a design score. The Illumina Assay Design Tool filtered out SNPs that were not suitable for the Illumina platform. Finally, 382 SNPs with a design score of “1” were selected.

DESIGN
382 SNPs within PADI1, PADI2, PADI3, PADI4, PADI6, PRKD3, Gc, GLRX,CDSN, PSORS1C1, TXNDC5, CA1, bub3, SORBS1, VDR,SERPNA1, PCSK6, DNAH9  encoding genes were selected. Genotyping was performed using Illumina VeraCode microarray in a case-control study including 51 AS patients, 266 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 163 health controls We performed genotyping using a custom-designed Illumina 384-SNP VeraCode microarray (Illumina). Peripheral blood samples were collected from patients with RA (n=266, 183 female) and AS (n=51, 10 female). RA patients had a mean age of 51.7 years, while AS patients had a mean age of 35.9 years. A total of 163 (60 female) healthy individuals with a mean age of 48.0 years were blood donors. Blood samples were put into Monovette tubes containing 3.8% sodium citrate. The genotyping was conducted with the BeadXpress Reader using the Illumina VeraCode GoldenGate Assay kit. 500 ng of sample DNA were used per assay. Genotype clustering and calling were performed using BeadStudio software (Genomestudio V2010.2 Genotyping module V1.6) (Illumina). This work was completed at the Beijing Institute of Genomics.
