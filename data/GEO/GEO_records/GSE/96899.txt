TITLE
The transcriptome of type I murine astrocytes under interferon-gamma exposure and remyelination stimulus

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Astrocytes are considered as an important contributor of the central nervous system (CNS) disorders, and particularly multiple sclerosis. Transcriptome of these cells is greatly affected by cytokines released by lymphocytes penetrating the blood-brain barrier, particularly classical pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). We report here transcriptomal profiling of astrocytes treated by IFN-gamma and perspective remyelinization agent benztropine. Our findings indicate that expression of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation in astrocytes are significantly upregulated upon IFN-gamma exposure emphasizing critical role of this cytokine in redirecting of immune response towards self-antigens. Data reported herein support previous observations that IFN-gamma-induced JAK-STAT signaling pathway may be regarded as valuable target for the pharmaceutical intervention.

DESIGN
Brain of C3H/He mice were used as a source of astrocytes. Cells were treated with IFNγ at a concentration of 250 IU/mL or with benztropine at a concentration of 2.0 μM in culture medium for 48 h before analysis.
