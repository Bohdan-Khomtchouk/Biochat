TITLE
DNA methylation sensitivity at detecting cancer in prostate core biopsies [DNA Methylation Profiles]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to analyze critically the potential usefulness of selected DNA methylation biomarkers in supporting conventional histological diagnostic tests for PCa. The selection of potential biomarkers was conducted by microarray profiling of DNA methylation on prostate tissues extracted from the gland after total radical prostatectomy.

DESIGN
DNA methylation profiles of 16 prostate samples without carcinoma and 16 matched pairs of samples with and without cancer cells isolated from prostates containing prostate carcinoma

PLATFORM
GPL13534 Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HumanMethylation450_15017482)
