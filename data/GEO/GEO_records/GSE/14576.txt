TITLE
Rabbit heart gene expression in global ischemia and cardioplegia

ORGANISM
Oryctolagus cuniculus

SUMMARY
The mechanisms through which cardioplegia affords cardioprotection is complex and  can not be investigated as a single entity but rather must be investigated as a  system. In order to improve understanding of the molecular processes modulating the effects of global ischemia and the cardioprotection afforded by cardioplegia  we have constructed rabbit heart cDNA libraries and have isolated, sequenced and identified a compendium of non-redundant cDNAs for use in microarray analysis.   Methods: New Zealand White rabbits were used for Langendorff perfusion consisting of 30 minutes global ischemia (GI)and 120 minutes reperfusion. Cardioplegia hearts received cardioplegia prior to GI. Control hearts were perfused without GI. The effects of RNA and protein synthesis on the cardioprotection afforded by cardioplegia were investigated separately by pre-perfusion with either alpha-amanitin or cycloheximide. Rabbit heart cDNA libraries were constructed and cDNAs isolated and identified by 5â€™ sequencing to create a compendium of non-redundant cDNAs for microarray analysis coupled with proteomic analysis.  Results and Conclusion: Our studies demonstrate that the cardioprotection afforded by cardioplegia is modulated by RNA and protein dependent mechanisms. Microarray and proteomic enrichment analysis indicated that cardioplegia significantly increases differentially expressed genes/proteins associated with the mitochondrion and mitochondrial function and significantly up-regulates the biological processes of muscle contraction, involuntary muscle contraction, carboxylic acid and fatty acid catabolic processes, fatty acid beta-oxidation and fatty acid metabolic processes.
