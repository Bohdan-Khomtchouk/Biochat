TITLE
Expression data from glioblastoma stem cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
TLX (NR2E1), as an orphan nuclear receptor, plays a critical role in growth, self-renewal, and tumorigenesis of glioblastoma stem cells. We used microarrays to investigate the global gene expression regulated by TLX and identified downstream targets of TLX in glioblastoma stem cells. We further investigated the global gene expression regulated by TET3, a downstream target of TLX, to identified downstream targets of TLX-TET3 axis in glioblastoma stem cells.

DESIGN
Glioblastoma stem cells were treated with lentivurs expressing constrol shRNA or target (TLX or TET3) shRNA to knockdown the expression of TLX or TET3. RNAs were extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.
