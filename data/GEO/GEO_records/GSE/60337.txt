TITLE
Gene expression data for 39 inbred mice strains for CD4+ T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression data were generated for CD3+CD4+CD62L+ naïve T splenocytes  across 39 strains in the MPD “Priority Strain Panel”.

DESIGN
Inbred mouse strains from the MDP Priority Strain Panel, representing 39 strains, were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory production facility in Bar Harbor, Maine, at five weeks of age. All mice were bred in the Jackson Laboratory production facility under SPF conditions. CD3+CD4+CD62L+ naïve T splenocytes  were sorted from pools of two to three mice. Two biological replicates were generated for each strain using the ImmGen standard operating protocol (SOP; www.immgen.org). Gene expression data was generated for bone marrow granulocytes (GN)  using Affymetrix ST1.0 microarrays resulting in the quantification of expression levels for 25,134 probes corresponding to 21,951 unique genes.
