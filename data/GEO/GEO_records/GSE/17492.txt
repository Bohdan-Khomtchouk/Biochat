TITLE
Preliminary characterization of gene expression in European wild boar naturally infected with Brucella suis

ORGANISM
Sus scrofa

SUMMARY
Brucella suis infects macrophages and dendritic cells. Wild boars act as reservoirs and carriers of Brucella suis biovar 2, and there is evidence that wild boar can be the main source of infection for domestic pigs through the venereal route. Transmission through this route could be an important path for disesease dissemination. The result from this study will contribute to the overall understanding of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms involved during Brucella suis infection in European wild boar.

DESIGN
In this study we preliminarily characterized differential gene expression in European wild boar naturally infected with Brucella suis biovar 2 using Microarray hybridization and Real Time RT-PCR analysis. Since Brucella suis acts by infecting macrophages, we used spleen cells to analyze the gene expression response to Brucella suis infection.
