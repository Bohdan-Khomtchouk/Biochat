TITLE
Plant Viroid Detection Microarray

ORGANISM
Viroids ; Tomato apical stunt viroid ; Tomato planta macho viroid ; Citrus exocortis viroid ; Potato spindle tuber viroid ; Hop stunt viroid ; Peach latent mosaic viroid ; Apple scar skin viroid ; Avocado sunblotch viroid ; Chrysanthemum stunt viroid ; Columnea latent viroid ; Hop latent viroid ; Chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroid ; Coleus blumei viroid 1 ; Citrus dwarfing viroid

SUMMARY
40mer probes were designed to detect plant viroids infection at the genus level. This microarray platform is able to detect a wide spectrum of all the 8 reported viroid genera, including 37 known plant viroid species.

DESIGN
Viroid samples were extracted from infected plant hosts and plasmids. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to the microarray.

PLATFORM
GPL16684 Plant Viroid Detection Microarray
