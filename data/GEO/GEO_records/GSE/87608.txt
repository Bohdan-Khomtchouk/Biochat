TITLE
Next-Generation Sequencing Supports Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type and Runx2+/- Calvarial Transcriptomes With or Without Administration of MS-275

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Because insufficiency of Runx2 limits skeletal growth, there is a great deal of effort to activate Runx2 for clinical use. In this study, we found that MS-275, the class I-specific HDAC inhibitor, activates Runx2 both transcriptionally and translationally. Therefore, we performed NGS analysis to gain accurate patterns of gene expression in mouse calvaria tissue through MS-275 administration. As a result, we could get insight that treatment of MS-275 increases genes related with osteoblast differentiation and cell proliferation, and decreases genes in field of causing apoptosis.

DESIGN
Mice calvarial mRNA profiles of embryonic day 17.5 wild type (WT) and Runx2+/- mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina NextSeq 500. Mice were administered MS-275 or vehicle. Three replicates per group.
