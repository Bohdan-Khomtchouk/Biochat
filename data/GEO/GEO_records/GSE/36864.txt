TITLE
Genomic landscape of metastatic colorectal cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Response to drug therapy in individual colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is associated with tumor biology. Here we describe the genomic landscape of tumor samples of a homogeneous well-annotated series of patients with metastatic CRC of two phase III clinical trials, CAIRO and CAIRO2. DNA copy number aberrations of 349 patients are determined. Within three treatment arms, 194 chromosomal sub-regions are associated with progression free survival PFS (uncorrected single-test p-values < 0.005). These sub-regions are filtered for effect on mRNA expression, using an independent data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) which returned 171 genes. Three chromosomal regions are associated with a significant difference in PFS between treatment arms with or without irinotecan. One of these regions, 6q16.1-q21, correlates in vitro with sensitivity to SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. This genomic landscape of metastatic CRC reveals a number of DNA copy number aberrations associated with response to drug therapy.

DESIGN
aCGH data of colorectal cancers of patients from 2 clinical trials (CAIRO, CAIRO2). 105 patients were treated with capecitabine first line (CAIRO arm A), 111 patients were treated with capecitabine and irinotecan first line (CAIRO arm B), and 133 patients were treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab (CAIRO2 arm A).
