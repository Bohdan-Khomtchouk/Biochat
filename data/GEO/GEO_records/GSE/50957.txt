TITLE
Molecular Hallmarks of Experimentally Acquired Immunity to Malaria [Pilot Study]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection can be induced experimentally in humans after few exposures. An example is the induction of immunity using whole parasites by exposure of malaria-naive volunteers to infectious mosquito bites while using chloroquine prophylaxis (CPS immunization). Chloroquine kills blood-stage parasites but leaves liver-stage parasites unaffected, thereby exposing the liver-stage and early blood-stage antigens to the immune system. Upon subsequent challenge, volunteers are completely protected from infection, but protective efficacy decreases when fewer infectious mosquito bites are used for CPS immunization. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of this immunity, and how it differs from naturally-acquired immunity, may provide critical insights that could aid malaria vaccine development.  In this pilot study, transcriptomic features are derived from blood samples collected before and after challenge with infectious mosquito bites.
