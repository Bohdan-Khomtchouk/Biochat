TITLE
Temporal Gene Expression Profiling of Bone Repair in a Rat Calvarial Defect

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Microarray analysis of gene expression was performed in the healing and non-healing calvarial defects of 12-week old male rats during various stages of bone repair: 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days post surgery.

DESIGN
Eight (CSD) or four (non-CSD) mm circular defects were created in the calvaria. The disc was removed, leaving the underlying dura mater intact. At the respective time post-injury, the region of regeneration was harvested, and RNA isolated using Tri Reagent. Next, labeling and hybridization to Agilent rat whole genome microarrays was performed.
