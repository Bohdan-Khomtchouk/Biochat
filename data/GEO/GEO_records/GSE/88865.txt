TITLE
Expression data from human placental derived mesenchymal stem cells (PDMSCs).

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Inductive environments and extracelluar mediums will leads to the alteration of gene expression pattern. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying adipogenic differentition, immediately osteogenic differentiation and deletion of stimulations for 21 days, we intend to identify distinct classes of differentiated genes during these processes.

DESIGN
Human PDMSCs were incubated in adipogenic medium for 14 days, then the inductive medium was replaced by osteogenic medium for 7 days, finally the medium was removed and the manipulated cells were cultured in general medium for 21 days. These adherent cells were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. To that end, we hand-selected cells at four time-points: before  induction (P), adipogenic PDMSCs at 14 days (A), osteogenic adipocyte like cells for 7 days (AO) and MSC-like cells in general medium for 21 days(TAO).
