TITLE
Combinatorial flexibility of cytokine during Human T helper cells differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Transcriptional analysis of human T cells differentiated in 4 T Helper context ( Th0, Th1, Th2 and Th17) in the presence or not of Interferon alpha

DESIGN
We analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of 4 human naives T cells diferentiated in Th0, Th1, Th2 and Th17 in the presence or not of Interferon Alpha. Microarray analyses were performed in 2 time points : 1/ after Day 5 of polarization (= Day5); 2/ after Day 5+ four hours of re-stimulation (=Day 5+ 4H restim)   in 3 different donors.
