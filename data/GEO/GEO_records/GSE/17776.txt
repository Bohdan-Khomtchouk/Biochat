TITLE
MicroRNA expression in rat soleus muscle during atrophy induced by hindlimb suspension

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to identify microRNAs expressed in the rat soleus muscle and determine if their expression was changed in response to hindlimb suspension.

DESIGN
The microRNA expression profile (Sanger miRBase 9.0) of the rat soleus muscle was determined in the following three groups: control (C), hindlimb suspended for 2 days (HS-2) or 7 days (HS-7).  Three replicates were performed for each group.
