TITLE
The ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 regulates hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and lymphoid commitment [high-throughput sequencing]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We identified the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 as a crucial regulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functions. We generated Huwe1 conditional knock-out mice and discovered that the loss of this ligase causes an increased proliferation and stem cell exhaustion, together with a decreased lymphoid specification in vivo. We observed that the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 is controlling the expression of N-myc at the level of the most immature stem and progenitor hematopoietic populations, mediating the described effects.

DESIGN
High-troughput RNA-sequencing of sorted HSC (Lin-Sca+Kit+CD48-CD150+) from wild type or Huwe1 conditional knockout mice (constitutively deleted with Vav-Cre recombinase or inducibly deleted with Mx1-Cre)
