TITLE
Genome-wide gene expression analysis of human foreskin fibroblast cells infected with Toxoplasma gondii over time

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of host cell gene expression patterns following infection of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii over a time course of 2 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours. Parasites were washed off after 2 hours to ensure that gene expression changes are truly reflective of an on-going infection, and not on-going parasite invasion.

DESIGN
Total RNA extracted from Toxoplasma gondii-infected cells for 2, 6 and 24 hours post-infected compared to mock-infected cells at the same time points.

PLATFORM
