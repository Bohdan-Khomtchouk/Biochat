TITLE
Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis Reveal New Prognosis Biomarker in Colorectal Cancer (miRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA profile of TNM-specific sequence design and integrated network-based bioinformatic analysis in 20 Colorectal cancer patients(n=5 for each TNM stage) are carried out to find the dynamic miRNA expression pattern specific to TNM stage. Gene microrray experiment of the same samples were also performed. Two different platform of microarray data were analyzed together to uncover the potential biomarker for progression of colorectal cancer.
