TITLE
Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis Reveal New Prognosis Biomarker in Colorectal Cancer (miRNA)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
microRNA profile of TNM-specific sequence design and integrated network-based bioinformatic analysis in 20 Colorectal cancer patients(n=5 for each TNM stage) are carried out to find the dynamic miRNA expression pattern specific to TNM stage. Gene microrray experiment of the same samples were also performed. Two different platform of microarray data were analyzed together to uncover the potential biomarker for progression of colorectal cancer.

DESIGN
Primary tumor and paired distant normal mucosa of 20 colorectal patient were collected to performed the microarray experiment(please refer to the raw data file). Data of five classes including 15 distant normal mucosa,5 stage I, 5 stage II, 5 stage III and 5 stage IV tumor sample (Total of 35 samples) passed the correlation-based data filtering and went for further analysis. microRNA expression pattern in accordance with TNM stage were analyzed to uncover the dynamic microRNA expression pattern. Significant expression pattern with crucial miRNA were uncovered for prognosis prediction and further functional experiment.
