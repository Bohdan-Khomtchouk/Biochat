ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
MED23, a subunit of the Mediator coactivator complex, is important for the expression of a subset of MAPK/ERK pathway-dependent target genes; however, the genes in this subset varies between cell types.  MAPK/ERK pathway-dependent processes are essential for T-cell development and function, but whether MED23 has a role in this context is unknown.  We generated Med23 conditional knockout mice and induced Med23 deletion in early T cell development using the lineage specific Lck-Cre transgene.  While the total cell number and distribution of cell populations in the thymuses of Med23flox/flox;Lck-Cre mice were essentially normal, MED23 null T-cells failed to efficiently populate the peripheral lymphoid organs.  MED23 null thymocytes displayed decreased expression of the MAPK/ERK-responsive genes Egr1, Egr2, as well as of the membrane glycoprotein Cd52 (CAMPATH-1).  MED23 null CD4 single-positive thymocytes also showed decreased expression of KLF2 (LKLF), a T cell master regulatory transcription factor.  Indeed, similarities between the phenotypes of mice lacking MED23 or KLF2 in T-cells suggest that KLF2 deficiency in MED23 null T-cells is one of their key defects.  Mechanistic experiments using MED23 null MEFs further suggest that MED23 is required for full activity of the MAPK-responsive transcription factor MEF2, which has previously been shown to mediate Klf2 expression.  In summary, our data indicate that MED23 has critical roles in enabling T-cells to populate the peripheral lymphoid organs, possibly by potentiating MEF2-dependent expression of the T-cell transcription factor KLF2.
