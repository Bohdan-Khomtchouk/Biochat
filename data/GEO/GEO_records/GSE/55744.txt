TITLE
Comparison of the transcriptional profiles of male E13.5 wild type and L/H-Pgds-/- gonads

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome profiling of  L/H-Pgds-/- gonads to that of WT (RNA-seq)

DESIGN
Methods:  mRNA profiles of E13.5 wild-type (WT) and L- and H- prostaglandin D synthases (L/H-Pgds−/−) embryonic gonad were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq2000.  qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays

PLATFORM
