TITLE
Transcriptome microarray of wildtype, relA, expI and rpoS Pectobacterium atrosepticum strains in PMB media

ORGANISM
Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI1043

SUMMARY
Whole genome analysis of gene expression by Pectobacterium atrosepticum strain SCRI1043 wildtype and its relA, expI and rpoS deletion mutants when grown to exponential and stationary phase in PMB media. The data is further described in Bowden et al (2013) Virulence in Pectobacterium atrosepticum is regulated by a coincidence circuit involving quorum sensing and the stress alarmone, (p)ppGpp. Molecular Microbiology. DOI: 10.1111/mmi.12369

DESIGN
A 24 chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI1043 and three separate cultures from three single mutant strains of SCRI1043 possessing deletions within relA (ECA3569), expI (ECA0105) or rpoS (ECA3530) when grown in Pel Minimal Broth (PMB) media to log-phase (6h) or early stationary phase (14h) growth. Each chip measures the expression level of 4,472 genes from Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI1043 with eight 60-mer probe pairs (PM/MM) per gene, with three-fold technical redundancy.
