TITLE
Gene expression analysis of diploid and autotetraploids of Mulberry (Morus atropurpurea)

ORGANISM
Morus alba var. atropurpurea

SUMMARY
Autotetraploid carries several phenotypic changes with larger leaves and fruit compared to diploid. To analysis of phenotypic changes in mulberry autotetraploids on the transcriptome, we performed RNA-Seq analyses on mulberry leaf samples of diploid and autotetraploids using Illumina HiSEq 2000.

DESIGN
Mulberry leaves mRNA profiles of diploid and autotetraploids were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSEq 2000.
