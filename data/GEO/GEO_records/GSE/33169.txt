TITLE
Gene expression profiling of negative-pressure-treated split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds reveals novel effects on epithelialization

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is widely used to improve skin wound healing and to accelerate wound bed preparation. Although NPWT has been extensively studied as a treatment for deep wounds, its effect on epithelialization of superficial dermal wounds remains unclear. To clarify the effect of NPWT on reepithelialization, we applied NPWT on split- thickness skin graft donor sites from the first postoperative day (POD) to the seventh POD. Six patients took part in the study and two samples were obtained from each. The first biopsy sample was taken at elective surgery before split-thickness skin grafting and the second one during reepithelialization on the seventh POD. In all 12 samples (eight from four NPWT patients, and four from two control patients) were collected for this study. From each sample, we carried out a comprehensive genome-wide microarray analysis. Data from patients receiving NPWT were compared groupwise with data from those not receiving NPWT.

DESIGN
Overall 12 samples were analyzed
