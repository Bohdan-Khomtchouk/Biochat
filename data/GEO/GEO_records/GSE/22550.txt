TITLE
Expression data from Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines UHO-1 and L-1236 transduced with shRNAs against GATA-3 or non-functional control shRNAs

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The transcription factor network in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) represents a unique composition of proteins found in no other hematopoietic cell. Among these factors, an aberrant expression of the T cell transcription factor GATA-3 is observed in the B cell-derived Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) tumor cells. Herein, we elucidated the regulation and function of this factor in HL To obtain a more comprehensive overview of GATA-3 regulated genes in cHL cell lines, we performed a gene chip analysis comparing gene expression in GATA-3-specific shRNA-transduced L-1236 and U-HO1 cells compared to samples transduced with vectors encoding scrambled shRNAs.

DESIGN
12 Total samples were analyzed. Three independent samples were analyzed per condition and cell line.We generated the following pairwise comparisons using Bioconductor: shRNA Gata-3 UHO-1 < control shRNA UHO-1; shRNA Gata-3 L1236 < control shRNA L-1236. Genes with an FDR≤ 25% and a fold-change ≥ 1.5 and ≤ -1.5 were selected.
