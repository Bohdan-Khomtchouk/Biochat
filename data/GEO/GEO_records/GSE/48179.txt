TITLE
Benzene effects on leaves: Study of benzene metabolism in higher plants.

ORGANISM
Brassica oleracea

SUMMARY
au12-01_detox; Improving the knowledge of the metabolic pathways of benzene in higher plants Cabbages (Brassica oleracea Var. Prover)are directly submitted to a one dose of benzene (3ppm) during 1 hour or 3 hours. The comparison is realized between samples treated and untreated to the benzene for both exhibitions.

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - treated vs untreated comparison

PLATFORM
