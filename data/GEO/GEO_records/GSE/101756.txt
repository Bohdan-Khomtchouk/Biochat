TITLE
Intrinsic Plasma Cell Differentiation Defects in BENTA Patient B cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
From purified na√Øve B cells from a BENTA patient cohort, we performed differential expression analysis by RNA-seq to show that BENTA B cells exhibit intrinsic defects in B cell differentiation with poor induction of specific genes required for plasma cell commitment.

DESIGN
Transcriptome profiling of one cell type in technical duplicate for 4 individuals per group
