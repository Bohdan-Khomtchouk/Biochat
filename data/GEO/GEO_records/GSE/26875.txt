TITLE
Gene expression data from undifferentiated mouse embryonal carcinoma cell strains (MOE430A and MOE430B)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of undifferentiated mouse embryonal carcinoma cell strains (P19, P19CL6, and 4 P19CL6 sublines) were obtained, using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A and 430B. Heart diseases such as cardiac infarction damage cardiomyocytes and consequently lead to significant loss of the contractile capacity of the heart. To repair functions of the injured heart, a great deal of research has attempted to develop regenerative medicine using pluripotent stem cell-based cardiomyocytes as cell therapy products. However, the efficiency of the current methods available for the cardiac differentiation of stem cells is insufficient for clinical settings. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanism involved in the cardiac differentiation of stem cells is necessary to improve the differentiation efficiency. To identify genes assosiated with cardiomyogenic potential, we isolated P19CL6 cell sublines possessing distinct properties in cardiomyogenesis and comprared their transcriptome profiles with those of mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 and P19CL6 cells.

DESIGN
Total RNA isolated from undifferentiated EC cell strains (P19 cells, P19CL6 cells, and 4 P19CL6 sublines)  using Affymetrix chips MOE430A and MOE430AB. CEL files unavailable.
