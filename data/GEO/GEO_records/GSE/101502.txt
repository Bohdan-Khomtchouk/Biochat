TITLE
microRNA expression profiling in human colon cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Using the highly sensitive miRCURY LNA™ microRNA array, we screened 3100 microRNAs abundant in the human colon cancer and Adjacent normal gastric mucosa tissues, and the function of differentially expressed microRNAs were analyzed by bioinformatics. The enrichment results indicated that these microRNAs perhaps participated in the occurrence and development process of colon cancer. In this study, three cases of colon cancer were used to acquire the microRNA expression profiling, and qPCR was employed to confirm the results of microRNA chip. The function of the differentially expressed microRNA were analyzed by bioinformatic methods.Finally,compared with the adjacent normal mucosa tissues，the expression of 2 microRNAs were up regulated in colon cancer. qPCR results showed an expression pattern consistent with that of the chip analysis.
