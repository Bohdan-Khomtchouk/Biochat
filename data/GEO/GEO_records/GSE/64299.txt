TITLE
Transcriptional Regulationand Chromatin Dynamics inHuman Epithelial Cell Differentiation (expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiling of  progenitor and differentiated keratinocytes by Affymetrix microarray

DESIGN
Analysis of the transcriptome of progenitors and differentiated keratinocytes, in order to identify genes that are differentially expressed during human skin differentiation.
