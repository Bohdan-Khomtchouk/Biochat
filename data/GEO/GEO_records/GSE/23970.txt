TITLE
Large intergenic non-coding RNAs as novel modulators of reprogramming: human embryonic stem cells, CD34+ cells, and CD34+ derived induced pluripotent stem cells (LincRNA expression)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
LincRNA expression profiles of human embryonic stem cells, CD34+ cells, and CD34+ derived induced pluripotent stem cells

DESIGN
Total RNA was extracted from human ESCs, CD34+ cells, and CD34+ derived iPSC lines, then hybridized to Nimblegen tiling array GPL8792; Human lincRNA 391k Tiling Array V2
