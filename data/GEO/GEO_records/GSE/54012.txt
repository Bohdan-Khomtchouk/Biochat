TITLE
Amoebal endosymbiont Neochlamydia S13 gene expression in host amoebae when Leginella infected

ORGANISM
Neochlamydia sp. S13

SUMMARY
To further development of our gene expression approch to intracellular pathogenic bacterial controlling, we have employed castamized Neochlamydia S13 genomic microarray  as a discovery platform to identy genes with the potential to inhibit Legionella growth into hoat amoebae , based on our data that the the amoebae haboring amoebal endosymbiont Neochlamydia S13 (an environmental chlamydia) could evade Legionella infection.

DESIGN
Neochlamydia S13 gene experssions in host ameobae  with or without Legionella infection (24h pi, MOI1) was measured. Single experiment was performed; a probe against each of the genes was arrayed quintuply. Avaraged values were used for analysis.

PLATFORM
GPL18161 Agilent-048216 Neochlamydia S13 genome oligo microarray (Probe Name version)
