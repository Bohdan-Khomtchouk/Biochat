TITLE
Genome wide expression profiles of early and late onset breast cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Analysis of breast cancer gene expression profiles. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that if differential profiles exsist between early and late onset breast cancer. Results provide important information regarding up- or down-regulated genes playing a mechanistic role in cancer.

DESIGN
Breast  tumors were divided into 2 groups based on their age criteria ; Early onset tumors(ET) with age≤ 40yrs and Late onset tumours (LT) with age ≥55 yrs ; Total RNA obtained from the breast tumours were subjected to gene expression profiling, adjacent normal tissues collected from breast cancer patients were used as controls for studying the gene expression profiles of early and late onset tumours
