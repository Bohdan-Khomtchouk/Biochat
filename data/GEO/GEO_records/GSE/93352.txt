TITLE
Gene expression profile of T-DM1 resistant and parental cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The esophageal cancer cell line OE-19 was used to select resistant cells to T-DM1. They were selected by prolonged exposure to increasing concentrations of T-DM1 in the absence or presence of ciclosporin A (CsA). Two cell lines resulted from these experimental conditions: OE-19 TR in the absence of CsA and OE-19 TCR in the presence of CsA. The parental cell line was named OE-19 S. The present study aims to detect the transcriptomic changes between OE-19 S, OE-19 TR and OE-19 TCR cell lines to identify the deregulated pathways involved in acquired resistance to T-DM1.

DESIGN
OE-19 S, TR and TCR were recovered without previous drug exposure. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed. The experiment was performed in triplicate.
