TITLE
piRNAs and transgenerational RNA interference protect essential genes from RNA silencing in C. elegans

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
This data series contains small RNA high-throughput sequencing data derived from cell lysates and FLAG::HRDE-1 immunoprecipitates (IP) after resetting RNAi in the presence or absence of piRNAs in C. elegans.

DESIGN
Small RNAs were isolated from adult wild type and mutant or transgenic C. elegans and subjected to Illumina HiSeq sequencing. The series contains fastq and tab-separated files for 10 libraries.
