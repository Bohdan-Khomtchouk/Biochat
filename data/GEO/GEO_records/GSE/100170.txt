TITLE
Circular RNAs expression profiles in human gastric cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The circRNAs expression profiles in 5 gastric cancer (GC) and their matched non-gastric cancer (non-GC) tissues were detected by human circRNA expression profile chips, and the differentially expression circRNAs between GC and matched non-GC tissues were then identified.  A total of 713 circRNAs were differentially expressed in GC tissues vs. non-GC tissues (fold changeâ‰¥2.0, p < 0.05) among all the candidate circRNAs (62998) detected in both GC and non-GC tissues according to the T-test. 191/713 circRNAs were significantly upregulated in GC tissues, whereas 522/713 circRNAs were significantly downregulated in GC tissues. GO and KEGG pathway analyses showed that many dysregulated circRNAs may be functionally GC-related, thereby contributing to the development of GC.

DESIGN
To detect the circRNAs expression profiles in 5 gastric cancer (GC) and their matched non-gastric cancer (non-GC) tissues by human circRNA expression profile chips and to identify the differentially expressed circRNAs between GC and their matched non-GC tissues based on the chip data. In this way,  this study provided the basis for identifying novel GC biomarkers and further studying the roles and functions of differentially expressed circRNAs in GC.
