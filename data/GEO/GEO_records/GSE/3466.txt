TITLE
D. nodosus WT vs pilR mutant

ORGANISM
Dichelobacter nodosus

SUMMARY
The aim was to determine the additional genes regulated by PilR in addition to fimA. To determine the additional genes the gene expression profile of a pilR mutant was compared to the wild-type strain. Keywords: genetic modification

DESIGN
PilR regulated genes were determined by analysed microarray expression data from three biololgical replicates, including a dye swap. The expression data from the pilR mutant was compared to the wild-type strain. Raw data was obtained using IMAGENE, while normalisation and analysis was performed using BASE. Statistical analysis was undertaken using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
