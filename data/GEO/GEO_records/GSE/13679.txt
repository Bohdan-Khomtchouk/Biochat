TITLE
High-throughput sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster small RNAs from S2R+ cells

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
High-throughput sequencing of Drosophila melanogaster small RNAs from S2R+ cells. total RNA, ~18-26nt RNAs isolated using PAGE, ligation to adapters requires 5' monophosphate and 3' OH For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf

DESIGN
Small RNAs were sequenced from D. melanogaster S2R+ cells. Raw sequences were clipped by 3' linker sequences recognition, and select clipped sequences longer than 18 nt.
