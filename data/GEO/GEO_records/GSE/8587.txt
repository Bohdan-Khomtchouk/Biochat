TITLE
Gene expression changes in cecum mucosa upon dietary treatment

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
To increase our knowledge of the effects of Fructo oligosaccharides (FOS) on the intestinal barrier function in rats, a controlled rat infection study was performed. Two groups of rats (n=12 per group) were adapted to a diet with or without FOS. mRNA was collected from the mucosa of the cecum and changes in gene expression were assessed using an agilent rat whole genome microarray (G4131A Agilent Technologies). Results indicate that dietary FOS influences immune response and wound healing mechanisms, which will most likely affect the intestinal barrier. Keywords: Dietary treatment, cecum mucosa, Rat
