TITLE
Characterization of IGF1 effects on the transcriptome of normal and irradiated Sox9-EGFP cell populations

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transcriptional profiling of intestinal epithelial cells expressing either Negative, Sublow, Low or High levels of the Sox9-EGFP reporter transgene FACS-isolated from jejunum of non-irradiated mice or at 5 days after 14Gy abdominal irradiation. In both groups, mice were treated for 5 consecutive days with either IGF1 or vehicle via mini-pumps (Alzet 1007D, IGF1 at 10mg/ml) implanted subcutaneously immediately following radiation.

DESIGN
4 distinct cell populations FACS-isolated based on levels of expression of the Sox9-EGFP reporter transgene (Sox9-EGFP Negative, Sublow, Low and High cells). 4 conditions: Non-irradiated/vehicle vs Non-irradiated/IGF1 vs Irradiated/vehicle vs Irradiated/IGF1. Biological replicates: 7 independent non-irradiated mice treated with vehicle - 3 independent non-irradiated mice treated for 5 days with IGF1 - 3 independent irradiated mice studied at day 5 post-irradiation treated with vehicle - 3 independent irradiated mice studied at day 5 post-irradiation treated for 5 days with IGF1.
