TITLE
Nucleosome occupancy dynamics in yeast BY4741 responding to 0.4mM H2O2 over time (0-60 min)

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C

SUMMARY
Numerous factors have been implicated in regulating gene expression changes, including changes to nucleosome occupancy.  Here we followed dynamic changes to nucleosome occupancy, gene expression and DNA binding of the transcription factor Msn2p genome-wide in yeast cells responding to hydrogen peroxide to reveal new relationships between regulators of stress-dependent gene expression.

DESIGN
Nucleosome occupancy was measured by MNase-Seq in response to .4mM H2O2 in the S288c yeast derivative BY4741.  A single replicate was performed for the time-course experiment with time points at 0, 4, 12, 20, 40 and 60 minutes after treatment.
