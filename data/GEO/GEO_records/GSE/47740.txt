TITLE
Gene expression of HSC39 treated with SiRNA targeting TRIM44

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We used microarrays to further detail a transcriptional signature of TRIM44 by globally assessing genes that have changes in expression upon knockdown on TRIM44 using two independent SiRNAs targetting the gene (in duplicate) and All Stars Negative siRNA (in quadruplicate) as a control

DESIGN
We performed genome-wide comparison of gene expression and identified genes that are differentially expressed in siRNA (targetting TRIM44) treated HSC39 relative to untreated cells, 4 biological replicates per condition

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
