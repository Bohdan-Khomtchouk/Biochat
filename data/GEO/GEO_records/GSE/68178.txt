TITLE
hnRNP U protein is required for normal pre-mRNA splicing and postnatal heart development and function

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We profiled the gene expression/splicing program of normal and hnRNP U-deficient mouse hearts by RNA-seq.

DESIGN
RNA-seq profiles of control and Hnrnpu mutant hearts at postnatal day 14. Hnrnpu mutant hearts were generated by breeding the Hnrnpu conditional knockout mice with Ckmm-Cre transgenic mice.
