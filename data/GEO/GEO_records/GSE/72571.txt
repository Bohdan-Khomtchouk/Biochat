TITLE
Sequence-Targeted Nucleosome Sliding in vivo - Transcription Profiling

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing was performed on various W303 variants to determine effects of nucleosome repositioning on transcript abundance

DESIGN
RNA sequencing was carried out in multiple backgrounds to determine effects of nucleosome repositioning in various contexts. For engineered chromatin remodeling factors, a catalytically inactive control was included.
