TITLE
Systems-based analyses of brain regions functionally impacted in Parkinson's disease reveals underlying causal mechanisms

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Detailed analysis of disease-affected tissue provides insight into molecular mechanisms contributing to pathogenesis. Substantia nigra, striatum and cortex are functionally connected with increasing degrees of alpha-synuclein pathology in Parkinson's disease. Functional and causal pathway analysis of gene expression and proteomic alterations in these three regions revealed pathways that correlated with deposition of alpha-synuclein. Microarray and RNAseq experiments revealed previously unidentified causal changes related to oligodendrocyte function and synaptic vesicle release and other changes were reflected across all brain regions. Importantly a subset of these changes were replicated in Parkinson's disease blood. Proteomic assessment revealed alterations in mitochondria and vesicular transport proteins that preceded gene gene expression changes indicating defects in translation and/or protein turnover. Our combined approach of proteomics, RNAseq and microarray analyses provides a comprehensive view of the molecular changes that accompany alpha-synculein pathology in Parkinson's disease, and may be instrumental in understanding and diagnosing Parkinson's disease progression.
