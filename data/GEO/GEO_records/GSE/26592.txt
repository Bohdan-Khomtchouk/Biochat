TITLE
Neighboring genomic regions influence differential methylation patterns of CpG islands in endometrial and breast cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report the global methylation patterns by MBDCap-seq for total 232 primary samples in endometrial cohorts, breast cancer cohorts and breast cancer cell lines. We found total 1,007 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) include CpG islands and shores in endometrial cohorts, and 2529 for Breast Cancer cohorts. We also identified 153 regions that are distinctly different from regular CpG islands at the 5'-ends of genes. Those regions, always contain a chain of 1-2 main islands and a few satellites alone on GC-poor and gene-less region. Majority of CpG atolls contain lowly transcribed or silenced genes in normal controls. This phenomenon provides a new opportunity to develop sensitive biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis

DESIGN
Study of 3 different Cancer type, Endometrial Cancer and Breast Cancer patient samples, and Breast Cancer cell liens, using MBDCap-seq technology.

PLATFORM
GPL9052 Illumina Genome Analyzer (Homo sapiens)
