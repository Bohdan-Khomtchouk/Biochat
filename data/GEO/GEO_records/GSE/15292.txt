TITLE
Drosophila at different time points of development: ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains ChIP-chip data on Agilent 244K dual-color arrays for 6 Histone modifications (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27Ac, H3K9Ac), PolII and CBP/p300. Each factor has been studied for 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to http://www.genome.gov/27528022 and http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/ENCODE/ENCODEDataReleasePolicyFinal2008.pdf This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

DESIGN
ChIP-chip: For each combination of time-point and antibody, triplicate ChIP experiments have been performed and hybridized on Agilent 244K arrays. 3 arrays per genome have been used so that each time-point is a set of 9 tiling arrays. ChIP-seq: For each combination of time-point and antibody, triplicate ChIP experiments have been performed and hybridized on Agilent 244K arrays. The hybridizations have been verified by sequencing one replicate of IP and one replicate of Input following Solexa sequencing procedure. RNA-seq: For each time-point (E-0-4h, E-4-8h, E-8-12h, E-12-16h, E-16-20h, E20-24h, L1, L2, L3, Pupae, Adult Males and Adult Females) a total RNA extraction has been performed. After conversion into double stranded DNA, the samples have been sequenced in duplicate on Solexa Genome Analyzer following Solexa sequencing procedure.
