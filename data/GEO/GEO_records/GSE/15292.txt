TITLE
Drosophila at different time points of development: ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq

ORGANISM
modENCODE

SUMMARY
This is a dataset generated by the Drosophila Regulatory Elements modENCODE Project led by Kevin P. White at the University of Chicago. It contains ChIP-chip data on Agilent 244K dual-color arrays for 6 Histone modifications (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27Ac, H3K9Ac), PolII and CBP/p300. Each factor has been studied for 12 different time-points of Drosophila development. For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to and This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
