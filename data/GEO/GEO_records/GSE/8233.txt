TITLE
Response of tomato leaves to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)

ORGANISM
Solanum tuberosum

SUMMARY
TMV-resistant (N), -susceptible (n), and enhanced susceptible mutant sun1-1 (N) tomato were grown in asceptic conditions in growth chambers (25ยบ, 16hr/8hr light dark).  4-5 week old tomato were treated with TMV leaf sap or mock leaf sap, and leaf tissue was collected after 3, 9, and 27 hours.    RNA was isolated from each sample (leaf tissue from one plant/one treatment/one timepoint), using standard TIGR protocols, and 25ug of total RNA was labeled using TIGR indirect labeling protocols.  The experiment was repeated three times. Keywords: Direct comparison
