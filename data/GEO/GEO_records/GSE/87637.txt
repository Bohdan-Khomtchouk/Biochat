TITLE
Interaction of CNOT3 with EBF1 regulates gene-specific transcription and mRNA stability in B lymphopoiesis

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
EBF1 interacts with CNOT3 and histidine 240 of EBF1 is a critical residue for this interaction. We studied H240 dependent EBF1 occupancy and gene expression regulation by genome-wide ChIP and microarray analysis. We also performed RNASeq analysis in pro-B cells to study the role of Cnot3 in early B cells development. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
