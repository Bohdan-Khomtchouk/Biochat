TITLE
Regulation of cuticle formation during fruit development and ripening in 'Newhall' navel orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck) revealed by transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling

ORGANISM
Citrus sinensis

SUMMARY
To investigate global genome expression changes during fruit developmemt, We then performed genome-wide expression analyses on the fruit peel at 120 and 150 DAF with RNA-seq approach.A total of 865 genes were identified as differentially expressed, among which 494 genes were up-regulated and 371 genes were down-regulated in the fruits harvested at 150 DAF compared with in those harvested at 120 DAF.In general, data obtained from RNA-seq showed that the genes involved in photosynthesis and tetrapyrrole synthesis were significantly repressed at 150 DAF; in contrast, the genes involved in secondary metabolism including the biosynthesis of wax, terpenoids and phenylpropanoid were significantly induced at 150 DAF.

DESIGN
Total four sample pools (two independent biological replicates of fruits peel from 120 DAF and 150 DAF)

PLATFORM
GPL17145 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Citrus sinensis)
