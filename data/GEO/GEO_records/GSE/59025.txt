TITLE
The difference of gene expression signatures between CD146+ and CD146- cells in malignant rhabdoid tumor

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To uncover the molecular mechanisms by which CD146+ malignant rhabdoid tumor cells exhibited higher tumorigenic potential, microarray analysis was carried out to compare gene expression profiles between CD146+ and CD146− cells isolated from three cell lines

DESIGN
RNA was isolated from the purified CD146+ and CD146− cells by FACS

PLATFORM
