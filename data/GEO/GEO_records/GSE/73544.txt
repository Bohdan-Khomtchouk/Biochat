TITLE
Expression data from E12.5 mouse embryonic heart

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We prepared RNA from mouse embryonic hearts and performed mRNA micro-array analysis to compare gene expression profiles between control and Rhau-deletion mice (E12.5), in order to understand how RHAU regulates heart development.

DESIGN
Three hearts were dissected from each group of control and Rhau-deletion mice and total RNA was isolated from these hearts. In total, six RNA samples were applied for microarray analysis (Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 Array, Shanghai Biotechnology Co. Ltd.).
