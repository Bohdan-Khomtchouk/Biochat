TITLE
Analysis of Blimp-1 and Irf-1 genomic binding in wild type and Prdm1/Blimp-1 mutant embryonic gut

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to profile Blimp1 binding in E18.5 small intestine using a Blimp-1-eGFP knock-in allele, and to compare Blimp-1-eGFP genomic binding with Irf-1 genomic binding in normal small intestine.  Changes in Irf-1 binding between wild type and Prdm1/Blimp-1 mutant small intestine were also assessed.

DESIGN
ChIP-seq was performed for Blimp-1-eGFP in duplicate in E18.5 small intestine expressing the fusion protein using anti-GFP antibody.  As a negative control a single anti-GFP ChIP was also performed in wild type small intestine.  ChIP-seq for Irf-1 was performed in duplicate in both wild type and Prdm1/Blimp-1 mutant E18.5 small intestine using an anti-Irf-1 antibody. Duplicate IgG ChIP control in wild types was performed as a negative control.  All samples had an associated input chromatin sample sequenced.
