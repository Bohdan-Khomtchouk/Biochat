TITLE
Study of Topoisomerase I in human

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We report a mechanism through which the transcription machinery directly controls topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) activity to adjust DNA topology throughout the transcription cycle. By comparing TOP1 occupancy using ChIP-Seq, versus TOP1 activity using TOP1-Seq, a method reported here to map catalytically engaged TOP1, TOP1 bound at promoters was discovered to become fully active only after pause-release. This transition coupled the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal-domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with stimulation of TOP1 above its basal rate, enhancing its processivity. TOP1 stimulation is strongly dependent on the kinase activity of BRD4, a protein that phosphorylates Ser2-CTD and regulates RNAPII pause-release. Thus the coordinated action of BRD4 and TOP1 overcame the torsional stress opposing transcription as RNAPII commenced elongation, but preserved negative supercoiling that assists promoter melting at start sites. This nexus between transcription and DNA topology promises to elicit new strategies to intercept pathological gene expression.

DESIGN
Examination of RNAPII and BRD4 by ChIP-Seq, Topoisimerase I by ChIP-Seq and Top1-Seq, and transcriptome expression by RNA-Seq in human colon cancer cells HCT116 (wt, wt+CPT, wt+JQ1, kiTop, kiTop1+JQ1, and siTop1).
