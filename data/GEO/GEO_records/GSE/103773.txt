TITLE
Phenotypic responses to interspecies competition and commensalism in a naturally-derived microbial co-culture

ORGANISM
Halomonas sp. HL48 ; Halomonas sp. HL58

SUMMARY
Testing of response of hetertrophic partners (Halomonas sp. HL-48 and Marinobacter sp. HL-58) to both axenic and co-culture growth using both glucose and xylose

DESIGN
Both Halomonas sp. HL-48 and Marinobacter sp. HL-58 were grown either on glucose axenically or in co-culture and on xylose in co-culture.  Halomonas HL-48 was also grown on xylose axenically.  Transcriptomic data was collected under each condition and used to determine each organisms response to the other under both competitive and commensal conditions.
