TITLE
Next Generation Sequencing of total RNA from 9 bladder cancer cell lines and 3 fractionated bladder cancer cell lines

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We profile the cell line expression of 279 circRNAs, that are highly expressed across 457 bladder cancer patient samples. Additionally, we investigate their cellular location in fractionated cell lines

DESIGN
9 bladder cancer cell lines and 3 fractionated bladder cancer cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens) GPL18573 Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens)
