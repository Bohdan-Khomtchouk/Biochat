TITLE
LGR5 positivity defines stem-like cells in colorectal cancer [aCGH]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-Cre-ERT2 mice were exposed to azoxymethane/dextrane sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) which induces inflammation-driven colon tumors. Tumors were then flow-sorted into fractions of epithelial cells that expressed high or low levels of Lgr5. To exclude that transcriptional differences between Lgr5 high and low mouse colon tumor cells were imposed by distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations in the two cell fractions, we also performed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) from these tumors. All eight analyzed tumors were chromosomally stable, and thus, no difference between Lgr5 high and low cells could be detected.

DESIGN
AOM/DSS-induced mouse colon tumors were flow-sorted into Lgr5 high and low cells before aCGH was performed. Biological replicates: 8. Two CGH array platforms.
