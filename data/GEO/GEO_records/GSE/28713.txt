TITLE
Obesity Promotes Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition and Tumor Progression in a Mouse Model of Claudin-Low Breast Cancer.

Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ABSTRACT: Obesity is responsible for decreased overall survival for breast cancer patients. Here, we describe the generation, characterization and application of a novel murine mammary tumor initiating cell model (M-Wnt) that recapitulates the claudin-low subtype of human breast cancer and permits the study of TICâ€™s in wild-type, immunocompetent mice. M-Wnt cells readily form mammospheres in suspension culture, express markers consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and generate claudin-low mammary tumors when as few as 50 cells are orthotopically injected. Using the M-Wnt cell lines in tandem with a more basal-like epithelial breast cancer cell line, E-Wnt, we found that diet induced obesity significantly downregulates epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin, and upregulates mesenchymal markers including fibronectin, N-cadherin, SNAIL, Oct-4, and TGF-b.  This reveals a previously unidentified link between energy balance and EMT.  The ability of calorie restriction (CR) to reverse EMT, upregulate epithelial markers and downregulate mesenchymal markers indicates the plasticity of the TICs, as well as the potential importance of lifestyle modifications as cancer prevention strategies.
