TITLE
Osteoblastic response in human bone marrow stromal cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our goal was to determine whether osteoblastic LuCaP 23.1 prostate cancer xenograft tumors can elicit an osteoblastic response at the gene expression level in human bone marrow stromal cells.

DESIGN
Custom Agilent 44K whole human genome expression oligonucleotide microarrays were used to profile bone marrow stroma cells isolated from three patients and treated with either mineralization media or LuCaP 23.1 conditioned medium.  Total RNA was isolated and amplified prior to hybridization against a common reference pool of prostate tumor cell lines.
