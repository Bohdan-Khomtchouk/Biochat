TITLE
Exploring Regulatory Mechanisms of Atrial Myocyte Hypertrophy of Mitral Regurgitation through Gene Expression Profiling Analysis: Role of NFAT in Cardiac Hypertrophy

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Regulatory Mechanisms of Atrial Remodeling of Human Mitral Regurgitation

DESIGN
This study enrolled 10 human subjects and divided into two groups: mitral regurgitation patients (MR) (n = 7; 7 females), and normal control subjects (NC) (n= 3).We sought to systemically elucidate critical differences in the alteration of RNA expression pattern between the atrial myocardium of MR patients and normal subjects using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays and functional network enrichment analysis.
