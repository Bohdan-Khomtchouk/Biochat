TITLE
Gene expression profiling of the human HepaRG hepatocellular carcinoma cell line under WNT3A stimulation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of the study was to characterize at a molecular level (changes in mRNA level) the effects of WNT3A on the human HepaRG hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. This was adressed by culturing HepaRG cells in presence or absence of Wnt3a.

DESIGN
HepaRG cells were treated with 200 ng/ml Wnt3a for 72hrs. To dissect the gene networks involved, experiments were also performed to silence Î²-catenin expression with a specific siRNA and to inhibit Wnt3a in the extracellular space with FZD8_CRD, a soluble Wnt-binding domain with SFRP-like functions. HepaRG cells were plated three days before siRNA transfection and treated with 200 ng/ml Wnt3a alone and/or 300 ng/ml FZD8_CRD from day one through day three after transfection. Independent culture experiments were performed in triplicate.
