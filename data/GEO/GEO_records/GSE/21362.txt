TITLE
MicroRNA Profile Predicts Recurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Milan Criteria Cases with Mild Liver Cirrhosis.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In this study, we utilized microRNA expression profiling to assess risk of HCC recurrence after liver resection.

DESIGN
We examined microRNA expression profiling in paired tumor and non-tumor liver tissues of 73 HCC patients with mild cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A/B) who satisfy Milan Criteria. We constructed prediction models of recurrence-free survival using Cox proportional hazard model and principal component analysis.
