TITLE
Differential expression of genes after transfection of STAT6 specific siRNA in NCI-H460 cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to identify the genes which get altered after the transfection of siRNA targeting STAT6 in NCI-H460 cells. The NCI-H460 cells plated in 12-well plate were transfected with 60nM of STAT6 specific siRNA.

DESIGN
Biological duplicates of 2 samples were used viz. control NCI-H460 cells (Contol), NCI-H460 cells transfected with siRNA (siRNA)

PLATFORM
GPL6884 Illumina HumanWG-6 v3.0 expression beadchip
