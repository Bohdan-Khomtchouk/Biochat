TITLE
Expression data from liver of young and old rats fed on different dietary fat sources, namely virgin olive, sunflower or fish oils

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Since the liver is the central organ of metabolism, changes in diet have a great impact on this organ and overall on health with aging. It is well known that dietary fat source strongly influences many parameters of the hepatic mitochondria. These changes includes modification of lipid composition of mitochondrial membrane, affecting the mtETC functions, oxidative stress and mtDNA alterations. We used microarrays to detail the changes in gene expression provides by feeding lifelong on different dietary fat sources, and identified distinct classes of up and down-regulated genes during aging under different dietary conditions.

DESIGN
Rats were fed lifelong on a normolipidic diet (4% w/w) with virgin olive, sunflower or fish oil as dietary fat source. At 6 and 24 months, animals were killed and liver were removed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain changes in gene expression due to both aging and dietary conditions. There were 6 experimental groups (virgin olive oil at 6 months, sunflower oil at 6 months, fish oil at 6 months, virgin olive oil at 24 months, sunflower oil at 24 months and fish oil at 24 months. 3 animals were studied of each experimental group, so a total of 18 samples were analyzed.
