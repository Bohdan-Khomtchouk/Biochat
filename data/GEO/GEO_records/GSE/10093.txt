TITLE
Effect of TCDD Exposure on purified splenic CD8 T cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
8-12 week, female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 10 Âµg/kg TCDD or solvent control. CD8+ T cells from spleen were FACS purified and submitted to transcription profiling Keywords: TCDD, AHR, Immunosupression peripheral T cells, CD8 T cells, Toxicogenomics

DESIGN
For each group 4 female C57BL/6 mice were treated, spleen surgically removed and single cell suspensions generated. Cell suspensions were pooled, and CD8 positive T cells purified (purity > 99%). RNA was isolated using TRIzol and amplified using the Ambion message AMP kit. Target lableing and hybridization was performed using Affymetrix standard protocols
