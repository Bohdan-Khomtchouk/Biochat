TITLE
Hepatocellular carcinoma follows loss of liver-gender specificity in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We are investigating hepatic transcriptional responses associated with castration and tumorigenic hepatitis induced by Helicobacter hepaticus infection in mature male A/JCr mice Microarray data demonstrated a global loss of gender-dimorphic gene expression regulation in mice with chronic hepatitis and liver cancer Keywords: dose

DESIGN
Male A/JCr mice were inoculated with H. hepaticus or vehicle at 4 weeks; some underwent castration at 1 year, and all were necropsied at 21 months
