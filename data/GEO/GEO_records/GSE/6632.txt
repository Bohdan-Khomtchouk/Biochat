SUMMARY
We are investigating hepatic transcriptional responses associated with castration and tumorigenic hepatitis induced by Helicobacter hepaticus infection in mature male A/JCr mice Microarray data demonstrated a global loss of gender-dimorphic gene expression regulation in mice with chronic hepatitis and liver cancer Keywords: dose
