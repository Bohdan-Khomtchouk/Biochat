TITLE
Comparisons of epithelial and mesenchymal murine breast tumor cell lines

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Epithelial  tumor cells (E) underwent EMT in vivo in FVB/N mice generating mesenchymal tumors. Mesenchymal cell lines (M1-M4) were each derived from a different mouse. This study compares gene expression between these two different tumor types. Keywords: cell type comparison

DESIGN
Two replicates were prepared for each of five cell lines, one epithelial cell line (E) and 4 mesenchymal cell lines M1-M4.
