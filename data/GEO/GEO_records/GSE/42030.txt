TITLE
Differential gene expression profile of newly diagnosed versus relapse acute promyelocytic leukemia

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to gain insight into the potential mechanism of resistance to arsenic trioxide and to identify genes that are modulated in the malignant promyelocytes at the time of relapse in APL patients. We analyzed the gene expression profile by the whole genome microarray of primary promyelocytes obtained from 8 newly diagnosed and 8 at relapse patients.

DESIGN
