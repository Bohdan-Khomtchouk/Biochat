TITLE
Expression data from porcelain crabs following heat stress

ORGANISM
Petrolisthes cinctipes

SUMMARY
Porcelain crabs, Petrolisthes cinctipes, live in the marine intertidal zone and routinely experience thermal stress.  Genes involved in heat shock responses are generally upregulated following heat stress and genes involved in oxidative energy production are downregulated following heat stress We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying responses to thermal stress and identified distinct classes of up-regulated and down-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: time course

DESIGN
Crabs were collected from the field and returned to the laboratory where they were given a heat stress or held under control conditions for the period of time during the heat stress.  Samples from both heat stressed and control crabs were taken after crabs were placed into a common recovery tank for periods of time ranging from 0.5 to 30h
