TITLE
Differential gene expression patterns in potassium-starved and Caesium-treated plants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
At high concentrations ceasium (Cs) is toxic to plant growth. This toxic effect may occur when Cs blocks potassium (K) uptake mechanisms in plants. Consequently, plants starved of K and plants exposed to toxic concentrations of Cs should have similar gene expression patterns. To test this hypothesis, Arabidopsis will initially be grown on agar containing 1/10 MS salts before being transferred to either 1/10 MS nutrient solution (control plants), 1/10 MS nutrient solution containing 2 mM Cs, or 1/10 MS nutrient solution with no K. Roots and shoot will then be harvested seven days after transfer and used to challenge ATH1 GeneChips.
