TITLE
Gene expression profile of DLL4+ and DLL4- Hemato-Endothelial Progenitors (HEPs) subpopulations

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In hESCs, expression of the Notch ligand DLL4 parallels the emergence of bipotent hematoendothelial progenitors (HEPs) and promotes their hematopoietic differentiation. During differentiation, DLL4 is only expressed in a subpopulation of HEPs. To study the developmental fate of the two subpopulations of HEPs identified by DLL4 expression, we FACS-isolated DLL4high and DLL4low/- HEPs at day 15 of differentiation and performed gene expression analysis using microarrays

DESIGN
10^5 DLL4high and DLL4low/- HEPs purified by FACS from H9 and AND1 hEBs at day 15 of hematopoietic differentiation were used for gene expression analysis using Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray chips (Agilent Technologies).
