TITLE
Characterization of novel ovarian tumor cell lines that retain the phenotype of primary tumors [Illumina]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The inability to establish stable cell lines from the vast majority of human tumors has limited the use of in vitro models to study human cancer. Currently available tumor cell lines fail to represent the biological diversity of human tumors. We have developed a cell culture medium that enabled us to routinely establish cell lines from diverse subtypes of ovarian tumors. Importantly, the twenty-five ovarian tumor cell lines described here retain the genomic landscape, histopathology, and molecular features of the original tumors. Furthermore, the molecular profile and drug response of these cell lines correlated with distinct groups of primary tumors with different outcomes. Thus, tumor cell lines derived using this methodology represent a significantly improved new platform to study human tumor biology and treatment.

DESIGN
Total RNA was obtained from untreated ovarian cancer cell lines and clustering analysis was performed. The 'Median-Cent_5147_probes.txt' is a list of the 5147 gene probes that has at least 2-fold difference relative to median value across cell lines in at least 4 samples. These are the probes that were used for hierarchial clustering analysis. The 'Combined_and_GSE9891.txt' is a combination of gene probes from this study of ovarian cell lines and of human ovarian cancer cell lines (GSE9891[GPL570]: Expression profile of 285 ovarian tumour samples). Only the 3832 overlapping gene probes between the this study and the GSE9891[GPL570] study are listed. The 3832 gene probes listed have at least 2-fold difference relative to median value across samples in at least 4 samples.
