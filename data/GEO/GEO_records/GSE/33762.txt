TITLE
Expression data from GW9662 treated FVB wild-type mouse mammary tumors

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Microarrays were used to analyse global gene expression changes in tumors from wild-type mice treated with GW9662

DESIGN
RNA was isolated (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) from progestin/DMBA induced mammary tumors from  wild-type mice treated with GW9662
