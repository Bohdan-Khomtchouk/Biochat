TITLE
Expression data from MOLT4 human cell line

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To compare The pattern of Gene expression by 7-hydroxymethotrexate-resistant human leukemia cells reveals changes designed to preserve intracellular levels of folate and nucleotide biosynthesis We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Keywords: Resistant and non-resistant MOLT4 cell lines
