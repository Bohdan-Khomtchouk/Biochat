TITLE
Transcriptomic analysis of defense responses in Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and mammalian guanylate cyclase-expressing transgenic plants in response to infection with an avirulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
To decipher the role of cGMP during the hypersensitive response Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic lines have been produced which express a rat soluble guanylate cyclase. Transgenic plants display a higher constitutive amount of cGMP (4 to 50 fold) compared to wild-type. Both GC and wt genotypes were infected with PstAvrB and transcriptome profile was analyzed at 12 hours post-infection.

DESIGN
Transcriptomic profile of wild-type and guanylate cyclase-expressing plants in basal conditions (mock) and at 12hpi with PstAvrB (107 cfu/mL)

PLATFORM
GPL17311 Illumina HiSeq 1000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
