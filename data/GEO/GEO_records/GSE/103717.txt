TITLE
Transcriptome analysis of 7l-treated leukemic cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To analyze the molecular mechanisms by which 7l may induce apoptosis, microarray gene expression profiling of 7l treated KG1a cells was performed.

DESIGN
7l induced gene expression in KG1a cell was measured at 24 hours after exposure to doses of 2ÂµM. Each sample was performed in triplicate.
