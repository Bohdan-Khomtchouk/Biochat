TITLE
Microarray Based Comparison of three Amplification Methods For Nanogram Amounts of Total RNA

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Two T7 based methods One round of Amplification (Affymetrix) and Two round of Amplification were compared to two Ribo-SPIA based systems, RiboSPIA and pico Ribo SPIA systems. Data for Pico-RiboSPIA are listed here. All Hybridisation were performed using Affymetrix Mouse 430-2 gene chips.  Data were all scaled to 500. For 12 chips performed with pico Ribo SPIA the scaling factor average was 2.0 +/- 0.3, background intensities 74.4 +/- 12.7 , noise 3.9 +/- 0.6, rawQ 2.5 +/- 0.3 Keywords: ordered
