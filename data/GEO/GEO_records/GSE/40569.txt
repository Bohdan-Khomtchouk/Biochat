TITLE
Expression analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans Bristol N2 prg-1 and Bristol N2 prg-1; daf-2 double mutant

ORGANISM
Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in early generation Caenorhabditis elegans Bristol N2 prg-1 and Bristol N2 prg-1; daf-2 double mutant, compared to late-generation strains.

DESIGN
A seven chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate alleles of Caenorhabditis elegans Bristol N2 prg-1 and four separate allelic combinations of a double mutant strain, Bristol N2 prg-1; daf-2 , in which prg-1 (pk2298) and prg-1 (tm872) are combined with one of three daf-2 alleles (e1368, 1370, m41).
