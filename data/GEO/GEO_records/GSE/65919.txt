TITLE
Tet1 is a tumor suppressor of hematopoietic maligancy [RRBS]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Loss of Tet1 expression causes global 5mC and 5hmC changes in stem and progenitor cells in mice and causes enhanced Pro-B cell self-renewal, increased DNA damage and B-lymphomageneis. In this study we performed reduced representative bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) of DNA from WT and Tet1 KO LSK cells.

DESIGN
DNA methylation sequencing was performed and analyzed using an enhanced reduced representation (ERRBS) methodology as previously described. DNA was extracted from purified LSK cells of 6-month old WT and Tet1 KO mice, Bisulphite treatment was performed using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research). Libraries were amplified according to illumina protocols and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 machine DNA methylation profiling of LSK cells in WT and Tet1 KO mice.
