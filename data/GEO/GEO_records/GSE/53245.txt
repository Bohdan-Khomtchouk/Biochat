TITLE
Analysis of 3D- and TRIB1-dependent gene expression in prostate cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
A capability to proliferate under the three-dimensional (3D) conditions is a characteristic property of cancer. Therefore, factors that regulate the 3D growth are considered rational targets for cancer therapy. We analyzed  gene expression profile of human prostate cancer PC3 cells which were cultured in normal 2D conditions or in spheroid  culture conditions (3D). The analysis suggested that the sheroid conditions would mimic a part of tumor-like 3D conditions. In addition, we analyzed genes regulated by TRIB1, a candidate oncogene in PC3 cells by comparing the gene expression profiles between control (shGFP)-treated and TRIB1 shRNA- (shTRIB1-1 and shTRIB1-2) treated cells. Our analysis identified a subset of genes that are downstream of TRIB1 in prostate cancer cells.

DESIGN
To compare gene expression between 2D and 3D, we prepared PC3 cells  which were cultured in normal 2D conditions or in spheroid  culture conditions (3D) (PC3_2D and PC3_spheroid). To analyze TRIB1-dependent genes, we prepared PC3 cells that expressed control shRNA (shRNA to GFP) or 2 TRIB1 shRNAs (PC3_shGFP, PC3_shTRIB1-1, PC3_shTRIB1-2).
