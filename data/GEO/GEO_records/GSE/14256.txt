TITLE
Human fibroblast stimulation with PDGF-BB or b-FGF

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We analyzed gene expression in human fibroblasts stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for 1h and 24h. The results of two independent experiments were merged. SAM analysis identified 116 relevant probe sets. Hierarchical clustering of these probe sets showed divergent early gene regulation by PDGF and FGF but overlapping late response. We first analyzed genes commonly regulated by PDGF-BB and b-FGF more than 2 fold after 24h of stimulation and we found that these two growth factors repressed FOXO. We then focused on the early gene expression response induced by both growth factors. We performed a fold change analysis and found 114 probe sets regulated by PDGF-BB and 42 probe sets regulated by b-FGF, 37 of which were shared between the two gene lists .
