TITLE
Distinctive Chromatin in Human Sperm Packages Genes that Guide Embryo Development: ChIP-chip

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
As nucleosomes are widely replaced by protamine in mature human sperm, epigenetic   contributions to embryo development appear limited.  However, our genome-wide approaches find nucleosomes at low levels genome-wide, but also significantly enriched at imprinted gene clusters, miRNA clusters, HOX gene clusters, and the promoters of other developmental transcription and signaling factors. Developmental promoters were often DNA hypomethylated, and bore histone modifications localized to discrete locations: H3K4me2 is enriched at certain developmental promoters, whereas large blocks of H3K4me3 localize to a subset of developmental promoters, regions in HOX loci, certain non-coding RNAs, and generally to paternally-expressed imprinted loci.  In contrast, H3K4me3 is generally absent at paternally-repressed imprinted loci. Interestingly, repressive H3K27me3 is enriched at many developmental promoters that lack early expression in embryos, with significant overlap with bivalent (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) promoters in ES cells. Taken together, epigenetic marking in sperm is extensive, and correlated with developmental regulators.

DESIGN
*Use of ChIP-chip to identify regions enriched for methylated DNA, protamine, histone, and several histone variants in human sperm. *Histone Localization: Chromatin was prepared from 40 million sperm as described previously (1) in the absence of crosslinking reagent, treated with sequential and increasing MNase (10U-160U), and centrifuged to sediment protamine-associated DNA, releasing mononucleosomes. The pooled mononucleosomes were gel purified (~140-155 bp) for sequencing and array analysis. Histone localization on arrays was performed using a single donor with 3 biological replicas and normalized to total genomic DNA (control). *Chromatin IP and Preparation for Genomics Methods: ChIP methods were as described previously (2) but were performed without a cross linking agent and slight modifications to the salt levels, 250 mM NaCl, 200 mM LiCl, and replaced the TE wash with 150 mM PBS wash. ChIPs hybridized to arrays were performed from a single donor: H3K4me2 had 2 biological replicas, H3k4me3 had 3-replicas, TH2B had 2 replicas, and all the modifications data were normalized to the gel purified array monucleosomes. *Methylation Profiling Using MeDIP: This procedure was described previously (3). Samples were hybridized to Agilent expanded promoter arrays, treated according to standard Agilent conditions, and scanned in an Agilent scanner. Sperm MeDIP had three replicas and Fibroblast had 2 replicas. Both Sperm and Fibroblast MeDIPs were normalized to their corresponding input fractions. 1.
