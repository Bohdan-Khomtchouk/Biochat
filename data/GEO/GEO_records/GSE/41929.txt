TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in response to bortezomib treatment [human cell lines].

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in response to bortezomib treatment (33 nM) in cell lines before and after selection for resistance. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the proliferation of neoplastic plasma cells in the bone marrow. While the first-to-market proteasome inhibitor bortezomib/VELCADE has been successfully used to treat myeloma patients, drug resistance remains an emerging problem. In this part of the study, we identify signatures of bortezomib sensitivity by gene expression profiling (GEP) using The human myeloma cell lines MM1.S and U266 (obtained from ATCC). Finally, these data reveal complex heterogeneity within MM and suggest resistance to one drug class reprograms resistant clones to make them more sensitive to a distinct class of drugs. This study represents an important next step in translating pharmacogenomic profiling and may be useful for understanding personalized pharmacotherapy of MM patients.

DESIGN
Transcript profiling timecourses after treatment with Bortezomib treatment (33nm) in two myeloma cell lines.
