ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We want to identify gene expression pattern in memory cells in response to Wnt pathway activation human memory T cells from peripheral blood from three healthy individuals were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence and absence of TWS119, a Wnt pathway activator. DMSO was added as control vehicle.
