TITLE
Antagonism between two mechanisms of antifungal drug resistance

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Genome-wide assays to test the interaction between two independently evolved mechanisms of fluconazole resistance Keywords: Comparative genomic hybridization

DESIGN
Three populations at 100 and 400 generations of evolution in increasing concentrations of fluconazole [experiment 1 - (Anderson et al.,2003 Genetics,163:1287-98, PMID: 12702675, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search & =pubmed & =12702675 )], a single double-mutant (progeny strain from each of the three crosses of the strains from generation 100, and the erg3r mutant strain, were all assayed for gene expression against sce13 the ancestor strain.
