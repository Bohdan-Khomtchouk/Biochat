TITLE
The effect of pertussis toxin on lung airway gene expression during B. pertussis infection in mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Genome-wide expression analysis of mouse lung responses to Bordetella pertussis infection and the effects of pertussis toxin

DESIGN
Total lung RNA from wild-type and pertussis toxin-defficient B. pertussis-infected mice at two and four days post inoculation compared to control, mock-infected mice.  Seven-week old female BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with 1 x 106 CFU WT B. pertussis (Tohama I), 1 x 106 CFU ΔPT (WT carrying a PT deletion), or 30 x 106 CFU of the ΔPT strain.  Whole lung tissue was collected from mice sacrificed at 2 and 4 days post inoculation (n = 3 per group per time point).  Control mice were inoculated with PBS and sacrificed 2 days post inoculation (n = 2).
