TITLE
Transciptional profile of Escherichia coli O157:H7 TUV93-0 inhibitor mutants in MEM-HEPES

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli O157:H7

SUMMARY
Tpx, FolX and WrbA were identified as a targets for type 3 secretion inhibititors in pull-down assays.The transcriptional profile of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and isogenic mutants grown in MEM-HEPES were determined.

DESIGN
Total RNA from triplicate cultures growing exponentially in MEM-HEPES media were labelled with Cy5 (wild type) and Cy3 (tpxC61S). Labelled cDNAs were hybridised to UBEC3 arrays.
