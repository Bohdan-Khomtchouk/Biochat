TITLE
Transciptional profile of Escherichia coli O157:H7 TUV93-0 inhibitor mutants in MEM-HEPES

ORGANISM
Escherichia coli

SUMMARY
Tpx, FolX and WrbA were identified as a targets for type 3 secretion inhibititors in pull-down assays.The transcriptional profile of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and isogenic mutants grown in MEM-HEPES were determined.
