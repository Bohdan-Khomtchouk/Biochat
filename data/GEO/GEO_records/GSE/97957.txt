TITLE
MicroRNA expression in a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumour

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
An FGF23-producing phosphaturic mesenchymal tumour was surgically resected. We performed small RNA sequencing to quantify the microRNAs/ small RNAs expression in the resulting library.

DESIGN
The tumour was resected from the patient's femoral head. RNA was extracted from the tumour. Small RNA sequencing using HD adapters (Xu et al 2015) was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500
