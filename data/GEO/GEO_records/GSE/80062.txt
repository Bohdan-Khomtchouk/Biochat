TITLE
Whole transcriptome sequencing identifies increased CXCR2 expression in PNH granulocytes

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
To clarify the selective advantage of the GPI-AP- cells in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)  patients, RNA-seq was applied to examine functional effects of the PIG-A mutation in human granulocytes.

DESIGN
RNA seq, 2 PNH patiant's GPI-AP-  granulocyte,2 PNH patiant's GPI-AP+  granulocyte, 3 Healthy granulocyte

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
