TITLE
Anti-CD3-induced activation of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The experiment was designed to assess whether conventional and unconventional IEL differ in their response to activation.

DESIGN
Total RNA from activated TCRαβ CD8αβ and TCRγδ CD8αα IEL stimulated with anti-CD3 for 24 hours compaired to unactivated samples

PLATFORM
GPL13824 Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 expression beadchip (Gene version based on MouseWG6_V2_0_R0_11278593_A)
