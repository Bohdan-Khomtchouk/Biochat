TITLE
Affymetrix SNP array data for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples with complex karyotype

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
AML with complex karyotype (CK-AML) is characterized by a high frequency of TP53 alteration (loss and/or mutation). TP53-altered CK-AML were characterized by a higher degree of genomic complexity (aberrations per case, 14.30 vs. 6.16; P < .0001), and by a higher frequency of specific copy number alterations, such as -5/5q-, -7/7q-, -16/16q-, -18/18q-, +1/+1p, and +11/+11q/amp11q13~25; among CK-AML, TP53-altered more frequently exhibited a monosomal karyotype (MK). Patients with TP53 alterations were older and had significantly lower complete remission rates, inferior event-free, relapse-free, and overall survival. In multivariable analysis for overall survival, TP53 alterations, white blood cell counts, and age were the only significant factors. In conclusion, TP53 is the most frequently known altered gene in CK-AML. TP53 alterations are associated with older age, genomic complexity, specific DNA copy number alterations, MK, and dismal outcome. In multivariable analysis, TP53 alteration is the most important prognostic factor in CK-AML, outweighing all other variables, including the MK category.

DESIGN
Affymetrix SNP arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions on DNA extracted from cryopreserved diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples.
