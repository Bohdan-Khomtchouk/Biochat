TITLE
Effects of mutation in a soluble guanylyl cyclase gene

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
Genomic and behavioral investigations were performed to determine the effects of a mutation in a Drosophila soluble guanylyl cyclase gene. A mutant DGCalpha1[3] third chromosome was crossed into a natural rover (for[R]) or natural sitter (for[s]) genetic background. (See Osborne et al. 1997; PMID: 9242616.) First instar larvae were collected and grown on 60mm Petri plates containing 10 mL of food until mid-third instar. (Approximate density was 3 animals per mL food). Larvae were collected and washed quickly with distilled water and were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Co-reared larvae were tested for behavioural effects.  Four independent collections were made for each of the two conditions (Rover_DGCalpha1[3] or sitter_DGCalpha1[3]).
