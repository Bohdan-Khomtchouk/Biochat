TITLE
The Long Noncoding RNA SNHG1 Regulates Both the Local and Distal Genes in Cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Many long noncoding transcripts are involved in cancer progression. Here, we utilized high-throughput microarray to compare the transcriptome alterations between the SNHG1 knockdown or control in HCT116 cell lines. Two independent siRNAs were designed against the SNHG1 cDNA sequence. Thus, we identified 302 genes which were expressionally changed. Moreover, Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that several gene signature were significantly  enriched, such as MAPK signaling pathway, growth factor activity and transcriptional corepresssor activity. Further, GSEA analysis suggested NF-kB signaling pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway were markedly associated with SNHG1-reuglated genes. The present study indicated that SNGH1 regulated both the local and distal genes in cancer progression.

DESIGN
HCT116 cells with SNHG1 knockdown and control. Three biological replicates of each condition were analyzed on Agilent microarray. Please note that experiments were performed technically as dual channel (eg, Cy3 and Cy5-labeled samples hybridized to the same array) but the results were processed as though they are single channel (Cy3 and Cy5 signals are calculated). Thus, the raw data files (one file per two sample records) were linked as Series supplementary file and are indicated in the corresponding sample 'description' field.
