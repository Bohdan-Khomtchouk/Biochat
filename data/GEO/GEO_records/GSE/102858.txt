TITLE
A molecular roadmap of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region reveals BMPER as a novel regulator of HSC maturation [OP9]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the developing embryo, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) emerge from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region but the molecular regulation of this process is poorly understood. Recently, the progression from E9.5 to E10.5 and polarity along the dorso-ventral axis have been identified as clear demarcations of the supportive HSC niche. To identify novel secreted regulators of HSC maturation, we performed RNA-sequencing over these spatio-temporal transitions in the AGM region, and supportive OP9 cell line.

DESIGN
RNA-sequencing profiles of OP9 cells grown in flat, submersed culture or reaggregate and cultured at the liquid-gas interface were compared.

PLATFORM
GPL17021 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Mus musculus)
