TITLE
Acute condensin depletion causes genome decompaction without altering the level of global gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

ORGANISM
Schizosaccharomyces pombe ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; Caenorhabditis elegans

SUMMARY
Condensins are broadly conserved chromosome organizers that function in chromatin compaction and transcriptional regulation, but to what extent these two functions are linked has remained unclear. Here, we analyzed the effect of condensin inactivation on genome compaction and global gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Spike-in-controlled 3C-seq analysis revealed that acute condensin inactivation led to a global decrease in close-range chromosomal interactions as well as more specific losses of homotypic tRNA gene clustering. In addition, we identified a condensin-rich topologically associated domain between the ribosomal DNA and the centromere on chromosome XII that is lost upon condensin inactivation. Unexpectedly, these large-scale changes in chromosome architecture were not associated with global changes in transcript levels as determined by spike-in-controlled mRNA-seq analysis. Our data suggest that the global transcriptional program of S. cerevisiae is resistant to condensin inactivation and the associated profound changes in genome organization.
