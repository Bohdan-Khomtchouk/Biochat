TITLE
Genes expression patterns in Desulfovibrio piezophilus sp. nov. C1TLV30T in response to hydrostatic pressure

ORGANISM
Pseudodesulfovibrio piezophilus C1TLV30

SUMMARY
We have identified differentially expressed genes according to hydrostatic pressure growth conditions in Desulfovibrio piezophilus. The transcriptomic datasets report the molecular mechanisms which could be involved in such adaptation and give information for the piezophile sulfate-reducing bacteria research communities. The data obtained pointed out different responses of D. piezophilus to an increase of hydrostatic pressure.

DESIGN
Transcriptome data of Desulfovibrio piezophilus have been generated with culture at 0.1 MPa (atmospheric pressure, low hydrostatic pressure), 26 or 10 MPa (high hydrostatic pressures). All these cultures have been processed in duplicate.
