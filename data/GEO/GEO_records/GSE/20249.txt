TITLE
Genome-wide profiling of RNA associated to the MSL-complex in Drosophila melanogaster

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
In Drosophila, the global increase in transcription from the X chromosome in males to compensate for its monosomy is mediated by the male-specific-lethal complex (MSL-C) consisting of five proteins and two non-coding RNAs, roX1 and roX2. After an initial sequence dependent recognition by the MSL-C of 150-300 high affinity sites, the spreading to the majority of the X-linked genes depends on local MSL-C concentration and active transcription. Here we ask whether any additional RNA species are associated to the MSL-C. No additional roX were found but a strong association was found between the msl2 mRNA and the MSL-C. Based on our results we propose a model in which a non-chromatin associated partial or complete MSL-C titrates newly transcribed msl2 mRNA and thus feed-back regulates the amount of available MSL-C.
