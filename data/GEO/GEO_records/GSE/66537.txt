TITLE
Global Epigenomic Analysis Indicates that Epialleles Contribute to Allele-specific Expression via Allele-specific Histone Modifications in Hybrid Rice

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to investigate the global ASHM profiles of trimethylation on histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3) in two rice F1 hybrids. A total of 522 to 550 allele-specific H3K27me3 genes and 428 to 494 allele-specific H3K36me3 genes were detected in GL×93-11 and GL×TQ, accounting for 11.09% and 26.13% of the total analyzed genes, respectively. The epialleles between parents were highly related to ASHMs. Further analysis indicated that 52.48% to 70.40% of the epialleles were faithfully inherited by the F1 hybrid and contributed to 33.18% to 46.55% of the ASHM genes. Importantly, 66.67% to 82.69% of monoallelic expression genes contained the H3K36me3 modification. Further studies demonstrated a significant positive correlation of ASE with allele-specific H3K36me3 but not with H3K27me3, indicating that ASHM-H3K36me3 primarily regulates ASE in this study.
