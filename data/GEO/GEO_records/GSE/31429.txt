TITLE
Progesterone and estrogen receptors segregate into different cell subpopulations in the normal human breast

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of normal human mammary epithelial cell subsets enriched for luminal or myoepithelial characteristics on the basis of EpCAM and CD49f expression. Transcription profiles were compared between luminal- and myoepithelial-enriched human MEC subsets following 3D culture from 4 individuals. Gene expression profiles of normal human mammary epithelial cell subsets enriched for mature, luminal progenitor or bipotent progenitor-enriched characteristics on the bais of CD49f, MUC1, CD10, CD133 and Thy1 expression Transcription profiles were compared between unsorted, mature, luminal progenitor-enriched and bipotent progenitor-enriched human MEC subsets following 3D culture from 2 individuals.

DESIGN
Four replicates of luminal-enriched human MECs and 3 replicates of myoepithelial-enriched MECs Transcription profiles of two replicates of unsorted, mature, luminal progenitor-enriched and bipotent progenitor-enriched human MEC subsets were analysed following 3D culture
