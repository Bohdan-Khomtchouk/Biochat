TITLE
Expression data from adult mouse testis exposed to cigarette smoke in utero

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
In the context of male reproductive health, epidemiological studies have observed reduced testis size and abnormal sperm counts and morphology in adult men exposed in utero, although these findings are not always repeated. The ambiguity of these reports is confounded by a lack of controlled animal studies investigating the effects of maternal cigarette smoke exposure on male offspring reproductive health. In this study we examined the effects of cigarette induced reproductive toxicity on male offspring exposed during the gestational and weaning period using our novel direct nasal exposure mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and female subfertility. This was done too gain a better understanding of the adverse effects of gestational maternal smoking on male offspring fertility.

DESIGN
C57BL/6 5 week-old female mice were exposed via the nose-only to cigarette smoke [twelve 3R4F reference cigarettes (University of Kentucky, USA) twice/day, five times per week, for 12-18 weeks]. Each exposure lasted 60 minutes. Control mice received room air. In total, 27 mice underwent cigarette smoke exposure. Eleven week-old female mice exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 weeks were separated into groups of three and housed with a single control stud male aged 7-8 weeks with proven fertility for a maximum of 12 weeks. Females were monitored every second day for post-coital plugs and pregnancy. Pregnant females were separated into single cages and litter sizes/pup weights recorded. Smoke exposure via dams continued throughout mating/pregnancy/lactation until weaning of pups at 21days post birth. The testis of exposed offspring were then collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on an Illumina Sentrix Mouse ref-8 v2 Beadchip
