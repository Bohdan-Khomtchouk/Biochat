TITLE
Mouse Model of Clear Cell Sarcoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Profile gene expression from tumors that develop in mice bearing conditional activation of EWS-ATF1, compared to control mouse tissues from the chest wall as well as tumor samples from mouse models of synovial sarcoma and osteosarcoma achieved by conditional disruption of Rb1 and p53

DESIGN
13 clear cell sarcomas (5 started with Rosa26CreER, 4 with TATCre, 2 with Prx1CreERT2, and 2 with Bmi1IRESCreERT2), 7 osteosarcomas, 6 synovial sarcomas, 6 control samples
