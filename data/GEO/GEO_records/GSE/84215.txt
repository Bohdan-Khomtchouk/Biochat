TITLE
RNA-seq experiments from Saccharomyces cerevisiae overexpressing ubiquitin-related protein Hub1

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
We report introns more efficiently spliced in cells overexpressing ubiquitin-related protein Hub1

DESIGN
Yeast RNA profiles of wild-type HUB1 and HUB1-overexpressing haploid cells deficient in RNA surveillance pathway were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500 system.

PLATFORM
