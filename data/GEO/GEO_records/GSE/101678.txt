TITLE
RNA-seq data of intestinal epithelial cells and lamina propria dendritic cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We report that Klebsiella pneumoniae promote Th1 cell induction in colon. To examine the influence of Klebsiella on colonic epithelial cells (ECs) and lamina propria CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs), we performed RNA seq on them. Germ free mice were orally inoculated with Kp-2H7 or BAA-2552 and total RNA was isolated from colonic ECs and DCs 1 week after inoculation. Furthermore, we examined the involvement of TLRs in induction of Th1 cells using Myd88 KO, Trif KO, Myd88/Trif DKO mice. These deficient germ free mice were orally inoculated with Kp-2H7 and total RNA was isolated from colonic ECs 3 weeks after inoculation.

DESIGN
The gene expression of colonic ECs and DCs isolated from germ free mice, and GF mice inoculated with Kp-2H7 or BAA-2552, and colonic ECs isolated from GF Myd88 KO, Trif KO or Myd88/Trif DKO mice inoculated with Kp-2H7.
