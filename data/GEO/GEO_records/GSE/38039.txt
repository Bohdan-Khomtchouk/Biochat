TITLE
ZNF750 in late keratinocyte differentiation

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Disrupted skin barrier due to altered keratinocyte differentiation is common in pathologic conditions such as atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis and psoriasis. However, the molecular cascades governing keratinocyte terminal differentiation are still poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that a dominant mutation in ZNF750 leads to a clinical phenotype that reminiscent of psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. We defined ZNF750 as a nuclear effector that is strongly activated in and essential for keratinocyte terminal differentiation. ZNF750 knockdown in HaCaT keratinocytes markedly reduced the expression of  epidermal late differentiation markers, including gene subsets of epidermal differentiation complex and skin barrier formation such as FLG, LOR, SPINK5, ALOX12B and DSG1, known to be mutated in various human skin diseases. Furthermore, ZNF750 over-expression in undifferentiated cells induced terminal differentiation genes. Thus, ZNF750 is a regulator of keratinocyte terminal differentiation, and with its downstream targets can serve in future elucidation of therapeutics for common disease of skin barrier

DESIGN
Gene expression analysis: To determine the differentaition signature for HaCaT keratinocytes, with ZNF750 gene silencing, total RNA was isolated in biologic triplicates from cells induced to differentiate for twelve days and hybridized to Affymerix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays.
