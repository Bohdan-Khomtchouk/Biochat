TITLE
Effect of MK591 on gene expression in LNCaP cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Cells were treated with MK591 and gene expression was analyzed with Illumina bead chip array.

DESIGN
LNCaP cells were plated and allowed to grow for 48 hours. Then the cells were treated with MK591, total RNA isolated, and analyzed by Illumina HT-12v4 gene expression array.

PLATFORM
