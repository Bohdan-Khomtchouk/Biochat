TITLE
The mechanism of restoration ovarian function using female germline stem cell

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Germ stem cells are the only stem cells which can produce gametes in vivo. Recently, accumulating evidence demonstrates the isolation and culture of female germline stem cells (FGSCs) from adult mice and humans. Here, we established FGSCs line from single EGFP transgenetic mouse, and traced their differentiation in vivo. Then we compared the follile development from transplanted FGSCs mice (F-TF) with that from wide type mice (F-WT) by RNA-Seq. qRTâ€“PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Using Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer, we generated 51.5 Gb of sequencing data from the 8 samples. On average, we detected expression of 20 966 transcripts. Under the criteria fold change > 2 or < 0.5, we obtained 7005 and 5764 differential expressed genes (DEGs) from F-TF or F-WT,respectively. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) analysis identified core genes and two potential networks during folliculogenesis which were mainly down-regulated after preantral follicle. This study was the first to analyze the development of transplanted FGSCs progressively and would provide the theoretical basis for clinical translational research of FGSCs.

DESIGN
Examination of preantral follicle (PF) and small antral follicle (SAF) from transplanted FGSCs and wild type mice.
