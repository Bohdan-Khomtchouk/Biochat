TITLE
AltitudeOmics gene expression data

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Acclimatization to high altitude over 21 days, and upon re-ascent 7 and 21 days post-descent. See Subudhi et al. (2014) PLoS One 9(3):e92191, PMCID PMC3962396, PMID 24658407 for experiment details.

DESIGN
112 total samples representing 21 subjects at 7 time points (not all subjects represented at all time points) were taken. Significance was determined by change vs. baseline (sea level). Genes represented by probesets showing significant change vs. baseline (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR q-value less than or equal to 0.01) at any time point were subject to WGCNA clustering.

PLATFORM
GPL6244 [HuGene-1_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array [transcript (gene) version]
