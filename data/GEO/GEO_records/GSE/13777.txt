TITLE
Purple sea urchin larvae alter their transcriptome in response to ocean acidification

ORGANISM
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus

SUMMARY
In this research we present a transcriptomics analysis of the physiological response of a marine calcifier, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, to ocean acidification, a decline in ocean pH that results from the absorption of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2). Larvae were raised from fertilization to prism stage in seawater with elevated CO2 conditions based upon IPCC emissions scenario B1 (540ppm CO2) and A1FI (1020ppm CO2).
