TITLE
Gene expression data from Sh-Mt-Gi vs Mt shoot tissues

ORGANISM
Medicago truncatula

SUMMARY
Most vascular flowering plants have the ability to form mutualistic associations with soil fungi from the Glomeromycota. The resulting symbiosis is called an arbuscular mycorrhiza and they are widespread in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world. Although the physical interaction between the symbionts occurs in the root cortex, the symbiosis impacts the physiology of the whole plant. To gain a better understanding of the AM symbiosis, we have used the 16000 feature array to examine gene expression in the leaves of mycorrhizal plants to explore the transcriptional changes that are triggered systemically as a result of the AM symbiosis. Keywords: Medicago truncatula, Mycorrhizal, systemic regulation, microarray profiling

DESIGN
30 days after inoculation, the shoot tissues from Mt/Gi and mock-inoculated (Mt) Medicago plants were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridized to the Medicago Genome Oligo Set Version 1.0 microarray. Six slides including three biological replicates and three dye-swap labeling replicates were hybridized for the experiment.
