TITLE
Expression of villi-specific genes reveals the novel prognostic biomarkers in human various cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The relationship between oncogenesis and embryo development are surprised similarity,  early placental villi development from 6 weeks to 10 weeks of pregnancy were profiled using microarrays. Through comparative villi and mature placenta data, we identified villi-specific genes that were highly expressed in villus. The large fraction of villi-specific genes dysregulated in transcriptional level across tumors and most of villi-specific genes up-regulated in human cancers. Then by the GO enrichment results, we selected 5 immune-related genes, 6 proliferation-related genes, 8 focal adhesion-related genes that were found to have reported with genomic alterations. The expression of three group genes predicted poor prognosis of a subset of tumors. Our strategy provided a fresh idea for discovering the novel prognostic biomarkers of tumors.

DESIGN
There are 44 samples, including 36 villus samples and 8  Postpartum placental samples. Gene expression profiling analysis of these samples was performed using Agilent 4x44K human whole genome gene expression microarray.
