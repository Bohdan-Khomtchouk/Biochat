TITLE
Differential regulation of genes in photoreceptor and other neurons by histone H3 methylation at K4 and K27

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To analyze cell lineage specific transcriptional activation mechanisms during retinogenesis, we purified retinal cells into photoreceptors and other retinal cells, and performed ChIP sequence for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3.

DESIGN
Examination of 2 different histone modifications in Cd73-positive (Cd73P) retinal cells and Cd73-nagative (Cd73N) retinal cells at 3 developmental timepoints.
