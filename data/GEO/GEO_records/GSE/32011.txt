TITLE
Viral small RNAs from Drosophila melanogaster flies infected with  FHVdeltaB2 or FHV.

ORGANISM
Drosophila melanogaster

SUMMARY
We focus our analyses on the description of viral small RNAs (FHVdeltaB2 or FHV) and based on genetic and molecular evidende, classify them and discuss their relevance in antiviral defense.

DESIGN
Small RNAs from adult Drosophila flies from different genetic backgrounds and infected with FHV-deltaB2 or FHV were sequenced using the illumina platform.
