TITLE
Quant Seq analysis of primary stretched rat alveolar type I-like epithelial (AEC-I) cells

ORGANISM
Rattus norvegicus

SUMMARY
Rat AEC-I cell monolayers were generated from primary isolated type-II pneumoncytes by plating them on fibronectin-coated silastic membranes. After 4 days of culturing, type-II pneumocytes trasform into AEC-I cells and form monolayers.

DESIGN
Monolayers were randomized in the following four conditions: 1) unstretched monolayers (NS). 2) Monolayers exposed to 25% surface area change with custom built biaxial cyclic (15/min) stretcher for 6 hours (S). 3) Unstretched monolayers pretreated with 1microM GSK2606414 PERK kinase inhibitor for 18 hours (NS_PI). 4) Stretched monolayers pretreated with 1micro M GSK2606414 for 18 hours (S_PI).
