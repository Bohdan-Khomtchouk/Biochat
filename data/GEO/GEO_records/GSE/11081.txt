TITLE
miRNA arrays: Ago2 transfected vs. Mock, Ago2 IP vs. total RNA

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
miRNAs were enriched from HEK293T cells using the ambion FLASHPAGE fractionater after mock transfection, Ago2 transfection, and FLAG-Ago2 IP. miRNAs were labeled and hybridized: Ago2 transfected vs. mock transfection and Ago2 transfected vs. Ago2 IPs. Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Keywords: Biological Replicate
