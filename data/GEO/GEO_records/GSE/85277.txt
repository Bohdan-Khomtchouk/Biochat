TITLE
Host mechanisms potentially associated with foodborne pathogen Escherichia coli O157 shedding in feedlot beef cattle

ORGANISM
Bos taurus

SUMMARY
Cattle shedding > 10e4 CFU of Escherichia coli O157 per g of feces are defined as super-shedders. RNA-sequencing was performed to identify the transcriptome of tissues, including duodenum, proximal jejunum, distal jejunum, distal jejunum, cecum, spiral colon and descending colon of super-shedder cattle in comparison with non-shedders. The total number of genes detected in gut tissues ranged from 16,846 ± 639 (cecum) to 18,137 ± 696 (distal jejunum), and immune functions were enriched for the transcriptomes of small intestinal tissues, reflecting their greater immune activity than large intestine. Totally 351 differentially expression genes were identified between super-shedders and non-shedders, including 101 up-regulated and 250 down-regulated in super-shedders. Differential gene expression analysis suggested increased T-cell responses and cholesterol absorption in distal jejunum and descending colon, and inhibited B-cell maturation in intestines of super-shedders. distal jejunum of super-shedders. Our findings suggested that host genetics and E. coli O157 activities are involved in super-shedding phenomenon.

DESIGN
We performed a differential analysis of transcriptomes of gut tissues collected from E. coli O157 super-shedders and non-shedders (control), to study molecular mechanisms of super-shedding phenomenon. It is a case control study.
