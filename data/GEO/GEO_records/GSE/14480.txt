TITLE
Phytophthora infestans gene expression during potato infection 2-5 days post inoculation

ORGANISM
Phytophthora infestans

SUMMARY
The expression of genes in P. infestans was monitored over a five day time course of a potato infection. Genes encoding known and putative effector proteins were found induced at two days post-inoculation with expression decaying over the five day time course.

DESIGN
The expression of genes in P. infestans was monitored over a five day time course of a potato infection.  Genes induced or repressed during infection were identified by comparing expression intensities derived from samples of infected potato to baseline expression intensities provided by samples derived from mycelia growing in media (Pea, V8, or RS agar).  Biological replicates were generated for each sample.  Total RNA samples were submitted to NimbleGen for full microarray expression services, including cDNA conversion, Cy3 labeling, hybridizations, and scans.
