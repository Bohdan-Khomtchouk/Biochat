TITLE
The grapevine expression atlas reveals a deep transcriptome shift driving the entire plant into a maturation program

ORGANISM
Vitis vinifera

SUMMARY
The first genome-wide transcriptomic atlas of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is based on 54 diverse samples expressing ~93% of predicted grapevine genes. Pollen and senescent leaves have unique transcriptomes but microarray analysis grouped all other samples into vegetative/green or mature/woody categories based on maturity rather than organ identity. This fundamental transcriptome reprograming during maturation was highlighted by three distinct statistical approaches supported by gene coexpression analysis. The shift to the mature/woody developmental program results from the reiterative coactivation of pathways that are largely inactive in vegetative/green tissues, often involving the coregulation of  neighboring genes and global regulation based on codon preference.

DESIGN
A total of 54 grapevine samples, covering most of the Grape organs at different stages, were collected. Three biological replicates were taken for each sample, resulting in a total of 162 observations. The collected plant organs were: bud, inflorescence, tendril, leaf, stem, root, developing berry, withering berry, seed, rachis, anther, carpel, petal, pollen, and seedling.
