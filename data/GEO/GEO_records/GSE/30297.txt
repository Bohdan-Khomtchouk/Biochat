TITLE
Micro RNA expression from human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens from patients undergoing liver transplantation.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Current selection criteria for liver transplant in patients with HCC (the Milan criteria) do not incorporate biologic metrics. MiRNA expression profiles correlate with HCC recurrence after transplant and can add significant value to the Milan criteria.

DESIGN
MiRNA expression profiles were studied in HCC specimens from patients undergoing liver transplant and correlated with their tumor recurrence status and Milan criteria status.
