TITLE
RNA-Seq of LPA derived macrophages

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Monocytes and macrophages constitute important components of immune system. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages following stimulation with cytokines and/or microbial molecule. Macrophages play central role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, development and its restoration after injury, as well as the initiation and resolution of innate and adaptive immunity. Though macrophages were long considered to be derived from differentiation of bone marrow monocytes, recent studies have proved that tissue resident macrophages are derived from yolk sac macrophages, fetal liver macrophages, can self-replicate from local proliferation. However, during homeostatic adaptations, injury and inflammation macrophages of different phenotypes can be recruited from the monocyte reservoirs of blood, spleen and bone marrow. Our studies show that Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a small lipid molecule converts monocytes into macrophages. We report the gene expression profile of primary mouse bone marrow monocytes treated for 5 days with LPA with respect to control monocytes.

DESIGN
We have performed RNA-seq in mouse bone marrow monocytes and LPA derived macrophages from bone marrow monocytes.
