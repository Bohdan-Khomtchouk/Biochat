TITLE
Expression data from mouse spleens after experimental stroke

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Infection is a major complication and cause of mortality and morbidity after acute stroke however the mechanisms are poorly understood.   After experimental stroke the microarchitecture and cellular composition of the spleen are extensively disrupted resulting in deficits to immune function. We used microarray to determine differentially expressed genes in the spleens of mice after experimental stroke to determine contributers to immunosuppression after stroke.

DESIGN
We extracted RNA from spleens from 3 mice 5 d after experimental stroke when we have shown peak disruption to cellular composition and also from spleens from 2 sham-operated control mice for comparison.
