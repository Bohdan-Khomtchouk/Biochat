TITLE
Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutant gliomas demonstrate a distinct global CpG island methylation profile compared to IDH1 wildtype gliomas using MRSE

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
In order to identify other molecular aberrations that may cooperate with IDH1R132MUT in gliomagenesis, we performed CpG-island methylation profiling analysis using MSRE (Tran et al. Front. Neurosci. 3:57. Doi: 10.3389/neuro.15.005.2009) on a subset of IDH1R132MUT and IDH1R132WT GBMs and found a distinct pattern of CpG island hypermethylation that was detected in all GBMs and lower grade gliomas with IDH1R132MUT. While absent from nearly all IDH1R132WT glioma, the methylation pattern in IDH1R132MUT GBMs shows similarity to the recently reported CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) found to be tightly associated with IDH1R132MUT gliomas(Noushmehr et al. Cancer Cell, Volume 17, Issue 5, 18 May 2010, Pages 510-522, ISSN 1535-6108, DOI: 10.1016/j.ccr.2010.03.017).

DESIGN
Methylation profiling performed on 40 distinct brain tumor samples: 7 Anaplastic Astrocytomas, including 3 IDH1MUT and 4 IDH1WT; 5 Lowgrade Astrocytomas, including 4 IDH1MUT and 1 IDH1WT; 28 Glioblastoma, including 8 IDH1MUT and 20 IDH1WT.
