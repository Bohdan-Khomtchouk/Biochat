TITLE
Expression data from Arabidopsis Col and rglg1/2 mutant in response to Fe deficiency

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Iron is an essential element for almost all organisms, catalyzing numerous essential redox reactions by virtue of its unique electrochemical properties. Iron levels in cells need to be carefully balanced. Rglg1/2 is an Arabidopsis mutant which display a pleiotropic phenotype partly resembling iron-deficient plants.To dissect global transcriptional regulation of gene expression in iron-deficient plants, we conducted genome-wide proteomic and transcriptomic surveys of leaves and roots from iron-sufficient and iron-deficient Col-0 wild-type plants and rglg1 rglg2 double mutants.

DESIGN
Ten days old Col and rglg1/2 plants were treated with Fe-suficiency and Fe-deficiency for 3 days.  Leaves and roots sample were collected respectively.
