TITLE
Transcriptome profiles derived from parallel venipuncture, dried blood spot (DBS), and saliva samples

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Comparison of transcript abundance estimates derived from DBS vs saliva vs gold standard peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiling was conducted using parallel collection and assay of venipuncture blood samples (PBMC), DBS samples, and saliva. Data come from 58 community dwelling adults recruited from the Los Angeles metropolitan area.  Analyzed data include basic demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and body mass index (BMI) as well as RNA indicators of major leukocyte subset prevalence (i.e., estimated abundance of mRNA for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, FCGR3A/CD16, NCAM1/CD56, and CD14; all provided here as log2-transformed values of normalized gene expression data).  Categorial variables were coded 0=no/absent and 1=yes/present.
