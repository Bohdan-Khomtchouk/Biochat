TITLE
β3 agonist administration before reperfusion reduces infarct size  and improves long term cardiac function in small and large animal models of myocardial infarction

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
RNA sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analyses were performed at early reoxygenation stages in HL-1 cardiomyocytes treated or not with BRL37344 Methods: HL-1 cardiomyocytes were subjected to Hypoxia/Reoxygenation (6h/1h) with/without a β3AR agonist (BRL37344 5µmol/L). mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing,  in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx.The sequence reads that passed quality filters were quantified using BWA aligned reads using RSEM. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assay. Results: After 6h of hypoxia followed by 1h reoxygenation, 866 genes were differentially expressed upon β3AR stimulation by BRL37344. Among these, 177 were at least 2-fold up or downregulated. Conclusions: Our results show that Hsp70 plays a key role in the cardioprotection afforded by β3AR agonism in cardiomyocytes during the early window of H/R.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from cardiomyocyte subjected to H/R (6h/1h)  with/without a β3AR agonist  were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx.
