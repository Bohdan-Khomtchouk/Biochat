TITLE
Oncogenic Ras regulated long non-coding RNA Orilnc1 in human cancer

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ras and its downstream cascades transmit cellular signals, resulting in increased transcription of a large  number of genes involved in cell growth and division. Research on long non-coding transcripts regulated  by the Ras signaling cascade is still in its infancy. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are operationally  defined as transcripts that are larger than 200 nt that do not appear to have protein-coding potential. Using  a custom-designed lncRNA microarray, we identified a novel lncRNA (oncogenic Ras-induced lncRNA 1,  Orilnc1) whose expression is significantly induced by activation of Ras. Further molecular studies  demonstrated that the expression of Orilnc1 is regulated by the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade via  the transcriptional factor AP1. Importantly, Orilnc1 is highly expressed in BRAF mutant cancers such as  BRAF-driven melanoma. Inhibition of Orilnc1 expression by small RNA interference (siRNA)  significantly blocked tumor cell proliferation and growth in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we observed that  blocking Orilnc1 reduced expression levels of cell cycle related genes such as Cyclin E1 and induced G1/S  arrest in tumor cells. Taken together, Orilnc1 may function as a novel non-protein mediator to respond the  Ras/Raf activation and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for RAS or BRAF-driven cancers such  as melanoma.

DESIGN
KRASG12D- expressing or control lentiviruses were used to infect IMR90 cells, and total  RNAs were harvested from cells at different time points (0, 4, 7, and 10 days for KRas cells and 0, 7, and  10 days for control cells).
