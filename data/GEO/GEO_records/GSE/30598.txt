TITLE
miRNA profiling in the adult mouse incisor

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
miRNA expression was compared in 3 distinct regions of the adult mouse incisor: the labial cervical loop, which houses ameloblast stem cells; the lingulal cervical loop, which houses stem cells but not ameloblast stem cells; and ameloblasts. Differentially expressed miRNAs from these regions are likely involved in the renewal and differentiation of stem cells.

DESIGN
miRNA expression in the labial and lingual cervical loops, and ameloblasts were compared from 5 specimens.
