TITLE
Expression analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv biofilm after treatment with DTT ( Reduced) for 29 hrs

ORGANISM
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv

SUMMARY
Expression profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv biofilm as induced by DTT (Reduced) 6mM

DESIGN
DTT reduced at 6 mM concentration was added to log phase culture of Mtb H37Rv. After 29 hours RNA was isolated and hybridization was done on microarrays

PLATFORM
GPL4057 PHRI-UMNDJ Mycobacterium tuberculosis 4.8K CAG_Mtb
