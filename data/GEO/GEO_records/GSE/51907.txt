TITLE
Alterations in the gene expression profile in patients treated with cyclophosphamide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in patients treated with cyclophosphamide We have studied the gene expression profile for 11 patients with different types of hematological malignancies but all of them have been treated with CP i.v.

DESIGN
Eleven patients were enrolled in this study. All of them were treated by i.v. infusion of CP 60 mg/kg/day once for 2 days followed by TBI. Blood samples were collected from each patient before the start of CP infusion, 6 h after CP first dose, before CP second dose (24 h after first dose) and 6 h after it.
