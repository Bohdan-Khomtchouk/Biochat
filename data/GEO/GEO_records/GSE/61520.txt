TITLE
Mycoplasma gallisepticum Lipid Associated Membrane Proteins Up-regulate Inflammatory Genes in Chicken Tracheal Epithelial Cells via TLR-2 Ligation Through an NF-κB Dependent Pathway

ORGANISM
Gallus gallus

SUMMARY
To identify differential gene expression profiles of chicken tracheal epithelial cells (TECs) upon exposure to Mycoplasma gallisepticum virulent strain Rlow and avirulent strain Rhigh and corresponding lipid associated membrane proteins(LAMP) at 1.5 hours in vitro. Goal of this experiment was to identify relative comtribution of LAMPs in up-regulation of inflammatory gene compared to the live strains. Several genes were identified to be differentially regulated in all exposures, but the virulent strain up-regulated more number genes as well as at a higher extent. We identified 6 important inflammatory mediators and did confirmatory RT-qPCR analysis at 1.5, 6 and 24 hours in vitro as well as at 1.5 and 6 hours ex-vivo. RT-qPCR was also employed to identify expression of these 6 genes in presence of different signalling inhibitors and we were able to identify that Mycoplasma gallisepticum LAMPs up-regulate these inflammatory genes via TLR-2 in an NF-κB dependent pathway.

DESIGN
Primary chicken tracheal epithelial cells (TECs) were exposed to either 500 MOI of a virulent Mycoplasma gallisepticum strain Rlow or an avirulent strain Rhigh and the corresponding lipid associated membrane proteins (LAMPs) at 5µg/mL for 1.5 hours. 4 biological replicates along with a dye swap technique totalling 8 replicates were utilized for all microarray experiments
