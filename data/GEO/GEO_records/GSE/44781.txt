TITLE
Expression data for plant compensatory responses

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Plant compensatory responses depends on transcriptional reprogramming. We used microarray analysis to understand the differential gene expression pattern between clipped (herbivore browsed) and unclipped plant.

DESIGN
Arabidopsis ecotypes Columbia and Landsberg erecta were chosen due to their differential compensatory response. The plants were grown in greenhouse. At bolting stage the plants were clipped to imitate herbivore damage. Following day the samples were collected from clipped and unclipped plants.
