TITLE
High-resolution comparative genome hybridization survey of healthy individuals (chromosome 22)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
HighRes-CGH arrays that utilize â‰ˆ385,000 distinct oligonucleotide probes to cover chromosome 22 at 85 bp resolution (tiling path step size) were designed and synthesized as previously described (Urban et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006;103(12):4534-9; see also GSE4240 record). Here, two healthy individuals were studied using the same experimental protocols as in Urban et al. Keywords: high-resolution comparative genome hybridization using oligonucleotides
