TITLE
Microarray transcriptome analysis of soybean genes induced during rhizobial, arbuscular mycorrhizal and their dual symbioses

ORGANISM
Glycine max

SUMMARY
For identification of plant gene networks which interact to initiate and support both rhizobial nodulation and AM fungal colonization, the transcription profiles of soybean genes induced during rhizobial, AM and their dual symbioses.

DESIGN
Four different treatments were used: an uninoculated control, inoculation with rhizobium alone (rhizobial symbiosis), inoculation with AM fungus alone (AM symbiosis), and inoculation with rhizobium and AM fungus together (dual symbiosis). After the soybeans inoculated were grown in a glasshouse for 6 weeks, the transcriptome of host genes were analyzed using a cDNA microarray
