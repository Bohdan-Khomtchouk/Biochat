TITLE
Bmpr2 mutation in murine PMVEC

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is thought to be driven by dysfunction of pulmonary vascular microendothelial cells (PMVEC). Most hereditary PAH is associated with BMPR2 mutations. However, the physiologic and molecular consequences of expression of BMPR2 mutations in PMVEC are unknown.

DESIGN
PMVEC were isolated from triple transgenic mice carrying the immortomouse gene, a transactivator, and either control, Bmpr2delx4+ or Bmpr2R899X mutation
