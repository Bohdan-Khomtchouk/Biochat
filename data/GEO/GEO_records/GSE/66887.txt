TITLE
The INO80 chromatin remodeling complex regulates the gene expression under oxidative stress condtion (stress)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
RNA micro array analyses were performed using Arp5-, Arp8-knockout and Arp8-over expression Nalm-6 cells treated with heme, an oxidative stress inducer. As a result, various genes were up- or down- regulated in both Arp5- and Arp8-knockout cells. Because of these Arps are essential and specific component of the INO80 complex, it was quite possible that the INO80 complex was related to these genes expression under oxidative stress condition.

DESIGN
Each cell was treated with heme, an oxidative stress inducer for 12 hour. Total RNAs were extracted and subjected to microarray analysis.
