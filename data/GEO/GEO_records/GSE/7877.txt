TITLE
Effect of acute creatine monohydrate supplementation on skeletal muscle transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of vastus lateralis muscle of young, healthy, non-obese men supplemented with creatine monohydrate vs. placebo for 10 days. Results identify transcriptional pathways activated in skeletal muscles as a result of acute creatine monohydrate supplementation. Keywords: Supplementation response.

DESIGN
In a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, double-blind design, 12 young, healthy, non-obese men were supplemented with either a placebo or creatine monohydrate (loading phase, 20 g/d x 3 d; maintenance phase, 5 g/d x 7 d) for 10 d.  Following a 28 day washout period, subjects were put on the alternate supplementation for 10 days.  Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis were obtained and were assessed for global mRNA expression using cDNA microarrays.
