TITLE
Effect of acute creatine monohydrate supplementation on skeletal muscle transcriptome

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Expression profiling of vastus lateralis muscle of young, healthy, non-obese men supplemented with creatine monohydrate vs. placebo for 10 days. Results identify transcriptional pathways activated in skeletal muscles as a result of acute creatine monohydrate supplementation. Keywords: Supplementation response.
