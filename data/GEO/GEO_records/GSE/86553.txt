TITLE
Identification of hypoxia-induced HIF1A targets in melanocytes reveals a molecular profile associated with poor prognosis for melanoma [gene expression]

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
These datasets describe a melanocyte specific, HIF1A-Dependent / Hypoxia-Responsive gene expression signature defined by the regulation of genes critical to metabolism, chromatin and transcriptional regulation, vascularization and cellular invasivness. These genes provide lineage specific targets for refinement of diagnostic markers associated with primary melanoma tumor metastatic potential, and also provides novel molecular targets for therapeutic strategies targeting metastatic disease progression.

DESIGN
Microarray gene expression analysis was performed in biological triplicate for each condition of immortal melanocyte cell line, melan Ink4a-Arf  grown  cells. contributor: NISC Comparative Sequencing Program
