TITLE
Expression data from healthy control human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) treated with wild-type IL-2 or F42K

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
IL-2 mutant (F42K) is a variant of IL-2 that binds preferentially to the lower affinity IL-2Rβγ and has minimal binding to CD25, on Tregs, effector NK and T-cell subsets. Our recent study has uncovered that in contrast to WT IL-2, F42K did not efficiently induce the expansion of highly suppressive ICOS+ Tregs in PBMC from healthy controls and melanoma patients whereas it did promote the expansion of NK cells. We used microarray to study the differences of gene profiles induced by wild-type (WT) IL-2, F42K and IL-15 when treated on freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy control.

DESIGN
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from buffy coat and were stimulated with 0.4nM WT IL-2, F42K or IL-15 for 24 hr. Total RNA was extracted from each WT IL-2, F42K and IL-15 treated PBMCs and Sense RNA was reverse-transcribed via RT reaction into DNA and labeled with biotin using Affymetrix labeling kits and hybridized on human Affymetrix microarray chip.
