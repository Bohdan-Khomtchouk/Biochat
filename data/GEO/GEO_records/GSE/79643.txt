TITLE
Development of gene expression signatures for CXXC5 in pDCs

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes regulated by CXXC5 in pDCs. pDCs (CD11c+B220+CD11b-) were differentitated from wild-type and CXXC5-deficient bone marrows by FLT3L for 6 days and sorted by FACS. Expression of five genes (Irf7,Ccl1,Smtn,Dppa2,Ifnab) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR.

DESIGN
Gene expression was measured in WT and CXXC5-deficient pDCs.
