TITLE
Physiological and transcriptional response of Bacillus cereus treated with low-temperature nitrogen gas plasma

ORGANISM
Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579

SUMMARY
Aims: To investigate the inactivation kinetics of Bacillus cereus vegetative cells upon exposure to low-temperature nitrogen gas plasma and to reveal the mode of inactivation by transcriptome profiling.  Methods and results:  Exponentially growing B. cereus cells were filtered and put on agar plates. The plates, carrying the filters with the vegetative cells, were placed into nitrogen gas plasma at atmospheric pressure and cold temperature (~37°C). After different exposure times the cells were harvested for RNA extraction and enumeration. The RNA was used to perform whole transcriptome profiling using DNA microarrays. The transcriptome profile showed a large overlap with profiles obtained from conditions generating reactive oxygen species inside B. cereus. However, excess radicals such as peroxynitrite, hydroxyl and or superoxide were not found.  Conclusions:  Antibacterial activity of nitrogen gas plasmas is not based on UV radiation but on the formation of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species in the plasma jet rather than inside the targeted cells.  Significance and impact of the study:  This study represents the ﬁrst investigation of differential gene expression on a genome-wide scale in B. cereus following nitrogen gas plasma exposure. This study may help to design cheap, safe, and effective plasma decontamination devices.
