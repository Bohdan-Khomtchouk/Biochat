TITLE
Zebrafish immune response to bacterial and viral infection

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
In order to explore the relative importance of adult zebrafish innate and adaptive immune responses to different kinds of infections, we compared the gene expression profile of VHSV-challenge-survivors, bacterial infection survivors  and control non infected zebrafish.

DESIGN
VHSV -infection-survivors zebrafish were divided in two groups of 12 individuals, first group was infected with VHSV (samples named A) and second group was mock-infected (samples named B). Two days after challenge, zebrafish of each group were divided in four subgroups (3 fishes per group) and head kidney and spleen  of each individual were sampled. For each group, internal organs of three fishes were pooled, so four biological replicates were generated . Zebrafish surviving a natural infection caused by Aeromonas hydrophila and  Vibrio fluvialis (samples named C) were divided in four groups (3 fishes per group) and head kidney and spleen were extracted. Finally, 12 healthy zebrafish were used as control group (samples named D) and processed in the same way as group C.
