TITLE
TIA proteins drives global and specific translational repression of genes linked to the cell-cycle progression and DNA replication/repair

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The reduction of T-cell intracellular antigen (TIA) proteins in transformed cells leads to the acquisition of aberrant cellular phenotypes promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor growth. Here we show that global and specific translational rates are regulatory gene events that contribute markedly to the acquisition of above cellular phenotypes. For example, we observe a significant increase of ribosomal population and translational machinery components in TIA-reduced HeLa cells. Polysomal microarray analysis shows specific changes at both the transcript and translational level following TIA reduction, identifying translationally regulated mRNAs that are not transcriptionally regulated which seem to be prevalent for the adaptation to the new environmental conditions. Validation of microarray data using RT-QPCR and immunological analysis for representative genes were carried out. Up-regulated in this class of mRNA are those involved in cell-cycle progression and DNA replication/repair, including several mRNAs with specific sequences to bind TIA proteins. Our data support a hypothesis that a concerted activation of both global and selective translational rates is relevant for the transition from quiescent to proliferative status in TIA-depleted HeLa cells.
