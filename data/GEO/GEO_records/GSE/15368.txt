TITLE
Expression analysis of Saos-2 cells expressing p53-His273

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Our compound (PRIMA) selectively kills tumor cells expressing mutant p53. Here in our study we decided to investigate the impact of our compound on the transcriptome of p53 mutant-expressing cells, Saos2-His273.

DESIGN
We plated Saos-2-His273 cells and treated them with our compound for 6h or 12h. We then harvested the cells, extracted the RNA, and followed the protocol to run affymetrix array to analyse the impact of our drug on the whole transcriptome of cells expressing mutant p53.
