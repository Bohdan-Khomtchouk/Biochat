TITLE
ChIP-seq of cyclin-dependent kinases

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are known to have roles in transcriptional regulation. Â The datasets presented here are ChIP-seq experiments for different CDKs and RNA polymerase II in murine embryonic stem cells and Jurkat cells.

DESIGN
ChIP-Seq of cyclin-dependent kinases in mouse embryonic stem cells and Jurkat human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line
