TITLE
Identification of genes modulated by JIB-04 in lung cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
JIB-04 is an inhibitor of Jumonji histone demethylases identified through a cell based screen that measures the reactivation of an epigenetically silenced transgene. The active JIB-04 E-isomer shows selectivity for cancer vs. normal cells affecting both transcriptional patterns and cell viability in a cancer specific manner.

DESIGN
H358 lung cancer cells or the patient matched HCC4017 (cancer) vs. HBEC30KT (immortalized normal) lung cell pair were treated with DMSO vehicle or 500nM E-isomer or 500 nM Z-isomer of JIB-04 for 4 h or 24 h and RNA extracted.
