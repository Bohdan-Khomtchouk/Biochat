TITLE
Evolutionary origin and functional divergence of stem cell homeobox genes in eutherian mammals

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We individually examined the ability of human ARGFX, DPRX, LEUTX, and TPRX1 to regulate gene expression by ectopically expressing these proteins in fibroblasts.

DESIGN
Each gene along with an empty control vector were transfected individually to drive ectopic expression in human dermal fibroblasts, in triplicate.
