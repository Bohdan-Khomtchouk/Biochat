TITLE
Expression data from rice meiosis-stage young inflorescences

ORGANISM
Oryza sativa

SUMMARY
Thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines and photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile (PGMS) lines have been successfully used in hybridization to improving rice yields. The molecular mechanisms underlying male sterility transitions in most PGMS/TGMS rice lines are unclear, but in the recently developed TGMS-Co27 lines which is based on co-suppression of a UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene (Ugp1). UGPase protein accumulates in TGMS-Co27 florets at low temperatures and temperature-sensitive splicing is involved in its sterility transitions.However, details of the molecular mechanisms involved are unknown. we use microarrays to compare transcriptomic profiles during the meiosis-stage of flower development in TGMS-Co27 and wild-type (H1493) plants grown at high and low temperatures. The detected differences in expression profiles provide further understanding of the regulatory networks underlying flower development generally, identify genes involved in the TGMS process in TGMS-Co27 and may provide reference data for analyses of molecular mechanisms underlying sterility transitions in other PGMS/TGMS rice lines.

DESIGN
Meiosis-stage inflorescences were used for this study because pollen mother cells (PMCs) of TGMS-Co27 plants begin to degenerate at this stage. Samples from H1493 grown at high temperature, TGMS-Co27 grown at high temperature, H1493 grown at low temperature and TGMS-Co27 grown at low temperature were harvested to compare the difference between fertile and sterile rice lines.
