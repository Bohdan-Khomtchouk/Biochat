TITLE
Gene expression during conidia germination in Neurospora crassa on different media

ORGANISM
Neurospora crassa

SUMMARY
Conidia germination is critical for fungi to colonize various habitats. We sampled RNA expression at four stages of conidia germination, including fresh conidia (15min), polar growth (120min), doubling of long axis (240min), and first hyphal branching (360min) in Neurospora crassa. Cultures were made on two different media, including Bird medium supporting only asexual development and maple sap medium supporting both asexual and sexual development, and two biological replicates were collected for all data points. The growth was under a labratory condition of 25C and constant light.

DESIGN
mRNA were sampled and compared from four time points across conida germination in Neurpsora crassa on different media

PLATFORM
GPL20705 Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Neurospora crassa)
