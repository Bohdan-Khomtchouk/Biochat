TITLE
Expression data of tongue mucosa from normal mice and mice treated by the 4-NQO

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
A better understanding of molecular changes during oral tumorigenesis may help defining new personalized prevention strategies. In order to test this hypothesis, we analyzed whole-genome expression changes in a murine model of oral carcinogenesis, induced by an oral carcinogen (4-NQO) We generated genome-wide expression profiles of microdissected cells from murine tongue at each step of oral tumorigenesis: normal mucosa, hyperplasia, dysplasia and tumor.

DESIGN
4-NQO was administered in half of them in their drinking water at the dose of 100 ug/mL for 8 weeks. Four mice treated with 4-NQO and four control mice were sacrificed every four weeks. Immediately following death, tongues were excised, longitudinally bisected, each half of the tongue was frozen on dry ice, embedded in OCT and stored at -80Â°C. By week 24, experiment was completed. Sections of mouse tongues allowed to identify histologic changes associated with oral tumorigenesis including normal mucosa in untreated mice tongue, and hyperplasia, dysplasia, and tumor in 4-NQO treated mice tongue. Biological replicates of normal mucosa, hyperplasia, dysplasia and tumor from 3 different mice were selected for microdissection and RNA extraction.
