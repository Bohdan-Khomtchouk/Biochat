TITLE
Vitamin D/Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) Axis Regulates LMNA gene expression [ChIP-Seq]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
ChIP with VDR antibody followed by DNA sequencing to determine if VDR binds the LMNA gene locus

DESIGN
BJ fibroblasts were treated with 10-7 M 1,25D or FBS (vehicle) for 24 h, and cells crosslinked, sonicated, and chromatin isolated to perform ChIP analyses as described in Gonzalez-Suarez et al. EMBO Journal 2009. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using anti-VDR antibody (10 mg) or IgG (10 mg) as control.

PLATFORM
GPL17303 Ion Torrent Proton (Homo sapiens)
