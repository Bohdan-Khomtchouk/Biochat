TITLE
RNA-Seq characterization of human H1-derived NPC differentiation timecourse

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
High resolution transcriptional profiling of H1-derived human neuronal precursor cells over a timecourse of differentiation in vitro.

DESIGN
Human NPC differentiation timecourse covers Days 0,1,2,4,5,11, and 18 after induction of neuronal differentiation as described in manuscript. Each time point was assayed in triplicate cultures with the exception of Day 5, in which one outlier culture has been removed.
