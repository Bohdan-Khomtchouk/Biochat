TITLE
Gene expression profiles of wild type and Actinin 4 point mutant knock-in adult podocyte cells at 2, 5 and 44 weeks following TRAP purification. (GUDMAP Series ID: 49)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The long term goal is to create an encyclopaedia of podocyte gene expression both in homeostasis, development and disease.  Podocytes are identified by their expression of an eGFPL10a fusion protein whose expression is driven by a Col1a1 promoter fragment.  Podocyte-specific RNA is generated by eGFP-affinity purification of polysomes and then subject to microarray analysis. Expression profiling of wild type and  Actinin 4 point mutant knock-in kidney podocytes by TRAP.

DESIGN
Col1a1-eGFPL10a mice were crossed against Actn4+/tm1.1Plk (KI) mice.  Wild-type or KI mice were subject to TRAP at the following time points: 2, 5 and 44 weeks.
