TITLE
Characterization of an astrocyte perivascular endfeet transcriptome

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
We aim to identify mRNAs present in astrocyte endfeet. We performed a microarray study comparing mRNAs extracted from brain vessels purified from 2-month-old C57Bl6 mice, submitted or not to a partial basal lamina  enzymatic digestion,  allowing to remove astrocyte endfeet membranes and their associated astroglial mRNAs from the purified vessels. mRNAs depleted upon basal lamina digestion represent a specific population of astrocyte mRNAs transported in the perivascular endfeet

DESIGN
Four independent cDNA libraries were prepared for each condition (digested and undigested 2-month-old C57Bl6 brain vessels) and hybridized on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 Array
