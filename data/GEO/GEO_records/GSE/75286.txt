TITLE
A polymorphic intronic enhancer at 19q12 drives CCNE1 expression in bladder cancer cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation against a marker of active regulatory elements in bladder cancer cell lines to highlight regulatory regions specific to the bladder cancer genome. We then compared our dataset to other publicly available datasets to identify any novel, bladder-specific regulatory regions that also overlap with bladder-associated inherited polymorphisms. We used this procedure to determine that there is an intronic enhancer within the CCNE1 gene that binds KLF5 and modulates CCNE1 expression.

DESIGN
Examination of 1 histone modification (H3K27ac) in 3 different bladder cancer cell lines

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
