TITLE
Comparative Transcriptional Profiling of Human Merkel cells and Merkel Cell Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Merkel cell carcinoma is supposed to be derived from Merkel cells after infection by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) and other poorly known events. A transcriptional profiling with cDNA microarrays was performed on cells from MCPyV(+) Merkel cell carcinomas and isolated normal Merkel cells. This microarray revealed numerous significantly upregulated genes and downregulated genes. The extensive list of genes identified in these experiments provides a large body of potentially valuable information of Merkel cell carcinoma carcinogenesis and could represent a source of potential targets for cancer therapy.

DESIGN
Three-condition experiment: MCPyV(+), MCPyV(-) and Normal Merkel Cells. Biological replicates: 4 MCPyV(+) and 1 MCPyV(-)(Cy5), 1 control = pool of Normal Merkel cells from 3 liftings (Cy3).
