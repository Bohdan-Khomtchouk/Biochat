TITLE
Regulatory remodeling in the allo-tetraploid frog Xenopus laevis

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis

SUMMARY
Genome duplication has played a pivotal role in the evolution of many eukaryotic lineages, including the vertebrates.The most recent vertebrate genome duplication is that in Xenopus laevis, which resulted from the hybridization of two closely related species about 17 million years ago.  Here we generated epigenetic profiles and determined gene expression in X.laevis  embryos to study the consequences of this duplication at the level of the genome, the epigenome and gene expression.

DESIGN
Genomic DNA of Xenopus tropicalis and Xenopus laevis; RNA-seq (two replicates) in stage 10.5 Xenopus laevis embryos; ChIP-seq for H3K4me3 and p300 (each two replicates) in Xenopus laevis (LELS), Xenopus tropicalis (TETS) and Xenopus tropicals x laevis (hybrid; LETS) embryos.
