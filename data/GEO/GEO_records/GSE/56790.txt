TITLE
Genetic stability in FA cells before and after gene editing and cell reprogramming.

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Fibroblasts from a Fanconi anemia (FA) patient  (FA-52) before and after correction by gene editing and transduction with a lentiviral vector expressing telomerase (geFA-52T fibroblasts). IPCs were generated from fibroblasts corrected by gene editing using STEMCCA LV (geFA-52T IPSCs clone 16) and finally the reprogramming cassette was excised (excised geFA-52T IPSCs clone 16.1)

DESIGN
Four groups: Fibroblasts from a FA patient  (FA-52) before and after correction by gene editing and transduction with a lentiviral vector expressing telomerase (geFA-52T) and gene editied IPSCs before and after excision of the reprogramming cassette (geFA-52T IPSCs clone 16 and excised geFA-52T IPSCs clone 16.1)
