TITLE
Treatment of AML patient samples with decitabine

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of AML patient samples treated with PBS or DAC. The Illumina Infinium 450 Human DNA methylation was used to examine the methylation profile of 8 patient samples and 2 cell lines. Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of AML xenografts treated with either PBS control or with decitacine (DAC) alone, cytarabine (Ara-C) alone, DAC and Ara-C together (D+A), DAC followed by Ara-C (D/A) or with Ara-C followed by DAC (A/D).

DESIGN
DNA was extracted from patient bone marrow samples and xenograft bone marrow samples using Qiagen Allprep kit. Bisulphite converted DNA from all samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450 Human Methylation arrays and for each analysis the drug treated sample was compared to the corresponding PBS control sample.
