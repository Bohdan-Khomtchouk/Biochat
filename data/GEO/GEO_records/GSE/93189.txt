TITLE
Identification of genes misregulated in developing seeds of Arabidopsis in response to myb92 mutation and to MYB92 overexpression

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
ra15-01_myb92 - identification of genes misregulated to myb92 mutant and myb92 oe. - What are the genes over expressed or down regulated in seeds in response to a myb92 mutation or to MYB92 overexpression? - Plants of the different genotypes (wild-type, myb92 mutant, MYB92 overexpressing line) were grown in a green house, their flower were tagged and seeds were harvested 14 days after anthesis. Seeds were extracted from the siliques, stored at -80Â°C prior to RNA extraction.

DESIGN
4 dye-swap - gene knock in (transgenic),gene knock out,normal vs transgenic comparaison

PLATFORM
GPL18904 Agilent-047069 CATMAv7 [Probe Name Version]
