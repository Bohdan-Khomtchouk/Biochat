TITLE
Histone modifications in primary intestinal epithelial cells from wild type (F/FUN) and intesinal NCoR1 deletion (ΔIECUN) neonates.

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
ChIP-seq analyses were carried out in intestinanl epithelial cells (IECs) isolated from F/FUN and ΔIECUN mice to assess histone modifications across the genome, an event that links the actions of corepressors with molecular insight towards a mechanism.

DESIGN
Examination of 6 different histone modifications in IECs with or without the presence of NCoR1.
