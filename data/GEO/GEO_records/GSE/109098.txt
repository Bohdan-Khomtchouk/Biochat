TITLE
Spec-seq data for ZFY and its truncated variants

ORGANISM
synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We used previously developed method, Spec-seq, to characterize the protein-DNA interaction specificity of human and mouse Zinc Finger Y protein.

DESIGN
In this data set, we included differently truncated versions of ZFY, i.e., human ZFY(F11-F13), human ZFY(F9-F13), human ZFY(F7-F13), mouse ZFY(F7-F13), human ZFY(F1-F11). With the same set of randomized dsDNA libraries used, we found the F12-F13 confered the highest specificity to GGCC motif, and the accessory finger bind to some extended secondary motif ----TAG---TTT--- in irregular way.
