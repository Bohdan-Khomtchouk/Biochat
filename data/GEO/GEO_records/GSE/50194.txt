TITLE
Identification of candidate microRNAs in colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens ; synthetic construct

SUMMARY
We showed that some microRNAs could be characteristic of the progression from adenoma to adenocarcinoma in colorectal cancer.

DESIGN
48 colorectal biopsy samples (28 adenomas, 15 adenocarcinomas and 5 normal mucosae) were analyzed. We generated three comparisons: adenomas versus. normal mucosae, adenocarcinomas versus. normal mucosae, and adenocarcinomas versus. adenomas.
