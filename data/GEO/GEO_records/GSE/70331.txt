TITLE
Expression of AWR5 in wild type and cdc55 deletion mutant at 6 h of induction

ORGANISM
Saccharomyces cerevisiae

SUMMARY
Expressing the type III effector AWR5 of the phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum in yeast cells causes cessation of growth and transcriptional changes reminiscent of inhibition of the TOR pathway. Deletion of cdc55, a regulatory subunit of the PP2A Ser/Thr protein phosphatase eliminates the strong growth defect caused by AWR5 expression. This experiments aims to identify the impact of the cdc55 mutation in the transcriptome of AWR5-expressing cells.

DESIGN
induction of AWR5 in JA-100 CDC55 tetO:AWR5-GFP and JA-100 cdc55 tetO:AWR5-GFP

PLATFORM
GPL17143 Illumina MiSeq (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
