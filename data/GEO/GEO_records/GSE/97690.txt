TITLE
Identification of Pax7 target genes in muscle progenitor cells from young mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To identify Pax7 target genes in muscle progenitor cells, we compared the transcriptome profiles of muscle progenitor cells from young mice (P12) with and without Pax7.

DESIGN
Isolate muscle progenitor cells from young mice (control and Pax7-KO), extract total RNA and subject them to RNA-seq

PLATFORM
GPL11002 Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Mus musculus)
