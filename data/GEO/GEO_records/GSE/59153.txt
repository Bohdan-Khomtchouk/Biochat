TITLE
Modification of miRNA profile in Caco-2 cells by dietary lipids

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The aim of this study was to detect miRNAs modified by biactive dietary lipids in a cellular model of enterocytes. The selected model was Caco-2 cells

DESIGN
Differentiated Caco-2 cells were incubated with micelles containing the lipids for 24 and 48 hours. The expression leveles of the miRNAs were compared with cells treated with empty micelles. Four control and choelsterol samples, three DHA samples and two CLA samples were analyzed variables: Control (Empty micelles), Cholesterol 250 µM 48h, DHA 200 µM 24h, CLA 200µM 24h Biological replicates Control: Samples 137, 159, 160, 210 Cholesterol: Samples 150, 151, 152, 219 DHA: Samples 141, 142, 143 CLA: Samples 144, 146
