TITLE
Thyroid hormone induced changes in Xenopus laevis tadpole brain

ORGANISM
Xenopus laevis ; unidentified

SUMMARY
Premetamorphic Xenopus laevis tadpoles brain ventricle cells respond to thyroid hormone by proliferation and subsequent differentiation. The goal of this experiment is to identify the genes involved in the TH-induced proliferation pathway in tadpole brain and compare it to TH-induced proliferation and differentiation program in tadpole limb. Xenopus tadpoles (NF54) were treated with 1 mM methimazole in 0.1 X MMR solution for 1 week to block the endogenous TH production and reduce the TH present in the system of the tadpole. They were then treated with 100 nM T3 in 1 mM methimazole and 0.1 x MMR for another 24h and 48h or without T3 for 48h (control group). Brains from the tadpoles were dissected at the end of the experiment. Keywords: development or differentiation design,organism part comparison design,reference design,replicate design,time series design
