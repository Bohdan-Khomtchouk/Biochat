TITLE
Comprehensive Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs in Purified Cell Types from the Brain Reveals Functional LncRNA in OPC Fate Determination (RNA-Seq of mouse neural stem cells)

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To better understand the transcriptome of mouse neural stem cells (including known genes and novel long non coding RNA genes),  RNA-Seq was performed on the polyadenylated fraction of RNA isolated from cell samples. Read mapping and transcriptome construction were done by using optimized pipeline which integrate Tophat followed by Cufflinks.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles of mouse neural stem cells were generated by RNA-sequencing.

PLATFORM
GPL13112 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Mus musculus)
