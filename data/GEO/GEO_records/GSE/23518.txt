TITLE
Microarray Analysis Reveals Distinct Gene Expression Profiles Among Different Tumor Histology, Stage and Disease Outcomes in Endometrial Adenocarcinoma

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The goal of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) between early vs. late stage endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC) and uterine serous carcinoma (USC), as well as between disease outcomes in each of the two histological subtypes.

DESIGN
Gene expression profiles of 20 cancer samples were analyzed (EAC =10, USC =10) using the human genome wide illumina bead microarrays carrying 48,000 genes.

PLATFORM
GPL6947 Illumina HumanHT-12 V3.0 expression beadchip
