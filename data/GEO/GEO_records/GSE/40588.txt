TITLE
Gene expression profiling of tumor-adjacent histologically normal lung tissues from lung SCC patients

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Tumor-adjacent noncancerous tissues often exhibited abnormalities on molecular levels, which is described as field effect of cancerization. Accumulated evidence demonstrated that filed effect may also play important role in cancer progression. In the present study, we found that the gene expression profile in noncancerous lung tissues adjacent to lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was significantly associated with regional lymph node status of patients. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) showed that 121 genes were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (delta=0.75, FDR=0.069). Interestingly, all of the significant genes were up-regulated in the lymph node positive samples. For these genes, the most significant biological GO terms were extracellular structure organization, cell adhesion, regulation of cell motion/migration, and vessel development, etc, which were also involved in EMT process supported by another experiment in vitro.

DESIGN
Tumor-adjacent histologically normal lung tissues were collected from 60 primary lung SCC patients, of whom 34 (56.7%) suffered regional lymph node metastasis. Gene expression profiling analysis of these samples was performed using Agilent 4x44K human whole genome gene expression microarray (G4112F).
