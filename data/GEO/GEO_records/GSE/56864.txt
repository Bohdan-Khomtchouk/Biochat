TITLE
Effect of Methyl jasmonate of the Poplar root transcriptome

ORGANISM
Populus tremula x Populus alba

SUMMARY
Illumina HiSeq technology was used to generate mRNA profiles from Populus tremula x alba INRA 717-1B4 roots treated with Methyl jasmonate. Samples were harvested after two weeks either from untreated control roots or from Methyl jasmonate treated roots. Paired-end (2X100bp) reads were generated and aligned to the Populus trichocarpa ( http://www.phytozome.net/poplar.php ) using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.

DESIGN
mRNA profiles from Populus tremula x alba INRA 717-1B4 roots treated with Methyl jasmonate as well as from control roots were generated by paired-end (2X100bp) Illumina HiSeq sequencing. Four samples were sequenced per lane, two biological replicates per treatment.
