TITLE
Identification of novel long non-coding RNAs in prostate cancers

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Long non-coding RNAs show highly tissue and disease specific expression profiles. We analyzed prostate cancer and normal adjacent prostate samples to identify cancer-specific transcripts and found 334 candidates, of which 15 were validated by RT-PCR.

DESIGN
8 Prostate cancer samples from radical prostatectomies, 12 samples from normal adjacent prostate, 12 samples from lymph node metastasis and 10 samples from transurethral resection of the prostrate were included in this study. These samples contained more than 70% cancer and less than 30% stromal tissue.
