TITLE
mRNA sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana pdx3 mutants

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Arabidopsis mutants in the PMP/PNP oxidase PDX3 show abberant growth and development.RNA sequencing reveals strong induction of stress-related genes in pdx3, particularly those associated with biotic stress.

DESIGN
Whole rosettes (21- days old) of three biological replicates of wild-type and pdx3-3 (SALK_054167C) and pdx3-4 (GK-260E03) mutants, all ecotype Col-0, were sequenced and a differential gene expression analysis was performed.

PLATFORM
GPL13222 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Arabidopsis thaliana)
