TITLE
Comparative study of interruption of TLR and NF-kB signaling pathways in lung epithelial cell by Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains [NFkB]

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
comparing different lineages of M.tb strains (lineages 3 and 4) in interrupting of epithelial signalling pathways in A549 cell line, from TLRs and NFkB signalling pathways to specific cytokine secretion

DESIGN
qPCR gene expression profiling.  Alveolar epithelial cell infected separately  by two M.tb strains . Equal amount total RNA from each infected cell was pooled prior to gene expression analysis.
