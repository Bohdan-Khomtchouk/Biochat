TITLE
Expression data from WT and E2A-deficient murine DN2 cells

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The E2A transcription factors promote the development of thymus-seeding cells but it remains unknown whether these proteins play a role in T lymphocyte lineage specification or commitment. By examining E2A-dependent genes in developing T cells, we will address whether these proteins are involved in these processes.

DESIGN
DN2 cells from WT and E2A-deficient murine fetal thymi were FACS sorted. Subsequently RNA was extracted, labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. The goal of this study is to investigate E2A-dependent genes in developing T cells
