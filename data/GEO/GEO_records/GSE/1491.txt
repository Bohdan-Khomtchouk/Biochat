TITLE
Identification of Inhibitors of Auxin Transcriptional Activation via Chemical Genetics in Arabidopsis

ORGANISM
Arabidopsis thaliana

SUMMARY
Approximately 2.5 mg dry Col-0 seedlings were surface sterilized and stratified for 2 days at 4degreesC in liquid media containing 1.5% sucrose (w/v) before being transferred to light with constant shaking at 100 rpm on an orbital shaker. After 7 days, the seedling clusters were subjected to the treatments for 1 hr followed by total RNA isolation using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion). Each treatment was performed in triplicate or quadruplicate. All labeling (Enzo) and hybridization (Affymetrix) procedures were performed as directed by the manufacturers.  Raw probe intensities output by the Affymetrix MAS software were processed using the RMA algorithm to obtain an expression measure for each gene on each array. Keywords: repeat sample
