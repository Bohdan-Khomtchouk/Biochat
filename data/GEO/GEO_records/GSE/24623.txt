TITLE
Adult_mouse_testis_CREM_ChIP_chip

ORGANISM

SUMMARY
Germ cells from adult mouse testes were isolated and ChIPed by CREM antibody. The purpose is to identify potential CREM targets during spermatogenesis.

DESIGN
The CREM antibody ChIPed DNA segments were labeled with Cy5 and goat IgG ChIPed segments were labeled with Cy3 as control. No duplicates were designed.
