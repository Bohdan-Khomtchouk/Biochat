TITLE
RNA-seq of zebrafish melanoma cells after metastatic dissemination

ORGANISM
Danio rerio

SUMMARY
We report how the zebrafish melanoma cell line ZMEL1 changes after intravascular injection into 2dpf zebrafish embryos, as compared to the cells growing in vitro.

DESIGN
Examination of ZMEL1 cells in vitro versus ~21 days in vivo in the zebrafish
