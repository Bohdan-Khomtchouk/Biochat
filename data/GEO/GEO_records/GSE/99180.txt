TITLE
CD133hi, Notchhi, DP (double positive) and DN (double negative) in GBML8 and GBML20, both patient-derived glioblastoma tumorsphere cultures

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
CD133hi, Notchhi, DP and DN cells were FACS-isolated from GBML8 and GBML20 cultures and analyzed with RNA-seq, in order to find cell type-specific gene signatures.

DESIGN
CD133hi, Notchhi, DP and DN cells were FACS-isolated and subjected to RNA isolation and RNA-seq. The experiment represents averaged data of 2 independent FACS isolations from GBML8 and 1 isolation from GBML20.

PLATFORM
GPL11154 Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens)
