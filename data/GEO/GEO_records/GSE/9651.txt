TITLE
Parkin as a Tumor Suppressor Gene for Hepatocellular Carcinoma

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
To provide an insight into the molecular mechanism by which parkin deficiency contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis, we analyzed gene expression profiles of nontumorous and tumorous liver tissues from parkin–/– mice using cDNA microarray analyses. Keywords: genetic alteration

DESIGN
We analysed the up and down regulated genes in tumorous and non-tumorous liver tissues of parkin-/- mice compared with normal liver tissues of wild-type mice.
