TITLE
Comparison of DNA methylomes of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) generated in co-culture with ovarian carcinoma cell line (OVCAR8) during 6 days

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The methylation profiles of bisulfite-modified DNA of human CD14+ monocytes-derived immature dendritic cells (GM-CSF/IL-4) were compared with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (GM-CSF/IL-4 in co-culture with ovarian carcinoma cell line (OVCAR8)) using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). This platform allows the interrogation of > 485,000 methylation sites per sample at single-nucleotide resolution, and comprises an average of 17 CpG sites per gene in the 99% of RefSeq genes. 96% of CpG islands are covered, with additional coverage in CpG island shores and the regions flanking them. The samples were hybridized in the array following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

DESIGN
Total DNA isolated by standard procedures from three sets of samples of derived immature dendritic cells (DCs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).

PLATFORM
