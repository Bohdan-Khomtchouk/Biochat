TITLE
Expression data from human iPS cells and fibroblasts

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
DNA methylation is often inversely correlated with gene expression. We used expression microarrays to determine the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression in 6 iPS cell lines and the fibroblasts from which they were derived.

DESIGN
We isolated RNA from iPS cells and fibroblasts for which we have genome-wide DNA methylation data and hybridized to Affymetrix gene expression microarrays.
