TITLE
Polarized T84 Cells Response to H. pylori infection

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
All arrays use the same reference, which is cDNA generated from RNA harvested from uninfected polarized T84 monolayers.  Infections were done on two seperate days.  Numbers following the name of each array designate the time point post H. pylori infection.  Data for time course one is named such that only this timepoint is listed, while data for time course two (wildtype and mock) is named such that the time point is followed by the designation " -2 " . An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract. Keywords: all_pairs
