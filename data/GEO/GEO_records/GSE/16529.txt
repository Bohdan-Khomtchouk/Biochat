TITLE
Interleukin-10 is a negative regulatory factor of CAWS-vasculitis in CBA/J mice

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
The gene expression difference between CBA/J and DBA/2 mice after the injection of CAWS (Candida albicans water-soluble fraction) was compared using an oligo-DNA microarray.

DESIGN
CAWS was injected into CBA/J and DBA/2 mice. 21 days after the injection, RNA was extracted from the splenocytes and measured using the mouse oligo-DNA 10K micoarray.
