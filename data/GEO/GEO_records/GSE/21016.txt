TITLE
Genome-wide analysis of gene expression profiles in ITNK

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Analysis of gene expression profiles in Induced T-to-Natural Killer (ITNK), compared to DN3 parental T cells and IL-2-expanded NK cells (LAK). The hypothesis tested in the present study was that gene expression profiles of ITNK that were derived from DN3 T cells after deletion of Bcl11b were more similar to LAK, rather than DN3 T cells. Results provide important information of the ITNKs, such as canditate genes regulated by Bcl11b, up-regulated important genes expressed in NK cells, and down-regulated T cell genes.

DESIGN
Total RNA obtained from DN3-derived ITNKs in vitro compared to DN3 parental T cells and LAKs.
