TITLE
Detection of copy number variation in patients with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) - NimbleGen

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
The objective of the study was to investigate the extent of duplicated, triplicated, and quadruplicated regions in PMD patients so that junction analysis could be performed.

DESIGN
10 samples were analyzed. Replicates are not included. The arrays were performed as a service by NimbleGen. Reference DNA was normal male NM002 from our lab.

PLATFORM
GPL19517 NimbleGen 2006-09-22_HG18_CHRX_FT Fine tiling design for chrX from human genome (hg18; NCBI Build 36)
