TITLE
Effects of Aging and Anatomic Location on Gene Expression in Human Retina

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Objective: To determine the effects of age and topographic location on gene expression in human neural retina. Methods: Macular and peripheral neural retina RNA were isolated from human donor eyes for DNA microarray and quantitative RTPCR analyses. Results: Total RNA from human donor retina preserved integrity. Hierarchic clustering analysis demonstrates the gene expression profiles of young, old, macula and peripheral retina cluster into four distinct groups. Genes which are highly expressed in macular, peripheral, young or old retina are identified, including inhibitors of Wnt Signaling Pathway  (DKK1, FZD10 and SFRP2) shown preferably expressed in the periphery. Conclusions: The transcriptome of the human retina is affected by age and topographic location. Wnt pathway inhibitors in the periphery may maintain peripheral retinal cells in an undifferentiated state. Understanding the effects of age and topographic location on gene expression may lead to the development of new therapeutic interventions for age-related eye diseases.

DESIGN
Twleve youang and older retinal macular or prepheral RNA samples are used for DNA microarray study to compare the effects of aging and anatomic location on gene expression in human retina.
