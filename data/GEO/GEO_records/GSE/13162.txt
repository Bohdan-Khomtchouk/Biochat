TITLE
Expression data from postmortem human brain samples with and without FTLD-U

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
FTLD-U is the most common pathological correlate of the neurodegenerative dementia frontotemporal dementia We used microarrays to perform global expression profiling of FTLD-U brain samples Keywords: disease

DESIGN
Postmortem brain samples were isolated from normal controls, FTLD-U patients with progranulin gene mutations (progranulin) and FTLD-U patients without progranulin gene mutations (sporadic).  Regional dissections were carried out from frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum.
