TITLE
A Validated Gene Signature from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated with Sickle Cell Disease

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) associated with increased mortality. Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have been studied in pulmonary arterial hypertension and in SCD. We hypothesized that a PBMC-derived gene signature in SCD patients may be utilized as a PH biomarker. Twenty-seven patients with homozygous SCD underwent transthoracic echocardiography and PBMC isolation. PH was defined as estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) > 30 mmHg with a peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) > 2.5m/s. Genome-wide gene expression profiles were correlated against PH severity using RVSP and TRV as surrogates, which yielded 631 potentially dysregulated transcripts.

DESIGN
Total RNA was isolated from PBMCs using standard molecular biology protocols without DNA contamination or RNA degradation. Sample processing (e.g., cDNA generation, fragmentation, end labeling, hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays) was performed per manufacturerâ€™s instructions. A total of 27 African descent American patients with sickle cell disease were included in the microarray analysis.
