TITLE
Tomato root culture and Al treatment

ORGANISM
Solanum lycopersicum

SUMMARY
cDNA microarrays (Tom 1) were used to analyze changes in transcript accumulation in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv Money Maker) root cultures under Al-stress (20uM AlK(SO4)2). Out of the 1,362 genes that had significant changes in transcript accumulation (FDR < 0.05), 569 were reduced and 793 were induced. The down-regulated genes included those found in the cell cycle (p34cdc2 protein kinase, cyclin, histone), putriscine synthesis, ABC transporter, germin-like protein. Al-induced genes included glutamate synthase, pectin modification, histidine synthesis, proline synthesis, metallothionein-like protein, multidrug efflux proteins (MATE), ethylene biosynthesis and detoxification proteins. Different isoforms in the multiple gene families of V-ATPase, glutathione transferases and others were either induced or repressed.  A wide array of genes for regulating transcription and translation activities, and signal transduction were also affected.
