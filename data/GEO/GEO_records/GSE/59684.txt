TITLE
microRNA expression profiling during Adipocytic differentiation of human MSCs (hMSC-TERT)

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have employed whole microRNA microarray to identify changes in microRNA expression in human bone marrow MSCs (hMSC-TERT) during adipocytic differentiation in culture on day 7 and day 13

DESIGN
Human MSC line (hMSC-TERT) were subjectd to adipocytic differentiation for 7 days or 13 days, subsequently, RNA was extracted. The samples were labeled using the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Hi-Power Labeling Kit, Hy3™/Hy5™ and hybridized on the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array (6'th GEN). Array product number 208400; Array version 6'th GEN, Array batch number 34014, miRBase version 17. The 'Legends_rawdata.pdf' contains the column headers (of raw data files) and their detailed description.

PLATFORM
GPL17382 miRCURY LNA microRNA Array, 6th generation - hsa, mmu & rno [miRBase 17.0]
