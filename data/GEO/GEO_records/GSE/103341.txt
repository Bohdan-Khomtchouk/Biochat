TITLE
RNAseq of FACS Drd1 and Drd2 receptor expressing medium spiny neurons (direct and indirect medium spiny neurons) from 5-6 month BACHD Huntington's disease model mice, compared to WT littermates

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
mRNAseq for baseline transcriptional profiling of D1 and D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons from 5-6 month BACHD mice, compared to respective WT littermates. BACHD iSPN and dSPN RNAseq data has been described in " Impaired TrkB receptor signaling underlies corticostriatal dysfunction in Huntington's disease " ; Plotkin et al; 2014; PMID accession number 24991961.

DESIGN
Hemizygous BACHD (FVB) × Drd2 -EGFP BAC (FVB) and BACHD (FVB) × Drd1-EGFP BAC (FVB) mice were generated. Both D2BAC-EGFP (FVB) and D1BAC-EGFP (FVB) were obtained from Gensat/MMRRC. HD model BACHD (FVB) mice, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-mediated transgenic mouse model expressing full length -mHtt with 97 glutamine repeats under the control of endogenous Htt regulatory machinery on the BAC (Grey et al, 2008 PMID: 18550760) were obtained from CHDI Foundation (CHDI-81001010). Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for GFP was used to isolate BACHD and WT  - indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (iMSNs) and direct pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs) from the D2BAC-EGFP or D1BAC-EGFP x HD model crosses, respectively. Cells were pooled from four animals (150,000 cells/animal) to create iSPN and dSPN pools for sequencing. RNA was extracted, and sequencing was performed by Expression Analysis on an Illumina Hi-seq 2000. Paired-end sequencing was performed, 4-plexed across lanes for a total of around 38 million 50mer paired reads per sample.
