TITLE
Therapeutic targets of a new treatment for osteoarthritis composed by curcuminoids extract, hydrolyzed collagen and green tea extract

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
We have previously demonstrated that a mixture of curcuminoids extract, hydrolyzed collagen and green tea extract (COT) inhibited inflammatory and catabolic mediator’s synthesis by osteoarthritic (OA) human chondrocytes. The objectives of this study were to identify new targets of COT using genomic approaches. We compared gene expression profiles of chondrocytes treated with COT and/or with interleukin(IL)-1β. The proteins coded by the most important COT sensitive genes were then quantified by specific immunoassays.

DESIGN
Cartilage specimens were obtained from 12 patients (10 women and 2 men; mean age 67 years old, range 54-76 years old) with knee OA. Primary human chondrocytes were cultured in monolayer until confluence and then incubated for 24 hours in the absence or in the presence of human IL-1β (10e-11M) and with or without COT, each compound at the concentration of 4 µg/ml. Microarray gene expression profiling between control, COT, IL-1β and COT IL-1β conditions was performed.
