TITLE
Expression data of genome-length HCV RNA-replicating OL8(3.5Y) cells and OL8(3.5Y)-derived ribavirin-resistant cells

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Ribavirin (RBV) is a potential partner of interferon-based therapy and recently approved therapy using direct acting antivirals for patients with chronic hepatitis C, However, the precise mechanisms undelying RBV action against hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication are not yet understood. To clarify this point, we established RBV-resistant cell lines from RBV-sensitive HCV RNA-replicating cell line, OL8(3.5Y), and characterized their features. We used  microarrays to compare the gene expression pattern between OL8(3.5Y) cells and three RBV-resistant cells and identified genes commonly altered by more than four-fold among RBV-resistant cells compared with the OL8(3.5Y) cells.

DESIGN
Growing cells  from RBV-sensitive OL8(3.5Y) and three RBV-resistant cell lines were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
