TITLE
Analysis of transgenerational effects on DNA copy number aberrations in male mice exposed to continuous 20mGy/day gamma-rays for 400 days (Secondary screening for 0GyN familly).

ORGANISM
Mus musculus

SUMMARY
Transgenerational effects of continuous low dose-rate (LDR) gamma-ray irradiation have not been well studied. C57BL/6JNrs male mice were maintained in non-irradiated room for 400 days from 8 weeks of age. This study  investigated the De novo mutation by comparing the parents and children. This is secondary screening. This study was performed under contract with the Aomori Prefectural Government, Japan.

DESIGN
Two-condition experiment, C57 BL/6JNrs tail tissue non-irradiated male (0GyNM), female (0GyNF) and their progenies (0GyN1 to 0GyN6) vs. reference male mouse.

PLATFORM
GPL22189 Agilent-035451 0GyN 8x60k CGH array [Feature Number version]
