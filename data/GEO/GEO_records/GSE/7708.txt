TITLE
Suppression of androgen receptor mediated gene expression by a sequence-specific DNA binding polyamide

ORGANISM
Homo sapiens

SUMMARY
Androgen Receptor (AR) is essential for the growth and progression of prostate cancer in both hormone-sensitive and hormone-refractory disease.  We have designed a sequence-specific DNA binding polyamide (1) that targets the consensus androgen response element (ARE).  This polyamide binds the PSA promoter ARE, inhibits androgen-induced expression of PSA and several other AR-regulated genes in cultured prostate cancer cells, and reduces AR occupancy at the PSA promoter and enhancer.  Down-regulation of PSA by this polyamide was comparable to that produced by the synthetic anti-androgen bicalutamide (Casodex) at the same concentration.  Genome-wide expression analysis reveals that a similar number of transcripts are affected by treatment with the polyamide and with bicalutamide.  Direct inhibition of AR-DNA binding by sequence-specific DNA binding small molecules could offer an alternative approach to antagonizing AR activity.  A polyamide (2) that targets a different DNA sequence is included as a control. Keywords: Gene expression changes in cultured LNCaP cells after DHT-stimulation and various treatment conditions
